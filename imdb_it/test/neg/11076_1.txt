Horror movies are a curious thing, sometimes they manage to come across a formula that works very well, sometimes they bravely try to tell a worthy story despite the problems of time and budget, sometimes they are so bad that they are actually a bit funny ... and sometimes they are "The Cavern". <br /> <br /> A good horror / suspense movie should contain whims that make you guess, they should allow you to be interested in the characters and their motivations in order to actually have some sort of reaction when they die. However, The Cavern chooses instead to introduce elements that work initially, only to be canceled out by its weak narration. <br /> <br /> All the characters are completely forgettable and any real story that could make them even remotely interesting is unbuttoned in a 30-second monologue, making it impossible to do anything more than laugh while the characters are extracted almost casually and in more than one occasion in the least scary way possible. <br /> <br /> (To ruin a scene a bit, a victim is caught during a complete blackout that may have been a bit scary if the sound effect used to indicate his killing did not remind him to mix a pot of thick macaroni and cheese Add to this formula the camera that works makes me think that the director has seen too many videos of Nine Inch Nails and an ending that in an attempt to be shocking serves almost nothing, but to annoy and to confuse the viewer and have a horror almost completely unwatchable film that fails at every level. <br /> <br /> I'll be honest with you, if you want a speleochemically claustrophobic horror movie go see "The Descent", and I feel strange to say it because I didn't particularly enjoy that movie too.
