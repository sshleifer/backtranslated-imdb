Needful Things was one of my favorite books by Stephen King. But this film is one of the worst books to adapt to the movies I've ever seen, they changed so many things that made me sick. Even the concept of the book is deception, things not always what appear as a reminder in the book were not shown in the film. Althogh was as fun as many Stephen King films, but like many Stephen King movies this didn't follow the book and became a piece of Hollywood trash. 2/10
