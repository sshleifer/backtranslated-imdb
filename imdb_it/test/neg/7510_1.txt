I work in the video store that rents this video in Lexington and I have to say ... it shouldn't have been done. I even know some of the people who worked there who regret having done it. Negative effects, horrible acting, bad screenplay in particular. I swear that the dialog box would not have passed for the original PSX Resident Evil; it's so bad If you want to know how not to make a movie, watch this movie to learn a thing or two. If not, don't waste time. And the director also knows that it sucks because it keeps coming to try to ruin the film. No sir. I saw two-thirds of the horror section and this percentage is even lower than that of Outer Space's Plan 9. Even Ed Eood would have said "No, it's too stupid for me too".
