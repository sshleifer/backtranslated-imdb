I just saw it at an independent local station in the New York City area. The cast showed promises but when I saw the director, George Cosmotos, I became suspicious. And sure enough, it was just as ugly, just as useless and stupid as any George Cosmotos movie I've ever seen. He is like Michael Bey of a stupid man - with all the horrible promise he enjoys. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy does not make sense, no burning problem urging the conspirators. We are left to ourselves to connect the dots from a piece of graffiti on various walls of the film to the next one. Thus, the current budget crisis, the war in Iraq, Islamic extremism, the fate of social security, 47 million Americans without health care, stagnant wages and the death of the middle class are all subsumed by the pure terror of graffiti. /> <br /> A truly amazing film.
