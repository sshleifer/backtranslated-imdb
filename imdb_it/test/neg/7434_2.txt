This * should * have been an incredibly fun movie ... but it fell to the surface. (In fact, I stopped looking at him halfway, which I rarely do ...) - Bill Murray plays Jack Corcoran, a second-level motivational speaker who is bequeathed to an elephant by his father (whom he assumed to be dead before he was born); then he has a week to get ponderous pachyderm all over the country. His adventures on the road are only slightly fun, at best. Janeane Garofalo's remarkable comedic talents are largely unused. Anita Gillette is impressive in her small role as the mother of Jack (who has many explanations to make), and Pat Hingle stands out as a former circus partner of Jack's father. - Maybe the second part of the film was better than the first, but I find it hard to believe ...
