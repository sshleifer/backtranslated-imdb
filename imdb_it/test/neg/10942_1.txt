Shakalaka Boom Boom is a rip off of the film Amadeus. Personally I consider Amadeus one of my favorites not only because it is about music, which is my favorite subject, but also because it tells the true story of a musical genius who is not only remembered for the voluminous works of the beautiful music he produced during the his life, but for his self-destructive nature and his tragic death at a young age of 35, being practically not celebrated during his life because of the politics interpreted by some people, in particular by Saliere, the Italian composer, who was jealous of him. <br /> <br /> Personally, I was shocked to see Shakalaka .., as the director invariably cut most of the scenes in the movie Amadeus. I see the worst kind of plagiarism in this film and I am skeptical about the kind of film that Bollywood continues to boil over day after day. The film is a disaster, the two musicians of the film do not give you any feeling of being realistic, the film is insignificant, insignificant and completely failed on all fronts. The only person who has an impact is Bobby Deol, who at least knows how to act. Otherwise, the whole cast looks like a bunch of amateurs. <br /> <br /> The irony is that while watching the film, the first screen of the film says that all the characters in this film are fictitious and that any resemblance to someone is purely coincidental which is a blatant lie, because all of them the similarities are very clear and are very much understood. I wish I could take Darshan and Co. to court not only for copyright infringement, but also to mutilate a beautiful work of art.
