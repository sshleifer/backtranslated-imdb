I rented this film hoping it could provide good entertainment and some fantastic knowledge or poker stories. What I got was a kind of documentary in an average life of guys that really happened to cards. Do I want to see the love story with your wife? NO I want to see everything that happened in this boy's life except poker? NO. Well, that's what you get with this movie. The acting is good for such a low piece of shit. The film never tries to break the mold or do something original. Simply, sleep goes through the script. The finish is disappointing and never looks deep into Ungar's mind. Instead it focuses on what was already obvious. He was an addict card player with an average life not unlike any other average Las Vegas joe. The film focuses on aspects of his life that were extraordinary in the United Nations rather than extraordinary. Poker scenes throughout the film add up to about 4 minutes of footage. Ungar's successes in winning the WSOP 3 times seem like life after life. A 10-year-old child could do a better job directing this film .. or maybe it was the script a piece of shit from the beginning that condemned this joke of a movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a film movie on a Rounders game clock. At least it has style.
