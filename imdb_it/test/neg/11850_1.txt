The worst film ever, with characters from Carnosaur 1-3 inserted simply to fall into the same death they had in the first film, so that the footage and special effects could be reused. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this debacle. <br /> <br /> Corman is ruining his legacy. He produced and produced some extraordinary films, but that era ended with Carnosaur as his last film "creative in its wickedness".
