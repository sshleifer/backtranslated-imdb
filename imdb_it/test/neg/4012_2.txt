Altman is very proud of the fact that people in his films talk to each other, because, he says, people do it in life. Well, people also cough, burp, get out of bribes, etc. The point is that just because people actually do something doesn't make cinema irresistible. This is a problem. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is that this is not a very intelligent satire, direct or guilty or relevant, in 1988 or 2004. Garry Trudeau still lives in the 60s and thinks everyone except a small core of Republican elected representatives is a 1960s style hippy liberal. I mean the boy still runs Zonker in his strip - a character that is a complete anachronism, but Trudeau still uses it as if he were representative of a large band of young Americans. <br /> <br /> I don't understand, I'm wrong. I'm a conservative, but I'm not saying this is bad because it has a liberal orientation. It could take a liberal turn and be fun and relevant, but it isn't. It's mainly a piece of vanity with a group of eminent celebrities (including the hateful and repulsive Ron Reagan, Jr.). Sometimes he feels without a script, and for the rest of the time he has a lean air of self-importance and "aren't we so smart?" - ness. <br /> <br /> Someone said that this show insists that it has a cult following. I think his cult status is more desirable than real. I'm sure there are two or three people out there who recorded all the original 1988 episodes and still have them, but if that's the standard, then every show on the air is a cult classic to some degree. If Tanner didn't have the names of Altman and Trudeau, it would have been another forgotten HBO production of the 1980s. Instead, it is presented as an incisive and harsh political comment by boys who are at the top of their game. The reality, however, is as far away as possible from this. Pat Paulsen's presidential satire is more relevant than Tanner has ever been, and he's been dead for a decade.
