I was very impressed by this eight or nine year old film. The gangsters seemed very real and threatening to me, and I could see why people would be afraid of someone like Dillinger. Seeing him as an adult, he seemed almost comical, due to the exaggerated narrative and shocking details like the thirties gangsters who drove cars that looked like fifties. There is a certain gritty and inelegant reality in the way criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and unintentionally funny piece that accompanies me is the scene where Ma Barker and his sons are filming with the FBI and their children are killed. The narrator says something like "Maybe at that moment, for the only time in his life, Ma Barker became a real mother". This is thought to be a time of great tragedy and pathos, since finally Ma realizes how he destroyed his family from his own greed, but instead causes laughter. A very strange film that is rarely shown anywhere these days. Gangster movie fans could have fun, but more like a curiosity than a real movie.
