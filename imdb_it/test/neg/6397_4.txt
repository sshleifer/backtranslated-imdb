All in all, don't expect much and you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And if you want to see a movie that will take you back in 1983, you'll definitely do it. The only reason I gave this film 2 points more than it deserves is for 2 reasons: <br /> <br /> # 1. Michael Caine <br /> <br /> # 2. la people, the landscapes, the culture and the music of Brazil <br /> <br /> The film is almost completely brought by Caine while he commits the seemingly impossible task of turning it into a feasible and half-conceivable story. Even Joe Bologna and Valerie Harper are not up to it. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is pure class, as always. In addition to being a talented classical and comedic actor, Caine brings a mixture of introspection, malice and sensitivity to every film he makes ... the fulcrum of his charm since his role in Alfie ... and the reason why he won the Academy Award for Hannah and her sisters 2 years later. In this farce, he is tenderly seductive ... funny and vulnerable ... melancholic and sentimental .... and also the jewel that is Rio de Janeiro, the ONLY reason for not looking for a better form of entertainment. <Br /> <br /> Well ... maybe a look at the 2 adorable young actresses, Michelle Johnson and Demi Moore would be a reason. But the appearance is all you can do to Michelle (even if her appearance seems dated) ... there could be no more painful experience than the movie than seeing her "try" to act (even most of her dialogue seems overdubbed). The acting and the looks of Demi hold up 100 times better and you can easily transplant it, as it is, into any film of today (it doesn't seem very different from being honest). Ms. Moore is certainly underutilized, especially considering that she was the biggest star of the 2. <br /> <br /> Save the fact that this is a silly farce, in the end, actually I like the maturity with which everyone these people handle this scandalous situation ... that does not end friendships or marriages and that a relationship, even with the minor daughter of your best friend, could be forgiven and everyone can go on. The injured parties show anger and disappointment at what has emerged, but everything works for the best .... a bit unrealistic for sure, but surprisingly refreshing. Hope is always
