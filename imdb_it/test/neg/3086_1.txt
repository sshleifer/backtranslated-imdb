One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Yes, I know I'm not the target audience. The reference public are the females, whether university or middle age or any age I imagine. I'm not one of these, so the producers don't care if I don't like it. But this will not excuse the fact that the dialogue and the plot are horrible. The main character, Phoebe, sets off on a trip to Europe to find out what happened to her sister, Faith, who committed suicide. Phoebe is an idiotic character that I hope no one identifies with. Faith is also a character with little credibility. Wolf is the only person who seems to be quite reasonable. As I said the dialogue is boring and uninteresting. The plot does things completely stupid at times. The absolute worst is that Phoebe and Faith's father is an artist but his paintings are completely terrifying. There is nothing new, interesting or refreshing in this film. If you are a boy, you will pray for the ending. If you are a chick you may be able to sit down, but you will not be impressed.
