There is nothing new in this film. Nothing you haven't thought of before, nothing you've never heard before. The story of a gay man brutally murdered in a small town and people's reaction can be tackled in many ways, and this film has chosen the most demagogic and muddy one. One of the biggest flaws of this film is that it is neither a film nor a documentary. The director used the transcripts of the original interviews and made sure that the actors played like a movie. The result is strange And finally, I read in the previous comments that people who don't like this film are anti-gay. I'm pretty sure these comments come from people who consider themselves tolerant but don't tolerate that other people don't like this movie. This is a fun world.
