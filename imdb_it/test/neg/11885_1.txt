Terribly stupid film and deception dealing with corruption at the Louisiana Purchase Lumber Company. <br /> <br /> Everyone in the state of Louisiana seems corrupt and inept. A member of the college's English Department can only sign his name with an X. <br /> <br /> When it seems that a well-formed senator (Victor Moore) comes to the state to investigate, everyone tries to blame the innocent but silly character of Bob Hope. It is surprising if Vera Zorina did not get the part of Maria in 1943 "For whom does the bell ring?" <br /> <br /> Of course, the corrupt officials together with Hope try to show the photos of Zorina with Moore in order to ruin it politically. Moore marries the head of the restaurant who insulted when he asked for a ham sandwich. He thought the reason he was angry was because it was a kosher restaurant. This is the scope of humor is this absolute disorder of a film. <br /> <br /> When Hope tries to defend herself in Congress, James Stewart takes off in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington". At that point the film is too far away for a good answer. <br /> <br /> Music and lyrics are both absolutely terrible. That song that praises Louisiana, sung in various ways, is absolutely terrible. Does Irving Berlin have anything to do with the music of this absolutely terrible movie?
