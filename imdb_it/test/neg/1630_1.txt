I saw this late, late, late, late show when MST3K was just a twinkle in Joel Hodgson's eyes. I had the privilege of seeing him without knowing exactly how bad he would be. I didn't know that a woman with an arrow in her chest could run "to the end of the earth" in about an hour and a half (thank God, her father gave such specific instructions) and then spend days returning to the castle with the help. I didn't know that a sword that wielded a barbarian type could run into the forest and create a hand grenade and powder bombs in less than 30 seconds. I had no idea how much a movie could be disconnected. <br /> <br /> It's a bad thing, it's a very bad thing. If you like bad movies, try it.
