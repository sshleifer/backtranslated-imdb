I rented this DVD because I'm a big fan of science fiction, but this thing (I won't call it a movie because it was shot very quickly on video) seemed to have come up with it as they went along. I'm still not sure what it was. There are these guys dressed in strange S & M clothes, and I imagine they are from another planet, however, it doesn't make much sense in this low, low, low film. If it was their first film, I'd cut them off a little, but I think it's like their fifth movie and it's really REALLY bad. <br /> <br /> Very bad acting, not a good actor is this movie. This director must have been out of his mind to even work on a horrible film like this. Don't waste your time or money on this DVD, please people don't. Not even the .99 cent I paid to rent the DVD is worth it. In fact, I'm going to tell them that the DVD was messed up to get my money back. I don't believe in giving a bad review, but I have to do it here. My advice to anyone involved in this sinking ship - please find another profession to enter. How could you make a rotten movie like this? I would give negative stars if possible, it's terrible.
