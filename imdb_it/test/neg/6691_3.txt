Stars: Hayden Pantierre. <br /> <br /> There have been so many movies that have exactly the same storyline, and this is just a bad suction of it. The white populer girl moves to ethnic school, does not adapt, soon becomes accepted. Originality is non-existent in this, and neither is laughter. Use so many old jokes badly executed is annoying. I don't know why they think it's a good idea to make videos for sequels of mediocre films, but it's not. Having said that, the positive aspects in this are that all the people in it are quite competent actors and actresses. <br /> <br /> My rating: * on ****. PG-13 for language and sexual humor.
