Teenage Exorcist is one of those terrible video films that make the viewer lose any decent entertainment expectations for sexual antics, teenage humor and empty writing. This film offers exactly what he was trying to offer. It's about a girl who moves into a house where once lived a Sade baron (hmmm) and who was eventually attracted to him through his inner demon. His sister and brother-in-law, along with an Irish priest, her boyfriend and a pizza delivery man, try to save her and exorcise her demon. Well, not much here in horror or suspense. In fact, one line of the film summarizes very well what to expect. Mike (the girl's brother-in-law) tied her up (the name is Diane, by the way, and is played by Brinke Stevens) after trying to make a chainsaw for his sister. He removes a gag from his mouth and says something like "This won't be the last gag we see tonight." Indeed, it was not. The special effects are poor and poorly modeled, and the film makes use of this by playing on its comic charm. Some lines and situations are fun. Robert Quarry, the old Count Yorga himself, really steals his scenes like an Irish priest. He surrenders complaining about Bible verses and singing Irish songs. You know you're in trouble, however, when Eddie Deezen gets top billing. Deezen does his schtick and also has a couple of good moments, but the material is too worn out that being nothing but a sophomoric time filler. Even Michael Berryman, of The Hills Have Eyes, has a short but interesting cameo in the film. As for the other actors, well, they're all pretty good at being pretty mediocre. Stevens is adorable with fishnet stockings and French cut panties, but beyond that they don't expect much from her. His sister is played by Elena Sahagun, and shows a little more of Brinke (a very pretty girl by the way) and actions out of Brinke by miles. Her husband, played by Jay Richardson, shows his ability to act and be fun amidst mediocrity. Again, it's not a bad movie to waste some time that doesn't require thinking. If you're a fan of Robert Quarry, watch it at least for his performance.
