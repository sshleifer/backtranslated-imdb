Probably this film would have been good, if they hadn't used CGI (computer-generated images) for the werewolf scenes. It made fake creatures look like werewolves and they looked like comics. CGI is great for certain effects like Jurassic Park or Twister dinasours. But when we see a movie where the creature must look completely real, CGI is not the way to go. Have a look at An American Werewolf in London. Not CGI. Make-up is a mechanical creature and what came to your mind was more realistic than what was shown in the sequel. This film offered some gags that were fun to watch and the humor in this movie seemed to have attracted me, but it's nothing but a movie that I thought was OK. And it's not good enough. In my opinion, an American werewolf in Paris does not stand up to the original.
