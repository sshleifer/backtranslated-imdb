I'm a big fan of Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, but this movie is not good. The reviewer below is completely correct that the fantastic images of the Detroit station are the first and last memorable scene in the film. Really, I really wish I had left after, instead of continuing to give hope in the film. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I felt disappointed. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is almost completely a remake of the previous two - not necessarily a bad thing if you are a fan, but there is only one piece that seemed new to me. It was good enough, however, that I will probably check the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> But keep this in mind if you see this movie: if you realize at any moment that you are not having fun, go ahead and divide - you will not lose anything, because it will not get better. <br /> <br /> I will also make the executive summary here (be careful! spoiler!): a lot of shots from athletes that look good enough for a Nike ad, shots from smiling people, inexplicably frontal head shots of famous mannequins of wax of the people (WTF were thinking here?!?), some giggling children (cuuuuute), some "bitchin '" Photoshop effects, some images that are meant to suggest a comparison between water flows, information, money and people (I think) ... and then a bunch of quick, unrelated scenes of mass violence ... and then a bunch of space stock footage. <br /> <br /> I could do this in 10 seconds. Here is my pitch: <br /> <br /> 2 seconds of a happy dad with a shaved head and lycra cycling shorts playing with a child playing with a kitten playing with string; 5 seconds of that scene in "Rete" in which the boy speaks of making confusion with the "elemental forces of nature" and of how "money flows, money comes out"; 1 second of Reginald Denny with a brick, and then 3 seconds of Alan Bean hopping on the moon. <br /> <br /> That's it - it's 88 minutes and 50 seconds of your life that I've just saved. Obviously, I would get a copy of After Effects and apply a filter or two, so it wouldn't look as bizarre as it is. If Steven Soderbergh is reading this, hey, I won't even need much money for this project ... <br /> <br /> If you insist on watching a movie on "Life as War", I suggest "Bowling for Columbine" instead of . It may not have the pseudo-intellectual veneer so fashionable in the crowd of black sweaters, but at least it's fun.
