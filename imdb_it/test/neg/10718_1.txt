I would give a zero if they had that rating. The fun wasn't fun at all. I got tired of the film for about ten minutes, but in the end I thought that it had to improve, it's not like that. The others I saw in this film also agree. The acting was annoying. I'm tired of Jim Carey for the top of the ham acting. The supporting cast was no better. While this film was a declaration of corporate greed and the condition of the worker being trampled when a large company goes under, the vehicle for this would have been better served in another way. Actually I didn't like the main characters (Dick and Jane) so much that their antics were never funny but pathetic. I'm trying to remember a scene where I or anyone else was laughing and I can't. A film without value and a total waste of time.
