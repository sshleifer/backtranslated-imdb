To call this film a disaster will be a euphemism. I don't even know where to start! I have questions though, and many of them. I'd like to know who conceived this script? Who gave them the money to make this movie? Who was in charge of casting and costumes? Everyone should be mentioned! I saw this film in the catalog of my local library and thought "Hey there!" I had just seen the two FOG movies that Hollywood had produced and then I realized that Bollywood had a version. Unbeknownst to me, it would have been total and total disgust! <br /> <br /> Dhund - the fog, it's a film about four friends (actually just one of them but you should know that there are four friends), one of them is a beauty queen (played by the first Indian lady World, Aditi Govitrikar) and the director spares no expense to let you know this. The script also states that she (the name of the character is Simran) has eyes of Aishwarya Rai, lips of Kareena Kapoor and hair of Rani Mukherjee. Feel free to go out if you want, at least at this point you haven't seen the movie, unlike the poor me. : * (<br /> <br /> In any case, Simran receives a death threat one day from an uncle of the contestants, who tells her to abandon the competition so that her niece has a better chance of winning, but her boyfriend of Simran does not allow her to do this and therefore participates in the contest and wins, which causes the cocaine-sniffing uncle of her former classmate Tanya to follow her, but with the help of her cousin Kajal, Simran drowns the culprit and enlist both their boyfriends in the task of getting rid of the body. It is difficult but in the end they manage to do it. <br /> <br /> In a scene that borrows from the Hollywood movie Diabolique, the pool where the corpse is hidden is emptied only to reveal that the body is missing and this starts an enigma of Whodunit and Where-is-it? When the film is finished, the film manages to steal scenes from "I know what you did last summer, I still know, Scream 1, Scream 2, Scream 3, Murder wrote episodes and non m ention, Colu mbo and Scooby Doo '! Without shame, I tell you! <br /> <br /> The movie's inconsistencies and problems include, but are not limited to: <br /> <br /> 1. A succinctly dressed Simran answers phone calls three times from her would-be killer, the camera shows that he drops the phone off the hook yet the phone can ring again every time and she picks it up to answer. <br /> <br /> 2. Does Tanya try to kill herself because she doesn't win the beauty contest? WTF? Even Aishwarya Rai, who is ten times more beautiful, did not attempt suicide when she did not win Miss India! <br /> <br /> 3. In the pool scene, the children who come to retrieve the ball that fell into the pool disappear conveniently as soon as the police arrive. And the ball also disappears. <br /> <br /> 4. The assassin's blue contact lens clich√©s change from blue to brown in the drowning scene, yet when his corpse emerges again, his eyes are blue. <br /> <br /> 5. No one dies in the film it is mourned (strange, especially for the Indian company). <br /> <br /> 6. When Vikram jumps into the dirty dark pool, an underwater camera shows us his actions and miraculously the pool turns into an Olympic dimension and is as clean and clear as day. <br /> <br /> 7. The sexy belly dancer performs a song steeped in pseudo-orgasm and dances the number over the age of majority. It would have been nice for some bachelor parties, but they were celebrating the victory of the Simran contest! Hello!!!! <br /> <br /> 8. Kunal, Sameer, Simran and Kajal cannot dance or synchronize their lips properly. But don't blame them, he just accepts that there wasn't a choreographer for the dance numbers. <br /> <br /> 9. Nothing in the film was choreographed, it was as if they had just told the actors to show themselves and do anything. <br /> <br /> 10. The film took place as if a script did not exist. Either that or the director was tall and drunk when he was filming this stuff! <br /> <br /> 11. When Simran's photo was published without her consent in a magazine, she flew to police headquarters to have the photographers arrested, yet she receives death threats and never worries about alert the police. <br /> <br /> Just to name a few of course. This film was a painful experience for me and I advise everyone to jump with all the necessary and possible means. Bollywood should be ashamed of this type of film.
