After seeing Darwin's nightmare, one must have the impression that Tanzania is a living hell, given that its population is almost a slave, delivering the best fish to well-fed Europeans, leaving fish bones to the starving population. In exchange for the fish, they get weapons of western production, which the predominantly unemployed population looks forward to using, because being a soldier is their only source of income. <br /> <br /> So everything is obscure with trade as an embodiment of evil and a source of all misery? Not exactly. Fortunately Darwin's Nightmare shows only the dark sides and completely saves the positive aspects. In fact, the documentary tells almost nothing of the economic and ecological importance that victoriaperch has for the region. <br /> <br /> For the countries surrounding Lake Victoria, the victoriaperch is the second most important source of revenue of the third. Salaries in the fishing industry are far above average. Tanzania has banned huge fishing boats to capture the jobs of thousands of fishermen. Adjacent states have reached agreements to maintain fishing at a sustainable level. Lake towns benefit from the taxes that fishermen have to pay for every kilo they catch and taxes on exports and factory profits. Furthermore, Tanzania has banned the export of traditional local fish, which still plays an important role by feeding the local population. <br /> <br /> Ignoring these positive signs, the documentary discourages Western consumers and investors who need it so much and threatens to aggravate the African situation. <br /> <br /> For further reading, I can recommend two articles in the German newspaper on the alternative: http://www.taz.de/pt/2006/09/02/a0013. 1 / textdruck http://www.taz.de/pt/2005/03/17/a0151.1/text
