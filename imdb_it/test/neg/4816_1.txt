This film is the worst thing ever created by humans. Do you think manos is the worst movie ever? It doesn't even come close to this garbage. I don't even know where to start. The "Russian" commander and the chic rebel are the worst "actors" to appear in a movie. They make the sister look like a troll 2 like Meryl Streep. The goofy faces the chic creations while in kung fu training must be seen to be believed. Then there is Oompa's music during the prison break, the totally misplaced love scene, the stupid song that plays during the misplaced love scene, the fake castro, the fact that everyone has either a band / or a bandana on part of their body, the most amazing rape scene ever filmed, and the worst acting ever staged. This film deserves to be better known among bad movie fans. Definitely the worst movie ever made.
