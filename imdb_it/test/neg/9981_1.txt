Who really wants to see it? Disgusting violence, disgusting sex, for so long. I don't want to, but I've always remained true to my philosophy of watching any movie in the worst way. This was the most difficult (immediately after "next Friday"). <br /> <br /> Basically it's just shit. How can you call it something else? The story of a Roman emperor as an excuse for gore and T & A. Yes, yes, "Hey, it's realistic, they were like that." Well, why bother us? I don't care if it was like that (and there are a lot of scenes where I really doubt it). The point is, why would anyone want to see it? The problem is that there is only one reason why the film might like you and that you would like it to like violence. There is nothing special about this, only cruelty. You can say "Cool!" as you would say in splatter-slasher-movie. But horror movies with violence can at least give you chills and excitement, perhaps characters you care about. But here it is all dark, boring and boring. Every character is crazy. "The story of an emperor who cannot face his power". What? In the first scene he runs naked through the woods with his sister! I have no problem saying that we saw a madman for two and a half hours. <br /> <br /> But maybe you get excited by seeing Helen Mirren, pregnant and dancing. Or 5 minutes of hardcore scenes that some people consider the movie's message. Or castration, yes, it was fun! Real birth scenes, as hilarious! Humans, animals, who cares, let's treat them like toys. <br /> <br /> I don't care what anyone says, this is not a movie, this is only 2 1/2 hours of blood and sex, degrading and disgusting. Go watch a porn movie if you want to have sex or watch a horror movie if you want violence. At least those films don't claim to be an artistic masterpiece. And they are shorter. <br /> <br /> [0/10] [6 (1+ - 6-)] [0/4]
