This film was not like the book. <br /> <br /> Everything has been mixed or changed. Most of the film were things that weren't even in the book. <br /> <br /> This film should never have been seen. It was a big disappointment for me when I enjoyed the book so much and then to see how this movie destroyed the whole thing. <br /> <br /> I would never recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Nora Roberts or JD Robb. <br /> <br /> Honestly this film is not worth seeing with what is outside the book.
