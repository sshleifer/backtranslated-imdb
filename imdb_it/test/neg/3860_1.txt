I saw this just to see Joe Morton in an early role and honestly I wished I hadn't worried, he could and he has done much better than this shit since. I can't understand why anyone finds this kind of stupidity funny but everyone on his own; it's an absolute disaster and it's not funny at all. No waiting, only one line was fun, where Mr. Kent (Joe) and his family are having dinner with this crazy job since he was invited for dinner (the Lord only knows why). Pest to Mr Kent: You know how the dog is, you've been there Mrs Kent: Not lately, Joe's expression was funny but it's a joke that doesn't make a comedy fantastic and this is so far from being funny that it should be delivered to the nearest garbage cart, it's just good enough for that. Joe Morton - glad to see you no longer appear in this kind of garbage; you are very superior and a great great actor.
