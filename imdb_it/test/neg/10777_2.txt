The title, although singular, will undoubtedly recall the true horror fans of Tod Browning's classic immortal on a circus freak troop and how they were misunderstood by the outside world. I can assure you, however, that this "thing" has absolutely nothing to do with "Freaks" or even with the art of professional film production in general. This film was recommended to me, presumably because it is raw, disturbing and challenging despite the low production values ​​of the budget. Yeah, for sure?? The person who recommended it to me could now be considered my personal enemy! The reduced budget factor is correct, but this sums it up. "Freak" is terribly slow, badly done and every character that is introduced is definitely unbearable and this also includes the freak. Two brothers traveling to a new life meet a deformed mental patient who escaped from the transport truck to another hospital and heads for the house where he killed his mother at the age of nine. This could have been an interesting slasher with good isolated shooting positions but, instead, Tyler Sharpe decided to make family drama boring and useless. The main actress's attempts to look emotionally devastated are rather ridiculous and the total lack of suspense and action can hardly be attributed to the limited budget. Total failure!
