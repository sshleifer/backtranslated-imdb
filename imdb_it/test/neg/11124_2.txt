Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito), a "crypto-zoologist" (a fancy term for one of those self-deluded losers who likes to study extremely rare - read: non-existent - animals) and his hunter crew manages to trap a Chupacabra , a large, scaly, elusive fast-moving beast. To bring it to the mainland, they smuggle it onto a Greek cruise ship and some idiots open the crate that holds it despite being specifically told not to. I guess the strange growling noises coming from inside were not a good enough deterrent. The monster then makes the thang monster; run around biting pieces of various passengers to the ship's captain (John Rhys-Davies), a special agent with a square jaw who claims to be an insurance salesman for some reason (Dylan Neal), a blonde instructor Tai Bo in a shrill voice (Chelan Simmons), a group of guys with machine guns and others trying to stop him. The main victims (which I think should be the comic relief, but it's hard to say) are an old rich bitch (Paula Shaw) with a yippy terrier and a snobbish golden hoe (David Millbern). Apparently the monster can be eliminated with a single tranquilizer dart, but it can survive with dozens of bullet shots. Chupacabra's design is acceptable (though not original), but the rest of the film is devoid of suspense, surprise or interest. An "original" movie of the boring Sci-Fi Channel; they have made dozens of films just like this one with almost interchangeable characters and textures, but with slight alterations on the creature. Enough already!
