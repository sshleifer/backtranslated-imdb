and parading around a 14-year-old girl in a flip-flop swimsuit is one of these. For fans of this film, I would like to ask: would you allow your daughter to walk in a resort dressed like this? And your fourteen-year-old would be able to handle the reaction he would have from the men? If yes, I'd like to know why, on both counts. Such a dress is a clear invitation to men; it is hypocritical to suggest that it is not. <br /> <br /> And on another point, which teenager would have claimed that his father was his lover, without the excuse of serious mental problems? It's almost as disgusting as the swimsuit. <br /> <br /> In simple terms, some things are not funny or appropriate at all, and never will be.
