Certainly those who compared this to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK certainly knew what they were talking about. He could also have compared it to some of the adventures of the pulp heroes that followed. "Kay Hoog" remembers more than a little both Lamont Cranston (The Shadow) and Clark Savage (Doc Savage). (The shadow, the mysterious man par excellence - and the very first "dark knight" - was also thought to be a Kent Allard. If one were to take Savage's name first and add Kent to it, one would end up with voila - Clark Kent, funny, isn't it?) Like Indiana Jones, Hoog is not above the taps of the artifacts of an ancient civilization (although his thefts are often more brazen and less "fascinating" than Jones's). Unfortunately, this double parter is far from the later serials (of any age) in terms of general quality. One of the first indications that something does not agree with the cinematic storytelling is a scene in which the desperados on horseback, literally breathing the neck, simply observe how Hoog escapes from their clutches in a balloon. Because they don't bother to take down the balloon it's just one of the many cinematic mysteries that afflict these two films. <br /> <br /> The second half of this double parter is even worse than the first. Of course, this was one of the first ever serials and, as such, should be cut a little loose, but there are limits, even, to tolerance. (At some point, the capture of the hero does not take place on the screen, but in the narrative itself! Talking about sharp corners ...) Fritz Lang is one of the greatest filmmakers; unfortunately for those of us who admire most of what he did, THE SPIDERS is really a bitter pill to swallow ...
