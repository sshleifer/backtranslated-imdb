"Frightmare" from 1983 is a strange little film. It seems that the director is trying to combine the atmosphere of the classic 30s / 40s-style horror films with the shock factor of the explosive 80s slasher genre. It is not a total success (especially due to very obvious budget restrictions and the unprofessional caliber of the cast of young actors), but it still has its moments, mainly because of the class performance (most deserving of the film it deserves) from the deceased German actor Ferdinand Mayne, who plays an old horror movie star (wing Vincent Price) called "Conrad Ratzoff". At the beginning of the film we meet the horror star while filming a prosthetic commercial and we soon learn that Ol 'Conrad is a bit of a tramp, first woman jerk-off. Just when you think he can't be more unlucky, the sales manager blames Conrad for blowing once more and the old goat pushes him from a balcony when he dies. Nice, eh? Conrad then visits some fans in a horror movie club on the university campus, unfortunately suffering from a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up in his villa waiting to die. Still exuberant even at the door of Death, he manages to do away with a despised business partner choking him with a pillow before eventually kicking the bucket himself. Conrad is then stored in authentic Hollywood style in a high-tech neon tomb with video screens above the coffin, which will play personal video messages from Conrad himself for visitors to pay homage. <br /> <br /> It is at this point that the boys from the college Horror Movie Society decide to pay Conrad's grave after a visit of hours, breaking into the grave and taking the body home with them for a party all night. (It's not exactly my idea of ​​fun, but hey, these are characters from a horror movie from the 80s, Logic has no place.) The college boys spend the evening dining with Conrad's body sitting in a seat honor, posing for photos with and even dancing around the room with him, before parking Conrad and his coffin in the attic, planning to bring him back to his crypt in the morning. Meanwhile, Mrs. Ratzoff, upset by the theft of her husband's body, called a psychic friend to try to "reach" Conrad through a seance. You can pretty much understand the rest from here. Since Conrad was not a very nice boy in life, it is not very difficult to assume that he will no longer be friendly in death. Psychic Lady comes into contact with Conrad and awakens in a way predictably marked by fashion, then spends the rest of the film walking through the corridors of the incredibly huge student house, gathering the young thieves one after the other. This is where the film falls apart. Endless scenes of teenagers wandering through empty corridors saying "Hi, is anyone there?" they are interconnected with occasional bursts of violence (we get a rather gnarled beheading scene, which is the highlight of the film) before the last two survivors finally understand (WAY later than any other semi-intelligent people would have understood the same thing ... but again, we are in a horror movie of the 80s!) that the only way to stop the chaos is to bring Conrad's body back to his crypt to which he belongs. The slow rhythm is amplified by a strange lighting and by effects of dry ice fog supported by a soundtrack composed almost entirely of sound effects rather than music (thunder, moaning, moaning, howling, etc.) which becomes very annoying after a while . <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend "Frightmare" to all those who didn't grow up watching cheap movies like this on the teleferro in the 80s. Fans of "Modern Horror" will no doubt find "Frightmare" incredibly slow in movement and foolish. If you have come of age in that magical decade, however, you may get a touch of nostalgia from "Frightmare". Jeffrey fans ("Re-Animator") may also want to take a look at the gossip, as the future Dr. West appears in one of the first roles here as one of the unfortunate film students. <br /> <br /> I will recommend the reader avoid the version of this film on the label EastWestDVD (combined with "Vault of Horror" by Roy Ward and sold in dollar stores) because the print quality is terrible. I was told that the film got a deluxe release through the good people of Troma, which seems appropriate. If you are a Troma type of person, then "Frightmare" will be just like you.
