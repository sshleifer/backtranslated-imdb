The ZERO stars of **** <br /> <br /> Endless Descent have absolutely no redeeming value, whether it's incredibly bad acting, laughable special effects, incompetent direction, stupid script or irritating musicals and irritating point. It is the kind of pitiful production that makes me wonder how a film like this can even have the slightest consideration for having been brought to light by a study in the first place. <br /> <br /> I don't think I'm going to delve into the plot except to say that it's a group of people who are trapped underwater and have to kill a lot of fake-looking creatures. <br /> <br /> Let me go into more detail about what is so terrible about this movie. First of all, acting is simply horrendous. Jack Scalia is ten times worse than Sylvester Stallone, a difficult enough undertaking to achieve. Support performances are no better. And what happens to the actor Luis Lorenzo, the boy who plays the cook, Francisco. He has a high-pitched voice and an accent that seems appropriate for a comedy, not a science fiction horror movie. <br /> <br /> Special effects are even worse. The creatures range from strange-looking eels to giant and "mostquitoes" starfish. The effects look like something you would see in a muppet movie, and I don't think I need to go deeper into this issue. <br /> <br /> Director JP Simon has a slight cult status due to all the terrible films he has made. I'm sure some will appreciate the Endless Descent in an Ed Wood way, but I don't even think it's that good. All he does is poor, especially car work. Man can't direct a film, that's all there is to it. <br /> <br /> This was the last of four films that took place underwater, and certainly makes Leviathan and Deep Star Six (both bad films in their own right) start looking masterly in comparison. In any case, stay with The Abyss.
