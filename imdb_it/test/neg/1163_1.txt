All the great horror films of the 70s, 80s and even the early 90s of Psycho, of Texas Chainsaw Masacre (The original did not warm up with WB's crap), by Silence of the Lambs. The characters in these films were based on the crimes of Ed Gein. Writers and directors have exploited the true story for the inspiration for creating some of the greatest fiction killer * of all time. <br /> <br /> The old horror films were fantastic because even though the crimes were based roughly on the facts of Ed Gein's case, they were really fantastic and far from the true story. <br /> <br /> In the case of this film, they created an imaginary horror film in which they tried to capitalize on the true story to sell a cheap and misunderstood love story between two characters that nobody really cares about. Indeed, in a horror * good film * these two characters would have been excellent victims. <br /> <br /> End of the conference ... <br /> <br /> In short, this film was like dressing up sweaty underwear on a cold afternoon sipping a nice cup of cold vomit.
