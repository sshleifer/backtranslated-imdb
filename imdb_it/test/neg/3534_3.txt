This is Wes Craven at his worst! this is the worst horror, if you can call it horror, you'll never see it, especially from one of the horror masters Wes Craven, Poor Direction, Poor Acting, Poor Set, Poor atmosphere makes this the biggest garbage pile ever! the villain is not absolutely convincing, you couldn't even feel sorry for the boy! the blood and horror involved in the film are ridiculous, it's just crap! the only good thing I can think of is that it says Natasha Gregson Wagner, Giovanni Ribisi and Lance Henriksen, but even that cast could prevent this from going out of control and becoming one of the worst horrors ever. If you still don't look at it yet, don't worry, it will only hate it.
