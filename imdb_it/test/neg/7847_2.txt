A young klutzy returns to the West after being trained in the hotel industry via Boston; soon learns that his friends in old California colonized in Spain expect him to fill the shoes of the deceased father - that of a romantic thief known for kissing his victims after kidnapping them. Colorful but stupid production of M-G-M has a great talent before and behind the camera, but never takes off. This may have been fun, second rope material for Abbott & Costello, but Frank Sinatra seems lost and embarrassed in the head. The combination of raucous comedy and musical interludes is hindered by bad staging (Sinatra is photographed while singing in a spot in the mirror, but one does not focus on his performance as much as noticing how strange the star reflected this way appears!) . Kathryn Grayson is the daughter of the Governor who falls in love with Frank, and her tall soprano trill transforms her singing scenes into self parody. Apart from the cinematography of Robert Surtees and the decent art direction, this "Bandit" remains without a kiss. * from ****
