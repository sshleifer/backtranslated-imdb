What I hate most in this junk is the arrogant attitude of filmmakers and network executives who put this nonsense to the public because they really think the public is so stupid, so undeserving, so insipid that they deserve this kind of disadvantages. There is an inherent entertainment that sees catastrophic films and with the magic of today's CGI effects artists receive powerful tools to explore what was previously denied. With that seduction we sat and watched a bit of chaos and destruction. Well, guess what, the only mess we've seen was in the ads that advertise next Wednesday's episode. What a disappointment! But wait, there was even a bigger one. The script was the biggest disaster! And then there was the direction and flabby action of all those involved in this turkey. But we knew it before, didn't we?! We knew that the effects alone are not fun, but the network bozos that did well in this TV movie didn't bother them because in their mantra the eternal line "never underestimates how stupid the public is". These guys must actually live by this motto, and I'm so sick of it. No wonder the public has abandoned the US drama in droves and launched its own field in reality shows. at least in those programs nobody is trying to make everything look different from what it is: intellectual pornography. Well, Category 6 is worse than that because it is assumed to be different and "original". Yes, this was a catastrophic film, but the disasters are not the ones that advertised!
