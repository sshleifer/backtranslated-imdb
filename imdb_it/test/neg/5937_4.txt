After two terrorist attacks in Europe, one in London and the other in Amsterdam, the main suspect is the leader Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul). CIA agent Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) who works in the Middle East is assigned by his superior to Langley Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) to maintain a "safe house" in Amman under surveillance, and joins the head of security in Jordan , Hani Salaam (Mark Strong). Roger does not reveal the whole operation to Hani, and fails because of Ed's intervention. Meanwhile, Roger feels for local nurse Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani) and approaches his family. When Roger draws up another plan to capture Al-Saleem using the innocent architect Omar Sadiki (Ali Suliman) as a bait to lure Al-Saleem, he endangers not only Sadiki's safety, but also Aisha who is kidnapped. After Sadiki's execution, Roger tries to negotiate the release of Aisha with the terrorists and proposes to surrender himself to save the nurse. <br /> <br /> "Body of Lies" is a disappointing pyrotechnic tour across Europe and the Middle East despite the names of Ridley Scott, Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. The IMDb User Rating indicates that there are many spectators who love this type of high-speed espionage film that uses high technology, satellites and all sorts of disrespect for the sovereignty of other nations in the name of oil that doesn't it gives time to think, but it is not my case. It is tedious and ridiculous to see fat Russell Crowe on a cell phone like a family man while his partner is risking his life in a dangerous operation. The rich character played by Leonardo DiCaprio is underdeveloped and, in my opinion, this great actor is a disbeliever as an operative agent in the Middle East because of his biotype. But the film never explains its connections with the Middle East. Even the rescue of Roger Ferris alive is very stupid and trivial. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Rede de Mentiras" ("Network of Lies")
