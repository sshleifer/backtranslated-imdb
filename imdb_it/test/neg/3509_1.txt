I saw this "movie" in part because of the large number of good reviews on Netflix and from that I gave a valuable lesson. Not a lesson on ethnic diversity, however ... the lesson I learned is "Don't trust the reviews". <br /> <br /> Yes, racism sucks and people are complicated, but the people who actually need to see this film will be the ones who are less attracted to it and less influenced by it if they see it. The only reason I can think of the number of positive reviews is that it has been reviewed by people who are not used to thinking, or who have seen their first film that stimulates reflection and somehow think that Haggis invented the concept. In fact, in practice he made this film, which should be called "Racism for Mannequins", as emotionally harrowing as possible, apparently to give people who don't spend much time thinking about the impression of having discovered some fundamental truths that are before it has never been treated in a film. Maintanence is not ... An after-school special for thoughtless masses, cut messy and overflowing pieces to make it easier to swallow without too much introspection. <br /> <br /> It is as if they all interpret as the worst possible end, simply to make us happy to be such good people because we don't identify with the characters. Let's face it people. NO ONE identifies with these characters because they are all cardboard scraps and stereotypes (or predictably inverse stereotypes). It's well acted (even if the dialogue is atrocious) and cleverly executed, so much so that you don't think to ask "Where's the beef?" until you can say that the film is finished. The scene of the flaming car was well executed, like most of the film, but it didn't go anywhere at the end. <br /> <br /> The messages are very heavy and, from the "behind the scenes" blurb, the producers were clearly watching a different film, because there is little to laugh about in this film, even during the designated fun parts. I must stress that this is NOT entertainment, more like a lesson on the diversity of high school ... call it the "Blood on the road" of racism. They could even show it in high schools if it weren't for Jennifer Esposito's "side-nude" movie. <br /> <br /> In this film, everyone is an idiot and everyone learns a lesson (except Michael Pena who gets the best role, but the most predictable plot. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie, with bad writing and good actors .... an ugly cartoon made by Paul Haggis for people who can 'I manage nothing except the audacious traits of the narration .... a picture painted with crayons. <br /> <br / > Crash is a small depressing nothing, which causes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know that racism and prejudice are bad things.
