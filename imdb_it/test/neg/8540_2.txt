Good old Jess Franco! The choice of the director is always reliable in case you are looking for unpretentious treachery, shameless exploitation and free 200%. Jess once again really outdid himself with this piece of "adventure" in the jungle. Let's face it, this film is basically just an excuse to make Katja Bienert's actress (and minor) parade topless. In reality it is rather disturbing to think that an innocent 16-year-old girl must shoot a set of naked films in front of an entire crew and in particular in front of Franco's perverted eyes! And it wasn't even the first time, since the duo had already done "Linda" together. Anyway, if I asked you: YES, "Diamanti del Kilimangiaro" has a plot, even if very imbecile. During the opening sequences, an airplane, carrying a rich Scottish boy and a child, crashes into an African tribe of vegetarian cannibals. I say vegetarian, because at some point in the film, not even so many try to consume human flesh. The hateful Scot declares himself the Great White Chief and the girl grows up to become the beautiful and freshly dressed White Goddess. Several years later an expedition reaches the middle of the jungle to bring the girl back to civilization and ?? even more important: to steal some of the legendary tribes diamonds. This could have been a compelling and action-packed adventure film, but Jess Franco obviously couldn't be bothered. Why shoot sequences of jungle chases or bloody cannibal rites when you can just as easily point the camera at a hot young girl sitting naked on a tree? Most of the jungle settings seem to simply be filmed in someone's garden and there is a massive amount of awkwardly edited National Geographic wildlife footage to fill the gaps in continuity. The back of the DVD describes "Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro" as an ingenious, feminist and adult oriented version of Tarzan. Yes, they put the sentence there because the character of Katja Bienert swings from tree to tree using a couple of times.
