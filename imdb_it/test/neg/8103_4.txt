"Black Dragons" is a second World War II propaganda feature released at the time. It's not as bad as some would have us believe. <br /> <br /> A secret meeting hosted by the respected Dr. William Saunders (George Pembroke) is interrupted by a mysterious stranger named Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi). Shortly after the meeting participants begin to be assassinated, their bodies are placed on the steps of the Japanese embassy in Washington. Colomb is suspected. Federal agent Dick Martin (Clayton Moore) is assigned to the case and meets Saunders' niece Alice Saunders (Joan Barclay) who tries to help him. The reasons behind Colomb's actions are not explained until the final reel. As long as everything is explained in the end, the story is difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> Lugosi, who at the time was reduced to appearing in a series of low-budget quickies, is actually quite good at it. He is not allowed to act as he usually did and the credit for this must go to director William Nigh. The character of Lugosi slips through the shadows and remembers his Dracula until the full of his piercings in the eyes. <br /> <br /> Clayton Moore, a one-dimensional actor at the most, would become the Lone Ranger of TV in a few years. Joan Barclay is a good heroine. <br /> <br /> Although a little dated now, "Black Dragons" is not a bad way to spend an hour.
