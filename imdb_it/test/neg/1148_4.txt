Arthur Miller has always been known as one of the great American playwrights for works like "Death of a Salesman" and "The Crucible". "Focus" is one of his lesser known works carried on the silver screen. However, knowing what a great playwright Arthur Miller is, I doubt his original work was very similar to the film. The film is presented as empty and formidable, with William H. Macy as a non-Jew mistaken for a Jew by the anti-Semitic neighbors of World War II in Brooklyn. Don't get me wrong: acting is OK, and I assume that the people behind this film are probably trying to make a point about racism, but the film doesn't work. Macy, Laura Dern and David Paymer fail to create an effective story with the material here.
