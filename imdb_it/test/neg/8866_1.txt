I never understood this kind of fake movies. We get a serious / semi-serious film that everyone knows and takes its seriousness through immature jokes and the like. We have seen it many, many times, and it has never been really fun. It's just an easy way to laugh at something you don't understand, in my opinion. This seems to be one of the darkest and least loved of the genre, although I honestly don't see anything much worse than Spy Hard or Hot Shots. This film, as clearly understood from the title, focuses on the fun of Pulp Fiction. This is the main reason why I decided to watch it, since I discovered that the film was excessively lenient towards Tarantino's sick mind and strongly overrated. I was hoping for one or two good jokes, making fun of the kind of film that was too violent and useless that Pulp Fiction was in every aspect, in my (anything but) humble opinion. I was very disappointed. The plot is practically a rip off of Tarantino's film, with some scenes that spoof other films, often better ones, in the same childish way and without humor. The pace is poor and you often sit there, you can guess the outcome of each scene, predict every joke, often thinking of a better one on the spot, bored by your mind. The acting is bad The characters are clich√©s and stereotypes and are deliberately thin to make fun of the characters they are based on ... the problem is that it doesn't work. It makes the film much more difficult to seduce. Humor is youthful and lame. The only positive thing I can say about this film is that they managed to find some actors that looked like the people they should have looked like. The film is a terrible waste of the real actors involved. Maybe slightly fun for fans of the typical spoof movie of the same type. I recommend it only to people who really hate Pulp Fiction or fans of Zucker's parody movies. Everyone else: avoid. 1/10
