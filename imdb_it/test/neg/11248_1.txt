This film was completely stale and uninspired. The central premise of this film was basically a group of stereotyped black people who sat around a barber shop exchanging painfully and unjustified. I didn't laugh once during the whole movie. I could have sat in a barber shop in America and listened to this banal exchange, and maybe even had a decent haircut. I can't understand why this casino has had favorable reviews, let alone why so many people have wasted money on this. None of the characters here was funny or worthy of attention. I didn't really care that the rival barber across the street would make Nappy Cutz fail. Don't waste your money on this, folks, because it's the only way to stop Hollywood from churning out these pieces of trash. 1 * out of 5
