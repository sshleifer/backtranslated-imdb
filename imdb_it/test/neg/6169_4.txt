Let me first of all rarely comment on the films, I just comment on whether I am amazed or disappointed by something I thought would be good. Killshot was a huge disappointment on so many levels. The script was horrible, the acting was sub-par (especially coming from heavy weights like Rourke and Lane) and the editing and effects were comical, (by blowing up cars etc. etc.) Rosario Dawson had a horrible role, I can't I think he would even accept it, it was such an abuse of his talent that I can't even put it into words. I should have known after seeing the trailer for this film 3 years ago and I kept putting on the cover that theirs was a serious problem with this film .......... B film to the end .... ..... don't worry if you're not really bored ........
