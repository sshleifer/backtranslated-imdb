In 1994 the Power Rangers had become a huge franchise and t.v. US network executives hoped to get into action and invented the Tattooed Teenage Alien Fighters of Beverly Hills, where the evil Emporer Gorganus, who seems to be wearing a homemade Darth Vader costume, and his talking bird, which looks like a chewable dog, arrives on earth to invade it using giant monsters that look like waste from a 1970s Godzilla movie. Fortunately Nimbar, an alien that looks like a gigantic piece of jelly, recruits four teenagers to defend the earth, Nimbar gives everyone a tattoo of a different constellation of stars that turns them into enchanted superheroes that resemble dancers of an eighties technology music video , could also be combined into a giant knight. Forty episodes have been made. The US network clearly didn't have the money to try to adapt a show from Japan like the Power Rangers did, and invented this show on their own using the budget of a scifi movie of the 50s. The fighting scenes are generic, the special effects are scarce and some of the sets seem to fall. The actors almost realized how ridiculous the show was and practically blocked it and made it go too fast. I can only imagine their shock when the show was canceled.
