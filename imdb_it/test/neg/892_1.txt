I saw House Party 1-3 and loved them but this wasn't fun at all. First it can't be a House Party movie without Kid n'Play right? This sucks and was more like a black version of Ferris Bueller's Day Off than a House Party movie. According to whom the hell is John-John? These new characters cannot even compare to those of the other three films. Now I know why they put it directly on video. It has a horrible music, a weak storyline, talentless actors and no hilarious jokes. My advice is to watch this movie at night only if you can't sleep. They should have finished series after House Party 3 since Kid'n'Play split up after that. I hate this I'm glad my video store doesn't have this movie and never wants to buy it or want to see it on Comedy Central. Just because Chris Strokes is talented in managing an emerging R & B group does not mean he has a talent for directing and producing films, am I right or what? In the end, the female characters were all dressed as cheap two-dollar prostitutes for almost the entire movie. that you forget nowadays. In simpler terms this film is simply old, it sucks !!!!
