This film is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The cast was fantastic, but the film itself was horrible. It was so horrible, I had to register just to say how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie and wanted to break it every minute I watched. It could have been fantastic. He had a very good premise. If you want to steal an armored car and there's a homeless man who sees you, you have to do what you have to do. For the main character to decide to have a policeman killed and his friends and work colleagues killed after the homeless was already dead, it's simply ridiculous. And yes, I'm sure there will be answers to this regarding the way his conscience came to him, but come on. <br /> <br /> The protagonist crawled on the bottom of the armored truck, no one saw him. He blew up the money supply and grabbed and dragged the cop right behind the other guards and nobody saw him. He was able to get back into the armored car, and nobody saw him ... This film had potential, but it blew him up. <br /> <br /> You couldn't pay me to watch this movie ever again! NEVER watch it! Aggravating...
