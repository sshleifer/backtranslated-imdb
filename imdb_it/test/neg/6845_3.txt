This film was so stupid and slow it was always slow. The only good part of the film was the girl in tight gold shiny pants. There was nothing to do and what is a horror movie from the 80s without a bit of cold blood. Furthermore, the killer was not at all scary and neither were the murders. But if you like watching the worst horror movie in the world, then this is for you. Don't waste your time like I did watching this.
