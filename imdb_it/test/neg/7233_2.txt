I bought this movie on DVD for Â£ 4, but it was a waste, the film is bad. The plot is your average monster, in which it kills a few people, the mayor does not believe it and in the end they fight it. <br /> <br /> The positive side is that the quality of the film is very good, and the New York setting is impressive for an economic film - as opposed to a small coastal town. Even acting is reasonable. <br /> <br /> However, the special effects, the mainstage in a monster movie, are ridiculous and the addition of a random load of boys to the plot halfway becomes strange. The finish is very bad. <br /> <br /> In summary, whenever you have the chance to see it, don't do it - there will be something better. <br /> <br /> RTC "The real horror movies I don't have a PG rating"
