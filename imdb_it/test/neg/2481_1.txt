When Las Vegas came out a review described this show as quoting "A harmless piece of hair". Needless to say, after seeing about a dozen or so episodes I think this description is right for the money. An assortment of cute boys and stiff models play an assortment of paper thin stories as they continually try to pretend to be serious businessmen. One-dimensional characters, in a one-dimensional context, pursuing one-dimensional stories. That pretty much sums up Vegas. I still look at it from time to time to see if the show is trying to evolve and takes a little serious but unfortunately without success. Till now.
