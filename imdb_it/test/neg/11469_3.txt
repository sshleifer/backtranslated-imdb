As a big fan of most modern fantasy movies, I couldn't wait to do it. I was not familiar with the character, although after listening to some general stories about the comic book style and good reviews of the film, I thought I had a real party ... <br /> <br /> From the moment the main character he started talking in his forced voice, I knew immediately that I wouldn't like this movie. I found the story weak and predictable, acting mediocre, the effects were very good for a low-cost movie, but they did nothing for the general plot. <br /> <br /> Maybe as a comic book fan you could get something more out of this, otherwise I'd suggest you skip it and not waste your cinema on this boring adventure.
