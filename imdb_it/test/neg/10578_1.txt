I went to see this movie with my boyfriend last night. I'm 20 and this film was too much for me. I could not imagine taking a teenager, a preteen or (especially) a child in this film. It was rough and offensive. I was totally misled by his PG-13 rating and the previews I had seen for it. Initially I saw previews for this on Nickelodeon, and I thought it was pretty nice (maybe I can't remember the preview correctly). Furthermore, Drake Bell (the main character of the film) is the protagonist of a Nickelodeon TV show aimed at pre-adolescents and young teenagers. I didn't really think that the content of the film would be just as risky. I should have done more research about it before I left. However, I hope parents read this movie before they bring their children to see it just because they are Drake Bell. <br /> <br /> Seriously, DO NOT take your kids or teenagers to watch this movie. The evaluation should have been R. There are a lot of sexual references, references to drugs and disturbing events during the film. Examples: Drake Bell is attacked by sexually charged animals, several scenes involving men who grab women's breasts, a lot of vulgarity, Drake Bell uses a bong to smoke vanilla frosting (or something like that), people are stabbed, hit and injured movies, and an old lady and her dog are torn to pieces. There are tons of other offensive and disgusting scenes throughout the film. It was really humiliating for women in general. The film is about the people who made the Scary Movie series, so it should tell you something right there. Remember that watching movies like this can give children and adolescents misconceptions about sex, drugs and violence. Most children and adolescents cannot decipher between parody or comedy and reality. <br /> <br /> I have a sense of humor. I also know that the humor of this film is typical of its kind. But I find the possibility for children and adolescents to see this film HORRIFYING. <br /> <br /> As for the overall quality of the film, I didn't think it was original or funny. He dragged in part and part of the humor was just forced and painful. The acting wasn't too bad, considering how bad the script was. If you are an adult or older teenager looking for a funny movie, skip this or rent.
