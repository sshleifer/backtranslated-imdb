I was very disappointed with this movie. The English lady who claims to be a fan of the original film seems to have taken a great artistic job and turned it into a flat and long "ho-hum", a very long production of children. I tried to appreciate Mary Haines of Meg Ryan, but she was simply boring. She didn't seem to feel anything about her husband's relationship. There was no emotional struggle, no deep pain. In the original 1939 film, Norman Shearer, Mary Haines felt betrayed, shocked, vulnerable, confused and angry. The 2008 production spoke more of a false sisterhood theme, (actually my wife's words) and didn't make you shed tears or even laugh. The only noteworthy performances are by Debra Messing and Bette Midler. (I wanted more than Bette.) There really was no protagonist in this movie. The character of Sylvia Fowler had too many secondary themes. And Crystal Allen didn't fire. The department store remake met Annette Benning and Miss Mendez was warm. Even the pace was slow. Obviously the 1939 version had to be updated, but it wasn't that. The reason the original version worked so well was that the characters were dealing with "man" problems. An argument from the way it is not obsolete. The magic of the original film was that the film spoke of both sexes, while you never saw men.
