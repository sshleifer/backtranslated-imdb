Retro Puppet Master is complete and absolutely CRAP. In particular, puppets seem stupid and disgusting. The acting was unforgivable and the story was rancid. This film dates back to the past, where the dolls were created for the first time, this is not a puppet. Back Puppet Master is rated PG-13, the first Puppet Master to be evaluated PG-13. The film contains no horror or suspense. The fact that this film is a Puppet Master movie drives the mind crazy, because this episode has no buckets of blood, good acting, or any other entertainment like the previous films. Do not watch this movie, do not rent it and do not even watch it on TV, because this film is stale, non-violent and completely poor. of 10. As a fan of Puppet Master, I am disappointed ... seriously.
