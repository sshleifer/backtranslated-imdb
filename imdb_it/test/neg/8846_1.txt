Forget the bad acting, which can be forgiven in this type of film. Or even the terrible, unnatural dialogue and illogical events (if my subtitles actually reflected what was being said). Much worse is the blatant absence of an experienced or experienced director who may have taken a vacation with the publisher while the film was being made? Watching the movie, it seems completely obsolete even though it was "made" only 7 years ago. A computer virus as a portal to the afterlife? lol? A dial-up internet connection? Clucky ghost images photographed on photos ("He! Look there ... is that ... is it a face?" sequences are badly modified and consequently do not flow at all. You'll be watching a girl find a corpse still hanging from the knot in a scene and then literally 10 seconds later seeing it again in a seemingly unaffected place, smiling and walking around. <br /> <br /> In addition to the many problems I have with the film in terms of production value, it is also painfully long and repetitive and therefore absolutely boring. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Shutter" instead, an oriental (Thai) horror film done well.
