I really don't know why, but I saw it with a certain sense of anticipation. Unfortunately, it was out of place. First of all this is not horror, it does not scare and (unless it was even worse than it gave him credit - which is possible) does not try. It's a scruffy comedy and the fact that I smiled once means that I gave a 2 not a 1. This movie by Gremlins in a very special way, I can't say I've ever seen a more dedicated movie. Very, very bad - avoid.
