I am very interested in the extremely positive reviews here. While it had some good features, for the most part I found this film heavy, predictable and, above all, not scary. The first 30 minutes of the film were promising, the actress did a good job in her performance, and the world around her was well thought out and meaningful. Unfortunately, from there, the film entered a downward spiral. I went to this movie without the slightest idea what it was about-- I knew nothing about actors, directors, genre, etc. At one point, my wife made the comment "should this be scary movie?" Well, I suppose so, since the "horror movie" steel plate is full of squeaky violins and the extended vibrato couldn't mean anything else. There doesn't seem to be much originality in the film, the romantic interest was painfully obvious from the first moment, and the second part of the film fell into the realm of ridicule. A film like this runs a dangerously narrow path, and unfortunately there comes a point where the spectator has to decide whether to continue walking along that path, or jump down and simply laugh at the ridiculousness of all this. For the last 30 minutes, I chose the latter.
