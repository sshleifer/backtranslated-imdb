When I first saw the trailer for this film, I really wanted to see it. I thought some of the other director's work was pretty good, but I have to say I was disappointed. The plot involves a young woman, who lives with a widowed father and two of her two children. They move to a well-guarded community, yet everything is not as it seems; a sort of Twin Peaks. The woman begins to see, or not see, things a people. During the first reel, I had a hypothesis and I thought "this can't be the whole reason?" Well, the ending lived, or rather DOWN, and gave us what I felt was a really weak final act. The mixing and the sound quality are excellent. I saw it in a THX Certified Theater and was impressed with the audio and only the audio. The image lacks substance.
