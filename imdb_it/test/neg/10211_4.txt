In 1989, here in New Zealand, wrestling was a bit of a mega-hype phenomenon, and whoever drove the spaceship to the top was the same orange elf, HULK HOGAN (one of my hero heroes right now), so I It seems obvious now because I loved this film in 1989-90 when it came out here. HULK HOGAN A.K.A Terry Bollea is an incredibly bad actor and Zeus A.K.A Tiny Lister is worse !!! The plot follows a WWE standard (hence WWF) of about 88-91 story lines that culminates in the good standard guy knocked down, hulk up and then he is beaten again on the plot only to follow that the good guy calls all his inner strength (earned to eat vitamins, saying prayers etc etc) to mount the epic back ..... fairly standard formula here. It is worth looking at if only to remember your youth !!!!
