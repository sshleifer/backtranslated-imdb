If you've seen the grudge, another mediocre ghost movie, you should know what to expect, only worse, much worse. This time instead of being in Japan with all English speaking people we are in Spain with all the people who speak English. It is interesting to note that not one shot of this film actually looks like Spain and could have been shot entirely in a studio lot. Oh, and a place with swings, because there are 5 good minutes of footage of no-one on them, oooohhh how ghostly they are. <br /> <br /> This is terrible in every way imaginable. Mom and dad lameinator's acting doesn't help things at all. Anna Paquin is the only person who offers a decent performance in the film but I hate Anna Paquin so you can imagine my private hell watching this movie. <br /> <br /> There is a good moment in the film, however, when a villain is trying to explain the twisted plot to the character of Anna Paquin and she does not understand any of this and asks a series of stupid questions and bursts out "IDIOT, you didn't understand anything!" lol. Well I understand you understand that this film is a piece of junk. 0 stars.
