The first movie was pretty trendy and had funny moments, this movie doesn't have exactly the same standard. Calvin Palmer (Ice Cube) is still trying to maintain his barbershop, but it's not just against designer Gina (Queen Latifah) with a beauty shop next door, but soon a large barbershop chain called Nappy Cutz that opens on the other side of the road. Calvin, along with colleagues and friends Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer), Jimmy (Sean Patrick Thomas), Terri (Eve) and Isaac Rosenberg (Troy Garity), are doing everything they can to keep the regulars coming, and eventually the their business racing against the competition. Still with Michael Ealy as Ricky Nash, Leonard Earl Howze as Dinka, Harry Lennix as Quentin Leroux, Robert Wisdom as Alderman Brown, Jazsmin Lewis as Jennifer, Kenan Thompson as Kenard and Bad Company in the Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon in the role of Loretta. I didn't like this movie as much as the first because of the useless flashbacks on Eddie, and it's not so witty, I just got bored. All right!
