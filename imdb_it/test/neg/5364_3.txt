I'm a fan of the paranormal and I love Ghost Hunters so when this show came out I decided to try it. I could barely sit in an episode. The show is thus obviously staged. I mean, come on, every single episode involves someone who is possessed or involves a demonic force trying to kill the family. Another huge flaw is that these guys never stop. When I look at Ghost Hunters they find evidence and try to disprove it and if they can't, then it's a test. In this show they find a voice or a video test piece and they are very quick to call it a ghost. This completely ruins their credibility unlike TAPS and Ghost Hunters who really know what they are doing. Honestly, if you are interested in the paranormal and want to see a show about it, look at Ghost Hunters.
