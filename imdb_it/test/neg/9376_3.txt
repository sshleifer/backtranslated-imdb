"De Dominee" is based on the life of a true Dutch gangster, Klaas Bruinsma! His name is Klaas Donkers! I have my doubts that the events presented in the film have anything to do with what really happened! But it does not matter! Because he failed to get my attention! This film bored me to death! It lacks substance and style! The part of the substance could have been forgiven if the acting had been good and if the director had tried to do something original! Without the substance you must at least bring a decent style or action! Do we need to be entertained? It would have been useful if the director had seen other gangster films! It's obvious he didn't! Otherwise he wouldn't have done it the way he did! This film received a lot of publicity due to a small scandal concerning Klaas Bruinsma and a member of the Dutch royal family! This scandal has nothing to do with the film, how come! Without it "De Dominee" would never have succeeded! I'm sure!
