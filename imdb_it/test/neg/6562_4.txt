This is the only word I can think of to describe this film. Don't waste as in a waste of time (any time spent with these characters is never wasted), but waste as a waste of opportunities. <br /> <br /> When I see this film, I think of all the Star Trek novels that have been written and that would have made a much better film than the story chosen by Shatner. The installation was like an average television episode, while the final seemed the culminating point (so to speak) of the first film. <br /> <br /> Nimoy, in directing II-IV, focused on Spock's character: how he tackled Kobayashi Maru out of the classroom and how he handled his emotional life now that he had the chance to start over. Shatner could have done the same with Kirk here, but he didn't. We don't know much about Kirk that we didn't know before. Once again, one of the novels would have been better - try "My Enemy, My Ally" for a study of the very interesting character of our friend James T. The secondary characters are mainly used for nice bits, and the Scotty-Uhura subplot looks very left-handed, especially since the subtext of the original series was Sulu-Uhura. <br /> <br /> Even the most ardent fans don't find much to have fun here. Sorry, but it's true.
