Riggs and Murtough are back but the magic of the first film has disintegrated. The plot is just awful! I mean, South African diplomats who smuggle the mythical Krugerrands into the United States are painful! And the accents are absolutely abysmal! No one can have an Afrikaans South African accent right? Or will we ever hear the British or the Americans make them look like drunk Dutchmen? The only guy who had the right Afrikaans accent was Tim Robbins in Catch A Fire. Another thing about this film that I didn't like was when Danny Glover described an Afrikaans accent like shit so harmlessly! I mean that slap in the face of the Afrikaans. There is also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me throw up. I mean, the character of Mel Gibson is so against the diplomats, but then he sleeps with their P.A. gender! Don't waste time watching this garbage movie. If you want to see a film that doesn't completely offend a cultural group, then rent Die Hard 2.
