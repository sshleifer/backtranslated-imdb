Don't get me wrong, I love most of Paul Schrader's films, so it was with great enthusiasm that I was able to participate in the "Rolling Thunder" screening of French Parisian cinematics with a surprise film on December 17, 2004. Obviously The film at surprise was the exorcist and most people were there for that (I was too). The film was then completed but the score, so P Schrader used excerpts from The Return of the King and some other films I forgot (was Conan?). However, apart from that the film was finalized. The lucky few there (maybe 200 people) were informed that they didn't like writing about the film on the internet or in magazines because they could have jeopardized the possibility of being selected for the Cannes Festival. Then the film arrived, then came the realization that the film could not be selected for the Festival because of its quality: never in my life had I felt such embarrassment in the audience while people went from being skeptical to clearly crying to loud to the pitiful spectacle. I could not believe how low the author of Light Sleeper, Mishima, Blue Collar and Affliction had sunk. <br /> <br /> Exaggerated forced execution, stupid ending, black and white morality, terrible side effects, the worst Christianity Schrader has ever taken, not even suspense, just boring to die for (it's not a pun) ) and not at all surprising! Some good positions but unfortunately they were not used or at least they did not meet the initial hopes! In the end I was 100 times more satisfied by Schrader, I wrote Rolling Thunder and I wanted my 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Don't believe the hype, even the John Boorman film is more exciting and original. Oh, and the casting of Billy Crawford, the poor guy does his best, but what do you expect? Now it's part of the smallest club of the worst casting mistakes of all time! I give the film a 1/5 just because I didn't leave the room, but I should have it.
