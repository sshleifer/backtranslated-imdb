This film was useless. I can't even call it sci-fi, since it requires more from a film than simply space in space. "Max Q" is not even set up in space for the entire movie. The story / plot is not original, the cast has nothing to tell, although it would be strange with a high level cast in a mediocre film ... Furthermore, it is not particularly exciting or well told. At least it is fairly balanced in a low quality way, in the sense that nothing or nobody stands out. Everything is equally insignificant. I usually find some quality in "space gestures", even if it's only 90 minutes of semi-limping entertainment that borders on the pathetic low-budget, but "Max Q" hasn't even given me that satisfaction. All in all, a complete waste of time.
