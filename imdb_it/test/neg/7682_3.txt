Sorry folks, I love the work of Ray Bolger but the only thing he is not is a leading man. Maybe if you pretend to be the last man on earth, this romantic plot could work, but come on now! <br /> <br /> Here is a film that exists simply to show the title song which was a great success for the Basie Band the year before (1951). And some pretty nice singers and dancers save him from being a total disaster. <br /> <br /> However, the plot is pathetic, even by the standards of the 1952 musical comedy. And the other songs are just as unforgettable as the Evening In Paris colony. The dialogue embarrasses the stars, Day & Bolger. Only Boyeresque spells by Claude Dauphin retain their three-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> So how can we enjoy this movie on video? <br /> <br /> A.) Fast forward through all the dialogues ... <br /> <br /> B.) Surrender to the voices of Doris Day and the loose movements of Ray Bolger. And don't miss Dauphin's exhilarating script in a rain-flooded "April In Paris" shot ... <br /> <br /> C. Finally, keep a couple of chilled and handy Cabernet bottles. <br /> <br /> Bob Raymond
