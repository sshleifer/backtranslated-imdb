Dr. Markoff is a mad scientist who is experimenting, trying to find a cure for a viral cause of acromegaly. When he attends a piano concert, he is struck by the pianist's beautiful daughter and sets off to woo her. But when she wants nothing to do with him, she infects her father with the acromegaly virus in an attempt to extort money and her daughter in exchange for a cure. <br /> <br /> This is the basic premise for this B-grade low budget thriller. I must say that I was disappointed with this film. Not that it was terrible - it wasn't, but there was nothing particularly noteworthy about it. It was quite fun for a vision but it is not one that will remain in my memory. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is a bit trivial at times and the acting is just mediocre. History is quite predictable and does not really give us anything new. Of course, I can't complain too much about a movie that has a boy with a gorilla dress that serves almost no real purpose and a doctor with a Svengali-like look who can't hypnotize his victims. <br /> <br /> It might be worth looking at if you like this kind of film, but don't face it with too many expectations.
