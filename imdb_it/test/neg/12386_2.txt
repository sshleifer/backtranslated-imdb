OK, this "horror" movie had to be a joke, right? Please tell me it had to be a joke, then I'll understand. <br /> <br /> A large bird that croaks with gigantic claws - or a claw, however - swoops upon unsuspecting ground and swallows them up. Mara Corday and Jeff Morrow get dirty enough to keep things interesting, but at least you'll enjoy a little laugh when you see the 'monster'. It looks like a cross between a deranged chicken and Mortimer Snerd. Or the director Fred Sears has just made this photo quickly and he knew that the bird seemed completely ridiculous, or really thought that his film and his creature were genuinely scary. I prefer to think - and hope - that it was the first. <br /> <br /> P.S. The bird needs a haircut.
