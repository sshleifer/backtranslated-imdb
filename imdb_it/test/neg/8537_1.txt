I don't expect much from ghost stories, but I expect a story to make sense! Is it too much to ask screenwriters and directors? When the villain suddenly becomes a homicidal maniac just because a bunch of crows starts to catch him, then I have a problem spending $ 9.00 for a ticket! Alfred Hitchcock would have turned to his grave. Has anyone ever learned anything in their Cinema 101 class? A good movie has at its roots an INTERESTING story! <br /> <br /> Here are some of the ridiculous messages in this film: If you have desperate financial problems, switch from Chicago to the center of the no-where in North Dakota to grow sunflowers (no kidding!). If your child has severe neurological problems due to a car accident, he goes from some of the best hospitals and speech therapists in the country to a small, isolated city, which, at best, has a community hospital. Hire a tramp to live and work with you, out of the blue, without consulting any reference, when you have a teenage daughter, a wife, and a child. (I'm glad they are not my parents!) <br /> <br /> A city where everyone knows he would have no problem missing a triple murder just outside the city. And, of course, blaming the man's madness for a bad Sunflowers harvest! (Anything else grows in North Dakota?) A couple of days after buying your dilapidated house - with huge vines everywhere - remember that Jack and the magic bean, an X-Files guy, Smoking Man, (I'm glad to see that the cigarettes did not take it, I suppose he did not inhale!) It will suddenly surprise you while you are working to bring you the selling price of your home, plus 15% more, absolutely for no reason! <br /> <br /> I think you have the photo. I saw so many horrible and horrible movies in the last month, it makes me think! Is it so hard to make a film that doesn't treat the audience like an idiot? I'm glad at least the crows in this sad film turn out to have a bit of a brain! I wish I could say the same for anyone who thinks they're going to make money with this piece of celluloid junk!
