I love watching steven seagal movies not because of the action of the big holes in the plot but just because it makes me laugh <br /> <br /> oh it makes me laugh so loud that this movie makes absolutely no sense and it's ridiculous compared to this movie Pearl harbor rocks !!! and Ben affleck doesn't need acting school just to give the impression of how ugly it is <br /> <br /> first of all there are so many jokes and bad acting that is getting worse like when steven is trying to get out of prison a helicopter lands at first the security warning and brought them to the ground when they suddenly fly away a guard starts firing <br /> or when he killed that guy in the car and he has them let's escape both on foot you can I see no oil on the ground behind him, he noted that there is oil without even looking at a cigarette lighter and the car explodes <br /> <br /> and there are a lot of other jokes that Steven uses his basic action when someone is pointing a gun at him he grabs him and totally shoots him a crap !!! as if a gangster ever made it happen. <br /> <br /> Acting is also much worse in the fight scene in the prison outdoors, you can see steven clearly waiting to go into action, just rewind it a couple of times you realize that bad acting <br /> <br /> makes me laugh, I hope that one day you arrive at the cinema, here in Holland, then I will go with as many friends as possible just to laugh out loud
