I love a good western movie, but this is more like watching a play or an act at the local carnival. I could only endure 38 minutes in the hope that it would improve, but it only got worse and I had to finish it. Each actor (s) has declared the lines as if they were reading directly from the script or cue cards. There was too much predictability for lines and actions, not as a natural event or conversation. Rachel Kimsey's wig was obvious. The actresses who played Native American sisters could have interpreted non-native parts and should have. The wardrobe for Native Americans could have been better and a little more authentic. If I decide to watch it with some friends in the future, I'll do it, not with the expectations of watching a good western, but with the expectations of watching a production of amateur comic films.
