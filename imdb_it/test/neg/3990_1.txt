Once again, the posters lied to me. <br /> <br /> The marketing of this film was deeply at odds with the content; 'explosive'? When I read the synopsis for this film, I expected to see a city full of grotesques, each jack-man of them bloodshot and swollen with alcohol, punctuated by heroin needles and folded in two with chronic masturbation; in a similar "lair of vice" would come the well-shaved hero who makes Gabriel shine. Instead, the film was the exact opposite of what I expected. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes of the film showed us that Middletown is a simple little place full of poor people who do the best they can, whether to fiddle a little to make ends meet, drink to forget the pain, or watch cockfights (chickens, not penises) to ward off boredom. In other words, the citizens were desperately normal. <br /> <br /> The only (deliberate?) Grotesque in the piece was Gabriel, the Presbyterian preacher celebrated by brainwashing interpreted by Macfadyen, whose face is constructed in such a way as to suggest a permanent air of bewildered fury . If I were gentle, I would suggest that the preacher's Paisleyite lyrics were a witty comment designed to make us despise Gabriel and his faith. Unfortunately, Brian Kirk is such an inept filmmaker that he quickly despises everyone in the film, leaving the audience to push their way through eighty more minutes of obscure, trivial boredom. My only break from this celluloid waste was a game of "guessing the accent" broken with "locating position" laps. Are we surprised that Gaybo ends up stealing his brother's son and suffocating his father? Obviously not; he is a preacher who beats the Bible and is therefore psychotic. All the citizens stand upset at the end of the film, but I suspect they just figured out what turkey put their names. <br /> <br /> The Northern Ireland Film and Television Commission has a budget to spend, but there are better projects than this weak company. The only nice thing I can say in favor of this film is that he managed to replace "Superman Returns" as the worst movie of 2006; a real success. <br /> <br /> v1: 20061114 v2: 20080107
