Larry Clark is not famous for his talents as a writer or director, but he has made some undeniably important films. The children, Bully and, to a lesser extent, Ken Park all achieve their purpose: shock, repulsion and even disgust. These films are intransigent in their content and use their controversial nature to expose very serious problems in modern youth. The children exposed us to the proliferation of A.I.D.S. and sexual promiscuity among young people. Bully touched on similar issues. Ken Park somehow dealt with sexual abuse and suburban ennui. Undoubtedly, all these films have exposed something horrible and left a bad taste in your mouth. <br /> <br /> Wassup Rockers is about a group of poor Hispanic skateboards from south central Las Angeles who arbitrarily go to Beverly Hills to skate. That's all. <br /> <br /> Wassup Rockers is nothing. <br /> <br /> It has no substance. It has an essentially non-existent narrative. And, like Kids, presents a cast of actors for the first time that they have been extracted from the setting of the film. However, unlike Kids, none of them have any semblance of talent. There's a better acting in porn. This film undoubtedly presents the most terrible performances I've ever seen in a film. You can respect Larry Clark in exposing these young people to the film production process, but these guys are absolutely worthy, folks. I might add that apparently these gentlemen have also produced the soundtrack, which features some of the most shocking garage punk you've ever heard, my advice is to blow up a couple of migraine pills before entering the theater, or you you will regret later. <br /> <br /> But then again, it's not like they had much of a script to work with. Every sentence that is pronounced is forced, pathetically delivered and irritating beyond all measure. The story itself is ridiculous. It starts fairly reasonably, but soon it slips quite unexpectedly into pure absurdity. This naturally begins with a whimsical sex scene with a pair of rich white girls, followed by a series of National Lampoonish clashes, characters who are killed for no reason, and which ultimately result in a ridiculous anti-climax. The shots go on much longer than necessary. Get ready to watch people fall off skateboards for about fifteen minutes in a row, prolonged and persistent shots of characters who do nothing or skateboarding on the streets. But then again, with the script at only 32 pages, they need the most useless filler possible. Perhaps Wassup Rockers would work better as a short film. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I could go on like this. This is the worst movie Larry Clark ever made. For those of you who are interested in seeing a Clark movie, if only for its shocking pederast surprises, look elsewhere. This is by far the most gentle film he has made, and it is also the worst. It's a horrible dish. Like, Uwe Boll is horrible. Definitely the worst I've seen at the festival. <br /> <br /> 1/10
