I was looking forward to seeing this movie, but when I finally got the chance, I was very disappointed. I had to stop halfway (or was it halfway?) Due to the bad script and direction. Not to mention the poor cast! Josh Hartnett is the only one who can act, and is much better suited to be the hero of history. <br /> <br /> Well, basically the story is about a loose girl from the country that betrayed her - time engaged just to have meaningless sex with a spoiled rich brat. This film failed to attract my sympathy, not even when the writer intended to do so. I wonder where moral values ​​go? <br /> <br /> The actors are so strict that when I shoot the movie (a few weeks after it was interrupted due to its boring nature), I couldn't get attention. The spoiled couple can only disgust me! What film! <br /> <br /> I think all the people involved in this production have to sit and review together so that they don't make the same mistakes next time. And next time they might consider Josh Hartnett as the protagonist ...
