I've always had this morbid curiosity when it comes to notoriously bad and unpopular films. I've always liked films that are so beautiful to do, you're looking at someone who actually enjoyed the recent films for kids like Catwoman and Thunderbirds (2004). <br /> <br /> So I saw this, and it turned out that all the critics are right about this. It's a MAJOR flop, but unlike many flops, it's not even fun at any level, not even to tease. It's just a boring party after another. <br /> <br /> I was warned. I didn't listen I'm a fool. <br /> <br /> Don't be silly, don't waste time and money on this pile of garbage.
