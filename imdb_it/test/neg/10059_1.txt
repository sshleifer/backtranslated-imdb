I've never seen so much talent and money used to produce something so bad in my life! As stated in other comments, a talent who's like Christopher Plummer, Faye Dunaway, Donald Sutherland and many others have been put together in a film that is not recognizable as an Agatha Christie story. I keep thinking about how it could be with the same cast, done the right way. <br /> <br /> The film has even less intimacy than Christopher Reeves's Superman films. The large cast makes smooth production even less effective than those films, because there is not enough time to get to know someone. Dave Brubeck's progressive jazz soundtrack asked me if the wrong video was in the case of the rental store. Music has become increasingly offensive as the plot progressed. It is difficult to say whether the soundtrack or the boring technique of repeating the information of the previous scenes was more offensive. From someone who has seen most of Christie's films (this is what attracted me to this, he was one of the few I had not seen) missing this. It's not an Agatha Christie movie. The Golan-Globus are more suited to producing large-scale wrestling films, rather than the intimate atmosphere of the English mystery.
