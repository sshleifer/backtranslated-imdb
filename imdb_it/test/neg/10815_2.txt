I can't help but forget that incredible scene in Alien, when the extraterrestrial exploded from one of the men's trunks. Or even in Predator, when the invisible monster slipped the bewildered soldiers and tore them to pieces. Both of these films have expressed fascinating ideas about the characteristic of run-of-the-mill creatures. She returned to the era of cheese B-movies and watched the great men in fake suits parade around killing people in small towns. Now I recognize that the two films above have revolutionized this genre. The Cave has nothing to improve on it. He doesn't feel anything new, and worst of all, The Cave doesn't even have good blood. Shame on you, shame on them all. <br /> <br /> The fun in sexy spandex are the one-dimensional characters of The Cave. All this seems not to worry when they witness the death of their colleagues. They just take a walk, without the knowledge of the evil creature hiding in the darkness. The plot is very easy to understand. So you have the two brothers, the black guy and the sexy scientist. The rest (for the rest I mean all those who encounter gruesome deaths) are even more exciting than the others. We have the Korean assistant, the dangerous girl outdoors, a Russian scientist and two divers, both lacking in emotion and stupid enough to wander around alone. This film is extremely clich√©, since everyone except the Negro, one of the brothers and the scientist meet an end. It also seems that only Americans can survive terror, since Russian and Korean die. Don't be offended if I put the details away. However, there is no real surprise. <br /> <br /> To be simple, find this cave. They go to the cave. They get stuck in the cave. They begin to die in the cave. One of them is infected in the cave. Others die in the cave. They come out of the cave; only to discover that one of them has a parasite that will turn them into a horrible monster, which actually doesn't seem to bother them. This is the simplicity of the lackluster texture. He doesn't even try to be original. He even has the part where he decides that their leader is not capable and splits. We have seen it this way many times before. <br /> <br /> I know in a film like this, people don't care about performances, but it's worth remembering how bad they were. Everyone is so depressing. Cole Hauser was particularly unsophisticated and did not teach me Eddie Cibrian, who is often much better. Morris Chestnut is undoubtedly the best thing about the film. His performance is actually decent. He plays the guy who calms everyone. All the other actors are average at best. In a show like this, it's not really a bad thing. <br /> <br /> Now for the reason why we go to this kind of film; action, of course. Well, to my regret, the action was boring. The death scenes are all boring, the whole movie was hell. There is almost no blood. Either they disappear and find themselves later or they are attacked and die without bruising. Seeing the death of the Korean man was the only exciting action I could find. <br /> <br /> It's quite surprising. The bad things about the shadow are the most things that are good. A good example is to say that the special effects were well done, what they were. The only thing wrong is that since everything takes place in a cave, it will be dark. I found it extremely difficult to distinguish between the walls of the cave and the monsters. So it was difficult enough to even see the creatures. Although I liked the special effects, there was nothing original about monsters. They all looked alike and weren't scary at all. <br /> <br /> The Cave marks the directorial debut of Bruce Hunt. I don't see what he's trying to accomplish doing this movie. He obviously made a huge mistake. Almost everything in this film smelled like a stinky bomb. A smelly bomb is probably even more enjoyable than watching this mess again. Only the most indulgent spectator will find this forgivable. I gave up all hope in the middle of the film when I heard the phrase "what the hell was that" for the third time.
