this film is basically a bad interpretation of the old urban legend of the baby-sitter who receives phone calls telling her to check the children, calls the police to trace the calls and finds them coming from inside the house. when a killer calls, he has such a simplistic story that a child could have written it. There is not much suspense, it becomes clear who the murderer is in the middle of the film. at the beginning, when the first victim is killed, it looks like a bondage fetish scene from a porn site or something. what's up with that the film is really a typical slasher dish with an original plot as much as a Beatles concert. even from the low slasher budget standards is poor. don't waste your time with this. said nuff
