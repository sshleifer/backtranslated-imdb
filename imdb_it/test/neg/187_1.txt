And I still don't know where the hell this movie is going? I really mean, what is this movie about? Is it to demonstrate Sean Connery's complete lack of Arabic? It is a question of showing that if he could play the role of a Moroccan warlord, it would have been natural to play Ramirez's role in the plateau? Why was Teddy Roosevelt also present in this film? Why was there so much sand that had been used so little? Where was there so much table slap? Why did Teddy ignore the Japanese guy he was shooting at with archery? Did he realize that the man was Japanese? Why was there no credible excuse given for Connery's accent? At least Jean Claude Van Damme has an excuse for his French accent, whether he is raised by the French nuns in Hong Kong (Double Impact), or raised in the bayou in Louisiana (Universal Soldier), whether he has a French mother and raised in Indochina (can't even remember the name of that movie)? Can anyone explain it?
