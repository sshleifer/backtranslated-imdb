I would give this movie a 1/10. This film has no common kinematic substance and focuses too much on the current "skin tendency" in Bollywood films. I definitely wouldn't recommend teenagers to watch this movie. What really makes me break down is how come a banner as impressive as Yash Chopra Films has ever yielded to such a horrible production? Perhaps they have forgotten to keep in mind that there is a wider audience than the "adult" public who, exposed to these gross films, can destroy their growing mind and succumb to things without meaning and recognition. > <br /> On the whole, the films must not only be fun, they must also make some sense. Of course, this film is a huge disappointment for the fans of Yash Chopra, especially myself. I'm really disappointed with the plot, the acting and everything else. Why can't people put in a substance that can be appreciated after having dealt with in the movies, at least once in the film? The point is clear. I'd like to put my opinion in brief: "Horrible - Disappointment - Lot of adult material - Lack of" sensible substance "- Lack of normal psyche - No value - Could take a croissant or chocolate for temptations"
