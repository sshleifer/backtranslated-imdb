I don't understand what the big hype of this film was. All the horror sites said that this film had all the essential elements of an "old American slasher" movie that would satisfy your needs. - Although this was similar to an old American slasher film, my needs were still not met. <br /> <br /> My big problem with this film is that we are now in 2000, not in the 1980s. The horror of 1980 has passed and should remain in the past. The horror films have changed so much that the older movies now seem shoddy and unrealistic. Although they are fun to watch, they do not offer the same realistic blood-thirsty blood that recent films offer. <br /> <br /> Hatchet is mischievous, unrealistic and terrible. If we wanted to watch an old American action movie, I could simply go back to the Friday 13th series, the Nightmare on Elm Street series, or the Halloween series. I have to admit that the film is better than some of the outgoing horror films, but it's among the worst. The jokes are not funny and the actors are horrible. <br /> <br /> Personally I would stay away from this movie and never look back.
