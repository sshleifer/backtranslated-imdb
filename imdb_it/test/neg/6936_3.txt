Eugene O'Neill's drama, lasting four and a half hours, arrived on the screen in less than two hours. The combination of symbolic dialogues and Gothic melodrama of the game has not aged very well and the cast has some difficulties, especially Nina by Norma Shearer and Marsden by Ralph Morgan. Clark Gable as Ned Darrell comes off better, but above all because his is a rude character not given to the philosophical reflections of others that best fits the Gable range. Once the plot adapts to the quadrilateral of love and the audience adapts to the off-screen voice, the film becomes more fun. The technique used here for aid is another problem. On stage the action stopped while the actors expressed their thoughts to the public. Here they are made as voiceovers. You would think it would work better, but since the action no longer freezes, the actors are forced to stop talking and grimace the camera to match the emotions in their thoughts. Furthermore, it is difficult for any movie fan to see this film and not think about the hilarious version of Groucho Marx's parody in "Animal Crackers". To these drawbacks are added some cuts made for reasons of censorship (Nina's promiscuity is sold in a soft way and there is no mention of her who gets the most central abortion in the drama) and a miserable score (uncredited) that sounds like a background music to a Pianto of the end of the century. O'Neill called this film "a tremendous hash of attempted condensation and idiotic censorship", and even if "Strange Interlude" is nowhere near as big as its next "Ice-Comed Man" and "The Journey of the Day long into the night ", certainly deserved better than this.
