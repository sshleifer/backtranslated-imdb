The whole set of this Disney family movie (ad-exec makes the teenage daughter a horse because "she wants one more than anything else in the world") is just an excuse to film the great horse show at the end. All the other ingredients (the advertising campaign for the stomach pill, Kurt Russell as a potential boyfriend for the young man, Lloyd Bochner as a potential rival for Dean Jones for Diane Baker's affections) are set aside towards the end simply to show the horse. More than half of the photo is padded, and worse: it is plaintive and hateful. The boy is the ninny guy who cries on the couch with a dog in his arms and makes his way as usual. * from ****
