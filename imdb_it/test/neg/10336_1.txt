I won't go into details about why this movie deserves a terrible evaluation, many other people have already done it. Suffice it to say that from the over 400 films I owned on DVD, this is the ONLY one I got rid of ... it was so useless that I could never see wanting to see ANYONE again. <br /> <br /> However, I have a comment on the incredibly high average rating of 2.9 (from 3 to 15-06). While flipping through the 4 pages of reviews I didn't see scores higher than 3 stars. Looking at the voting history, 78% of users rated the film as 4 stars or less. It seems to me that some people are filling the ballot boxes to keep this film off the "bottom 100" list of IMDb. It would be interesting to see how many of the 30 users who rated this film as 10 stars (none of whom wrote a movie review) are real active users. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled, this movie is not worth your time.
