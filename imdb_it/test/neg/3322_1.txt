I'm usually not inclined to write reviews on films that I don't think deserve mention. But, in my quest to grow as a writer and film critic, I feel it's important to express my thoughts when I don't like a movie. "Queen of the Damned" is one of those movies. <br /> <br /> The famous horror stories of Anne Rice from Lestat, a bisexual Vampire, first appeared on screen in 1994 in "An Interview With A Vampire". Played by two of the biggest Hollywood heavyweights in Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, the film's elegant aesthetic scene and mise en scene captured the audience. Although it may have been a case of style over substance, there was something about it that worked, despite its chessiness (I've never been so in love with the genus Vampire in general). <br /> <br /> Since that time Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise have done much bigger things. It is likely that both would be bursting out laughing when asked to appear in a sequel. They would have laughed even more when they saw the final result. "Queen of the Damned" characterizes the type of cr * hol Hollywood is content to spend at low cost with the hope of earning a quick penny thanks to an average soundtrack and a great marketing campaign aimed at young people aged 13 to 17 years. /> <br /> Needless to say, this film is terrible from the start. Lestat, now played by Briton Stuart Townsend of "Shooting Fish" fame, wakes up from his dark grave to the sound of ... you guessed it, Nu-Metal. He beats some confused punk musicians and joins their band, on condition that he appears only at night, with the sun burning his skin and all during the day ... Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), a student who studies the paranormal (Vampire Studies 101 maybe?), Try to find out if Lestat really is who he says he is. Along the way he falls for him (something to do with his strange past), but he has a small competition in Queen Akasha (Aaliyah), a queen of vampire demons who is returning from the underworld to acquire Lestat as the chosen king. > <br /> The film is shamefully self-indulgent, yet the campy tone leaves some room for its deprecatory humor. Anyone who sees this movie for anything other than a good laugh needs to see more movies in general! Watching Townsend is fun. He knows that the role is absolutely exaggerated and does his best to walk the tightrope between the total horsewoman and serious acting. The deceased Aaliyah is, unfortunately, terrible in the role of the protagonist. It has a minimum screen and what it does does not use it to the maximum. Bad makeup and special effects don't help; sometimes it seems that he is speaking through a voicebox. <br /> <br /> It is said that this film went straight to the video until Aaliya's untimely death last year. With the possibility for people to watch his final film, Warner Bros published it in a general version. Otherwise this would have been one of those movies you see on the video store shelf, but avoid it because you can say it will be just terrible. Without a doubt films like this will continue to be made. Watch the flow of teen-coms around or spoof that genre with films like "Not Another Teen Movie". If there is a market to be exploited, Hollywood will do it. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I have with this movie is not the movie itself. Hollywood makes money, so if there is a market for this film, they will pursue it. This is business. But what worries me most is that people will actively go to the cinema and pay to see it! I imagine this is the biggest topic in the world of cinema: first is the art of cinema and entertainment second, or is it the opposite? The only people who can decide which is the public. If you like them and are fascinated by good movies, stay away from this turkey.
