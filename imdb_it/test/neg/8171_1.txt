Two days ago I had the chance to see this film on Cable (TV-Asia). I have been very upset since then. The film "Baghban" has been very successful in portraying only one side of real life. It is very partial to parents. Have you ever thought of another side (children) ?? There are few parents in this world who just give birth to their children but do not give proper parental care. I'm a victim of that. Why do you (the parents) want to have 5 children in your life if you are just doing Rs 2000 a month? I was forced to work on the streets with my brothers. I have no idea how I managed to reach IIT from there. It's been a long time since then, but I still don't believe it. Now I'm a research scientist here in the United States. I have carefully taken care of my parents to bring home all the goods needed by my two brothers who are with them. They could not provide us with basic things when we were children. I find this film very resentful. It is very partial. It deeply hurt my feelings. I strongly urge the producer / director of this film to look at Indian society in other respects and make another film. I can be reached at john_simension@yahoo.com
