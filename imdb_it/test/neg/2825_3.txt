Well, the film starts well, but after half an hour it becomes boring and stupid, when the whole story is about Karen's pregnancy (was this the girl's name?) <br /> <br /> The end of the film is really trivial and the characters are really stupid. <br /> <br /> I don't know who is more stupid, if the girl came back with her old boyfriend or the boy for the way he was used for her. <br /> <br /> However my conclusion is this: certainly not the best comedy of the eighties, just another film like many others with nothing special, they could do better but they ruined everything, if only the plot had taken another way, but they keep that pregnancy and certainly ruin it, so the final conclusion: I don't like it.
