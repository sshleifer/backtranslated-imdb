First of all, let me tell you that after watching this movie I felt like I had sold an expanse of goods. Mind you, it is not the film's fault that IMDb listened to it as a first comedy and a second horror (although I don't know how it came in ... maybe some of the film crew defect inserted it). Being a fan of the horror / comedy genre, I checked it based on that and I'm like that, I'm sorry I did. Where to start? First of all, to remember my beginning, there is no comedy in this film. He tries once or twice, but never gets a laugh at best. My reaction was mainly to roll my eyes and ask myself why someone thought that such a tired material would be fun. Moreover, there is no horror here. It is not possible to find a second voltage. You think I'm exaggerating ... I'm not. No tension, very little blood, and not a lot of violence on the screen (sorry, but in a horror movie that cuts away just like good things start is a serious foul). Hell ... there's even zero nakedness. Call me a purist or a young man ... I prefer a horror film if it can't invent an original plot / premise. And the tired one like all devils "TV reality show went wrong"? It has been done before and much better. Like Wrong Turn 2 or ... ummm .... whatever the name of the movie with Edward Furlong was. Here's how bad this movie is. I don't even remember the name of that movie, but it was better than this. I also liked the only comment that claimed that the times for this were good because "the TV reality is taking over". Someone from the previous post with a time machine? You are making a fool of me? This thing is rubbish ... and not fun.
