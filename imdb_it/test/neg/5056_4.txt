The history teacher, Mrs. Tingle, seems to have it for student Leigh Ann Watson, who has the heart in making a scholarship for writing. He receives another low grade from Tingle, which does not help. When one of her classmates Luke steals the paper of the last history exams and inserts it into her bag, Mrs. Tingle finds it sticking out. She threatens the three that will go to the principal in this regard, but is not available. So before he reports it the next morning. Leigh, her friend Jo Lynn and Scott head to her place that night and try to convince her not to tell the principal. However due to Tingle's stubbornness, this is found to return to drastic measures to prevent this from ending. <br /> <br /> He was not a fan of this when I saw him for the first time, and after another vision, I am not yet one. The writer Kevin Williamson was in vogue after signing successful contemporary teen horror movies; "Scream (1996)", "I know what you did last summer (1997)", "Scream 2 (1997)" and "The Faculty (1998)". He was riding the success (also not to forget the television program "Dawson's Creek"), but this project would have been the final blow. The difference, compared to this item, was different from that of writing the script, he was also making his directorial debut. The strange thing, though, is that I found his direction competently, but material that he stormed without taste and tired. He seemed to be trapped in playing both a black comedy and a direct thriller, without letting it freeze. The script is cluttered with quick jokes, gags, banal banners and deceptive references to other films, but the problem is that it is too watered down with so many artificial developments and deaf moral currents that disturb the flow. The fractured script had to be stronger and more powerful, since it is a small-scale production that looks like watching a theater show because of its mostly limited sets. Try to play mind games with the characters, but these moments are there just to serve the poor progression of the story in a pool of stupidity and foolishness. The ending of the film takes the cake. Williamson's lucid direction is healthy, but above all in a pedestrian way and therefore lacks suspense and the rhythm, even with its tense environments, can really collapse. Eventually you feel it after the sign in half, and it shows how small the story is. The performances are quite tolerable, even if, if it weren't for the refined and refined interpretation of Helen Mirren, like Mrs. Tingle and exuberant Marisa Coughlan, we would have been stuck watching a foiled Katie Holmes. Barry Watson is modest in his part as a slacker and Molly Ringwald plays a minor role. The soundtrack contains enough energy, but I found it terribly exaggerated and shapeless in its choices. <br /> <br /> Watchable, but mechanical in the round.
