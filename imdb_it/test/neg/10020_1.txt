Sure, most of the slasher movies of the 1980s weren't worth the celluloid they were shot on, but this video nightmare could be <br /> <br /> the most boring product. <Br /> <br /> Six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping. Obviously, <br /> <br /> and you already know it, they start getting killed one by one by a mysterious stranger <br /> <br />. The climax is a hunky forest ranger trying to reach the teenagers in time before the last pretty girl becomes a buzzard <br /> <br /> John Carl Buechler, my boyfriend of the less favorite B movies, made the bad br /> <br /> makeup effects here. The cast features Carel Struycken from "The <br /> Witches of Eastwick" and the Addams family movies. Unfortunately, he does not appear until the end of the film, and is covered in the burning trick, making him unrecognizable. Steve Bond (someone <br /> <br /> remembers it?) He's here in an early role as a victim. <br /> <br /> Brown's direction, and his script, both smell like the <br /> <br /> presents brown bears left in the woods. He knows the movie with <br /> <br /> so many wilderness images, I thought I accidentally rented a special episode of Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. <br /> <br />. Most of the cast <br /> <br /> is around the fire and eats, then walks, and sits down and eats again <br /> <br />. The forester is involved in the strangest scene ever set in a slasher movie: he tells a joke about a wide-mouthed frog to a <br /> <br /> deer. Jackie Coogan, who must have forgotten that he once worked with the silent film legends, has two scenes, and is involved <br /> <br /> in the second strangest scene ever put into a slasher film: he and <br /> <br /> the hunky forest ranger have a conversation about cucumber and <br /> <br /> cheese sandwiches with oatmeal cream ... yes. <br /> <br /> there is not a minute of suspense here. The killer, a forest fire <br /> <br /> survived in search of a companion, observes the students from behind <br /> trees. We know it's the killer because the directors have nicknamed a sound effect at heart that serves to wake the viewer every few minutes. Skip this pile of pine sap and rent <br /> "Halloween" instead. <br /> <br /> This is classified (R) for physical violence, light armed violence, cold blood, <br /> <br /> some swear words, brief female nudity, mild sexual content, sexual references <br /> and drug abuse.
