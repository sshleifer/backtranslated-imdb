It was a lousy movie and miserably based on sublimated male fantasies. A pity that it was based in Texas, an otherwise excellent state. I would recommend this film to anyone and I hope it never came into my consciousness as I am so irritated now that I wasted my brain cells even paying the slightest attention to it.
