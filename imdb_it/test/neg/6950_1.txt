I have to prefigure this by saying that I love watching bad movies that are fun. This film offers 100%. It is without doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. It's full of random material rubbish in a city (people walking, traffic, skyline, etc.) that don't bind to anything. Then there are the "sex scenes" that are too long. These involve a lot of petting and frequent rubbing of stockings on the bodies of others. These are not absolutely erotic and are the closest thing to the horror you will find in this movie. This is especially true for the shower scene in which two of the so-called "barely legal" girls who could not be one day over age 40 spray each other with blood but there is also a crew member spraying blood from the outside while one of the girls continues to smile at him. No one had to memorize any lines for this film, if they don't read the cards clearly, they have a magazine in front of them that they keep watching as they struggle through uncomfortable dialogues. Then there is Mr. Creepo. It casts the name of Ed Wood as if it were somehow comparable, but it is very far from anything of that quality. Walk around a graveyard chatting about random things that went wrong in the movie, which really helps the complete lack of flow that the film had already had. We could not stop laughing during this film (except during the sex scenes in which we were disgusted and occasionally horrified) <br /> <br /> I give this film a 1/10 to go so beyond all my expectations for a horrible movie.
