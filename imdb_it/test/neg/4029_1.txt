This is such a lousy movie that I have no idea how it got on the shelves, they must have paid the movie store to get them there, seriously! The story makes absolutely no sense unless you are heavily drugged, you should definitely be on something to look at this piece of junk, so much that you wouldn't be interested in what was on TV because you're almost in a coma. Writing seems to be done by a 5-year-old child and acting is worse than school plays. The horrible special effects that they were trying to look so stupid, what they spent an entire $ 5 to make the whole movie look like that! Oh my God, that scene with the old woman who has a haircut from the 80s and the ugly girls in rubber clothes, my friends and I laughed so hard. Did anyone really think it was a good idea to turn it into a movie? I find it hard to believe!
