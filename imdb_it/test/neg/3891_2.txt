Beautiful music Beautiful photographs, some scenes are breathtaking and fascinating. But the dramatic tension is lost in a film that has been modified so badly that it is difficult to know what exactly is going on. Sometimes the dialogue is incomprehensible. Then there's Richard Gere. He should be a worker who gets into trouble and works on a farm. We see dozens of sweaty and filthy laborers in the scorching sun. Then we see Gere, who seems to have just come out of a Calvin Klein announcement. Sam Shepard, another charming boy, should be terminally ill. But it looks fantastic. Nice try, but it doesn't work. Brook Adams tries hard but gets lost in the scenario. The real star is the girl.
