There is a thin line between being theatrical and being simply forced. Forced Acting Forced Outlets. Forced Plot Also forced photography. There are people who say "the film develops this way because it comes from Asia", but I don't see any kind of forced elements on Seven Samurai or Sonatine. There is a thin line between being fiction (and every work of art is, in its own way, fiction) and being unlikely. In a more personal way, I don't feel anything with the film, it doesn't take me anywhere, and I can't believe in the imaginary world that is being proposed. It just doesn't seem right, there's something inside or it just doesn't click.
