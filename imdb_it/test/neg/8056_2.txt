I'm probably one of the few people who defends and even enjoys "Frisk", the project that put Todd Verow on the map, if it's really where he is. I appreciated the fact that someone had the courage to face Dennis Cooper and not get away from the material; Verow is doing pretty well. Judging by what he has done since then, it is suitable for that type of material and should probably stick to it. "Vacationland," an aspiring teen coming out movie, is so misleading in so many ways that it becomes an involuntary comedy, and I'm disappointed to have to bring it back. <br /> <br /> First of all, our hero, Senior High School "Joe" is far too old to play the role of 18. When we later meet a man who should be Joe's teacher, it's confusing, since the sweaty boy looks a lot younger than the student he is teaching. Joe's mother looks younger than him and doesn't "play" any more. Second, in Joe's opening scenes, he seemed to be playing, or actually experiencing, mental challenges. To his credit he improved with the film and I realized he was "playing young", but it didn't work, it was strange. <br /> <br /> 15 minutes have passed before everything is revealed about who, what and where these people are, and why we should worry. The second scene in the film is a business in a toilet for men that, considering where the story goes later, is absolutely superfluous; the subplot with the teacher doesn't go anywhere, not even as a "rite of passage" for our "young" hero ... a minute Joe is nervously trying his hand at the sex of the bathroom (a scene so little erotic that really makes you wonder what anyone in practice sees), the next minute he's an expert at sexual blackmail and violent crossbreeding. This is followed by an extended scene with the character we will later learn is "Andrew", and this affects everything we learn about him, apart from the fact that he is apparently gay but not yet out. <br /> <br /> It is very crowded in running time 1:44 (which is about 20 minutes too long - I can't imagine how it played with Joe's erased scenes going around the mind - numb and long and useless); a sub-plot denied by "Gods And Monsters" with an elderly patron who talks about rhetorical approaches without anything interpreted by an actor who obviously can't remember his lines (he is conveniently sent with a way in which Dickens could have invented a week slow); an almost four-way mix-n-match between the boys and their girlfriends, a gay tramp tramp, a wise wise essay in the form of a queen in the jungle (and he has no queen in suddenly taking over the role of the "prostitute" with the heart of gold "as the most tired type stereo?) that exists only to be degraded; blackmail, theft, murder, alcohol consumption and abuse of music software in loop for the recording of the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> What you will NOT find in this film are interiors that establish twists; we expect to imagine we are in an airport, a grocery store and a classroom, since all the scenes in these places consist of close-ups and poorly modified soundscapes to convey the idea of ​​premises that production should not have be able to afford. One thing they managed to get seems to be a real gay bar; or is the worst bar in the world or there are only about 5 gays in Bangor, Maine, as the bar never has any patron. Another good laugh came when the actors would have to scream for dance music that obviously didn't come from the speakers, but it was just part of the "score" hum. <br /> <br /> Plots and characters come and go, emotions are unreadable and the dialogue, clearly inspired by Dennis Cooper, is "film-talk", in the sense that no human being speaks this way. Since we are not given any information about these characters it is impossible to worry about what happens to them; it is as if Joe et alias appeared from the ether one day and could simply stop existing once the credits (surely the character of Joe's sister, an aspiring Jennifer Gray who is crazy about Bohemia, seems to simply "stop", we never know where he is in Los Angeles or what his problem is ... but still ... does it matter?). Visually the film looks very good sometimes, more a testimony of new developments in hi-def videos than anything else, suspect. The editing is rather clunky (there was a big change, Joe poses naked and says "I wanted to play sports, but ..." and we cut a blow revealing his "ass ..." ha ha). Sometimes even the composition is strange (I thought I was watching SCTV's "Persona" parody when the boys were talking together in bed and visually it seemed that their noses were glued together for the whole scene!). <br /> <br /> We feel that Verow is really holding back from making a "meaner" or a bit rougher film than he usually does, and maybe he shouldn't have restrained himself (foamy toothpaste / sexual fantasy worked well, I thought, even if the tone was in contact with the rest of the film) ... produces and directs this story of "coming ad age sensitive" very similar to Herschell Gordon Lewis directed films without gore ... sex movies without sex in them. I had some involuntary laughs and it wasn't boring, it wasn't even very nice.
