I had just finished reading the book and couldn't wait to see this television adaptation broadcast on the Hallmark Channel on Monday night (05/30/05). The key to the whole book was the poster that was stolen by the man with steel teeth, but I watched for an hour (about 3 1/2) and saw the man with the steel teeth , but I've never seen him steal a poster. I saw someone steal a virus but what did this have to do with the book? It's a pity because this film has great production values ​​and a good cast, but it's not the idea of ​​turning a book into a movie (TV or film) to convince people who read the book to be part of the public. They only kept me for an hour. I thought the premise of the book was great and what they did, but throw away the whole premise. This book had a great McGuffin (to paraphrase Hitchcock) but they ignored it. And he said in the headlines that Forsyth was involved in the production. Surely they must have paid a lot of money.
