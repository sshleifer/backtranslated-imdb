There is nothing original, human or perceptive in this film. The acting is average, the images are amateur, the writing lacks subtlety and the scenes are very simple ... something like a soap. <br /> <br /> In 2: 37, a suicide is used to transform the film into a suspenseful drama. Let's look, in part, because we want to know who dies. The various characters each have a problem and the film shows how dangerous each problem is for them, but only as a way to bring them each to a place where they think they could kill themselves. Despite the different points of view offered by the camera on key events, there is NEVER another way to see the events themselves. So in 2:37, assholes are assholes, angels are angels. This is simple stuff. <br /> <br /> Without this complexity, the film emerges as a voyeuristic story of sex and youth violence. You can hardly get to know children as much as the breasts, bodies and limping that the filmmaker transmits as characterization. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you know SOMETHING about the movie in the last 5 years, 2: 37 is just an immature rip-out of Elephant - not a meditation, not a progression. However, while the director and distributor use the alleged suicide of a friend on every occasion to give the film a certain legitimacy, they never talk about Gus Van Sant or Elephant. Positive posts on IMDb curiously avoid any mention of this, or simply do not value originality. If you want something with heart and voice, avoid this youthful exploitation. I was surprised by the age of the filmmakers when I discovered it after seeing this film - I thought a 13-year-old boy had made it. The Twenty Somethings I've always known are too busy trying to express something real in them to lift an old man's work.
