I remember seeing it in my local Blockbuster and I took it because I was curious. I liked movies about mythological creatures. I like werewolf movies, vampires, zombies, etc. This is based on the half-caste, a half-leopard-like creature that preaches the African people. <br /> <br /> The film is horrendous! The actors are terrible! There is no script whatsoever! It's all improvised! Everything is filmed at night because they say it's the only time you see it. It's obvious bull * beep *! They make movies at night to make it scary. But they couldn't scare me. After the first person was killed, I returned her to custody and brought her back to Blockbuster. One of the most boring movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Now you're probably saying that I don't have the right to review a movie if I haven't finished it. Well, this is one of the films that didn't deserve to be looked at completely. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10. This is really BAD!
