Yes, a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction. Now it's a prison again. Guy. Well, it's more like an airport mixed with a middle school, but there are a lot of kids running around in orange suits, so I guess that way it's like a prison. Not really though. When Sasha, the character of Steven Seagal, is admitted to prison, he is in chains and heads for a different line so he can talk to his friend, as if he were in line for security check at the airport. Then, before long, he and his friend are punching, smacking a pair of security guards. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something. Attack a correctional officer in a federal prison, they will shoot you on the spot. Ja Rule would have been killed about 30 times before launching his second punch. Oh, and there are guys wearing caps and bandanas and whatever. In prison. Federal prison. <br /> <br /> You can't dress like that in most high schools in America. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Ja Rule, I must say that the person who probably liked his performance more than anyone else on earth, including Ja Rule himself, must have been 50 Cent. Shortly before seeing this film I saw one of those TV shows on the biggest celebrity parties ever, and like the number 7 or 8 it was this rivalry between 50 Cent, who had lived the life of a criminal for real, and Ja rule. Who didn't. Every time I saw Ja Rule on the screen, the only thing I could imagine was 50 Cent laughing his ass. Ja Rule looks like a rowdy 9 year old every time he appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, back to the plot. It is funny. Sasha is an FBI agent who works undercover and agrees to be sentenced to prison for getting behind the criminal organization. He is sentenced to five years, and that old line between determination and stupidity vanishes instantly. Nothing else in the film matters later, it becomes a meaningless sequence of action sequences, most of which are not even well choreographed. <br /> <br /> Oh, what do you think, a helicopter crashes on the roof of "New Alcatraz" at some point, accidentally releasing all the inmates. And what do they do? Everyone ends up outside their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block. Without even a basket. They had a ball, but it doesn't matter. The scene is so stupid that they could even ring the bell. <br /> <br /> So a boy is convicted of being the first person to be executed in the execution chamber of Alcatraz's state of the art, evidently not to steal $ 200 million in gold, but not to say where it was hidden once it was captured. <br /> <br /> Hey, good idea, folks. If you can't get information from someone, kill them. It's a great way to learn the truth! So a gang breaks into the prison planning to stop the execution and get the $ 200 million position for themselves. <br /> <br /> Oh and $ 200 million are in gold. I doubt they thought before how difficult it would be to turn it into an interchangeable currency. <br /> <br /> There is also the problem of the prison director. He is a clever vato who thinks he is a barrio's hardcore chollo, which reminds me of a joke. I saw this comedian once he talked about people in California who spoke so forcefully calling each other, houses and all sorts of other nonsense. These people go to Mexico, the comedian says, and they say "Oh my God! The people LIVE there? That's how, a total shack!" <br /> <br /> The best is when the United States Supreme Court Justice arrives and this guy tells her that her men can't take their guns inside her prison, "I don't care if she's a justice of the United States Supreme Court! " <br /> <br /> This woman could crush him like a grape and think she's in charge. Has. <br /> <br /> And by the way, the Supreme Court that is taken as a hostage in the film tells the bad guy who is 53 years old. He is a year younger than Steven Seagal. I just thought it was fun. <br /> <br /> The only positive scene in the film is in the prison where Ja Rule is slapped in the prison like a bag of cotton balls by this little Asian woman. This was the funniest thing I've seen in a movie in a long, long time. <br /> <br /> You know, I work for the company that produced this film (which I saw because I did), and I still don't have a single positive thing to say about it, except, of course, for that scene with Ja Rule who is spanked by that Asian woman. <br /> <br /> So read my review of Malena and you see how sometimes I disagree with professional film critics like Roger Ebert, but in his review of this movie Ebert wrote something I was d agreement with anything else he has ever written: <br /> <br /> "I imagine the flywheels at the MPAA congratulate each other for a good day's work, as they voted PG-13" Half Past Dead "after giving away to the anti-gun movie "Bowling for Columbine" an R. "<br /> <br /> guys.
