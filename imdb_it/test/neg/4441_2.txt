The previous review is pretty much on target, that Altman was NOT with this movie. I haven't seen it since its original version, but I rarely spent two hours in a theater feeling as sad and unhappy as I was with this movie. If some pretentious community theater tried a sci-fi version of an Ingmar Bergman movie, it might come out like this. I can't give myself anything Altman made a "1" but this is probably the nadir of a career that has had some remarkable ups and downs. I would have gone out, but as a paid film critic I couldn't. (Think of that next time you envy film critics.)
