The use of the term "comedy" in relation to this documentary is an insult to the art of comedy, and worse still is the pain that is inflicted on the spectators of this production. Almost nothing was fun. <br /> <br /> This documentary followed a small group of standing comics as they traveled from city to city to perform in small clubs. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that their conversations and off-stage behavior and on stage are indistinguishable, but sadly, equally un-entertaining. <br /> <br /> It is possible to understand the self-delusions of grandeur that the "comedians" in the foreground possess, but it is more difficult to grasp the sounds of laughter heard by their audience. Perhas these are the same spectators for whom the comic blades on TV are intended. <br /> <br /> This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my over 50 years of watching the movie.
