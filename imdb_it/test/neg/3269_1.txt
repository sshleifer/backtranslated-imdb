I saw "Caddyshack II" when I was ten and I mostly laughed because of the horse scene. I should have understood that the film was as empty as ... I can't find a good comparison. It's stupid and not even very funny. The cast members of the original who chose not to act in this have probably made the best choices they have ever made in refusing this; why, oh why, the Chevy Chase is back ?! And how come Jackie Mason, Robert Stack, Dyan Cannon and Dan Aykroyd got involved in this hangover ?! I bet that every person who has had his name even remotely connected to this garbage (for example, the catering service) is ashamed beyond redemption. So all in all, it's beyond terrible, terrible, and all that. Avoid it as you would with the Ebola virus.
