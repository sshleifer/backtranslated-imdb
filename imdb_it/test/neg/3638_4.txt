I've seen this program a couple of times and the more we see, the less I like it. Jamie Lynn Spears has been contacted to do this due to the fact that she is Britney's sister and I am sorry to say that on the show it is obvious. They created the Zoey character to be all that people want to believe that Jamie Lynn is, intelligent, original, intelligent, pretty, popular, etc. The characters around her are there just to make her look better, becoming smarter than them, more popular than them, more sought after by boys and then by them. There is nothing original about this and it is paid with money, so every child there has the most beautiful fashions and things like that. I also have to say, for a 13-year-old girl (or anyway old, she can't be much older) she wears very mature clothes, those short skirts are too short, makes young people want to wear them, and all that makeup, this adds to the growing problems why girls get in so much trouble. The only thing I will say is that the credits are played by Jamie Lynn and, given his age, it is not bad at all, much better than his sister when it comes to vocal skills. Sorry, it's too mature and yet too low. It worked poorly with predictable plot lines and too many stereotypes.
