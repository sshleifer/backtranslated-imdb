Okay ... a few years later the classic "Network" by Chayefsky will be his real cinematic home run ..., but for now, this dark comedy is not the classic he aspires to. It's mostly terrible, even if it has some good scenes: the first victim of a murder found, the ER employee responsible for billing the patients who make a surprise discovery, the frenzied confessional of Drummond and the last scene in which the character of Scott regains his professional integrity and respect for himself. He also has some ridiculous scenes: the plaintive monologue of Scott's character during his first visit to the hospital psychiatrist, the character of Rig, the character of Rigg, the horrible aggression of Dysart in his short scenes and the R. the doctor pounces on the operating table to revive the wrong patient because "I already have a cause for negligence". <br /> <br /> Chayefsky also tries TOO HARD to launch every conceivable obstacle in this hospital (ie the murders, the error administration, the poor protesting outside, etc.). It may have worked better by looking at the industry as a whole. Acting-wise: Scott is passable, Rigg seems uncomfortable, Hughes is inspired, and Dysart continues to sing his short performance. The rest of the cast is TOO one-dimensional.
