Sorry, this was a whimpering excuse for a movie .. a plot so threatening to look like a block of Swiss cheese and a boulder of characters that seemed to me completely devoid of interpersonal relationships .. Well, except of course for Carlyle and Lee-Miller, that I could swear, he had to be in love. Unlike the union of Tyler and Miller who were for the most part, like the rest of the film, utterly unconvincing .. although the end product was engaging and enjoyable for all the wrong reasons, production values ​​were high and deserved a certain recognition ... but unfortunately the end result was rubbish..this was involved by everyone thinking ...? surely they should have packed up soon on this ..
