Everyone likes to see a really bad movie sooner or later. You look at it, have a good laugh and forget it for the next half hour. But this is not one of those. It's the worst thing that will appear before your eyes for a while. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see someone take on the responsibility of Dante: it's really the most stupid villain you can think of: a guy in leather pants who speaks with a voice and has a victory like Dracula of the 50s. How can anyone come with this guy ?? And the hero ... "The Dragon" or whatever ... my cereal box has better acting skills than he (maybe all of them), it's incredible. But the worst are the fighting scenes where you might think there might be something in it. They are so lame, it's beyond any kind of description. There is no shame, I can't really believe how this film was allowed by some studio. But I'm just thrilled. Watching this is a self-mutilating pleasure. See this only if you are looking for a movie for pain, and in this case, this is a sure winner.
