I found Super Troopers only slightly amused to the fullest (it seemed to me an inculturation of a glorified Police Academy), and I rented this film in the hope that it would be better. It wasn't. <br /> <br /> The writing is absolutely horrible and the rhythm of this film is even worse. It does not seem that all this happens in this film, or that it really gives us a reason to not care about any character. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays Felix is ​​totally uninspired, although probably due in part to the dialogue he had to work with. In short, this film has gone wrong in so many places. <br /> <br /> I have the impression that, from films like Clerks, independent filmmakers seem to think they can make films like this with long and bumpy dialogue scenes where the characters are trying to be funny. But, where the dialogue in Clerks pushes history forward, in this film, it weighs down irreparably. The films are supposed to have a good balance of action and dialogue, and although filmmakers are tempted to have a lively and fun dialogue, it doesn't always work. Especially if they are not so good at writing dialogues. I hate to say it, but even "Extreme Heist" was more interesting than this movie - and that movie was so low budget that it was filmed on video.
