The Evil Below VHS cover makes it look like a nice underwater horror movie. Unfortunately it is closer to a boring adventure movie and has no real horror elements. Start with some divers who get attacked and see some blood, but this is the only blood in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The Evil Below is not the worst around, but for a horror movie it is boringly boring. The acting is decent and, to be honest, the only thing that keeps you looking is the developing love story between the two protagonists. There are some nightmare sequences in which it seems like the director didn't know what to do. I handled everything to sit (almost) but I wouldn't recommend this movie to ANYONE. Horror fans might want a copy for the beautiful VHS cover, but it's best to leave it.
