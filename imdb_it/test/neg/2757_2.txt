This could have been much better than it turned out. Tom Pittman gives a good performance and some of the older actors do well with what they have to work with, but it doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the actors are too old to play in the higher students, particularly Howard Veit (Vince). It seems about thirty. Secondly, it is difficult to sympathize with poor Marv, especially since Betty is not that exciting to begin with. <br /> <br /> ******* Spoilers ****** The ending is so strange. It seems that the director intends to shoot Pittman's character, but there are no gunshots ... he has just knocked on the cement, where he lies there until the ambulance drivers take him and put him on a stretcher (a face down!). What were his injuries? A knee from the skin? Fool! Vince just shot his girlfriend without remorse, but simply pushes Marv to the ground and rushes in, despite the fact that he doesn't hide the fact that he hates the child. And to make the matter even more foolish, Marv asks the police to tell his father that he is sorry. (Duh! Hey Marv, you have just fallen to the ground, I think you will have many opportunities to tell your father you are sorry ... in person). And this writer did not receive an Oscar nomination? Skip, unless you can see it on MST.
