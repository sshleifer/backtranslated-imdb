I agree with most of the critics above. Furthermore, I was shocked by the presentation of the love scenes with the homosexual couple. Why? why while they - the director, the producers? - they had no obligation to present the different heterosexual couples in the most passionate embraces including nudity and super close-ups of French kisses and all sorts of nude contortions in bed, completely useless in their length and history, when it was time to show the same experiences with the homosexual couple, they only have the courage to go as far as a painfully heartbreaking embrace, almost between learned laughs, with two very nervous actors. So in reality, the creators of this film have discovered that homosexuality is UNNATURAL, as one of the characters in some scenes says. What a difference with Spanish cinema !! I remember being at the screening of an Almodovar film in an Italian cinema in Rome, and being completely amazed by the total lack of reactions from the Italian public, they were afraid of having a reaction !! when in Spain people fell from their place laughing at all the risky situations and the fabulous spirit and talent of Almodovar. Obviously in Italy there are dark forces in its history that prevent the free manifestation of some very normal and natural emotions. Pity. I must add that I was rather surprised to find that this same comment was censored by another correspondent. It is very ugly and dangerous when we cannot afford the narrowness of others to express our opinions on certain issues. Where is freedom of speech? I don't know if that censor will approve the changes I have been forced to make in this comment, and I hope he will not receive the same treatment from some other narrow-minded judge. Too bad yet.
