This was by far one of the worst movies Sandra Bullock played. Ben Affleck should stay behind the camera and continue writing scripts. This is definitely his forte and acting not. I actually lasted 54 minutes in this film before I was so bored that I felt obliged to leave the theater. It's a bit boring from the beginning up to a full 54 minutes in the movie. The premise of "Guess what happened to me on the way to ...." has been repeated several times. Somehow it doesn't seem like there is something fun or romantic about people betraying each other. Parents should be aware that this may not be a suitable film for your teenage children, especially the impressionable ones that could see Sandra as a hero. There is a scene where writers / producers / directors thought it would be nice to show how "acceptable" was to smoke a joint ... while driving ... and then have no consequences when caught. I am not an idiot and I smoked my share when I was younger, but I guarantee you that I will not take my children to see it and they are solid students A & B. If you want to see a good Sandra Bullock movie, rent "The Net" or "Hope Floats" which I believe are two of his best works.
