A stupid story of Underwood about a young man (Arquette) who convinces his friends that they should kidnap Frank Sinatra Jr. (Nicholas). The film is ridiculously written, the direction is strange, the dialogues are out of place and scrambled, the actors didn't do it much justice, Arquette is annoying everywhere, Ian Nicholas was non-existent, Macy was decent, but only because he is pretty good actor and probably just did his best not to get out of this project with an absolutely embarrassing performance, it was at least tolerable. This is a stupid movie in my eyes, boring at times, not funny, just a movie I wouldn't recommend to anyone. IMDb Rating: 5.5, my vote: 4/10
