This is presumably a story in which a GROWN MAN tells a story about his youth. Still, you see things like personal computers, e-mails, faxes, etc., which are objects used in the late 20th century and early 21st. <br /> <br /> So when this guy should tell this story - in 2020. Damn, I wonder how far we've advanced then. How about telling us. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, there are several legal issues that make no sense. In the scene of the hearing, the story falls into the usual examples of surprise evidence, which is inadmissible in any royal court in this country. Furthermore, the grandmother would have to miss at least seven years in most states before being officially declared dead. <br /> <br /> Congratulations Elmo Shropshire. You are now officially a SELLOUT.
