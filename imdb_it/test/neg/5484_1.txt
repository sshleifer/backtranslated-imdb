Remember when Rick Mercer was funny? 22 Minutes was a great show when Rick Mercer worked there and even Made in Canada was a great show. Talking To Americans was also such a fun special. But like my friend said, "Rick Mercer woke up one day and it wasn't fun anymore" I think that day was when Rick Mercer Report aired. What's the point of this show? Rick Mercer reads fancy and fake titles, shows images of bad sheds that people send by mail and then spends about 20 minutes of the 30-minute show going somewhere and only talks to people hoping to say something witty or smart enough go on TV and maybe even make someone somewhere laughs. We should be interested in seeing Rick Mercer visit a gym team and then try to do some of their moves, and then suck them on purpose trying desperately to be "funny". Rick Mercer has grown old or has just lost interest or just isn't fun anymore. Even his classic rant bits have lost all their bite and humor. Can you tell all this about the CBC comedy in general, also how many years have they attacked Air Farce on TV to offer the same kind of useless jokes?
