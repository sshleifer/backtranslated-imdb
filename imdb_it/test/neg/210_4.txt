One of those movies where there are no big twists and you can predict what is going to happen. Matt Dillon was fantastic again, but the rest didn't play a bigger role than they should. <br /> <br /> At first it was exciting, but a little slow and predictable in the end. movies where the good guy wins, it doesn't matter. If you have absolutely nothing to do, you can try it yourself. I personally didn't find it worthy to be seen. The story could have been more interesting and the director could have made it less a B-series movie by planning a happy ending.
