... what would a porn movie look like if I had taken sex and left the bad dialogue, bad sets and bad acting, you would have had Galaxina. <br /> <br /> This film came out when the original Star Wars showed that there was a market for science fiction. This in turn leads to some gems like Alien and a revitalized Star Trek. Unfortunately, it also led to some bad movies, and this was obviously one of them. (I say of course, because I had never heard of this film until a few days ago. I lost it when it was released in 1980.) <br /> <br /> Here's the basic problem. Dorothy Stratton could not act, so for most of the film they didn't even let her try. I understand that his tragic death gave this film an undeserved cult status, but for the life of me I can't understand why. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the film tried to parry Star Wars, Star Trek and Aliens, but clearly they don't understand that when doing something, it must be FUN! This film was not, or at least, the comical moment of jokes that could have been funny were not. Science Fiction is ripe for parody, as shown by the Spaceball and Galaxy Quest. This film, however, hurt him.
