I saw it in the independent cinema of my city - no surprise, because no mainstream theater would like its fingerprints on this wreck. <br /> <br /> The camera work is very annoying. Constant movement, focus and zoom could cause a sensitive person to have motion sickness. It looks more like a student film project than a serious film. <br /> <br /> Although well acted, the characters are unlikely. Josh is sneaky, always trying to manipulate situations and people to his advantage. Without any context for the relationship between Emily and Josh, she comes out as an insecure and whining girl who is desperate to get married. Rhett is an emotional child, unable to understand the complexities of human interaction. Without any ransom, I didn't care what happened to any of them. <br /> <br /> Obviously someone liked this movie, since the couple sitting behind me laughed hysterically. Sure, they could have made fun of him. I could hardly blame them for this.
