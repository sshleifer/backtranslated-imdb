It's probably a cultural thing --- somehow, the natives of this country have been conditioned to find these fun things. I experienced this phenomenon first hand, during an outdoor film event, in which this film was shown before the film. Most of the indigenous public laughed, and no, this was not in a hospital or clinic for retarded children, this was in a wealthy area, and the public consisted mainly of educated adults. <br /> <br /> So it must be possible, somehow, to find this fun, but honest kindness, I have no idea what it takes --- maybe it is in the air or in the water, a prolonged exposure which causes this condition. Something must cause it, of course, the only thing I can say is that I am quite sure of what does not cause it: the film itself. <br /> <br /> There are no lines. He's brain dead, stupid, nonsense, not funny, lame. It is, in short, a waste of time. Any Tom and Jerry is more fun, heck even funerals are more fun. <br /> <br /> In the event that you have been fortunate enough to have never seen any of the Stooges' performances: they are three boys who behave, run, speak like retarded children, who cause all kinds of dishonest chaos , without plot, without real purpose and without true conclusion. It's like the ugly Teletubbies without the nice costumes. <br /> <br /> Sitting in the crowd watching this garbage in this country can be quite exasperating, because you feel like you're at a party with a bunch of potheads and you're the only one who hasn't smoked nothing. <br /> <br /> So, unless you're ready to poison yourself to make it bearable, or come equipped with whatever it is that makes you think that watching three ugly old men act like idiots is fun, my advice on this is: Stay way. Far.
