Huge, undulating, grimaces of threatening "indigenous" tree trunks on a "Atoll of the Pacific" (with the suspicious air of Southern CA ...), which is making its way between revival and revenge. Unlike the stupid strains of "Navy VS The Night Monsters", the Tabonga is actually an adult tree. Well, grown up in 2 days: hatred is unaffected on those Miracle Grow spikes ... Anycow, it doesn't come from Hell, but from the grave of a false native, Kimo (Greg Palmer, "The zombies of Mora Tau"), murdered by native elders to go out with those horrible American scientists. Scientists include Dr. William Arnold (Tod Andrews, "Hang 'em High", "Under the Planet of the Apes") and Professor Clark (John McNamara, "The War of the Colossal Beast"). Rounding out the cast is Linda Watkins ("The Parent Trap") as the hateful Mrs. Kilgore, the obvious comic relief that releases an obvious "cockney" fake accent. A stellar cast indeed !! Anycow, because his carefree wife, Korey, played amateurishly by Suzanne Ridgeway ("Love's A-Poppin"), helps put it up, Kimo declares his revenge on her and all the elders. Then, the fantastic American scientists uproot the tree, bring it back to life "in the name of science", and allow it to walk slowly around the island, killing all those who have harmed it. Of course, we all know that evil monsters bring beautiful maidens, so Tabonga grabs the brave scientist Dr. Terry Mason (Tina Carver, "Hell on Frisco Bay") and leaves with her. Vine-ally, a good blow with a Remmington hits a knife lodged in the Tabonga, and falls dead in the quicksand. This ridiculous disbelief cowncept is one of the screams of all time. The Tabonga is undoubtedly the slowest monster in the history of moovie, right there with the rugged overcrowded robot of "Robot Monster vs the Aztec Mummy" and the perversely slow monster of "Creeping Terror". Try not to laugh as you watch Tabonga throw the false natives on the hills and in quicksand, dodge the spears and work slowly for "the island". The shady writing, the wooden exhibits and the corny direction make it clear that this fertile fertilizer is much more than a bite. This pile of wood chips was the last hurray for longtime director Dan Milner, who quickly disappeared in the deserved darkness of this film. You passed it through the vine from the MooCow: "From Hell It Came" is a compost classic !! : ??
