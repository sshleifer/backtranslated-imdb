This was a pathetic film. The alien was decent, but the film itself gave a new meaning to piety. The plot is something that has been done over and over again! However, this does the worst! The acting was c ** p, the scenes were often too dark to get what was happening. No one has developed any concerns about the main character. The film was too slow, and the crime scenes that were there were stupidly made and ended up looking no more interesting than the rest of the film. There are some movies that "suck" but can still be enjoyed because of total outrage, but this doesn't even have that !! Anyone who made this film thought they could do something good and failed miserably. There is nothing that this film has to offer but a headache. Avoid it!
