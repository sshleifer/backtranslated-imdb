The good news for IMDb is that this film was so bad that I had to register and comment. I should add here that I am a movie buff who rarely passes strict judgments. But sometimes a film is so poorly interpreted, ill-conceived, poorly written, with a plot so poor that it begs for criticism. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by all the claims of how superb, brilliant, dark and this film has been beautifully filmed. I can only conclude that the cast and crew are active posters here. The acting was extremely subtle. The rhythm of the film was distressing. I gave new possibilities at every turn (especially because I didn't want to feel like I was wasting a Saturday morning in New York), but with each new scene, it dragged on longer, offering characters I didn't care about, with which I couldn't connect, for which I could not empathize. <br /> <br /> When I see negative reviews on IMDb of small independent films like this, I sometimes wonder if the poster has a personal ax for grinding (something like that. He used to go out with the electrician, she he downloaded it, and now he's going to throw away everything he's ever worked on. But here, no. I don't know anyone who has worked on this film. And I wish it would have been great. But the film was not obscure (as some have mentioned) or depressing (as others have argued). . . those suggest that I connected to the film. . . No, Henry May Long was too long, empty and boring. <br /> <br /> This is the Tomas Take on this.
