This Spaghetti Western uses three main American actors who take away some of the typical aura of spaghetti. The plot is about an amnesty that the governor of New Mexico offers all available criminals to offer them the chance to start a new life. Usually this type of opportunity is limited to past events, but in this film it seems more like a license to kill because even new crimes (such as the threat to the governor) are forgiven. History is an endless chain of killings in which almost every character only aims to provide more carcasses. Only the few cables have resistance. Clay McCord is haunted by nightmares related to a childish event in which he obviously killed a lot of people. In the midst of eternal chaos this kind of reflection lacks credibility. Compared to similar films such as eg BANDIDOS none of the characters in this film was nice to me. <br /> <br /> In addition to the weak content aimed at certain customers, this film is well shot, the sets are somewhat detailed and the acting is average. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
