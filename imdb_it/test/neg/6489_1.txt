the real plot ... <br /> <br /> A group of post-war prostitutes are looking for alternative accommodation in FORTE BOOM. Lacy Everett and a dense family of call girls have eaten expired sausages for days and plan to move to the former Fort McMillian. Locals warn women to eat more dated sausages. Because there is a fierce pyromaniac in the area and refuses to take them to the property. When they finally arrive at their destination, they discover that their stomachs are full of gas after the bad sausage. It is not long before they learn why their new home is called FORT BOOM.
