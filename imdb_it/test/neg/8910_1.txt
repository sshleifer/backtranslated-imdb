Really? It is necessary? How can anyone make a film like that? Disgusting!!! Seteven Seagal with funny hair and fat like an elephant. Stunts all the time, automotive persecutions with an annoying soundtrack. Not to mention the ending. Completely meaningless with the presence of the child. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal wants to be Robin Hood !!! Well, at first a soothsayer answers something, nobody asked. Seagal's wife has nightmares and she can see the future. They are joking. Steven Segal faints after a car persecution, and I know he can't act. It was terrible. Nothing can save that movie. <br /> <br /> I've lost 90 minutes of my life! I'll see you
