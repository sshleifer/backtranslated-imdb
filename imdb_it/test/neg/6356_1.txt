My first question, NOT about the horrible acting, NOT the horrendous writing, is the direction. The choices that have been made about cinematography are some of the worst decisions I've ever seen. Why does EVERY bad individual have to die in slow motion? I was about to hit me with a rubber tube. Camera shots do it so you can't see what's going on. I was about to turn the film off because of Jalal Merhi's accent when he arrived at the sex scene, so I thought it might be better, well, that's not it. If you evaluate special effects on an A, B, C rating scale, should I put it around a W or so, and did I mention acting? Wow, it was bad !!! And the WORST part of the whole "Expecting to die" experience is the blatant abuse of the phrase on the cover, which is: "THE MATRIX JUST GOT DEADLIER". comparing this film to the Matrix is ​​easily the worst comparison I've ever seen. If you haven't seen this movie, don't do it, unless you're looking for a good reason to hit your head against the wall.
