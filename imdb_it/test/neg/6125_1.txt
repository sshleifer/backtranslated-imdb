The French produce pro-Marxist films or anti-Marxist films - with a few in between. "Merci pour le chocolat" is the last of its kind. From the opening credits that tell the viewer what music will be played and from whom it is composed who knows that you will be enchanted in the middle class claim. It is a film of an old man with over 40 years more people. It is also directed by an old man with an old crew who has nothing to say about the life of the spectator. The plot is not only trivial but absurd. How many films reveal the plot through dialogue only to repeat the same message via flashback about five minutes later?

One eloquent line of the film is when Rodolphe Pauly tells Anna Mouglalis that he doesn't need to close his car while in the resort! Oh my dear. <br /> <br /> On the DVD, Miss Huppert makes a comment on how to shed a false tear for a scene. Smiling he says: "As they do in America's Actor's Studio!" I think Miss Huppert and the rest of the cast could learn well from Actor's Studio. <br /> <br /> If there is a statement that stands out in my mind, it is when Huppert observes "we are having friends for the weekend and all the servants are away." not to be associated with such a scary movie. <br /> <br /> Medical safety note. In the film they show a hot water burn that is covered with ointment and a bandage. This should never be done. cold water. <br /> <br /> Less than 10 brands.
