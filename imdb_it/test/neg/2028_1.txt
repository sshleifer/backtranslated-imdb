The wind. Easily one of the worst movies ever made. The only good that comes from this kind of useless bravado, is the fact that seeing the distribution of films like this causes horror film directors like me to be confident that my next film will also make the cut. I mean, if this is indy's horror market, I could make a fortune by registering myself to bring the garbage for 83 minutes. <br /> <br /> A complete list of what this film lacks would take too long to write. But the highlites are: no history, terrible acting, terrible cinematography and virtually no change. The last one bothered me more. As a publisher, this movie drove me crazy completely because it had almost no editing. Each scene was shot in a master. They had absolutely no cover. For those who don't know ... the "cover" is shooting a scene from multiple angles to have cutting options during the edits to make the visual experience desirable. Yes, this film had none of this. I'm also talking about the simplest scenes. Example: a normal conversation scene between two people sitting at a table normally begins with a teacher who determines who is in the scene and where he is. Then, as the conversation continues, you would cut back and forth over-the-shoulder shots as the conversation continues. You can also throw a shot or two of something on the table or in someone's hand. Nothing. This is "Film 101", kids stuff. It seems that these people have no idea how films work. Every hit was a camera lock. No movement, no cutting, nothing at all. If I was teaching a film class, this would be the visual aid for my "What not to do" lesson. <br /> <br /> In closing, don't waste your time. The only surprising thing about this film is that it has never marked distribution. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
