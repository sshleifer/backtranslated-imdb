This is a real stinker. <br /> <br /> The story does not match most of the other episodes of TZ. It's pretty boring, even if seeing Peter Falk invented as a Fidel Castro lookalike is a bit funny. <br /> <br /> Whenever Twilight Zone is broadcast at an unplanned hour in my hometown, I'd take a sandwich and a drink and settle in for some quality entertainment. 9 times out of 10, THIS episode is over! Strange thing? This often happens to my mother (another TZ fan like me). There have been so many times that one of us would have said to the other: "I was ready to see _The twilight zone_ and guess which episode the Cuban dictator was in!" Obviously some people like this episode, since it gets a score of 6.7 ... as it happened, I have no idea - but THIS in and of itself would make a nice Twilight Zone plot!
