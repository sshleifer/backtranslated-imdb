This film is more or less the cannibal holocaust. If it hadn't been for the useless killing of animals in the name of "shock" ("Ooh look at us, we're hardcore, we added real death to our films") these films would have made their way onto my dusty classic shelves - I'm a great fan of cannibal movies and zombies. But as it is, it is another example of horror shock that clings to the last drops of the pile in a desperate effort to make a poor movie generate more fanfare. To sum up, a chronic stroke of blood with limited charm. A gore fan from the 70s should give it a try, but anyone with modern ethics and tastes should choose something a little better written for their popcorn party.
