OK end of story is - all the killings were a joke on the main character and no one is actually dead. Yes, I know that Cry Wolf did it and did it well, but this is not "Cry Wolf", it's "Scream Crap"! Even if the "characters" apparently do not die, we see them being stabbed to death (and in other ways they are killed) even if these "kills" do NOT occur as anyone can see them. Mr. Director, if you want to kill people, someone has to see it, if they are off-screen and the character who pretends to be killed is just not working - and until the end I liked a couple of scenes but your end ruined it all. <br /> <br /> The acting is horrible (especially the guy at the beginning who really thinks he tricked his friends into thinking they were playing with his dead grandmother's brain) the script is less than half-cooked (even if you are half cooked you might like the movie) the only reason I gave this movie to 3 is because a) they did something b) they released it and c) they shot on film Yes, read right, they wasted (at least ) $ 5,000 in movies for this shit. Sad, if they shot DV they had some money for a better cast and another writer to go through the script and make it good. <br /> <br /> I admire the fact that the director did something (as most do not), but HATWE the fact that it comes on IMDFB talking about how "original" the film is. <br /> <br /> Avoid the movie if it means buying it to see, if a friend has it, it could be a fun movie to borrow.
