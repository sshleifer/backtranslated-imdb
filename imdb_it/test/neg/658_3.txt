Compared to the recent Gore Flick HOSTEL, this film reminded me a lot ... I would say that See No Evil is slightly better but not by much. The very complex plot involves a handful of criminals who are sent to clean up a dilapidated hotel for a shorter sentence. The children will soon end up being killed by a religious psychopathic bum who is purifying them from their sins (I suppose). The only thing I feared most before seeing this was the fact that he watched a WWE wrestler, Kane. He ended up doing a decent job considering he only had 2 lines of a single word in the film. There are a couple of pretty gory moments, mainly involving eye-gouging and a fairly memorable scene in which a girl receives a cellphone stuck in her throat - probably the most effective disappearance of the film. <br /> <br /> Can we say that this film really shows us something new and is definitely anything but exceptional. I can't recommend it.
