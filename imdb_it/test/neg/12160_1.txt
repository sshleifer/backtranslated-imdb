I saw this movie today. Very disappointed and wondered how he could be in the shortlist. The saddest things are: <br /> <br /> 1. It's very slow. <br /> <br /> 2. How can Ghengis-khan, the cruel and powerful emperor of Asia be played by a kind, good actor with warm and lovely eyes - throughout the movie except for one scene? <br /> <br /> 3. A lot of holes in the plot: there is nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spends 20 years between his childhood and his mature age. We see a former slave with no money, power, friends or home. Click! - the next moment he is driving the huge army, with no reason to be a leader. <br /> <br /> 4. The magic of Ghengis-khan arises kindly explained only by the help of a wolf / god / whoever he was. <br /> <br /> 5. Can a man make love with his wife like that after seeing her for years? <br /> <br /> 6. Is it enough to win the fight with the sword if you are riding your horse through enemy lines, sitting there with two swords and everyone around you dies? Does Ridley Scott know this way? <br /> <br /> 7. Why doesn't Khan's mother look older after 20-30 years? <br /> <br /> 8. What is the motivation for the main character? (Nobody, literally.) <br /> <br /> Don't waste time. Really. The work of filmmakers is good; nature is exceptional - but the film cannot be made without a director and script. The real Ghengis-khan will execute the director in a second. <br /> <br /> Best regards
