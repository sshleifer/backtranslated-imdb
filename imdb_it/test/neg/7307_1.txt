Truly a great leap forward in the perfection of painful cinema. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is ugly. Act (if it can be called that), lighting, sound, script (if there is one), editing, direction, work with the camera, it's all atrocious. There is not a single element that is done well. If I thought it was intentional, I could give the film some credit, but I can't believe people were preparing to make such a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> This film deserves to be bought and projected onto your worst enemies.
