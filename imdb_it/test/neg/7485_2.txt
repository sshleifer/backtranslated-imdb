Jon Good's Wife (simply one of the worst titles for a movie ever), or The Red Right Hand (another absolutely horrible title that means nothing and has no relevance to the film) under which I saw it, is set in 'Salem, Massachusettes 1978' (incidentally the year I was born, perhaps the best thing that happens in those 365 days) where five old college friends meet for a school meeting, Roger Mather (John Kuntz) is the nickname true? Just say it out loud ...), Martha Alden (Kim Brockington), Rebecca Lawson (Jenna Stern) and her boyfriend Jake Stabler (John Doe), Alan Hobbes (Michael Kevin Walker) and his wife Sandy (Megan Rawa) more John Good (Marc Ardito, why is the spelling of "John" different in the title?) And his wife Sara (Abigail Morgan). From the word go there is a restless tension in the air and when someone mentions their 'missing' friend Calef (Jason Winther), many unpleasant memories are flooded again. Then come the phone calls, the mysterious nose bleeds, the hallucinations and the guilt as the real horror of the events of all those years ago finally comes to light ... <br /> <br /> Product, produced and directed by Kurt Gioscia also who wrote it and Kurt St. Thomas who was credited with the artistic direction, and if that wasn't enough, they both act in the film! I personally thought that Jon Good's wife was horrible, I mean he can't cook or anything! Ha ha ha, just kidding! Seriously, though, I didn't think much of the film in general, to begin with it is a bit slow and all the first 30 minutes are a solid snooze material for the meeting which consists of a lot of bounces between them and an exhibition of boring character. The film can never be explained by itself, with those strange purges from the nose for God's sake, the mysterious phone calls, the almost irrelevant death of one of the groups that could or might not be natural and what the hell was Sara? She runs into a nosy, crazy sex, dirty dirty word, shameless, bitter blackmail, all whore who looks like she sleeps with almost every man she meets! Some of the dialogues that she pronounces would not be out of place in porn and seem totally at odds with the rest of the film, which looks more like a drama than the horror / thriller that was supposed to be. Then there is the ending, if there is a worse way to finish a film, then literally leave everything hanging in the air without any closure I have yet to see. The whole thing was very predictable, I mean whoever is looking at this not knowing that when everyone mentions that their friend Calef went "missing" there would be no more? <br /> <br /> Directors Gioscia And Thomas makes an exasperating film, in addition to the predictability and annoying climax there is a retrospective narrative of Alan that I simply don't understand as it has no more or less meaning than anyone else and in which is he the time to tell from? The reasons for this narrative are never clarified or elaborated. There is no tension because everything is so from the numbers. <br /> <br /> Technically the film is OK but nothing special and some of the places and clothes didn't seem particularly authentic, this never convinced me it was taking place at the end of the 70s. Did acting go well and what about actor John Kuntz's surname? I suppose if his wife was standing next to him we could describe them as a pair of Kuntz, right ?! <br /> <br /> I didn't really think much about Jon Good's Wife (an inflatable doll would have been better! Ha ha ha) and I'm not sure who might like it. Forget any gore, horror, violence, fear, atmosphere or excitement, forget everything that would have made this film watchable because it is not here. Not recommended.
