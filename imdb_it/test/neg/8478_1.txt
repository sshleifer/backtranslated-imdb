- Because the weak excuse for a story in the general waste of time involves a guy who wants to be an animator but can't get his career off the ground. His super hot wife is more successful and does not seem to care that he is a loser, but the man is not satisfied and wants to do more from his life. One day their dog brings them a magical mask that changes his life. Unfortunately for him, the god Loki is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man in the mask, he tries to recover it and this is the whole story. If that sounded exciting to you, then someone needs to throw you some water to wake you up <br /> <br /> - This movie is terrible. There really is no other way for me to say it and I can't do it enough. The only positive thing about the whole thing was the woman who played Jamie Kennedy's wife who was sexy, but apart from her there is nothing in this movie that is worth watching. I know it is meant for children and this is why it is so idiotic, but what about the adults who have to take their children to look at this garbage. Because we have to suffer through this vile vomit lot of horrible crap. The original mask was a great film that had a great mix of comedies and great stories. This is a lame attempt by the masters of the cinema to cash in the franchise and judging from the laughable gross BO I believe that the franchise will not last longer. <br /> <br /> - The filmmaker must be severely beaten because the sugary colors of the film will make you feel sick. If there was music, I didn't pay attention because I had already pierced my eardrums to prevent me from hearing the horrible dialogue. Then there is acting or at least what passes for acting today. you could watch a commercial and see a much better acting than this movie, but I can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors had to make another king ** take. If the new line is trying to start a franchise with this, then they need to play their game by hiring writers who can actually write and stop thinking that the public will look at any crap that comes out <br /> <br /> - Line of the bass if you are a sadomasochist and you love to torture yourself, so please check this because it is painful to watch, but if you are not and in reality you like watching movies that are good avoid at all costs
