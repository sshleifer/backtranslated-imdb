I think I can say with certainty (without really giving anything) that this film did not contain robots. The boys in the "robot" costumes do not act or speak as such, and the evil entity behind the whole "plot" is not even a robot. <br /> <br /> The whole thing seems to have been filmed in a city park somewhere, with the photos dropped in the background when the director needed a custom set. I can't even use words to describe acting ... <br /> <br /> This couldn't even offer the hilarious ending of "Star Crystal". In short, it is clearly one of the worst science fiction films of the 80s and I would be so bold to say "of all time".
