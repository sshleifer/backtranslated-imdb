INFERNO begins with a rather impressive effect for a TVcape starscape effect. We are also presented to a scientist named Heller. You do not understand? Heller, Hell-er, Hell. So I guess someone in production had a little intelligence. However it becomes more and more obvious as the TVM progresses that intelligence has been discarded along the whole plot to attract an American TVM audience <br /> <br /> The plot itself is overwhelmed by sub-themes characterized by a huge number of TVM characters like the hard liberal school teacher who is trying to save a boy from a life of crime, the doctor who lost his medical license and so on. In fact the story focuses much more on these characters than on the disaster that is approaching and that all the potential tensions and dramas that the scenario could have soon had gone up in smoke, and being a TVM we only know that there will be no fine downbeat <br /> <br /> There is a problem on the screen that I noticed and that every time there is an explosion there is a huge fireball that seems ridiculous not to mention physically impossible. Watch the scene where the national guard fights a gang. A soldier fires a grenade into a tower block and the whole building explodes into a fireball. What can a small greanade do that contains no more than a couple of ounces of explosives? No, it can't. There is also another scene of army engineers blowing up a dam with plastic explosives and you see the same fireball effect. The directors may note that the high explosive is not the same as napalm <br /> <br /> Having said that I found HELL highly watchable for a TVM and at no time did I find myself wanting to switch it off. It had some potential and let me repeat the special effects are pretty good considering the budget and it's not so bad a TVM as some people are doing outside
