"Solomon and Sheba" was the kind of movie you had to go to see in the late 1950s when I was a kid: an epic biblical show featuring famous artists, unusual costumes, many extras and battle sequences. So I went to see it; but I remember that at that time "Solomon and Sheba" did not impress me at all, and it was a strange thing since I appreciated "The Ten Commandments", "Quo Vadis", "Helen of Troy" and others. The point is that when you are a child you neglect things in images that adults don't do (bad acting, for example) and you're easier to please with warriors in their armor, battles, sword fights and actions, so if you're yours not hit so something is wrong with a product of this kind. <br /> <br /> Although this film has some of these characteristics, it is certainly standard and medium. The wooden performance of Yul Brynner as the Jewish king does not even light up when Gucci Lollobrigida, voluptuous and half-naked, dances around him provocatively. She is better and makes acting acceptable. George Sanders does not seem interested in what he is doing, and Marisa Pavan (Pier Angeli's twin sister) does not add at all a sort of Brynner consciousness. <br /> <br /> The last sword fight between Brynner and Sanders is only for the plot and lacks interest and intensity (he had to film, that's all). <br /> <br /> Not a good farewell for director King Vidor, Solomon and Sheba will probably be remembered as the last unfinished Ty Power image.
