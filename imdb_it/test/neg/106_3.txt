Dr Stephens (Michael Harvey) runs an asylum. He has a different approach than the crazy one. Conducts unorthodox treatment methods. He treats everyone like a family, there are no locks on the patient's doors and he lets some of the prisoners carry their twisted fantasies. Let Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin) dress and act like a soldier and Harriet (Camilla Carr) is a mother of a doll, even leaving her in bed in a cot. Dr. Stevens is out letting Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross) cut a log with an ax, turns out to be a bad move, given that once Dr. Stevens returned, the judge planted the ax in his shoulder. Shortly afterwards, Nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the Sanatorium after organizing an interview with Dr. Stevens about a possible job. She is welcomed by the head nurse, Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick as Anne McAdams) and is offered a trail position. You get to know and become well-liked among patients. However things eventually start to get sour, phone lines are cut off, an old lady named Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) has her tongue cut off and starts feeling a strange feeling that things just aren't right somehow. Then, one night all the secrets of the dark Sanitary are revealed violently. Produced and directed by S.f. Brownrigg has a great central idea that turns into an interesting ending, but in the end it's kind of a task to sit down because of his limited budget restrictions and a rather slow script by Tim Pope. There are too many long and boring lengths of dialogue from prisoners, not much until the last twenty minutes. The film has no real visual quality as it is set entirely in the Sanitarium and is a terrain that is basically just a big bland house in the middle of nowhere. There is nothing gum, a few drops of blood here and there and this is a lot. There is a bit of nudity, but I don't really like it. The acting is pretty strong, especially Holotik and Weenick. Photography is flat and unexciting and I can't even remember what music was like. The finish is fantastic, but it takes too long to get there. A film that had great potential that was probably held back by its budget. OK, I think, but I think it would have worked a lot better if the story had been transformed in half an hour in the episode "Tales form the Crypt".
