Roll up! Roll up! It's Big Gay Bruce and his Big Death Death Cannon! Plausible plot? Unnecessary! Decent acting? Unnecessary! Respect shown to his powerful ancestor? Unnecessary! Yes, it's another turkey offensively stuffed in Butch Bruce's canco. <br /> <br /> I mean where do you start with this movie? Okay, let's start with the sad misunderstanding that people might have that this was somehow related to the original book or movie, Jackal's Day. It is not. In fact it is so different (and so bad) that Fredrick Forsyth asked to have the name removed. Now I'm not necessarily a closed Englishman who can't hack the remake of British films. Well, okay, maybe I'm a bit like that, but fortunately it's a redundant point in this case. This film is so different from the original that the name and the strange reference are the only things that survive. <br /> <br /> Now let's move on to the premise. Cheesy The Russian gangster is killed in a Moscow police raid (somehow it involves the FBI even though no one bother to explain why). In revenge, the gangster's brother decides to take revenge by killing the wife of the president of the United States (although again nobody bothered to explain why this is a good move, although to be honest it was pre-9-11, so it wasn't To know that it would have caused the carpet bombing of US aviation in Eastern Europe). The gangster takes on the "bad" killer (Willis). The police hire "soft" assassins (Gere), "murderers" killer "bad" murder traces. Police officer and is periodically killed. The "tender" killer kills the "bad" murderer. The First Lady is saved and we all realize that the IRA is just a group of really sweet guys, you know, that happens to want to kill innocent people. Put. <br /> <br /> Let's put aside the unwelcome Hollywood habit of playing in the troubles of Northern Ireland as if it were a sand pit in a theme park (I deal more with this in message boards). If Hollywood directors want to launch Belfast butchers as prostitutes with hearts of gold, it's up to them. I, of course, reserve the right to despise them for this. It is a free country. <br /> <br /> More egregious, however, is the fact that the film manages to protect and insult the Irish while trying to support them. It is not politically disgusting, it is much worse: it is incompetent. No wonder, for example, that Gere is still so beautiful, since he slept for all six months necessary to make this piece of cra * p. The fact that Gere's accent is not just Irish from the south, but a frightening parody of southern Ireland shows that the filmmakers weren't looking far beyond America to make money with this film. Then there's that adorable scene at the end, where Sidney Poitier (a complete loss of space in this film) says he's out for a coffee, offers to get our "cuddly" IRA man, then casually says "Ah, but then you guys drink Guinness, not you. " Yes, it's true Sidney; the Irish live on Guinness and potatoes. <br /> <br /> While we are on the subject of Poitier: why? In the original film, the detective is the tracker. In Jackal, Gere is the tracker. So what does Poitier do? Well, it crashes and looks like a tw * obviously. He has absolutely nothing to do besides call the marines in the end, and he does it only because the nice man of the IRA tells him. <br /> <br /> While we are on the subject of Gere: why? I suppose it's only a matter of time before Hollywood remakes Gandhi with Vin Diesel who plays the former Mujahideen Commando Mahatma Gandhi who decapitates his way through the 40s and 50s of India (after all, it's a bit dark by color and therefore very likely to be a fundamentalist Muslim). Let's not forget that the character of Gere is a killer and therefore a bad job. And if it isn't, why do you know the jackal? If it isn't, why do you know all its moves? And if it is, why is it such a soft cookie and such a "lovable" person? <br /> <br /> All this shows that the creators of this film cannot be bothered to (a) think about the plot (b) have the characters who make decisions that are in harmony with their character (c) avoid the cheese stereotypes how to have the big bad boss kill his friend ?? I honestly thought that this had become a James Bond movie (d) giving the "central" characters something to do (and) give credit to the public with a minimum of intelligence. <br /> <br /> This film is an insult to the British and Irish killed by terrorists, it is an insult to the Irish people, it is not an exceptional insult, but a good movie that tears and an insult to intelligence. But most of all ?? and the most unforgivable ?? it's an insult to my a * rse for having to sit through the over two hours of execution time it took to finish. Honestly, you would think without plot, without characters and without dialogue, it would have ended in no time. But they didn't even have the decency to quit soon.
