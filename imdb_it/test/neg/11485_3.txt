'The Shining' is endowed with visual intelligence and iconic performance by Jack Nicholson. However, Ausentes has none of these things; even if he borrows from his classical ancestor; for example, a man who climbed over a door and a woman who ran screaming while clutching a huge kitchen knife. Unlike Stanley Kubrick's great psychological horror film, "Ausentes" is a work that resonates with a singular lack of genius. It is beautifully, comically terrible; makes the Spice Girls movie look like a vital work of art. 'Ausentes' is the story of a family that moves into a closed community in the suburbs. Everything is fine with the world. They will live in peace and tranquility; they will go quietly for their business away from those old city streets. But no. Ariadna Gill's character, Julia, starts to get scared by those things that insist on bumping into the night, from empty supermarkets and doors that close; and her husband Samuel, played by Jordi Molla, passes in an instant from a relaxed family man to a nutter permanently stared by wild eyes, injecting Julia with a drug to keep her under his sudden cosh. Molla, highly respected as an actor, is absolutely terrible in this. Comical rather than threatening, he simply cannot bring out a threatening expression. He just stumbled upon a bar slime that drank too many drinks. So is there anything to redeem this movie? No. The script is big, the plot non-existent and the cast without merit. Completely free of tension and full of frightened moments, "Ausentes" is an exercise in how not to do a psychological thriller. It's ridiculous and exaggerated, but as one of the most unwittingly hilarious films of recent years it's worth a look.
