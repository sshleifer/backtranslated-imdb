Having some free time before going to work, I watched my "50 Movie Pack Comedy Classics" DVD collection and chose the darkest title in the package: Zis Boom Bah starring Grace Hayes forgotten. "Classics" is obviously the key word here from most of the titles I've never heard of and I suspect they are all in the public domain. However, this film features his son Peter Lind and his wife Mary Healy (whom I just discovered is from New Orleans in the state I live in, Louisiana) with Benny Rubin as a malt shop owner and Huntz Hall, taking a break from East Side Kids, as a friend of Peter. The plot, which speaks of a vaudeville mother who tries to turn her rich, carefree son into a responsible with him unaware of who she is, is for birds and doesn't have many funny scenes even though I like the celebrity personifications of Peter his dance with Hall in drag. And the songs and dances are fun in themselves. Rubin, however, is everywhere with his confusion of the vulgar American of the time and almost everything about him makes absolutely no sense (although I liked his funny dance). Since it was only 61 minutes that I'm sure they played in the lower half of the double bill, I would be kind and give this a 3 for the few fun pieces I mentioned while having fun.
