I read all the reviews for this video directed movie. I can agree that the film is not of "Armageddon" or "Deep Impact" quality. However, if you are looking for a way to spend ninety minutes or so, then this is a film that is bearable. <br /> <br /> I started watching the movie in the early hours of the AM while I was doing a little geek stuff. It was very nice, because I was able to switch back and forth between what I was doing and watching the movie, without missing a beat. It's a predictable movie and the acting isn't up to the veteran actors (eg Dennis Hopper). <br /> <br /> But I must point out that I only paid $ 2 (US) and as the old saying goes: you get what you pay for! If you are looking for a film with a deep meaning that you will have to see again and again, then this is definitely the long video. On the other hand, if you are looking for something to pass the time, then there is nothing wrong with Tycus (which incidentally was called "Comet: Final Impact" in Mexico, where I found this video).
