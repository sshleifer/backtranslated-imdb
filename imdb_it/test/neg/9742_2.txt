Why this character was hired by the post office is far beyond me. The test that postal workers take is so difficult. There is no way such a stupid dude can work at the post office. Everyone in this film is simply stupid and this is probably the point of the film. How they could spend their entire lives and not seeing an elevator is also disconcerting. I didn't take this movie too seriously, but it was so stupid. So try to start the car without its keys? A lot of horrible scenes and horrible acting and this movie is not funny at all. It's just a sad stupid mess. I liked dressing mothers anyway. <br /> <br /> Send me the sender as soon as possible.
