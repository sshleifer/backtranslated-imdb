Another first: this French film is my introduction to the world of Eric Rohmer. I may be a bit hasty when I say this is probably my last Rohmer film, but I was immediately excluded from the way Rohmer relies on monotonous philosophical conversations that never get to the point. There is a scene in the film where the characters discuss a love that I thought would never end. Honestly, no matter how I tried, I couldn't understand why Rohmer is so popular with film buffs. It struck me as one of those hateful petulant people who are full of hot air. If this is an example of his films, I don't care. I don't really care about French cinema (usually thoughtful and speculative due to guilt), so maybe I'm biased.
