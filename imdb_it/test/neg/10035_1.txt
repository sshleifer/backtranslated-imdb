If someone tells you that this image is simply terrifying, they probably have something to do with achievement or profit. This film is a real loser and copies situations from big budget horror movies and not to mention the soundtracks. I would not recommend this to my worst enemy. It's a low-budget film with amateur actors. It looks like it was shot for a movie competition. The acting is terrible and it wouldn't surprise me if the script was written by a writer from Hee Haw. My family laughed about it. A Grado ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ all the way. You will not be afraid of this. Here is a small taste of the terrible elements of this film. When the guy gets lured by the stupid portrait of Ric White by Reverend James Johnston. The reactions of the boys are as if he had an amputation without painkiller. Watch extra DVDs after watching the movie. When you see Ric White and the others talk so seriously about the movie, you'll laugh until your stomach hurts. How people will extend the truth and what they will do to earn a dishonest dollar. Don't be fooled like we did and buy this failure.
