Anyone who thinks this movie is great, desperately needs to see their head. It seems to me that this film was made as a joke. It has no good points whatsoever. Props cost around $ 10 and the whole set looks like it could fall at any time. Why are films like this made in the first place? This also had two of the most annoying characters I've ever met in the young boy on the ship and the redneck of the 20th century. This film is almost as bad as "Cool as Ice" with the incredibly talented vanilla that "misunderstood" Ice.
