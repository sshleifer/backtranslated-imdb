OK, everyone is so excited about this movie that I hardly dared to add a negative review but I didn't like this movie. I must say first of all that I saw the film in Russian overdubbing, so I would have missed a few dialog boxes, but not much. <br /> <br /> Beautiful things first. There are some hilarious moments (the Elvis lookalike, for example). The actors seem well launched, even the Russians. Efremova is great and Goldblum is very good. Which brings us to the negative aspects of this film. First of all. There is almost no story and we already know the end: Eltsin wins. So no drama or suspense. They tried to solve this problem with an emerging relationship between the actors mentioned above, but that story evaporates. <br /> <br /> More importantly, the film does not represent reality. The Russians in politics and society portrayed in this film are not funny, they are a serious and dangerous destiny. I am willing to believe that flying in some state spin-doctors has helped Yeltsin win her campaign, but the really interesting questions that should be addressed are: who financed the campaign, what they got in return, how the opposition from the broadcast of some commercials? <br /> <br /> So what we have here is a film, freely based on reality (but strangely avoiding anything that can make the film historically relevant or just a great political thriller) without plot or subplot.
