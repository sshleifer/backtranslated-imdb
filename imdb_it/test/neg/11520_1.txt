Ed Wood rides again. The fact that this film was made should give every youngster <br /> <br /> aspiring film director hope. Any screenplay you ever thought of using for <br /> <br /> a litter box or a birdcage shouldn't seem so bad. Don't watch this movie if you don't have a healthy supply of Tylenol or Rolaids. Watching this movie <br /> made me realize that Boa and Python weren't so bad. It would probably have been better to do this movie in Claymation at least that way that no actor should have taken the credit for being in this movie. It is understandable why this director has so many pseudonyms. There is a positive side to watching this film in the sense that if you can convince someone to bring you a bag of chips, then you can eat out of the cocoon of cheese that surrounds you, allowing you to come to cheese from your TV that surrounds it.
