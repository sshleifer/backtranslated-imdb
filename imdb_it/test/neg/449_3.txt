Larry is a perfect example of the Democratic Party in the United States, of which he is a faithful member. The king was a little honest and impartial and had a variety of guests. The party was also a centrist, but that was another era. Now, like, Larry, it's a long way away. <br /> <br /> At least 90 percent of all guests at King's show in the last year or two are liberals sitting there and hitting President Bush and all the conservatives they can think of ..... night after night. Bill Mahar, one of the most viscous, is - and you can see - the most frequent guest in the history of King's TV show. You can count on other supporters of the left to attend the King show every week, but don't hold your breath waiting for a conservative. They are few and far between. <br /> <br /> King was also one of the innovators of media overkill. It all started with the OJ. Simpson. Night after night after night is all you saw in the mid-90s. Whatever the latest gossip about Anna Nicole Smith, or the case of the Petersen murder, or Paris Hilton, Britney Spears or some other scandalous topic, you can bet Larry will tear him to pieces. Unfortunately, all the other networks do the same thing now. Larry was a leader in this regard. <br /> <br /> King also has the courage to give some advice, for example on marriage. I'm not kidding; I've heard that. The joke is that he has been married and divorced half a dozen times! This man has few qualms, believe me. When it comes to morality, it has no knowledge. Maybe that's why he has Dr. Phil, to regularly explain to him some facts of life. Larry will nod, but he doesn't understand any more than he was when Billy Graham talked to him. <br /> <br /> King is also becoming famous for the "softball" interview, in the sense that he doesn't ask difficult questions. This is due to the fact that most of his guests are of his political persuasion. People know that being present at the King show liked having a one-hour public relations concert. <br /> <br /> What this meant was a serious decline in valuations over the past five years. People see through him and his Liberal-and-tabloid-TV mentality and go from King and CNN to Fox News.
