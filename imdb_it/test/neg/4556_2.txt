This film was so bad that it became fun. If you want to see a cast of soap operas decide to make an action movie, this is for you! Excessive incidents, irrelevant, implausible dialogues - it has everything. The main character has a double personality and cannot decide whether he is a thief, a loving father or a hero who will risk his life for others. It is plausible in none of these roles. This sets the standard for many of the other characters. The head of the company whose building is on fire shows the same unpredictability as his wife. And the punch line - who took the "chip" - beggar belief. I found myself laughing heartily and for this reason, I suggest you look at it.
