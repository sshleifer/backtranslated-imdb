Produced by Nott Entertainment, this film is very good. I sat through the first 15 minutes of the film before judging that acting is bad, the cast is bad and the work with the camera is bad. While I hear that there is a download of this film that runs on the internet, it is "nott" that is also the bandwidth. <br /> <br /> Until I wrote this review, the average rating for this movie was 8.5, which prompted me to see it and there was an average high majority of 10 for this, of course voted by liars and shillings. This film is "nott" for everyone. Or parents, if you want to punish your children with this horrible movie, make them sit for it for Halloween.
