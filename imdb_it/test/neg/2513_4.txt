Based on a story by Ray Bradbury; a professional photographer (Brian Kerwin) returns to his modest home near a small desert town, where most citizens want him to stay away. A lonely boy (Jonathan Carrasco) hooks himself to him for attention; and the two witness the landing of an alien aircraft in the rocky desert region. Aliens turn into images of citizens. Kerwin has to convince the evacuation of the city and falls in love with the boy's mother (Elizabeth Pena). Acting is rather superficial; the plot is not worse than others; this movie lets you catch a decent ending. The supporting cast includes: Howard Morris, Dean Norris and Mickey Jones.
