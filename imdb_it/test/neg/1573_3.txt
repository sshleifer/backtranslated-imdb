Bette Midler is the best thing about this movie. It is a POOR second to the 1962 original with Natalie Wood as Gypsy. The songs were made much better in the original and the costumes were better. Bette's voice was exceptional and seemed better in most of the costumes than Cynthia Gibb. Only someone who didn't see the original would have thought it was a good movie. <br /> <br /> There was not enough change between ugly duckling and pretty girl. When Natalie Wood was Gypsy, she was seen as beautiful only when she wore gloves for the first time to perform in the burlesque show. When he has loose hair and then magically everything is well done and looks so elegant, it's an important aspect for the film, because it's also the first time that Gypsy sees himself as something special and that he could really be a star, not just poor substitute for his sister. And the scenes in which she slowly became most famous were hurried. It was an important part of the film and they killed it. It is essential to show her that she is becoming more comfortable with her future as a stripper and the costumes are fantastic in these scenes in the original. It was a huge disappointment watching him scroll through this movie. I was completely disappointed and if it wasn't for Bette Midler I would have closed the film.
