Asmali Konak has probably become one of the best TV series to come out of Turkey. With its unique cinematography and visual approach to filming, the series has achieved a broad base of successes with continuously broken voting records. Personally I don't agree with the singers who become actors (so, Ozcan Deniz - the leading actor) but I imagine the figures speak for themselves. <br /> <br /> In relation to the film, it was disgusting to see how much someone can destroy such a plot. Years of work, this film was able to supervise every descent story that existed within the series. Not only that, cultural errors were unacceptable, with an idiotic scene involving family members who danced (in Greek style) and dishes that broke, which does not exist anywhere within Turkish culture. <br /> <br /> Some argue that the film should be considered an independent film and not a continuation of the TV series, but this theory has an important fall, the way the film was marketed is that it will pick up where it came from the series has been interrupted and will end the series once and for all. With that message in mind, me and everyone I know, I would have asked for a refund and agreed to stay out of the theater to warn the other victims.
