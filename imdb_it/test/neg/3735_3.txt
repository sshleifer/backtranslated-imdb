Feeling Minnesota isn't really a road movie, but it's still the best categorization I can generate. A road movie doesn't depend mainly on a great plot, and since the plot of this film is really pathetic, it satisfies that description. To be interesting, a film of this kind must be based entirely on moving and intriguing characters and on the chemistry between them. Unfortunately, the Feeling Minnesota staff completely fails to produce this excitement. <br /> <br /> The initial presentation of the characters is unsatisfactory and confusing; For example, I can't tell if Jjaks (Keanu Reeves) grew up in his mother's house and his brother or not. It is said, from his mother (Tuesday Weld), that he must live with his father, but nothing in the film suggests that it ever happens. The same goes for the rest of the characters - I never know them. They seem irrational and no real explanation is given of why they do it. <br /> <br /> The key point is that I leave the film with no feeling for the characters, except boredom and maybe a little kick for the pretty Cameron Diaz.
