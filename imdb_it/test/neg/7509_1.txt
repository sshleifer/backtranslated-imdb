Once a month, I invite some friends for a "Night of delayed films". We look forward to movies that are so bad to be funny or movies that know they don't have a storyline and just show a lot of crates. Last night, we were unlucky enough to have Zombie Planet as one of our films. Cinematography is on a par with what we are used to, but acting was a different story. The lead role is played by Johnny Depp / Rob Zombie, who could not play a role in a school play, let alone a horror film LOW-BUDGET. Our undecided hero, who could not tell whether or not he wanted to be an ugly ass in this scene or a whiny coward, was one of the reasons why this was the first 30-year film I ever had to interrupt before during a late Film Night . He had the chance to be exceptional with a big twist on the standard zombie infection, but they took a completely different direction based on Johnny Zombie. I personally wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends. However, it is a pity that he has already invited some last night to suffer with 80% of this film with me.
