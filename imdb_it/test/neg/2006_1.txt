Hey, if people thought that wood was a bad director, they absolutely didn't see this movie. I mean, there were holes in the plot and under the cast used. Poor special effects. I mean, I can't believe this movie came out of a Hollywood studio. A school acting club could probably come out with a better product. I mean they had Erika Eleniak who is splendid Casper van Dien and under the nominal actor. Their agents should be shot to ask them to sign this dribble, they don't read the scripts. I still can't believe that that tiny lister was a survivor in the movie that hit me on the head all the time about why he and not a descendant of Van Helsing was the last man standing. I'm a fan of vampire movies and this is by far the worst that they should put into play so they never see the light of day.
