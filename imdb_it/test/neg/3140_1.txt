You know, I always imagine scary or weird movies, especially when they're shown at the fantasy film festival in Hamburg, Germany. but subconscious cruelty was probably the worst movie I saw this year. Does this comment contain any spoilers? <br /> <br /> no, because I didn't understand this movie. but well, what you can expect from a movie that was presented to a festival audience "we (the festival guys) know that not everyone will watch it until the end" ... <br /> <br /> I like the film splatter and I also like films with a strong graphic language. but this? there are many bloody scenes in this, but why? what is the director trying to tell us? Are you saying that we have lost all morality and all religious feelings? or are you saying that incest will always end in disaster? who knows - I don't know. <br /> <br /> if you want to watch a movie that makes you think for a while - watch it. but don't expect to think "wow, I received the message" - I didn't understand ...
