The Devil's Men represents what turned out to be one of the last gasps of the horror scene obsessed by the 70s just before Halloween, tore up the rules book, set it on fire and kicked it shouting through a glass plate. <br /> <br /> To make it short, a couple of enterprising Greek directors imagine the possibility of nailing a new film series with the unlikely double act of femininity, wise American investigator Milo and tender priest but kindly father Roche. A noble in exile is confused in a satanic mess - offering tourists as sacrifices to an extremely eerie effigy of the minotaur and only Milo and Roche can stop it! <br /> <br /> Or something like that. <br /> <br /> However, reality is horribly boring, frustrating and full of missed opportunities. I strongly suspect that the young directors have blown up most of the budget to bring on board Donald Plesance, Peter Cushing and Brian Eno (for the soundtrack) and hopes that this is enough to influence the audience in the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> It is not. The Devil's Men looks great, with a safe camera and fantastic settings. The soundtrack of Eno, although basically just a drone of chords that probably came out in an afternoon is appropriately atmospheric and the film is full of cracking 70's crumpet including the Austrailian type of Fawlty Towers and the drunk Jane Lyle of Island of Death infamy. But there the positive sides end. Cushing sleepwalkers through it, looks like he has a corn cob on his tramp and Pleasance takes care of doing his best, but never quite correctly things. To make matters worse, Milo's character is terribly fragile and unpredictable. <br /> <br /> Ok, so it doesn't look that good. But from there the film simply refuses to go anywhere. There is an insinuation that local villagers are possessed, but to be honest with them, they never do anything very different from mixing with glazed eyes. Maybe they were just tired? Just when you're sure things will come to a kind of head, Milo and Roche will stop the Baron's satanic feast with ridiculous ease, sending him to meet his creator. The statue of the minotaur is silent and soon! Satan is defeated. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes. <br /> <br /> The inept optimism that The Devil's Men could be the first in a series of films is hammered home by Father Roche's last line a few seconds before the ridiculously rushed ending. <br /> <br /> "Who knows Milo? Maybe one day I could call you again to help defeat the Antichrist." <br /> <br /> I'm sure you'll call that call at any time, Donald.
