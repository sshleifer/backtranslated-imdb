I just have to say that this was the third worst movie I ever saw after the attack of the 3 murder of tomatoes and starship soldiers 2. It wasn't just the paper dialogues or walls or even the shots of the guns that disappeared automagically with no holes in the walls. It was horrible acting. No wonder he never saw these actors before everyone probably slept with the director (s). I think I'm nice to this movie, but it's only because I'm tired of screaming at the movie (I saw it). My advice is to buy as many DVDs as possible of this movie and burn it so that no one can ever see this horrible waste of time, money and movies again.
