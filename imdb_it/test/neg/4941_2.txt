Don't choose this. **** Spoiler Alert ***** The plot of this grossly ugly film is that four friends were persuaded to take the shuttle from the airport by a dedicated driver. On the shuttle with them is a rather milquetoast type of business. <br /> <br /> Shortly after their journey, the shuttle driver takes an exit ramp and a mad driver tries to drive them off the road. The end result is that they get a flat tire. The driver receives one of the people on the shuttle to help change the tire and the jack grips and the boys' fingers are squeezed between the wheel and the wheel. It is at this point that the driver reveals himself as a kidnapper and has taken all the people hostage. <br /> <br /> Now the film becomes extremely slow and boring, as the characters do one thing lame after another. One of the men is killed trying to escape - he too lacks any suspense. In the end it was revealed that the business boy milquetoast is in league with the driver when a billionaire boy kills the other male friend by cutting his throat. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of attempts to escape from women. Milquetoast is beaten on the head with an iron - yet it survives. <br /> <br /> The driver is also defeated and somehow survived a collision with a high-speed fence while kneeling beside the steering wheel. Somehow he didn't go through the window and he didn't seriously injure himself with a collision with the windshield. Yet the woman driving the shuttle fell unconscious - yet she had a steering wheel to protect her and had nothing between him and the windshield. <br /> <br /> Finally he is able to subdue women and take them to an underground garage that is a front for human trafficking. One of the women is killed. The other stabs the driver in the leg with a piece of broken mirror of good size and shoots / touches him in the head, however he is able (in what should be a seriously weakened state - severe blood loss, two head injuries and a wide leg) to drag her out of the shuttle, drag her into a large chest, throw her and block her, while she fiercely fights him. <br /> <br /> Now some people admire the film's message on human trafficking and how it is going today. This is a serious problem. But making an extremely boring film on the subject does not entitle to a higher score.
