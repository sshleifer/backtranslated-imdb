Maybe I was expecting too much from this movie, but at least a comedy should be fun, and this has very few funny moments. He can insult homosexuals, heterosexuals, women, the obese and probably many other groups too. The graduation scene where _everyone_ claims to be gay is one of the most disgusting I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Tom Selleck and Matt Dillon are ridiculously mixed and Kevin Kline seems to have enjoyed most of the time. > <br /> Other reviewers compare the film to "Will and Grace", but at least "Will and Grace" is fun.
