I'm quite surprised to see that this film also got lukewarm reviews, I found this film really terrible. The plot hovers around trying to decide if it's a comedy or a thriller, so realize that it can't reach either. Then he throws in the towel and continues with his absurd plot, highlighted with a hilarious and involuntary scene with Laura Linney, an injection, and the spilled coffee that lets the audience awkwardly squirm on their seats looking at each other as if it were true? Basically it's abysmal and really disappointing for Robin Williams fans, and makes you think someone blackmailed Laura Linney to add this piece of junk to her otherwise respectable resume. I wanted to leave after 10 minutes and I would like to have it, even to see it for free I wanted someone to pay me for my lost time. The glitch / twist of the computer in this film was awkwardly stupid, and in the end you don't care who wins the election. Vote directly on DVD.
