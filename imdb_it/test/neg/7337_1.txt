Is it just me or the fact that the evil racing team is Japanese and that their arrogant star racer is German seems a bit exaggerated? Maybe this is how it is in the international motor racing circuit, but if all the United States had represented them, they are balls like Cody and his mechanic Chris (Peter Berg, who still has to learn to act), so I'd cheer for another country. Formula films can be good but the characters must be nice and no one fulfills the criteria in this film. To put it shortly - a very bad film.
