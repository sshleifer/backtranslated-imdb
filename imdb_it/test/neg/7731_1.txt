I saw this film in the theater when it first came out, I'm sorry to say, and it was one of the few movies I ever wanted to come out soon. I had no problems with the drug content and I could see how this cautionary story could have been powerful. The problem was that the director, working with James Woods and Sean Young, drew two of the least lovable characters I've ever seen in a movie. I hated this couple and couldn't care less if they sank directly into the inevitable bottom. Theirs was not a surprise in this film. Every turn of events was so painfully obvious that I felt I could write the script myself; although I like to think that I would have done a better job. Later I listened to nightmarish stories about the incidents on the set between Sean Young and James Woods along some stalking events. It made me wonder if the terrible acting was born of bad feelings and dysfunctions. Anyway, I'm referring to The Boost as the worst movie I've ever paid to see.
