It looks like an exciting prospect, a modern "Othello" with Christopher Eccleston, who was so frighteningly good at "Shallow Grave" and (above all) "Jude", and Eamonn Walker, which brought so much intensity and introspection to his key role on " Oz ". You might think they're both Shakespearean natural, but both performers can't shoot: Walker's Othello is a fairly sharp grip on the side, with a whisper that doesn't make a noticeable impact; and Eccleston sums it up as frighteningly as Iago, winking at the camera in an almost extravagant parody of the role. It is likely that he was encouraged by his director, whose thriving approach could have worked better with the Elizabethan language, but which seems a strident and pretentious choice for this modernized script. And the script itself is less disappointing in being modern than it is in being obvious ?? it is as if Andrew Davies had sketched the famous plot and then he had simply written any dialogue that had come into his head. All in all, a failure. 4 out of 10.
