This is one of those strange, self-important, self-indulgent movies that tries too hard to be profound. It is not. Instead, it triggers clich√©s that try to go through Profundity. Typical is the scene in which Peter (Kelsey Grammer) explains to the protagonist and best friend Adam (Dwier Brown) how the man starts breastfeeding, then goes on to suck the breast of his girlfriend and finally his wife, thus concluding that life sucks. So deep. We are treated by a variety of characters that offer their life perspective, the universe, etc. During Adam's journeys through the Mojave desert on foot. (Suddenly leaves L.A. on his wedding day and his family, friends and boyfriend presume he died when his car was found in a rocket-destroyed military test field.) Some characters are more fun than others. The best is by far a fugitive from a psychiatric hospital that speaks only through the voices of others. The actor, James Kevin Ward, makes some great impressions, including Nicholson, Popeye and several characters from the original Star Trek. But once the interesting characters come out of the screen, we're again connected to Adam and his search for the deep. It is a long journey, which is dragged into many places. In fact, it's the longest hour and a half I've ever seen. And the finish barely makes it seem worthwhile, <br /> <br /> I discovered this movie playing on HBO one day waking up too early and clicking on the TV. This learns me. Next time I'll try harder to sleep.
