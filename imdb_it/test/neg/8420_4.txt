The dryly irreverent, but sadly non-disastrous satire of detective films, with a stone-faced Michael Caine playing a British author of scruffy criminal stories traveling in the Mediterranean to help write the memoirs of an aspiring gangster; soon, he realizes he is being followed and his life is in danger. Caine narrates the procedure with remarkable witty and sarcastic cunning, but his current performance is devoid of energy (Caine's shrill bursts of anger or frustration seem to come out of nowhere and not connect with anyone on the screen). Other cast members (particularly Mickey Rooney, silver-haired Lionel Stander and Lizabeth Scott) behave very well in very colorful roles, although Al Lettieri has an offensive role as an apparent homosexual cross-dressing (Lettieri is insulted without being able to defend him same, an unenviable position). The director and screenwriter Mike Hodges has the germ of a good idea (he satirizes the detective films of the '40s without compromising the speeches and the cheesy environments), but he doesn't have an acute sense of humor. When a Bogart lookalike - asking a question about a hawk - is the best joke, what follows is anemic. ** from ****
