This film was recommended to me by some scholars. From their comments, I had rather high expectations. But this film was not that disappointing. The purpose of the director is obvious: to use a web of discourses / poems as a way to argue against the Bush doctrine. But the director fails miserably at this. Furthermore, I seriously question the choice of the director's protagonist. He is a vagabond who is absolutely not worth listening to. The rise of corporate power, so what? More importantly, this film gets a negative score in its persuasive power; it is clearly intended for those who have already formed their opinions. It is true that the aesthetics of the film is quite pleasant. But practically the rest of the film simply sucks.
