who is responsible for these things "behind the scenes"? Who are these actors? have they crawled out from under the rocks? "Yes, lots of yuk!" no. nothing for me. just disgust and shame of being a human being. I have to take my eyes off the set, it's so embarrassing. in fact, I changed channels. <br /> <br /> I've always had a problem with Robin Williams without a break, I forgot my lithium today, but at least it's fun once in a blue moon. looking at someone who is not at all fun to play robin williams is like having every tooth in your head pulled slowly and sadistically, without novocaine, for eternity. <br /> <br /> please stop making these absolutely terrifying TV movies. please.
