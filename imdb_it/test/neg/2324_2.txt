In need of work, straight man Bud Abbott (like Jack) and comedian Lou Costello (like Dinkel) get the latter job as a self-described babysitter like the "problem child" David Stollery (like Donald). The young Stollery ends up reading Mr. Costello's favorite novel (see if you can guess the title), putting Costello to sleep, dreaming that he and Mr. Abbott are reliving the story of "Jack and the Beanstalk" (you guessed it). br /> <br /> The sepia tone changes to color for most of the production. Apparently, this was an attempt at something different for the duo, a colorful fantasy for children. He fails, but this is where you see Abbott & Costello in color, the silent film superstar William Farnum (like the King) makes his last performance a little, the brother of boxer Max Baer, ​​Buddy, and Stollery , before Disney's "Spin and Marty". <br /> <br /> ** Jack and the Beanstalk (4/4/52) Jean Yarbrough ~ Lou Costello, Bud Abbott, Buddy Baer, ​​William Farnum
