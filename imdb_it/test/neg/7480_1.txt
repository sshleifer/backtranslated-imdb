Before the last call with Carson Daly, my local NBC affiliate broadcast much more interesting programs after Late Night w / Conan as the second TV city, 3rd Rock From the Sun & Carline in the City, and some comedy standing. These days there's nothing worthwhile to look at, because all I see is Carson Daly and his horrible show. He is not a comedian, he is not an actor, he does not deserve to be famous because he is not a good speaker or a comedian. <br /> <br /> In his June 21st show, he tried using Internet meme he called "Rickroll" in his show. He failed hard. That event confirms that Carson Daly is horrible.
