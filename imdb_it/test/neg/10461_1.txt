I agree with all the comments posted so far: this film was a waste of time and energy, both for the spectators and for those who made it. CGI terrible, horrible script, stupid storyline and hey, the setting is Alabama but it looks like California. But the worst thing must be the angle of the Native Americans on this, which attracts every stereotype that can be imagined, from the leader surrounded by smoke, the angry warrior, the people who talk without using contractions ("Don't do this!" , Native American pipes that sound in the air, etc. It just shows such lack of respect and understanding that I was tearing my hair out. A native American with a few ounces of respect for himself would have thrown the television out of the window in this garbage. So, in closing, I would say that this film is practically an offense for everyone.
