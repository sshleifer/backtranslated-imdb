Spoilers abound. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed, this being my first STREET FIGHTER film that I saw (I still dare not approach the 1994 beat). Very little attracts your attention in STREET FIGHTER ZERO (ALPHA) in contrast to most japanimation. The fights are hilarious (Shun versus Zangief was a laugh) and the dramatization is too moody especially towards the end, when Ryu must control everything in his fight against his brother. <br /> <br /> The main road the fighter, Ryu, is weakening in a much darker version within himself. The frustrations in controlling this darkness are further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother! A sinister tournament of street fighting takes place with more than just fighting on the mind of the promoter. <br /> <br /> What is with the design of the artist's feet? Any anime drawn above the stomach is impressive. The soft nature of the story makes the STREET FIGHTER genre too intelligent and places much more emphasis on a character (Shun), who is not even a fighter in the video game! A study of the character over the main stars of the original STREET FIGHTER is completely ignored. How many times have you captured Rolento? Adon? Guy? STREET FIGHTER ZERO lacks the videogame imagination.
