There is a significant amount of money behind this production, so the appearance is very good. It includes some interesting appearances by Gilbert Roland, Eddie Burns and a short cameo at the beginning of Christopher Lee. There are some exciting firefights, and a bit of humor or two - the satire on Django, the nameless man, and Sabata is fun, especially when given the names of the failed presidents of the Mexican revolution. <br /> <br /> The problem is that there is no purpose in satirizing western spaghetti as you try here. The key element of the Spaghettis is IRONY, which mixes easily with comedy; in fact, the source of all Spaghetti is Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which is universally recognized as one of the great black comedies of all time, and most of the Spaghettis have easily slipped past the true comedy of a very sophisticated variety. Perhaps the best proof of this is found in the Trinity films, which are both openly Spaghettis and an openly slapped comedy. So why bother to satirize a genre that, by its very nature, is satirized? As a result, I found the whole enterprise substantially unconvincing. None of these characters were people I would never be interested in, the story was generally cliché, and production values ​​reflected only the money involved, not the director's passion. Above all, a trivial and futile effort to collect the phenomenon that mocks.
