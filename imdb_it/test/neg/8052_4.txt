I first saw Kindred in 1987 along with another film called "devouring the waves". I remember then I hated them both and never bothered to look at them again. <br /> <br /> However I have just started a crusade to collect so many 80s horror titles in their original form, which have been deleted for some time. I have a pretty proud collection with many other titles on my list! <br /> The Kindred even though I have not yet received a copy is a top priority like all the old films I did not like then, I now have and now I have re-looked and I think they are brilliant and the things I remember about the Brothers are now pushing to get a copy as soon as possible <br /> <br /> Hurray for the 80s and long horror life!
