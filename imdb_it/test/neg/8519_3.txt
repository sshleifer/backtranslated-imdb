This film is strictly dedicated to the fans of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher. <br /> <br /> I get angry with TCM for showing this mess more frequently than Bachelor Mother, the delicious original. I still get angry that a Hollywood troupe thought it would be a good idea to redo the Bachelor Mother, filling it with some limping songs that only serve to interrupt the flow of a pretty comedy. Instead, Hollywood could have spent time, money, energy and talent wasted on this horrible remake to give us something new and original - Wow, what a concept! <br /> <br /> Bachelor Mother (the original), with Ginger Rogers and David Niven are a spicy stew that boils with sexuality. It is the wink of the 1930s at the Hays Office. Bundle of Joy (the remake), with Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher is strictly milk and biscuits. It's a handshake from the 1950s with Eisenhower. <br /> <br /> Which cast would you rather watch: Debbie Reynolds, Eddie Fisher and Adolphe Menjou, or Ginger Rogers, David Niven and Charles Coburn? For me, every cast member in the original version is far better than his counterpart in the remake. <br /> <br /> In the original a young and beautiful Ginger Rogers is at its peak. David Niven offers a perfectly spoiled, sophisticated and baffled scion of a mogul full of department stores perfectly. And I always like to see Charles Coburn in a movie. In Bachelor Mother, he is priceless as the desperate grandfather wannabe. <br /> <br /> In Bundle of Joy Debbie Reynolds is her usual lively personality. He looks good in this role, although his performance (along with that of Fisher) completely changes the tone of the story. As an actor, Eddie Fisher is hopeless. It is completely missing the "presence" screen. Here it is too healthy for this story. His acting is completely dull and without trace. Likewise, his singing is so insignificant and insignificant that it has been completely forgotten by the world at large. The only time it's not completely painful is in Butterfield 8 - where, incidentally, he doesn't sing. Here, Fisher's lame performance alone is enough to ruin this film. Adolphe Menjou, a favorite character actor, offers a competent performance, but not one of his best. He is more bold than commander. He and Fisher are not convincing as father and son. <br /> <br /> See a musical for music, is the story purely coincidental? Or do you watch a musical for a story, with a little (hopeful) good music used for seasoning? If the first one, you might like this lame remake. Otherwise you'll be much better looking at the non-musical original by Ginger Rogers, Bachelor Mother.
