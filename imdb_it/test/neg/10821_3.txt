I think most people would agree with me if I had to say that the Alien movie pretty much created the bar for the atmosphere. I've seen quite a few movies combined with that bar, but no one has ever passed the scary Alien galleries and darkened rooms. The Cave is a film that tries very hard to restore the bar. I think the trailer even talked about being scary like Alien, yet not once in the film did I ever feel the least bit scared, or excited about the rest. <br /> <br /> So now that we have taken the ball of rolling negativity, I could also explain why the main hook of the cave (the atmosphere in case I wasn't careful) turned into a waste of my time. Right now I will say that most of the sets are beautiful and well lit, but what we hear and what we know is that they tend to ruin what we see. The music for one is terrible. Either we take rock music or exaggerated haunted house music. Okay, maybe I'll push it a little bit, but I couldn't stand it. The many underwater scenes were pretty bad (underwater scenes are known to be boring to die for). I didn't need rock music that echoed in my ears as they simply swam in a cave. This actually produced many unintended laughs that were then amplified by the following aquatic crash scene. <br /> <br /> However, as I said, it wasn't just the music that killed the atmosphere, hell no. Creatures hiding in darkness should invoke horror. I should be worried that they will appear and only a taste of them should make my blood feel cold. The Cave wisely takes a page from the alien manual by not showing the whole creature for a long time and leading to revelation with only glimpses but it just doesn't work because the creatures are so lame. I imagine it would be rude to spoil the specs, but they are basically the aliens with wings. <br /> <br /> I think you understand the point now. Ruined atmosphere Yet I know a lot of people who will still see a movie if it's exciting. I'd like to tell you about the Grotto but I'd be lying. This film is slow to get to action and once we get there we are almost amazed when it ends up calling it a day. We have seen all this well done before with the exception of some clean scenes (the boy impaled on stalactites, the eel and the rapids) so as not to feel any thrill in watching the people running from meaningless alien launches in endless tunnels. <br /> <br /> Ah, but the pain does not end there. We must also consider the characters and take action. Well, I can't remember a single line of dialogue other than "run!" and the only name of the character I can remember is Jack, but it's only because it's inserted in almost all the other lines near the end of the film. Perhaps the actors were capable but the script didn't allow them to do anything else, so run and discuss. They had almost no backgrounds and every time someone died they just shrugged it off. It is rather sad considering that the CGI eel offers the best performance of the film. <br /> <br /> Speaking of CGI; there is plenty of it, most of which are terrible. I recommend using the seeds (at least I think they were seeds), but nothing really gets confused with the environment and therefore most of the effects end up looking rather "hokey". <br /> <br /> So I guess I wrap it up, the Cave is bad and has very little to do for it. If the film had been a first-run movie on the SciFi channel or a low-budget version directly on video, I could have felt a little more love, but this film was a theatrical version. With more ingenuity and talent this could have been a frighteningly funny film, but as it is this film is as scary as going to the cellar and it's not very nice. <br /> <br /> My review of Frider Waves: http: //friderwaves.com/index.php?page=cave
