Great acting, great production values, good direction. <br /> <br /> But the script starts with great rhythm and interest in the first half and then collapses in the second half. Let's be clear about the character and motivation for the first time, but then the second half leaves many questions unanswered. <br /> <br /> The conflicts raised are compelling but the follow-through is weak. For example, we are very clear that Rudyard Kipling is in favor of war, but we do not know if this philosophical position will change during the film. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of image that makes me want to look for facts in history books. I don't think I can count on the film to have a clear idea. <br /> <br /> The representation of the war itself is extremely accurate, although women's lack of enthusiasm does not reflect the hysteria of war that swept Britain at the time. Perhaps this is historically accurate; like so much in this movie, I just don't know.
