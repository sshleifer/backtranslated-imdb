First of all - although I believe that Joel Schumacher is at best a mediocre director and more often (as here) decidedly bad, the lion's share of the guilt of this ugly film parody must go to John Grisham whose novel is based on this. <br /> <br /> Set in an indeterminate moment (the '50s - the' 70s - now?), the film opens with the rape and murder of a child with such a caricatural redneck that their purpose seems to be to reassure racists that "at least we are not so bad" ?? Cut to the bad guys who come to the court when the girls' father, Samuel L Jackson, fearing that they will run away for some technique, tears them apart in cold blood before the trial. <br /> <br /> The setting is a "deep south" that probably never existed: the few black characters live in shacks and seem to pick cotton, the racist dyed in wool (Kiefer Sutherland is a comic version of a Klansman) are laughable in their wickedness. The set-piece is the proof: for the defense, they are the "good guys" - a billionaire lawyer played by Matthew McConaughey as a coma, his assistant played by Sandra Bullock's breasts (he doesn't seem to serve any other narrative purpose) and Donald Sutherland as the wanted drunk-who-sobers-up-to-fight-the-good-fight lawyer. For the prosecution, Kevin Spacey goes through the movements of being demon spawn, while in the city in general, the crosses are burned, the witnesses are intimidated and the local citizens don't seem to care? <br /> <br /> Some of the reviews here claim the immoral film, since surely Samuel Jackson is a killer and should rely on law enforcement rather than descend on a weak piece of Matthew McConaughey's oratory. To be honest, questionable even if the underlying message "Vigilante justice is good" could be, everything about the film sucks: the characterizations are pitiful, the acting in lead, the direction that trudges, the script and the dialogue almost elusive to parody. Peter Menzies' Technicolor cinematography, in the 1950s, is pretty but derived. <br /> <br /> And go on for almost two and a half hours !! <br /> <br /> What remains to be said? This is a waste of 141 minutes of someone's life, it is boring, empty and lovable, and, almost like an afterthought, it is morally repugnant.
