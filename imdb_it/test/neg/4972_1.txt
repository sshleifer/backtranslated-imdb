I love Jurassic Park movies, they are three of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> And I hate this game, if there was a game I would never have for Super Nintendo this was it. <br /> <br /> How can a game based on a classic movie be too horrible? And to make it worse, I was scary about this game when I was a kid. <br /> <br /> How stupid he was, but then I was a kid again when this game first came out. <br /> <br /> The game in this game is just weird. A minute is an action game and then it's a shooter. What in the world is wrong in making a decision when making a video game. <br /> <br /> The sound in the game is simply terrible to hear. <br /> <br /> The music is too sick to listen. <br /> <br /> The controllers in the game don't work most of the time. <br /> <br /> Jurassic Park the game is just a waste of time and money and it won't be a classic. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs
