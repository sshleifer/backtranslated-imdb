I like all the main actors involved in this rather bizarre film. Terrance Stamp, Guy Pearce and Hugo Weaving have all been shown as some of the best and most capable actors around, but I couldn't understand. I don't know if it's because I don't understand the lifestyle or what, but I couldn't turn my head for this movie. Worst of all is that the actors have made some of the ugliest drag queens I've ever seen. I think it was part of the point, I don't know. I realize it's probably an insult, but I don't know what else to call them. I must say that I bought the boys as interpreters (the correct term?) But the story was not very good or very interesting. I will say that I usually cannot very well appreciate the costume designers, even if I notice them when they are wrong or out of place, but I was very impressed by these. Very creative to say the least, just not attractive, but I don't think they should be. I don't know that I'm definitely not the target audience and I'd never go see a performance performed by these artists, but I wouldn't go to see the ballet or the opera, so I don't know. If this is your kind of movie, you'll probably like it, but if you don't skip it because it's ... well, not most of us. I just checked that he won the costume Oscar and I will say it rightly. I must say that even Ebert didn't care much for this film, even if he liked it much better than me.
