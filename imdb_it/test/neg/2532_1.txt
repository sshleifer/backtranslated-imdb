I just saw the Princess Raccoon at the Asian New York Film Festival. The gentleman who presented the film congratulated the public for their refined taste. "You could be in Herbie: Fully Loaded," he said with a smirk, "but instead you're here to see Seijun Suzuki's Princess Raccoon." The public applauded and exulted. Well, let me tell you, I'd rather watch Herbie: Fully loaded twice in a row. Princess Raccoon, an allegedly whimsical musical based on Japanese folklore, easily qualifies for one of the ten worst films I've ever seen. He is so unhappy that his misery actually makes me unpleasant to the other films of Seijun Suzuki, which is rather an undertaking. <br /> <br /> There is such a vast expanse of things that don't go with Princess Raccoon that I don't know where to start. Perhaps his worst faults are both aggressively unintelligible and the mind incredibly dull. If the rollers got confused or half of them were lost in the expedition, the public would not have recognized the difference. If you don't believe me, I challenge you to steal a print and ask someone to spin the reels in random order. If you can tell me which is where I will give you every penny I have. <br /> <br /> The first third of the film features a jumble of scenes, songs (including a rap rap number) and images that don't seem to be connected in any way. The horribly integrated computer animation is thrown into the real deal, adding another brick to the immense and rapidly growing wall of incomprehensibility. It does not surprise me to know that the writer wrote down any Japanese folklore that came to mind on a pack of known cards, stacked them, mixed them, distributed the cards on a table and then wrote the script in their order. <br /> <br /> About thirty-five minutes into the film comes a plot semblance. Something about a raccoon princess that changes shape (in human form) and a normal human falling in love. I was hoping it was an omen of the movie to be something other than a series of embarrassing scenes, but not so unlucky. The film continues in the same absolutely disconcerting way. I wish I had come out then, but I was trapped in the middle of a narrow line. In retrospect, the embarrassing scene would have been worth it. <br /> <br /> I'm exhausted thinking only of the last couple of rollers. I spent every moment hoping and praying that it would be over. Every big move by dolly, swell in music, or scene that seemed remotely like it was ending things, renewed my hopes that the credits were about to turn. For distressing minutes after a painful minute he went on. And again and again and again. Eventually, after dozens of false alarms, he was reduced to what I had to be an abstract scheme on which the credits were going to appear. Then, defying all reason, he cut another scene. How could I forget? The completely independent subplot concerning a captured, urinated and boiled ninja in a soup had not yet been packaged. <br /> <br /> I will never go back to those 111 minutes, but you can save yourself the pain. Unless you want to contaminate your memory or the future fun of the great Seijun Suzuki movies like Youth of the Beast and Tokyo Drifter, don't see Princess Raccoon. I would rather spend my time vomiting.
