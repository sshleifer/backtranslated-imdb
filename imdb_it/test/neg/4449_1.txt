Only to save you time and time I will go ahead and tell you that this film is absolutely not worth the game and the gas it would take to burn it. Do not waste time. In fact it would be better to forget that you ever thought of watching it. I have seen B movies in a language that I cannot understand. Whoever has given permission for this must be done must be sewn. The only positive thing I can say for this film is that with a new script and the right director and actors it could be a great story. Let me break down; A virgin becomes pregnant by a demon, while the child in her womb wants to feed on people. They try to make up for the fact that this is perhaps the worst film ever made with curses and useless nudity. All in all Totally not worth the dollar it took me to rent it.
