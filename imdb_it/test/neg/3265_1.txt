This film is so terrible that it is literally a task to watch. I wanted to expel him from my VCR and throw it across the room, but I kept thinking (foolishly) that it would eventually be fun and then all would be well. "Lose, we'll win, yay!" This film should be requested for anyone who even once thought Jackie Mason was funny. After that, beat them on the head with this film until the tape breaks. And if you're even considering renting this asshole (or worse yet, having it!) I have something to ask you: didn't you even look at the cover? I mean, with a shit like this you can tell with a simple look how ugly it is! "Oy vey!" This movie sucked.
