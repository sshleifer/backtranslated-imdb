I saw this video because I like Malta and this film was filmed in its entirety there. Very disappointing, since it fails to capture any of the island's flavors or beauty - only the hot, dry and arid elements. The film was boring, boring, completely inconsistent from beginning to end, pretentious and devoid of any imaginable plot. You had to be a psychic to follow the plot, or lack thereof. He had his moments, of course; but so goes to the dentist. <br /> <br /> In short, I would prefer to endure another colonosphere before revisiting this horrible mess. It was so ugly, I couldn't actually fall asleep. There are some "Eurotrash" movies out there that were obviously made without adult supervision. This is one of them. On the positive side, who is Nadia Cassini? Never before have I seen a more beautiful set of legs. She's the only thing that saves this movie. <br /> <br /> Even the cruel boar hunt represented in the credits was disturbing. A boar that has been released on someone's property (Malta has very few native mammals, all small - rats, bats, etc.) and then hunted by dogs before being shot. Oh well - go visit Malta, despite this movie - it's a beautiful and colorful island; rich in history and lots of fun.
