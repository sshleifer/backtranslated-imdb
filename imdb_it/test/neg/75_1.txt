After tormenting the old man, even three hillbilly are not satisfied with their arrival as they approach their car and threaten them to leave. After asking some of the local mannequins who can't talk or simply don't want to answer, they eventually find the cabin. After settling in, strange things happen to guests, including the discovery of shit on their car, the man who is the head of this trip, what an idiot shoots at the family dog ​​thinking it was a killer scratching the door and series of deaths later in the end. Adding a group of churches did not improve the story. Then, in the end, the idiot who survives the whole ordeal goes around the city carrying a gun. Boring. this is what this movie is.
