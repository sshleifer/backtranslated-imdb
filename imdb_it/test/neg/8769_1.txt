As a keen fan of the Christian film, and a person trying to keep a watchful eye on improvements in the realm of Christian film production, I was thrilled to have the chance to see this film. I was ready to see something that would make a new mark in quality movies. I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> The starting scene is excellent, although a slight catch by Leon - The Professional on the corner, showcases some great cinematography in the early years ... all that followed was pretty much downhill. <br /> <br /> I could barely stand this, I was tempted several times just to turn it off. <br /> <br /> The acting, although quite sincere, was incredibly terrible. But then again, the core of the problem was the script itself. The dialogue was worse than anything I've ever seen, and even my amateur script "The Awakening" (which will soon become an independent film) looked like a Hitchcock thriller next to it. (Which is not saying much). The positive side of this film is that it was shot on the newest 900 new high-definition cameras from Sony shot in 24P. This film and Star Wars: Attack of the Clones were the first films to use these new technology cameras that year. Unfortunately, the camera's performance seemed to be wasted with poor lighting, poor angles and handling. <br /> <br /> The only positive feeling I had when I saw this film was the goodness of my debut in independent cinema. look next. ; ) 4/10
