Comparisons with the original series are inevitable. It's a shame that Diana Rigg left the original show in the 1960s due to abuse by the producers, and MacNee probably regretted it like any other fan - you can't tell how long the show could have lasted otherwise. Linda Thorson was OK as a substitute and her episodes retained almost all the quality and aspects of the Rigg episodes - only the Rigg / Macnee chemistry was missing. The New Avengers should have been left on the shelf: a Macnee on the decline, an annoying Purdey and hell to that Gambit man. Furthermore, the humor was forced and scarce - granting I only watched some of the episodes, because that was all I could watch, but I think I had the idea. Try as many could do, it's almost impossible to resurrect an old show as a new format or movie.
