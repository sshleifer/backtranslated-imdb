The film starts off great, with a fake film of instructions on the habits of Swedish housewives. After that we get a detailed reconstruction of post-war Scandinavia with lots of amazing machines, electronic equipment and interior design; a minimal jazz soundtrack, a beautiful photograph and fashionable titles. There is also some fun Scandinavian rivalry like in the Von Triers Riget. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after the set up, "Kitchen stories" collapses like the Twin Towers on 9 / 11.Actors trying to portray the "jealousy" emotion by simply staring at them in front of them. Corny filled with stale gay symbolism in vain of: "I don't like white swans, I prefer bears and wolves ... have you ever tasted bear meat?" Music becomes Yann Tiersen's cheesier at its worst. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the director made all his effort in this great set-up, only to ruin it later.
