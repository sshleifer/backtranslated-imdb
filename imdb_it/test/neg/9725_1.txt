From the beginning of this film, with his "The Lost Boys" that tear up the opening sequence, the bad work of the wires and, even worse, the end of the dialogue, this film winds at a snail's pace. "The Covenant" was highly recommended by some of my colleagues, who are deeply convinced that they were playing a trick on me. At least I hope it was the intention and their taste is not so bad! This film didn't last much more than an hour and a half, yet it seemed much longer. The story was so simple that it could have been summed up in about 15 minutes, at most. They could have at least filled the rest of the film with some funny magic or fight scenes, however someone decided, (maybe the director, but I don't know if anyone really "directed" this film) that would have been filled with some "artistic" shots poorly executed and absurd scenes of the "boys" who swim and throw themselves into clashes with the bars. About halfway through this film I thought that maybe hitting my head against a wall would be more fun, and partly to get rid of that horrible feeling of dirt I had to keep looking at it. . So I banged my head against a wall, and I liked it a lot more than the movie! I looked at it until the end, hoping that in the end it offered me more fun. No, my efforts have been rewarded with "How about getting your Whee-aytch!" I vomited, and then I felt only embarrassment for the writer and pity for the poor actor who had to deliver this shot. The acting wasn't so bad as other reviewers seemed to think, but even the most talented talent didn't save this job, and the work did it, on my nerves! I give the films an opportunity, even a bad one because they usually offer some form of entertainment, and this really wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen. After it was over, I felt like watching the movie "Stealth" again and WOW was much better this time! Oh yes, for example, don't worry about this movie, really, no. Watch some episodes of "Charmed" and watch "The Lost Boys" after drinking a good dose of alcohol, and you'll be a much better person. If you fall into the same trap that I did and look at "The Covenant", make sure you keep all the sharp objects away, far away from yourself, you will thank me for it.
