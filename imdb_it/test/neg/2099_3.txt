Looking back at the year 2006, one of the things I will remember most is the "Snakeamania" on the Internet for a movie called Snakes on an airplane. But unknown to me there was a review movie from DVD right called Snakes on a train! After seeing it, I feel at best a B-Movie below. <br /> <br /> The plot: <br /> <br /> A husband and wife get on a train to go to Los Angles, to help train their husbands uncle who is a shaman. This is because his wife's family does not approve of her ruining him, so they put a curse on her that the snakes "will become his". Conceived with sixteen hours driving to Los Angles and a group of passengers includes a former Narc policeman and some drug traffickers. Will they get there in time before the snakes take her away? <br /> <br /> View on the film: first the effects: I must say that while some scenes with smaller snakes look good in a bloody way, the main effect shots have to wait eighty minutes to see! Sadly so bad that they have completely killed all the good memories of the movie (The film makes video games 198os similar to T2 next to this!). One of the things I noticed is that there is no credit for the script on the movie! and the directors make the film so anti-climatic that it ruins the entire film. Final vision of the film: <br /> <br /> A B movie under-par, with an incredibly bad ending.
