The Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong and James Gleason trio play Coney Island in the running for the hand of Ginger Rogers, a girl who works by selling saltwater taffy. With the outbreak of World War I, the trio enlisted and pursued Ginger from afar. The first half of this production of RKO Pathe is tough, with the three protagonists chewing the scenery with overcooked jokes and a "snappy" dialogue that quickly becomes boring. The second half focuses on the action sequences in which the US Navy pursues both a German merchant cruiser and a U-boat. These sequences are lively and well filmed, but on the whole it is a comedy drama that is too long and unsatisfactory with a flat finish. Only for star fans.
