I was looking for ATTACK on Precinct 13. There, the film is THAT memorable. Who is the star of this? Ethan Hawke or Matt Dillon (I can't say who the leading actor is, it's a pretty important point against the movie right there) Gabriel Byrne (who couldn't have had the money as badly as he could?) for his fantastic body. It took me years to finally understand that she is Joey's sister to "Friends". I agree that the so-called SWAT people who attack the station are pretty crappy, as far as tactics are concerned. We have also taught the best basic skills of this in the basic training of the RAF. <br /> <br /> Avoid this, even the snow does not want to fall on a bus full of prisoners! Very bad continuity indeed. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague!
