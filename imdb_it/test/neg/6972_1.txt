Let me tell you about Edward D. Wood Jr. He had a passion for his work that I wish more people had. If we all had Ed Wood's optimism and great hope, the world would probably be a much better place. Being familiar with the story of Ed Wood and having seen the most wonderful biopic "Ed Wood" (1994) several times, I admire his boldness and his commitment to the work he loved; I still admire his attitude of never saying. He had a love of directing that I wanted to have more people in today's Hollywood. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't make his films more fun to watch. And "Glen or Glenda", his first and most denominational film, is probably his worst. <br /> <br /> "Glen or Glenda" is a breathtaking cult film about a cross-dresser named Glen (played by the director / writer Ed Wood himself) who despite his love for his girlfriend Barbara (Dolores Fuller ), fails to conquer his passion for cross-dressing, in which he dresses in women's clothes and a wig and becomes so ... Glenda! The story of Glen / Glenda is narrated by a doctor and he too is spoken and supervised by a mysterious character called "The Scientist" played by veteran horror star Bela Lugosi. Oh, and there is also a subtext about an Alan / Anne character who becomes a transsexual based on the story of Christine Jorgenson, on which the film originally titled "I Changed My Sex!" previously it had to be based. <br /> <br /> Have I already left your jaw? Well, as far as I want to warn you from this image if you have never seen it, I would never say lies on a film and there is not a single word of falsehood in that synopsis of the plot I just gave you. Everything in it is true. This is a film about cross-dressers and transsexuals, a topic that does not seem very attractive to begin with and is not done in a very attractive way. I'm sure that with a good script and a good director (he didn't even) that "Glen or Glenda", despite the argument, could have been a very moving image. It's a sectarian film from Wood, because he was a transvestite in real life and on screen. But again, this doesn't make it a good movie ... or a watchable one for that matter. "Glen or Glenda" is a messy and messy mess of a film that sinks into new trenches in the realm of bad cinema. It no longer makes sense of his notoriously stupid scene where Bela Lugosi shouts "Pull the rope!" inexplicable footage of bison on the run. Most of the film is narrated in a monotonous voice, reminding me of some ugly short informative films I have seen before. It's like one of those really nasty short films that have expanded into a seventy-minute movie and twice as boring. We sit for years waiting for the plot that never comes. There is no real attempt to build energy with the camera locked in a position for many grueling minutes and long periods of time when nothing happens at all. The only moments that apply to anyone are those of Bela Lugosi who manages to bring some light into these dark trenches. I imagine that Lugosi should be like the divinity of the film, but personally, I couldn't care less about who or what it should be. I'll tell you what it was: a talented actor who ended up making garbage. But he and Wood were very close friends and we liked working with each other, so for him. <br /> <br /> I will always admire Edward D. Wood Jr. for his passion for cinema, but I will never do it while I live, I admire his films. A film critic has called the films of Ed Wood "innocent fun", but I think this is also questionable. Innocent? Yes. Fun? No sir. And if "Citizen Kane" is the Everest of the film world, then "Glen or Glenda" is probably the Mariana Trench.
