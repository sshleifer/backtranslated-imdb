Even if Ryan were not an annoying person, it would still be bad, I said though, where to start? "registers of registers" You will want to tear off his recorder and beat it with a hammer or point it in a lake, a haunted lake, of course. Oh, how I wish the "dead time" was more literal than the one they refer to, but alas, no death, maybe a pillow out of place or a "buzz" oh, wait for this the cat. Actually I expected to see some sort of evidence or at least something to check their escapades, don't worry, you won't see anything you wouldn't see on a normal day. <br /> <br /> A whole season and what they have to show for this, um nothing. No, in fact they have less than nothing, they have a waste of time. They took my challenge, doing something about the paranormal challenge. Now in this you actually do something about the paranormal, you could say go in the car and say "I love the paranormal so much that I will draw stylized ghost figures" or "I love the paranormal so much that I'll hot-run Eds pretending to be ghost hunters" you would be wasting a movie, but wasting it on the paranormal. Or you could say "I'll make a mess with a demon" but don't say it's the name you could hurt yourself, and you know that god doesn't like it, it would be pretty enough for god but he wouldn't like not to do it then. So I asked them to waste time on the paranormal and they followed the example, they went to an old building looking for "mothman", it was a waste of time, it didn't make any difference, it didn't have any effect, we didn't learn nothing new, it was a waste of time and film. <br /> <br /> The fantastic investigative work is so mysterious, "well we found your problem" a cat died here, so he was going to psychically communicate with that cat and say to go on, kind of throwing some 'of catnip, and everything will be fine ... registers of registers .... "Date of log log star 541.2 ... oh I mean" registers of registers, I have just brought up some new investigators, a pair of 8 and 9, but this chic is a 10 .... er ... yes, we have a new case ... strange things that happen .... ....... on one of the children ..... we were to investigate .. "Now we will bring is a psychic, we have not told them anything about what TV is to believe it,
