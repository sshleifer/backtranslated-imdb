I saw a big clip of this movie, which I'll talk about later, and then the cast list, and I thought I might even try it. Basically, an unfortunate bartender, Randy (Matt Dillon), his cousin cousin Carl Harding (Paul Reiser) and the murder investigator Detective Dehling (John Goodman) all have something in common, they saw the girl of their dreams (if married or not), and they would do anything to please and be with her, even to die. All three met her / they saw her "one night at McCool's", the bar where Randy worked, they don't know each other, but all three can't stop thinking about Femme Fetale Jewel Valentine (Liv Tyler's of the Lord of the Rings). All three are telling their stories to someone they hope will hear their rather intense and revealing stories, Randy talks to the hired Mr. Burmeister (Michael Douglas, who co-produced the film), Carl to the psychologist / psychiatrist Dr. Green ( Reba McEntire) and Dehling to the priest Father Jimmy (Richard Jenkins). They confess all the details of what they were willing to do, their sexual contact with her, and in the end they were all gathered in one place, all intent on being with her, and all involved in the latest shooting that leaves one dead, one run away (and eventually die) and one stunned, and the unexpected guy who chooses (but at the same time obvious, because he is obsessed with sex Douglas). Also starring Andrew Dice Clay as Utah / Elmo and Sandy Martin as Bingo Vendor Woman. If I had to choose a favorite moment, it would surely be the one that was mentioned at number 11 along with Cool Hand Luke in the 100 Greatest Sexy Moments, where Tyler copies the woman who washes the car with foam all over herself, and in front of Goodman, very sexy! Apart from that, not the most memorable film. All right!
