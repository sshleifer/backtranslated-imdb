I read the 28 most recent comments from various people about this film and I was surprised that no one mentioned the fact that the first victim was shown on the bed with "eyelids missing", while the camera opened and moved away face, flashes! Yes, BLINKS! I recorded it as it came out on HBO last weekend and when I saw it I had to literally replay it several times, focusing on one eye at a time to make sure I didn't see things! Of course, afterwards, it was difficult to take the film seriously, even though there were some interesting and intense scenes with Julian Sands. Very disappointed and give him a 4 mainly due to the fact that the first victim flashes in one of the last frames while the camera moves away from the body / face. Sin.
