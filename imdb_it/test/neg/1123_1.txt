National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure (2003) Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, Dana Barron, Jake Thomas, Sung Hi Lee, Eric Idle, Fred Willard, Ed Asner, D: Nick Marck. An embarrassing direct-to-video flop has cousin Eddie and family on a paid South Pacific vacation from his boss, hoping the donkey won't sue his company after being bitten by a smarter lab monkey! The idiotic spin-off can't match any of the holiday films (even the European holidays!), With a question about whether the filmmakers thought the script was really funny. Not even Quaid, Willard or Asner can make it remote to watch. 83 min., Not classified. *
