A unit of the Delta Force army, charged with finding a handful of bad green cap donkeys not known to be completely dispersed, will be fighting for survival against a cloaked skeleton man, the alleged spirit of an ancient Indian warrior who was revived when archaeologists disturbed his tomb. The Skeleton Man rides a horse and has the ability to push back and forth using a dimensional portal type, and seems to be unaffected by bullet fire and explosives. The Skeleton Man horse leaves no hoof prints and can ride silently from behind and around the prey. The point of view of the film through the eyes of the Skeleton Man looks at its prey with a different color. In other words, it is apparently not human, so how can Captain Leary (Michael Rooker, grizzled and intense as always) and his band of would-be commandos stop this threat? For some reason, the Skeleton Man kills the employees of a nearby chemical plant. What are the reasons of the Skeleton Man to slaughter endless human beings? And why does a blind Indian live in the forest that our commandos live spared if the Skeleton Man, as a man, massacred his entire tribe to test himself? <br /> <br /> As completely stupid as it seems. Incredible horrible. This is the kind of film that can absorb brain cells. Casper Van Dien gets a second billing in the credits right under Rooker, yet he is fascinated by a ridiculously signed character who leaves the film quite early. Rooker deserves better than this. If I were an actor, I wouldn't want this film in my resume. The Skeleton Man is a rejected Templer Knight of a film by Ossorio. He has a spear that can simply knock down some people while a woman's head explodes on impact. An arrow fired from the Skeleton Man's bow actually destroys the propeller of a chopper plane. For almost 99% of the film, the bullets are shot at Skeleton Man and he can get in and out of that thingee of the portal yet, eventually, suddenly, he becomes vulnerable to the attack. Oh, and the horses also change as the Skeleton Man moves freely through the forest from that portal. The film is written and edited by clowns. The attack scenes are poorly constructed and the characters, who are supposed to be experienced professionals, make really bad decisions in this film. The mind is amazed by this film. Good for some laughs, and some gore scenes make this piece of pure shit watchable like a trash movie.
