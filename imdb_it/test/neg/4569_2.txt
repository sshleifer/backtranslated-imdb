I'm not usually a fan of high school comedies, they rely heavily on bad humor and rarely move away from lines of stories and common characters and absolutely dull dialogues. However, I had my share of guilty pleasures, particularly when I was still in high school. Seeing so recognizable faculty figures getting their butts kicked always cheered me up and an occasional laugh could also be the case. These films only work if at least one of the characters is immediately likeable, not the case of "Cheats", especially not of the protagonist. Of course, it was not very helpful that the actor in the game was one of the most annoying, talented and arrogant boys I've ever seen in a play. <br /> <br /> To play in a comedy is no joke, it is difficult to be funny: the delivery must be right or the material must be wasted. In this case there wasn't a lot of good stuff to start with and the jokes that were half funny were professionally ruined by the cast. <br /> <br /> This film lasted 3 hours, the director has never heard of rhythm of course. Stay away from this, there are many other fun teen comedies out there like 10 things I hate about you, who your daddy is and Superbad.
