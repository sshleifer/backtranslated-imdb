Ouch !! What a mess we have here. Not so much confusion as a painfully boring and reckless excuse for exploitation. Brought to you by the one, J. G. "Pat" Patterson, yes, the same from Moonshine Mountain. Dr. Gore, formerly known as The Body Shop, is, I believe, somewhat inspired by Frankenstein, and God knows what else. The late Mr. Patterson also plays in this joke, like a broken-heart plastic scientist / surgeon who recently lost his wife in a car accident, and is mad with grief, to the point that it becomes clear that the next step is slaughtering of countless females, therefore perhaps stealing some graves for the parts of the body, in order to "put together" the perfect companion. It will not be easy, but thankfully his friend Gregg, the hunchback, is willing to help and offer moral support. <br /> <br /> If proof had ever been needed that some people's goals should not be fulfilled, here it is, band. Obviously this Patterson hayseed has never had anything to do with anything, much less, following in the footsteps of good old H. G. as a master of blood. I've never seen a gore film that only flatly refuses to give the viewer a single reason to keep watching. Even blood is boring. Sometimes, sometimes in a humorous way, but impossible to tell if it is intentional or not. I choose "not". <br /> <br /> Filmed in Charolotte, North Carolina (home of the California Ax Massacre), most likely, a 3-digit budget, from a boy, as untrained as he might have been, who probably had an appreciation for the drive-in garbage, so maybe we should give JG a good break, I mean, he tried (I assume) that it's more than can be said for the most part, and this movie is better than all the big superpowers that the theaters they put out these days, though, I realize it's not saying much. Furthermore, Dr. Gore is an improvement on Patterson's previous failure, The Electic Chair, so it is slightly possible that he would have improved his skill in time if he hadn't died, so maybe it's not that bad, especially compared to the other movie on DVD, How To Make A Doll, so hell, take a look. 4/10
