The biggest problem with "Searching for historical Jesus" is that there is absolutely no research on it. Shick-Sunn produced these "documentary" films in the 1970s and only in the 1980s, which included interviews with "experts" and discussions on "science" and "facts" to show that the film's title was trying to cash in. <br /> <br /> Sadly, "historical Jesus" is really little more than a third-level dramatization of Christ's life. Unlike "In Search of Noah's Ark" by Shick-Sunn, who spends most of the time spent discussing the possibility that the ark is on earth today and where it could be, this film is basically the story of Jesus effortlessly made to prove or disprove its existence. The famous Shroud of Turrin is mentioned, but little more detective work is given much time on the screen. <br /> <br /> For fans of these almost documentary films like "Jupiter Menace" and "In Search of Bigfoot", etc. , this film does not offer much.
