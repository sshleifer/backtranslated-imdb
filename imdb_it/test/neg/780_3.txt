Strangely, I have little to say about "The Box", so it will be short. I've never read Richard Matheson's novel "Button, Button" from which the film is based, but considering what I saw in this "adaptation", there couldn't have been much semblance for the work of such a legendary author. "The Box" is about a family that discovers a strange thing on the doorstep with a button. Frank Langella introduces himself and explains how he will be given a million dollars if they press the button - the only 'hold' is that he will automatically kill someone, somewhere ... ?? SPOILER ?? Do they push him ?? END OF SPOILER ?? The whole concept was interesting on its own, but somehow they managed to extend the film into some twisted stargate that filled it up to a pretty decent ending with a rather deep message. While I try to be as "fair" as possible, I still have to say that this was not my cup of tea and bored me severely. I imagine it's from the same director of "Donnie Darko" that I remember I liked when I saw him years ago. "The Box" would work well as a short film, but since it has been adapted so lifeless in this way, I can't get close to recommending it ...
