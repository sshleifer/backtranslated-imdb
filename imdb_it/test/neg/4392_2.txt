I have little or no interest in seeing another horrible film, which totally lacks something creative or fun, abusing the National Lampoon tag. How come something has caught my attention in the cast of this movie. I see the name of Danielle Fishel I'm a big fan of boy meets the world! But the movies are horrible. More than a fan, I am not rewarded by seeing his terrible movies with the naked breast treasure. So this is where my question comes. <br /> <br /> Has anyone seen this movie? And if so, is Danielle Fishel getting naked? He would save me the 2 hours of my life, I would never come back to watch this terrible movie. Many thanks
