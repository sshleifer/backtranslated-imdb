Few films have drawn expectations and shocked me as much as Fire. The film is pretentious garbage. It does not reach anything artistically. The only thing she has been able to receive is a ban in India. If only it were because of the poor quality of film production rather than the current controversy, the ban would have been more justifiable. <br /> <br /> Now that I have my discomfort with my system, I am better able to analyze the film: <br /> <br /> * From the beginning the film feels unreal especially when the protagonists start to converse in English. The director obviously did not make the film for an Indian audience; however he underestimated his international audience by simplifying it. Watching the character of domestic help conversing in perfect English is too unreal to be true. <br /> <br /> * Later we will have regular glimpses of Radha's dreams. These scenes are not very effective. They come as strident and hinder the flow of the film. I'm still wondering how that philosophical dialogue has connected to history. I felt that surrealism was lost. <br /> <br /> * Love scenes felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for the titillation of the public rather than being a powerful statement. In any case, they do not reach either of them. <br /> <br /> * The names chosen for women, Radha and Sita, are names of Hindu gods and have therefore been selected to shock the public. However, since the film was not meant for the Indian public in the first place, the shock-through-name-selection is not intended to achieve its goal, which is absurd. <br /> <br /> * The quality of the orientation is very poor and some important and delicate scenes have been poorly managed. A better director could have created a strong emotional drama out of the topic. <br /> <br /> * The acting was made of wood, although Nandita Das brought some life into the role, the others were wasted. I always thought that Shabana Azmi was a good actress, but her talent is not evident in this film. The male protagonists were decidedly junk. <br /> <br /> In case you are a fan of the Earth and want to see more of the director, stay away from this. Please.
