The success of the original French series "Emmanuelle" (I only saw the first one, which was not bad considering) led to a series of imitations; the Italian counterpart, who even changed the race of his heroine, was clearly less lucid and more exploitative - falling more and more into vulgarity as the series progressed. Incredibly, there were 16 "Black Emanuelle" films in total, with the heroine who even changed the name to avoid copyright issues !! Yet, Laura Gemser - the object that holds the desire - has become almost an icon as much as the original Emmanuelle, Sylvia Kristel (although, personally, she is too thin for my taste)! Here it is even advertised as "Emanuelle" rather than by its real name - with the director, likewise, becoming "Albert Thomas"! <br /> <br /> In itself, the film offers little interest: in fact, one would do better to face it as a travel diary with some decent shots of the African fauna. As for the sex scenes, I don't know how complete the version I saw but, while there was a lot of nudity, none was very explicit - or even titillating (the closest scene, perhaps, was when Gemser - who works as photographer - and her partner Karin Schubert light the camera on each other, naturally without clothes, in the middle of the jungle! The film also features a makeup artist like Salvador Dali but, fortunately, his scenes do not take up much time The soundtrack of Nico Fidenco is typically bland 70s pop and, actually, nothing to write home about.
