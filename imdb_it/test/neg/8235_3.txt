Luther the Geek (1990) is a boring horror movie and it's really bad even by Troma standards !! This is a monster that bites the heads of chickens and kills people by biting its neck, and actually thinks it's a chicken in person !!!!! Luther is released from prison after 25 years because he was obviously a "model" prisoner and deserves another chance in life (which is VERY difficult to believe after seeing how he acts and treats people during the film). <br /> <br /> After killing an elderly lady in a supermarket parking lot, she manages to slip into a woman's car, and proceeds to torture her, her daughter and her daughters boyfriend in their family home in the country. <br /> <br /> Then we are treated to a long boring and boring film, with a terrible acting until the end, before a useless policeman shows up to try to kill Luther once and for all !! Oh and the movie has a ridiculous and ridiculous ending too !!! I love low-budget horror movies and I think "The Toxic Avenger" is an all-time classic, but I'm afraid Luther the Geek is boring, illogical and boring, not so much in terms of gore, but just bloody worries around the neck and that's it! 3/10
