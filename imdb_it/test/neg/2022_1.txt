Space is a void, right? Therefore, space sucks. Even the vampires suck. A bad vampire movie set in space would have twice the suction power, right? <br /> <br /> It started with what could have been a fun premise. Reveal the story of Bram Stoker's Dracula in the future. There is a rescue team that is sent to investigate a merchant ship lost in the space called Demeter. Fans of the original novel will unintentionally assume that this will be a simple retelling of Dracula set in the future ... unfortunately, unless you share the names of the characters, it takes the most remote route and goes to the B-movie galaxy twenty minutes later Coolio becomes a vampire. Trust me when I tell you he's the best actor in the movie, and that's not saying much. <br /> <br /> Casper Van Dien should sell his goods on daytime television. Erika Eleniak should have stopped after leaving Baywatch and poor Udo Kier has trouble reading from the cues. The guy who plays Dracula in this is more ridiculous than Frank Langella in the 1970s version. If you can sit for the whole movie, you will be rewarded with the worst ending imaginable. The ending is surprising if the actors and crew realized what piece of garbage they were producing and left the set. <br /> <br /> Watch out, vampire fans. This sucks twice as hard.
