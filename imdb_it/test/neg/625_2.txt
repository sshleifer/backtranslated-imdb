When I was 8 and went through my Marx Brothers stage, my father read in the TV Guide that they were showing the Marx Brothers movie, "The Big Store", late Friday night, and set up the VCR to record it for me . When I woke up Saturday - due to a printing error in the TV guide - instead my father and I discovered "The Story of Mankind" had been recorded. <br /> <br /> "The Big Store" was probably one of the least fun of all the Marx Brothers films and yet it stands as one of the best cinematographic works of the century compared to "The Story of Mankind". I can almost justify the error of TV Guide, as the Marx Brothers - Groucho, Chico and Harpo - appear in both films. Although in "The Story of Mankind", they are divided into a series of independent scenes: Groucho plays Peter Minuit, Chico plays a guy who talks to Christopher Columbus and Harpo plays Isaac Newton ????? The scene of Harpo lasts about half a minute; Chico has only two or three lines; The Groucho scene is at least funny, but horribly racially insensitive by today's standards. The rest of the film does not bear mention. They brought out some of the best actors of the day and made them recite total garbage. What a disappointment. <br /> <br /> TV Guide, I sent you a nice letter, I'm still waiting for excuses. <br /> <br /> For the record: "The Big Store" has a lot of physical comedy with the Marx brothers on roller skates and a couple of Virginia O'Brien songs. I couldn't wait to see it.
