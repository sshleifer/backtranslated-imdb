A group of teenagers get together to discuss their fears, but an uninvited guest showed up and is killing everyone. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst horror movie of the 90s, Camp Blood (1999) is the only one that could challenge him for that title, has some of the stupidest characters and situations they can ever enjoy the TV screen. The so-called surprise ending is terrible, as is the rest of this film. Pleasingly entertaining a bad standard is of a good standard. My vote: 2 out of 10.
