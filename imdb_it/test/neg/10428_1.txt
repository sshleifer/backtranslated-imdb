The captivating and contemptuous story of the actor and the fall of the actor John Belushi of the journalist Bob Woodward becomes a completely misjudged film, a nebulous "fantasy" directed by Larry Peerce as if he were doing something sharp and vital. Michael Chiklis (years before his debut on "The Shield") finds himself in the unenviable position of portraying Belushi, embarking on a post-mortem journey through his life, recreating those sketches of "Saturday Night Live" that are now part of the story of TV. It's like watching someone trying to challenge Lucy Lucille Ball: it can't be done. The reason why there was such a pain at Belushi's death was because it was one of a kind. Chiklis makes a commendable attempt to look the part, and it's fun in one of the first scenes he tries to escape from the morgue. Still, it's an uphill feat and no actor - no matter how talented - could have saved him. * from ****
