Lil Pimp is the story of a boy who becomes a pimp. Animation and dubbing were perfect for this type of film. <br /> <br /> I laughed out loud for the first 20 minutes of this movie; mainly to the concept. After that, the joke thinned out. Like a 15-20 minute animated short, Lil Pimp would have been a classic. Instead, this film consists entirely of a joke that lasts too long. <br /> <br /> Weathers, voiced by Ludicrous, has several raw and fun one-liners. Unfortunately, this is all that the boy's pet rat is good since it contributes nothing else to the story. In the end, I became bored with his observations while doing the rest of this film. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of South Park and other adult-oriented animations. I also play several online pimp games, so I'm partial to the stories of protectors. The transition from the boy to the pimp was brilliant; but later, both history and dialogue have become redundant and predictable. <br /> <br /> I gave this film a five. It is worth looking for the great concept and vocal acting. Don't expect anything else or you will be disappointed.
