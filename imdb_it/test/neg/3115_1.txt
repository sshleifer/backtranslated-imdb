You would probably get something like this. I am translating films for a living and this is the first film of my 5-year work experience that I found offensive to my intelligence. Sure, there are stupid Hollywood movies about drunk teenagers in a spring break, but those films don't even claim to be serious works of art. But when someone looks for greatness and poetry, but offers a confusing (and often ridiculous) storyline, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogues ... Then you get the worst kind of film that some other reviewer very accurately defines as "pretentious "crap". To those who find this film intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it is your intelligence and your imagination that you obviously used to try to make sense of this pitiful attempt (it is in our human nature to try to make sense of things). <br /> <br /> Another thing: I can tolerate political misconduct very well, I am all for artistic freedom and the suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was too much. that someone told the director that it is ridiculous (even in an unrealistic art film) to portray a Slavic woman as a disordered and semi-articulated creature connected to the forces of nature, probably due to the fact that the whole childhood must be spent watching the stars and milking the cows on a three-legged stool.
