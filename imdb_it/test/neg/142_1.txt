This movie is over hyped !! I am sad to say that I can see the first 15 minutes of this film and something besides this, I will really have to force myself to sit and watch the rest of the film. It is totally stupid and very false. The robot in the film looks like a man wearing that steel suit and acting is really bad, especially the one who plays the character of Alien. It's totally annoying !! Don't waste your money watching this sequel to the famous Gen-X Cops. I'd rather sleep or spend my money on other things than watching this movie. 1 out of 10. If possible, I would give 0.
