Hulk Hogan and Zeus are horrible wrestlers and horrible actors. Hogan for some reason was popular enough to get a movie deal, I'll never know why. If it wasn't for Mcmahon's money, this stupid movie would never have been made. Maybe one day someone will make a good film about professional wrestling. No Holds Barred is not that movie.
