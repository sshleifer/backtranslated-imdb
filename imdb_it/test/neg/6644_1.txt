To date, I've never seen Elizabeth Shue in anything else because of the stench of this movie. Discontent, battered and racially Neanderthal, took place in a Chicago where every black person apparently lived in a blues club. . SPOILER NEXT. . . . . .. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: His solo of "blues" was even more painful to watch than his clueless acting and the intro in it - "Nobody leaves without singing the blues" - it was as silent as a post. The children her character babysat was unbearable and long before the end of the film I wanted something horrible for all of them. <br /> <br /> I have to say though, there's a special thing about this movie; it takes a lot for a film to offend me, but this piece of steaming tripe did what Chopper, the Phantom Minaccia and Catwoman couldn't do - makes me sick to my stomach.
