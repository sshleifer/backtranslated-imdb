I bought this movie in a thrift store. Months earlier, my friend told me about it when we were talking about stupid movies we saw. Once I found the tape, I knew I had to have it. I saw him that night. I could say that it would have been very poor and cheap. . . This is what attracted me. I entered it and laughed all the way. I recognized Gregory (The Ice Cream Man), but I didn't recognize his name and couldn't remember where I saw it. Later, while watching the Andy Griffith show, Clint Howard (Ice Man Man) appeared as an extra since he was Ron Howard's brother (Opie Taylor). I saw the credits and I jumped. I turned to my mother, who was also watching the show, and said, "That's the ice cream maker !!" She too panted. This film is fantastic, but only for laughter and criticality. It's the perfect example of a cheese horror movie. If you want to laugh and have fun with low budget movies, rent this video.
