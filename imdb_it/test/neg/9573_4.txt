As I write this in November 2005, I realized that the great boom of British cinema has come to an end and while people will claim that all this is due to the British government that does not grant tax relief to film producers, I think the cause is much simpler - A lack of diversity on the part of producers in recent years. Let's take a look at what the British were producing in 1995-2005: <br /> <br /> Funky gangster thriller. LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRALES was a really awesome and very funny movie and people did everything to make themselves a Guy Ritchie style with usually disappointing results <br /> <br /> romantic comedies. Yes, I realize that FOUR WEDDINGS, NOTTING HILL have been produced by American studios but they are still vaguely "British films". Unfortunately, as a profit is guaranteed for the studios, they must follow a winning formula that usually involves Hugh Grant and Hugh Grant for the umpteenth time <br /> <br /> Black Comedies. Can anyone explain what a black comedy really is? In the British context it is usually a rambling film with often contemporary political statements made and which often resemble Mike Leigh's NAKED. <br /> <br /> Jasmin Disdar's BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE is a good example of the third type of British film. Shot in 1999 but set in 1993, it opens with two men arguing over a bus and later revealed that one is a Serb and one is a Croatian, so we have a smaller version of what was happening in the Balkans at that time, even if the chances of two former enemies in the Balkans coming across each other on a London bus? This summarizes one of the main flaws of the film - Irony takes precedence over probable situations, it is possible to appreciate the final irony of the subplots but is the result likely? Perhaps the greatest irony is the title of the film. It's called BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE but certainly this member of the public has found the clich√©s of stereotypes that I could not believe as three-dimensional characters
