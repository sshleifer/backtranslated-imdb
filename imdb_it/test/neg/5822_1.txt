Terrible direction from a terrible script. Even the DVD seemed muddy and blurry. Risible accents on the whole map. Unlike most other commentators, I had no idea that they were guys in love in the mud, but this immediately became obvious from the opening scene and all the lovingly pulled shots of young naked or succinctly dressed, usually wet or shone with sweat, looking at each other with desire.
