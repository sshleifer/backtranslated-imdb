This was a Hindi movie. Hindi = horrible. reasons: economic dialogues, economic special effects, economic direction + extension of a film of 2 hours max in 3 hours. <br /> <br />% ^^^^^^ spoiler ... a little %%%%%%%%% <br /> <br /> In particular for this film: 1. the dialogues are not fun. they are poor and inexpensive. Although akshay tried his best acting for which I admire him, the play was not at all funny! I only laughed 3 times during this movie. 2. The first half of the film was useless for the history of the 2nd semester. the second half was the real story / film. the first time was the past / accumulated time. 3. The characters are not properly developed. paresh rawal is intelligent in the first half, an idiot in the second half / rest of the film. we do not really develop any feeling or care of akshay and govinda. their characters are no longer stupid. they don't seem to struggle in their difficulties. The jokes are fun, but they're not funny in a very serious scene. gang members and drug traffickers are poor and have been used in the last 20 films. there is nothing new about these characters. Again, they prove stupid for being funny. however, stupid = funny when the stupid is the norm during the whole movie. the only character that made sense was that of lara dutta with a true story. 4. the special effects were crap. at the end, he falls off the ladder of a fire truck. note that they are not actually scaled in the air. secondly, ppl starts to take off when the ladder starts to move. ppl cannot fly on a ladder when it moves ... they fall directly to the ground due to something called gravity. 5. the entire film has been nicknamed. all the dialogues were recorded after the film. The actors' lips have just synchronized with the dialogues. <br /> <br /> There are probably many other reasons why this movie was crap, but I can't remember them. watch this masterpiece of disgusting Indian movies of yourself not intelligent, even stupid, and you will agree with my review. ppl who likes Hindi movies, please increase your expectations for good quality in Hindi movies. <br /> <br /> Let me say that not all Hindi movies are bad. I like some of them. I didn't like this <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10 (1.5 for the effort of akshay and lara)
