With a humor that appeals to a restricted and exclusive audience, the average viewer will find it meaningless and monotonous. When Cartoon Network publicized this show, it was made to appear as if it were a big drama or event, complete with a real rain scene and government officials trying to catch the sheep. <br /> <br /> When it came out in the air, I was disappointed by the way all the characters were so one-dimensional and a totally insipid animation. The only thing that put something close to humor was the names of the characters like "Public Audience" and "Specific General", some vague references to cultural aspects, and how Lady Richington hit Sheep with her steel. <Br /> <br /> Slightly off topic, but I don't see why Sheep falls in love with that ball of dirty cotton balls called "Swanky". It was horrible!
