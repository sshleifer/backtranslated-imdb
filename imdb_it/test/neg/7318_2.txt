Oh boy .. This movie is so mediocre that I really don't know what to write about it. <br /> <br /> I think it's easier to write what is not: <br /> <br /> It's not very funny. It is not original And there is not a character in the whole movie that I care about. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a certain reality show on MTV, but without interesting people. It drags on and I can't wait for it to end. The only thing that kept me from turning it off was Jennifer Lyons (c: <br /> <br /> I thought a lot about this movie to find a good thing to say about it. What I liked was the reminder of not judging a person from the first impression you get (as Holly did when he accused Nicole) who earns a score of 2 out of 10 instead of 1.
