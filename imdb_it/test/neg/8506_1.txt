I remember this film with feelings of pure pleasure. . . agony. More than half of the film is commercial (no, really!). The slight excuse for a story could easily have been told in 25 minutes (and almost it is!) The end result is a predictable schlock love story, all obviously thrown together in a crass commercial attempt to snatch a few dollars in more from the contemporary Debbie Boone shot. Yes, it's so fast it was produced ... the song that "inspired" was still big on the charts when the movie was released! <br /> <br /> Despite having seen decades of bad films, this still impresses me with its extravagant jump, no holds barred, headlong into the most boring, absurd and indelible cinematic evil. It really deserves to be on the "Monsters" list of the 100 worst of all time, and has never left the top 3 on my "worst" personal list. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the pure masochistic thrill!
