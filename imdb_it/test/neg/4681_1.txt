Andy Milligan, the independent filmmaker from New York, directs this little "treatment" like his version of the legend Sweeney Todd. Sweeney cuts the throats of the customers in his barber shop and his cohort Mrs. Lovett turns them into meat pies. Fortunately I was well informed of the plot before seeing this misrepresented film. Milligan, for my money, must really be ahead of the worst directors in history of all time. In comparison, Ed Wood resembles Orson Welles. This movie is so bad in so many ways. Let's take the direction of Milligan for beginners. The quality of the film is grainy. The sound quality is grainy. Many scenes look as if Milligan were using a camcorder to film. The credits say "Photograped and directed by Andy Milligan". Do you want to take credit for the ceilings that appear after a scene of death? What about the atrocious musical score chosen for the film? The film cuts with one poor transition after another. Logic is used in plot creation. History has little to do with Todd's true legend. The murder scenes are abundant but not terrifying in any way. Hands, legs and other appendages are cut with the skill with which the assembly was performed: choppily! And let's take the breast in the cake scene. Yes, it's in there. Did the cake maker not know that a whole breast with a nipple filled an entire pie crust? Later we hear from our characters that "they were careful not to get caught" for the over 200 murders they committed. Obviously they are a pair of tits that I can't keep up with what's going on (I'm sorry it was too tempting). Actors are not too terrible to be honest. Some even have glimpses of talent and they all look like genuine English articles. Many non-erotic nude scenes are forced everywhere. Milligan apparently has some questions regarding sex. The threads of the weft are left free. The finish is almost unwatchable due to the bad work of the camera. I could go on and on. Did I like something about the movie? There is not much to be truthful. I have a high level of acceptance for films of this genre in terms of low budgets and marginal talent, but this film has no real purpose other than being crude and sick.
