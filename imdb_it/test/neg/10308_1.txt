Wow, there are no words to describe how bad this film is. I usually pride myself on being able to enjoy every movie, no matter how bad it is, but that was just too much. I would just like to suggest watching this movie as a torture device. If you can overcome the terrible plot and dialogue by looking at it in mute mode, the even more terrible work of the camera and the substandard special effects make this film a real horror. If you're thinking of watching this because you're a Sandra Bullock fan, don't worry because it has less than ten minutes of screen time, and its acting is absolutely atrocious. Not to mention the rest of the cast, which could be replaced by baboons who would do a better job, at least we shouldn't listen to the terrible dialogue.
