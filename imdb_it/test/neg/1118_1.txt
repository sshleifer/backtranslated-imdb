I am speechless. Matty Simmons managed to do something that I thought was impossible. He did "The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island" as "Citizen Kane". Doloroso can't even begin to describe this piece of ... I don't know. Mind you, the premise seemed fun, but now that I've seen it, it's fun in the way that dropping an anvil on the scrotum is fun. <br /> <br /> I will not bother to describe the premise, as the title says it all, if only to say that I don't think there was literally a funny thing in this film, not one, not even the monkey bite. How could one of the funniest characters in the "Vacation" series, the squalid white Eddie (Randy Quaid) garbage, be made so horribly unattractive? I've never felt so much sympathy for an actor in my life. I equally pitied the other actors participating in this "comic" atrocity, Miriam Flynn (Catherine, Eddie's long suffering, but solar), Dana Barron (the original Audrey Griswold), Fred Willard, and the extraordinary Sung Hi Lee ( maybe the only reason to watch the movie, if only with the sound off), except for that old Commie, Ed Asner (Uncle Nick), made him arrive. Alas, the public does not. I just say "thank God" that Chevy Chase, who has been in crisis for years, has avoided this splatter of diarrhea, it's the most brilliant move I've ever made. <br /> <br /> I don't know if you guys are religious like I am, but I know I'll be praying to the Lord tonight to add 2 hours (if not 2 years) to my life to make up for the time I spent watching television that I'll never go back otherwise. <br /> <br /> Hot Water Burn Baby says ZERO on 10 stars (If you take a few shots from the bong AND drink the water, maybe 1/10 of a star out of 10)
