I'm sitting here writing this review and the film isn't finished yet. In fact, I have just checked, and there are still 45 minutes to do. But it doesn't matter, you don't need to see it until the end. I will write this review and I will laugh while the film takes place in the background and stumble towards a presumably horrible conclusion that I never care to see or know. <br /> <br /> What does hostility to this film count for me? The characters are not credible. The plot is not credible. The pretentiousness of the film is nauseating. Basically, every element of the movie sounds fake. Obviously Buscemi thought he had something to add to the dozens of films that have already explored the well-worn themes of dysfunctional families and the apparent lack of meaning in life. However, Buscemi was wrongly wrong, because this film contains nothing new. It is very difficult to be depressing, but fortunately no one can be really depressed, because it is obvious that people like this do not exist in the world. <br /> <br /> What is depressing, however, is the awareness that somehow this film was voted as an undeserved prize. Disgusting!!!! In conclusion: stay away from this worthless movie at all costs.
