An unnecessary collection with nothing to add except badness, this is a definite case of neglected seconds for Robocop. The messiness of a sequel to Irvin Kershner, numb, less plots and tired, is watchable and even slightly amusing in an ambiguous and unpleasant way, but it has practically none of the original characteristics, emotion, intelligence or excitement. Instead, we only have another empty show of a blockbuster whose only reason for existing seems to be to disgust the viewer with relentless violence, which is much more brainless than anything else in the original. Omni Consumer Products, which created the original Robocop cyborg, has turned into a totalitarian force more than ever, with suspected Nazi-fascist banners, stormtrooper guards and rented tanks at the end; as for the anonymous Old Man (Daniel O 'Herlihy), he is less of a benevolent protector and more of a horrible type of Mr. Burns, he surrounds himself with moral lackeys who sincerely believe that putting the brain of a killer psychopath in the body of Robocop 2 is a good idea. Oh, and the first Robocop took a look somewhere in the middle of all this mess, even if you wonder what a good actor like Peter Weller has seen on Earth in the script. The funny Tom Noonan has nothing to do with the villain, while Nancy Allen is seriously wasted as a Robocop partner. There are some hilarious moments in all; the opening advertisement "Magnavolt", for example, but this is a bad sequel to the real big original.
