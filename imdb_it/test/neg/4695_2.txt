This film, which is a.k.a. "Life In the Fast Lane" is easily one of the least funny films I've seen in a long time. I think it was done thinking of the sick, twisted and exhausted women of L.A., who represent about 0.00000001 of the population in the United States. The characters are all one-dimensional, even the protagonist. After stabbing his boy in the head with scissors, a cheap (and unsuccessful) laugh is attempted by inserting a cap in the boy's skull to stop the bleeding. Oh, smart! Patrick Dempsey (whose films are almost always a class act --sarcasm) plays this "devil" that changes his life - but from what we've seen, his life has been this series of cartoons to begin with. No emotion, no laughter, no story. The only reason I gave this 2 is that Jeffrey Jones is ok as a priest and there is a bit of style (albiet zero substance) in the camerawork. Otherwise, one of the 5 worst movies I've seen. Grade 2 on 10 AN F! I think even the most addicted drug addict who would laugh at a toilet seat wouldn't like this movie. I can't stress enough how far you should stay. <br /> <br />
