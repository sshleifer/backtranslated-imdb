This was an abyssal show. In short, he spoke of this boy named Doug who had a strong sense of guilt. He could seriously feel guilty for killing a fly, then feeling guilty for feeling guilty for killing the fly and so on. The entertainment was grateful and unpleasant and the jokes were cheap. <br /> <br /> It was broadcast here in Sweden as part of the "Disney time" show and I remember I liked a little of what I later shot 13. <br /> <br /> I never understood because some of the characters were also green and purple. What happened? <br /> <br /> Truly a horrible sight. Apparently it has generated a film I've never seen, but I don't have high expectations for that either.
