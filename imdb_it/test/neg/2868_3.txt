I just saw Fingersmith and I'm amazed to see the average score of 8/10 for the show. <br /> <br /> Not only was the plot difficult to follow, but it seems that the character's development was applied casually. <br /> <br /> The actors were adequate, but in an attempt to create twists, their characters are rendered entirely one-dimensional. Once this happens, the story becomes really flat and becomes boring. <br /> <br /> And in case someone didn't see the predictable lesbian undertones from miles away, this is hammered home in the most trivial terms at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The final scene is disappointing and he called, and everyone who sat down and went "Ohhh, so they were all carpet eaters all along!", had to be out for the evening. <br /> <br /> Two stars for tonsil hockey in the previous scene which was at least a little vulgar, none for the rest ...
