The lonely, disconnected and bourgeois housewife, in the midst of a divorce, seeks comfort to reflect on her immediate future. In a kind of bed and breakfast from (well, literally in the sea) the ocean that for some strange reason escapes the owner. Enter the lonely, arrogant Richard Gere. He is a plastic surgeon. He is the only guest of the inn in the sea. Diane Lane is the lonely housewife. You'll never guess that these two fall in love immediately. A tropical storm makes them true lovers. <br /> <br /> The subplots in this melodrama have little or no meaning. The locations, the photography are fine. Gere remains one of the most overrated actors in the cinema and does not disappoint. Mrs. Lane must have needed the money, but call gracefully on her side.
