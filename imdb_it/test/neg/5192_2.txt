I saw this movie 2 weeks before going on a snowboarding holiday, so for me it was just to think about my vacation mode. The film boasts some sweet snowboarding skills, in all the movies in the action scenes. These moments were great, a bit like watching the extreme sports channel. Unfortunately the story was quite honestly horrible, the acting was generally fine, with a fairly small cast. This film is apparently a comedy, at least it tries to be comical, but it seems that the comedy and the plot have been written by a teenager. The story has no depth or purpose and the comedy struggles to be more than a little laugh a few times during the film. It might be worth renting just to see the action of the snowboard, but then there are a lot of movies out there that are totally dedicated to snowboarding stunts and don't have a funny story written badly by the UN.
