I don't recommend watching this movie if you feel easily offended. I don't even feel offended easily and this film made me frustrated. It's so disgusting. And it doesn't make sense. The whole internet thing is so clich√©, and the producer obviously didn't understand all the "internet rules". When you chat with someone, you can monitor their IP address. Really? (see the sarcasm here). It was stupid. Needless. And I haven't even looked at the end. I could always say "this doesn't make sense, this either ..." This movie is pure shit at its best. Nice comment, right?
