Hard to believe - but it is! I shouldn't be surprised. The spots try to show how unique and "fun" a show can be. Yet not only the ads that announced this new show have the least humor for me, I haven't talked to anyone who has found the ads fun too. <br /> <br /> I never remember seeing a pilot so lacking in intelligence, cuteness or humor. The characters were mostly unbearable. Especially that of Selma Blair (which is surprising that you agree to be in a fecal sample of a show like this). The few moments when the characters were slightly redeemable were considerably trite and trivial. <br /> <br /> Rare is the show without redeemable qualities. And this is not one of them. Kath and Kim have exactly ONE redeeming quality - and it's Selma Blair. Despite wearing disgusting clothes and behaving like a pitiful, stupid excuse for a young woman who looks like a cross between Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian, Selma is still nice to watch. <br /> <br /> But if you want to watch Selma, go get Hellboy. At least you will maintain a minimum of respect for her instead of burning this abominable character in your brain to associate it with her. <br /> <br /> All in all, Kath and Kim are a waste and really embody the worst that TV is or has always been. Set a new minimum.
