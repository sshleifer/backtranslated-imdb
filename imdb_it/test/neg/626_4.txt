Irwin Allen's first adventure in a star show was a catastrophe for a star. The Story of Mankind contains some of the most incredible casting decisions of all time. Virginia Mayo in the role of the blonde Cleopatra, Dennis Hopper who chews the landscape with Napoleon, Peter Lorre who feeds for weeks on the stage as Nero, Marie Wilson as Marie Antoinette as a Marilyn Monroe road show, are just some of them. <br /> <br /> The film is also known to be the last film that featured all three Marx brothers even though they all have different roles. Chico plays a monk who is the confidant of Christopher Columbus, Groucho euchres the Indians outside the island of Manhattan as Peter Minuit, and the most surprising of all, Harpo Marx in the role of Sir Isaac Newton who discovers gravity when an apple convinces him on the bean. <br /> <br /> Holding all these portraits together is a story in which humanity itself is judged. A super H Bomb is about to be discovered and unleashed will be part of the world's population. It's a day of judgment coming. <br /> <br /> But humanity has its supporters and detractors. Speaking on the charge, Old Scratch has brought the worst in man in the form of Vincent Price for centuries. But the man also has his good side and who better than Ronald Colman to demonstrate the man in his most civilized aspect. Colman and Price support their case before The Judge played by Cedric Hardwicke. <br /> <br /> In those three individuals you have some of the best talking voices that the English language has ever known. When the movie is about them while everyone pulls out the exhibits for their case, it's a pleasure to listen to it. Then, when you focus on the individual stories, you want to scream in agony. <br /> <br /> What Irwin Allen was driving at, I'm still trying to figure it out. Was he deliberately camping with some of these casting decisions? If it was satire, it didn't work out. <br /> <br /> This was Ronald Colman's farewell film and although it's not something I'd like to get out of, I can't think of any man who could have declared the case better for civilization. <br /> <br /> So when you see The Story of Mankind, quickly advance through some of the exhibits and treasure every moment the defenders are in front of the judge.
