I liked Half-Life. I'm still a fan. It was scary, intelligent and stimulating. I'm not saying any news is one of the best FPS ever made. Maybe I'm a hardcore fan of Half-Life too, but the so-called Half-Life 2 isn't Half-Life 2. <br /> <br /> And I have a question: IS THIS the next chapter in Half-Life? Maybe the creators, Valve, think so, but I don't. Where are the smart enemies? Where is the scary atmosphere? Nowhere. I think they wanted to do a slightly different Half-Life (instead of another story from a research station), but they didn't do a very different one, they did something that had to do with Half-Life such as Quake for Destiny. The whole game is so unpleasant and unreal that it is almost abandoned. <br /> <br /> Even if the physics is truly exceptional and the level of play is good, the idea of ​​making a revolutionary game guided by physics has failed. When you get the Gravity-gun, which can move objects, you can expect with the rights to use it as a weapon - which would overturn the schematic gameplay of FPS. The truth is that you can't use Gravity-gun as a real weapon. Why? Because the best you can do is throw boxes and barrels that don't do much damage. If you want to keep an object in front of you to protect it, it can fall about 3 rounds. If you want to throw a barrel that explodes against your enemy, it can explode in your "hand". The gravity gun doesn't work like a weapon. The best use is to solve some physical problems. I ask Valve: why? The truth is that you have to use your boring and schematic FPS weapons until the end (except for the last level). Weapons are not what made the original Half-life a classic. If Gravity-gun was always on the last level, a real weapon, I would admire what Valve did. But not this. This is disappointing. <br /> <br /> So if you want Half-Life then you are looking for the wrong place. Maybe you will like it but I repeat: it's all but not Half-Life and not even a faithful continuation of it. This is the biggest disappointment of all time. The valves have shown that they can even make horrible games. They managed to do it.
