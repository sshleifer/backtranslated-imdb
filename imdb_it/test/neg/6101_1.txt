And again, Columbia Pictures decides to simply "hash" using the original version with Curly and without any of the gags or jokes to start! Towards the end of this pitiful movie when Joe gets stuck riding the bull, the studio hasn't even made an effort to record the sound again, because if you listen carefully you can still Curly here by going "Woo woo woo woo". Also, when Moe and Larry launch the darts to "slow the bull down so it can fall", this is raised directly from the original because you can actually see that Moe and Larry appear "magically" 15 years younger. Why, why did Moe allow this to happen? It is a burning question that probably can never be solved because, as far as I know, in real life he was quite sensitive to any kind of criticism and had rather high standards for his work, like Larry, Curly and Shemp. Don't waste time with this.
