One complete zero out of four. A worse part sums up Ajooba: terrible. In reality, other words come to mind: ridiculous, third choice and terrible. This is one of the worst films of Amitabh ever, it struts with a cheap leather jacket and a zorro mask that is just as expensive in foil with what look like wings on the sides. <br /> <br /> The film is set in ancient Persia or Arabia and is typically non-historical for an Indian film. As mentioned above, a leather jacket from K-Mart with Velcro straps did not exist 400 years ago, unless all my history teachers were wrong. <br /> <br /> Rishi also does its patented cross-dressing in this film. Far from being funny, it's very embarrassing to watch. What could the legendary Raj Kapoor's son have to flay the memory of his house like this on the screen? <br /> <br /> The good points, if you want a real laugh, go ahead and watch this movie. The conspicuous inconsistencies in the plot and the costumes are not up to the horrible dialogues and the poor acting.
