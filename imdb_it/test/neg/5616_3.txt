I was the first to expect this film to be good enough, maybe my expectations were a bit too high, but the fact is that I love Judd Nelson. Actually, it's the only reason why it's worth watching this movie and really its role isn't really that great. The highlights of this film are vulgar sex scenes and boring dialogues. If these are the highlights I am sure you are getting an idea of ​​what kind of movie it is. There is certainly a reason why this was done for a television movie. See this only if you have nothing better to do on Friday nights or simply waste money on video rentals. Save time and rent the breakfast club!
