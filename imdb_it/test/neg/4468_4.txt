The previews were so funny that I couldn't wait to see this movie. I just got home and I have to say that I couldn't have been more embarrassed in this movie. Yes, there were times when the jokes were funny, but the stereotyped roles were painful. Joan Plowright is a good actress, but the scene with the "negro spiritual" was in bad taste. Needless to say, the laughter was few and far between the films for a largely white crowd (I was one of the very few blacks).
