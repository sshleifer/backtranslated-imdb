If I had known what I was submitting to myself, I would have escaped from the theater. The film is terrible, in the literal sense of the word. Despite the striking images, the intriguing premises and a subject that could be fascinating, the film is dead. I was not familiar with this period of Greek history and I prepared to experience a great film. The directors' hand is heavy. it is not enough to see a passing train; we have to watch it from afar, we have to watch it in the car, we have to see the smoke, we have to see it slow down, and we have to see it stop. The director's approach is educational. In the same way, the characters he creates never develop, they never change. Are they so stereotyped that we wonder, are they meant to be Everyman? Any girl? Everyoldmusician? Is there any point in this allegory? It's the most pretentious film I've seen in a long time.
