As much as we can welcome a film about people who have different romanticism challenges, I can't shake off the feeling that this film was intended as a C-level porn movie directed on video where A) the actors they backed off from making the explicit scenes or B) the producers ran out of money to hire the inserts (a fantastic thing if it were true). <br /> <br /> I had to go back to Blockbuster to figure out why I never rented it, which was due to an adulterously gullible cover story, which seemed to imply a seductive John Waters-style humorous party with a sexual theme. Ok, I've laughed a couple of times and it certainly has a sexual theme (although most of it can't be described as stimulating in any way). But in some movies you could rewind to make sure you heard the dialog box correctly - on this you advance quickly because you already know what they are going to say. But there's nothing to send quickly, so just fast forward on the shelf.
