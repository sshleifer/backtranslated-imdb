I think I saw a highly modified version because it wasn't nearly as graphic as I expected, based on the other reviews I heard. <br /> <br /> In addition to being 1. written by the same person who wrote the original "Emmanuelle" (1974), Emmanuelle Arsan, 2. the main character is a sexually free spirit, and 3. being set in the place exotic of Asia, "Laure" does not have the same charm as its predecessor. <I just found this film too convinced with philosophical arguments that I'm not particularly interested in, namely the voyeuristic and open relationship between Laure and Nick, "I'm just happy with whatever brings you pleasure" ... something in this sense. I can't relate to this mentality and the film / characters don't really shed light. <br /> <br /> The second part of the Mara tribe research seemed to be a completely separate film. One of which I didn't care. At that point, I was just hoping it would turn into a porn, so at least it would keep my interest. <br /> <br /> Maybe I didn't understand it. <br /> <br /> I'll leave it to this.
