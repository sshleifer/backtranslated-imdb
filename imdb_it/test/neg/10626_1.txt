Great spoiler right here: this movie is B! TO! D! But have fun, that's fine. <br /> <br /> Bugged is the kind of movie you can't believe exists, with so inept dialogue, plot and direction that the home video of Carlsbad Cavern by Uncle Ned looks like an IMAX experience. Since it is a Troma movie, there is a lot of cold blood on tap, but it is even more foolish than usual. <br /> <br /> Most of the money for the production seems to have gone to buy drinks and sandwiches for the cast and crew. The brilliant dialogue is best summarized in the immortal, "% @ # $! What was it?" which is second only to the most often shouted, "Now what?" <br /> <br /> Any knowledge of how people act in a desperate situation is foreign to Ronald Armstrong, the writer / director. When one of the friends is found eaten alive by a grasshopper / termite / chiapet thing, Armstrong immediately makes his survivors survive with the pretty, but stupid, "Divine" handle. While being hit, Divine is cooking a large steaming pot of a mixture of rat / oatmeal poison on the stove, stirring, smiling, stirring, smiling, never falling to death from the fumes! <br /> <br /> Killer insects are as scary as pi√±atas, which look too much like them. The effects used to move them include dragging them through the tile floors very quickly with the legs dragging behind. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film would probably have been the bursting of the house, but they were either cash or never had, so instead of seeing a miniature go up in flames, it simply leaves the screen become black (eat at heart out of ILM). <br /> <br /> The cast is practically all black. How can the NAACP constantly censor something really funny like Amos and Andy (which describes characters certainly not less similar to those of 99% of all white comedy shows), but says nothing about something like Bugged. Oh well, it's better not to know how humiliating this movie is for everyone (as it would be if it were played by a single ethnic group, frankly). Before putting the kabosh on Bugged, get some friends and get ready for the Plan 9 of the Bug Exterminator movies.
