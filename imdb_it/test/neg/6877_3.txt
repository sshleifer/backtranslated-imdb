There he is. A new horror icon for the new millennium. Better than Freddy. More dangerous than Jason Vorhees. More evil than Michael Myers. Hard to believe, I know. But his time is here .... <br /> <br /> Ray The Prick. <br /> <br /> Yes, the antagonist, Ray is a complete Prick. This is partly due to the bad things he does. Also because he has a scar (oh, scary) on his face. But above all because Ray The Prick was milked. <br /> <br /> Yes, Ray doesn't channel evil. He is not even cursed, not even by a voodoo spell. No, Ray The Prick has been milked. As DeNiro once said, "you can milk anything with your nipples". And Ray has been milked. Evil. <br /> <br /> How do you milk the evil you ask? Snake nipples, I reply. Snake nipples. <br /> <br /> Why do you ask Ray? Because it's a Prick, I answer. Capital P. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the New Line Pictures extravagance entitled "Freddy Vs. Ray The Prick". <br /> <br /> Your new horror savior was Jeeper The Creeper? Well, not anymore, because Ray The Prick is here. And it scares me. <br /> <br /> Too bad for the atmosphere less bad than PG-13, the quality of the non-original film, because Ray is a star.
