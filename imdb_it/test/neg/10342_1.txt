Far from combining the best pieces of Pontypool and 28 days this has managed to ignore them. While you copy them without shame. (if that makes sense?) Pontypool was different and progressively more tense, this stinks. The radio DJ, "we have to be on the air", does not go unnoticed. He sits on his back and watches TV for news. This is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie ever. Is there only one person in the United States or even the world who doesn't know what a zombie is? Or ever heard of the word "zombie"? Well, in the 50th minute this group of maladjusted still calls the zombies, "the infected ones" or those with "anger". The word "Zombie" could make an appearance later, I could care less. Maybe there is a copyright where you have to pay to use certain words? How the Bluetooth headset is called "the ear-thing", I'm not kidding! Finally, no plot + no acting = nobody cares. A waste of time, a shameless one, badly stolen.
