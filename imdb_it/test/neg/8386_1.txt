I saw this movie last night, even though I rented a horror / scary movie from the hit movies and got one. The opening scenes were so long, the conversations between the characters seemed to lead nowhere. <br /> <br /> The plot seemed so poor to me, she gave him HIV and then she meets someone else, but she is killed by the man she infected (I think she could have done it for a long time for different people) Then, when he knocked down the body, he was the man he would meet, he was in the forest and he saw him unloading his body. Then he chased them (he never finished burying the body ??) and they got into a car and he somehow found them from a different direction they came from and killed the boy. <br /> <br /> I think the severed head was the only good thing about the film as it was quite realistic. and then when the woman ran he happened to fall in front of him so he could stab her with a spade !! AND THEN IT'S FINISHED !! <br /> <br /> What a relief, it was the most useless film I've ever seen ... please, avoid it, it's so badly done, I only counted 5 different people and the scene where it kills it is so unrealistic and they only swear to us and that's it !! This is from me ... <br /> <br /> WELL-CLEAR STEER !!
