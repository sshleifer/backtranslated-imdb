Margaret Mitchell turns in her grave every time someone looks at this mess! The costumes and set designs can't even begin to overwhelm the poor performance of Joanne Whalley (like the title character) and the ever-bland Timothy Dalton (like Rhett). Even worse than acting - and perhaps partly the explanation - is the script, which is incredibly clich√© and predictable. Add to that hellish script a soundtrack that will make you shudder, and you have a disaster that I do not wish on any spectator. SCARLETT is simply incredibly bad, and I can't imagine how it was ever made, much less arrived at the video.
