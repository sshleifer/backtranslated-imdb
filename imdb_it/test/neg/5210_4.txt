Director Nico Mastorakis has made a cynical charmer of money (by his own admission) that he is too cynical to impress anyone but a fan of the latter's genre. <br /> <br /> The most extreme genre photos, of comparison, to paraphrase a character in VIDEODROME, "to have a philosophy"; this is what makes them dangerous. <br /> <br /> The philosophy of ISLAND OF DEATH is to throw many "shocking" elements into a film mix and move slowly. The result is a dish without taste but an ugly appearance. <br /> <br /> Not to be confused with the brilliant Serrador WHO CAN KILL A CHILD? (sometimes called ISLAND OF DEATH), the effort of Mastorakis is set on a Greek island that is a stage for various forms of slaughter, a bit of bestiality and some wholesale perversion. <br /> <br /> Everything moves at an extravagant pace and the violent sets are misguided. <br /> <br /> Described as "The film that the censors did not want you to see", I would venture the hypothesis that the censors have never seen it, they simply read the presskit until their knees jerked toward the 'high.
