The film started very well ... so far Isabelle's exorcism could be believed ... but later, god !!! I didn't know if it was a horror film, a dramatic one or one not to be seen! The possessed creature that attacks the sheriff has no connection with the movie .... the trick !! At first it seemed quite true, but in the end, the last part of the film, the makeup (especially the teeth and eyes) was very exaggerated. If you want a good movie "The Exorcism" by Emily Rose ". <br /> <br /> Together with" Hard Candy "(Totally boring, pathetic plot and ending), these two films are the worst I've seen from Lionsgate !! But the film company has given horror film fans excellent films, but with this, we wish you never to rent them !! Exorcism movie fans, stay with two "The Exorcist" and "L 'exorcism of Emily Rose "
