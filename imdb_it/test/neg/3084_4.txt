A naughty girl (yes, the weasel is as complex as her character is) does not accept no for an answer and does bizarre things to bring her husband back. It is too far-fetched to be credible with characters so inconsistent that they go through the movements. But it is not far-fetched enough to be fascinating in the way it is called Being John Malkovich. So he ends up getting bored. <br /> <br /> sv
