A man wonders if his hunky collaborator is gay. At a garden sale he finds a ray gun called "Gaydar". Point it to a person, pull the trigger and tell you how gay I am. He tries, works and starts traveling to find out if his colleague is gay like him ... <br /> <br /> Promising idea ruined by a little funny script (after a promising start) and a terrible acting. The entire cast overhangs and basically SCREAM their jokes to each other constantly. It gets annoying and really embarrassing after a while. The saving grace is that it is short, there is a scene that steals a cat (I love it by falling out of the kitten bed) and Charles Nelson Reilly is hysterical in his short bite. But none of this saves the film. I can't recommend it at all.
