This self-important and confusing "b + w movie" resembles a child in a bad acid trip. You are dealing with something that reminds you of a piece of rotting lettuce that accidentally fell from the back of a garbage truck: nobody cares to touch it because it will probably be washed away by itself along the storm drain. There is no space for the plot when you have "visceral images" and "thin" allegories. For me, it seems that the director tries to make the next great art film while he begs for the recognition of intellectuals. I didn't bring my cap either. Looking at this, I felt almost insulted since the "movie" does such an effective job of getting away from you.
