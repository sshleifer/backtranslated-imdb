I had the chance to see if maybe a good movie of World War I had let me off guard - it's not like that. John Phillip Law and Don Stroud are both rigid in their acting and disbelievers for their roles. The dialogue is stupid or non-existent; the sequences in flight are ok but rather repetitive. Compared to the fantastic "Blue Max" this film should never have been made. Look at George Peppard, James Mason and Usula Andress in the BM and you understand why that film is one of the best war movies ever made and this is not. Recently released on DVD Richtofen and Brown is presented as a great "lost classic" of the 70s, I resold it the day after I bought it. Don't waste time or $.
