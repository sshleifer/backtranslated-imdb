While walking to buy cigarettes, professional dancer Daniel (Tom Long) is kidnapped and forced to have vicious sex for three days by three hooded women. When he is released, the director of his company Isabel (Greta Scacchi) has already replaced him in the game and his girlfriend gives him a cold welcome. Daniel, disturbed and humiliated, leaves the dance company and travels obsessed to look for the kidnappers. Daniel has sex with many women he suspects might be kidnappers. <br /> <br /> "The Book of Revelation" is a bizarre film with a promising start that loses its initial power and becomes a sort of too long erotic soap or soft-porn chic. The production is classy, ​​the cover of the DVD is fantastic but the characters are not well developed and Daniel's trauma seems excessive because most of the men would fantasize with the dream situation that was submitted to him ?? become the sexual object of three sexy women. Melodramatic development with Isabel's disease adds no value to the plot; the open conclusion is very disappointing and there are no explanations about the women's motif or the title. It is clear that the script of a man's feelings was written by a woman. It was good to see the beautiful Greta Scacchi again and her makeup is impressive in the end. There is a saying in Portuguese that could be translated into English as follows: "If rape is inevitable, relax and come". Daniel should have done it and saved me from watching almost two hours of a useless story. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Livro das Revelações" ("The Book of Revelations")
