He unjustly gave him a 3 - a point each for Fonda, Stanwyck and the supporting cast. <br /> <br /> I've never seen it before - I'm looking at it right now and just got to the part where Henry Fonda is taking Babs over the threshold. If I keep watching, it will only be to see if Fonda and Stanwyck will be able to extract this from the dumper. <br /> <br /> But after reading the other comments of the viewer, I'm not very optimistic. <br /> <br /> The opening ski scenes were enough to send me out of my lunch. The voice-overs were obviously done in a recording studio, and the montage between the external shots and close-ups was horrendous. I don't know much about the technology of that era - but I can't believe there wasn't something they could do to make it more credible. <br /> <br /> My second start of disbelief was when Fonda swept out and (I guess because of the extreme speed of travel) he was dug upside down in the snow to his torso - Stanwyck pulled him out obvious scenic difficulty - and, (I guess because you are such an experienced doctor) do not react entirely to his seemingly unconscious state and his limping position. <br /> <br /> Look, I am completely capable of suspending disbelief, but I could not overcome the fact that she had just pushed a man with a possible head injury and could be paralyzed for life. It's not my idea of ​​great yuks. <br /> <br /> So, as I finish this comment, we have just seen Kirk's first jealous outburst, and Dr. Hunt is out to perform an appendectomy! I'm not sure what I hate most: the script, the background music or the story !! Argghhhh! I finished. Game over. Click.
