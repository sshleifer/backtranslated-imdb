I don't feel comfortable finding "redeeming social value". Any book or movie that people want to suppress, from Huck Finn / Heart of Darkness to, I don't know, Deep Throat or the last beheading of the hostages, honestly, I wish they didn't. I'm not a lover of porn or violence-like-entertainment, but which of them do I tend to see angles of shooting, cuts, pans, lights, rhythms, almost with the exclusion of fear or titillation, sometimes even dispersed intent of filmmakers or actors. Even from the film that reasonable people could object, it should never exist, I always imagine that there is something to learn. I wonder more about how it makes a film rather than what it does. Maybe it's wrong on my part. More wise, but more difficult than deconstructing unpleasant cinema, could be see cuts, pots, etc., in one with and inseparable from any content. I wonder what horror film directors and ecclesiastical architects have in common. Add to political, fascist and non-fascist directors. They all manipulate with light, space and sound to alter perception and mood. How different are their goals? How different are the goals of those who film the real atrocities to be used as propaganda? <br /> <br /> When the original All Night Long (ANL) trilogy appeared on my shelf, I left it unused for almost a year. Curiosity had made me buy. I tasted a few minutes of "1" on the day it arrived, until the street shot of the awkwardly played corner of the street that really looks like an attack on the sensitivity of the viewers, found inept but effective. I should come back to it, of course, but I didn't like the perspective. Clearly this was not the sublime horror of Kairo, Cure, Angel Dust, Lain, the crudest yet traditionally framed horror of the first Evil Dead Trap, Koji Wakamatsu's overtly political work, or even the brilliant harshness of the first Cronenberg. br /> <br /> Perhaps the word "attack" is the key. Matsumura attacks not his characters, but his spectators. I can't look at them at this point in history without thinking about Abu Garib (some of which I think I remember was highlighted in the video) and the videos of the hostages, but also about the torturers of Godard (in Le Petit soldat?) To which atrocity is alone a job, a fraction of a person's workday. And then there is the long and prolonged news of Northern California, the details of which I can hardly remember but which I cannot completely forget because it also involves "cinema", a known serial killer duo, if the suggestion is not play with my memory, for having taken victims of torture. <br /> <br /> All three of ANL's voices are revenge cinema, vigilante exercises, but I attach ANL3 because it is the most ambitious and could be a turning point for director Matsumura. (I have not seen the rumors that followed ANL3.) Through the first two offers, I imagined a camera falling into the hands of one of those marginal children of middle school or grammar who obsessively draw war scenes or other atrocities. (Or as if one of Matsumura's crazy revenge characters had turned into a screenwriter and director, whoever saw those who didn't see Michael Powell's Peeping Tom would do well to see it.) But ANL3 seems to aspire to the mainstream. The protagonist of Matsumura cultivates carnivorous plants, allowing some natural, prominent shots, typically Japanese. There is also, for the first time, a film by Matsumura, a traditionally erotic sequence: the female head of Kikuo sneaks up and begins to caress him while peering at the customers of love. Kikou finds himself unhappily in the middle. He is an intermediary guardian. The brief thrill comes from the layers of voyeurism. There is also a philosophical / poetic trash set, a garbage voyeur that somehow makes me think of the repeated poem in Go-Go, Secondtime Virgin by Wakamatsu, which is not at all what it seems. <br /> <br /> I'm not going anywhere with this, and it's hindering my comment on other films. I can not escape the suspicion that in a few years I will enter a retrospective of Matsumura in my local film archive, perhaps hosted by an educated character who is taken by something I miss. <br /> <br /> How much does it matter if the director is or simply "takes" his incredibly confused protagonists? Does he also need to understand them? Maybe a director's job is just to throw it up, so let critics, sociologists and the rest of us tear to pieces. Perhaps the responsibility for directing or art is a fake notion. <br /> <br /> My last fight with this thing made me think about what the hell a woman thinks of observing these overwhelming male exercises. We put women over and over again, from star wars to et cetera etcetera, and so on and on and on and on, but everything is just as masculine as the All Night Longs?
