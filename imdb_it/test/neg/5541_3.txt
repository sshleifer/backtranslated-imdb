I realize that this is a small statistical sampling (8 votes as per this post), but 5.9 out of 10? I'm giving a 3 movie and that's generous too. I tried watching this movie three times now (Saturday night at 9:00 am first on the SciFi Channel, and Saturday night at 1:00 am and Thursday night re-broadcasting) and I fell asleep all three times before the movie ended. Which leaves me with a list of unanswered questions. For example, is Lance Henriksen short on money and must continue acting in secondary roles in these terrible "Pumpkinhead" sequels? Has Henriksen contractually banned making any non-Pumpkinhead movie? The creators of this franchise can't do better than a monster that looks like a geriatric and emaciated "Alien" who walks as if he had a stick stuck in his a **? When will the hick characters in these films realize that guns and rifles don't hurt the "Pumpkinhead"? Why don't they try to block another stick on this thing a **? And finally, are the authors of this film so creatively challenged that they can't find names for the two most original fighting families of Hatfields and McCoys? While you're at it, why not write a screenplay about an imaginary president and call him George Bush? One day I might have the mental strength to watch this movie to the end without falling asleep. Until then, if anyone has the answers, please let me know.
