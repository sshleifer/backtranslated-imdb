What Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine is better at getting into the psyche of Garry Kasparov during the 1997 competition against IBM's Deep Blue. You see it becoming increasingly paranoid and increasingly destroyed, all because in the second game, Deep Blue made a move that seemed too human for its preconceived notion of chess computer. Kasparov has therefore thought, and continues to do so, that IBM has cheated. <br /> <br /> Game Over seems to be impartial, but it is clear that the director thinks IBM has cheated. However, they do not provide concrete evidence to support the fraudulent claim, only the intimations that IBM's security around the computer room was because IBM really had masters hidden over the computer on some important occasions, and Kasparov's claim that the computer it didn't sound like a computer usually does at some point in the second game. In the second game, Kasparov played a game that was designed to trick the computer by attempting to sacrifice a pawn in a situation where previous computer chess programs would take the pawn, leading to the final loss of the computer. Deep Blue didn't take the bait, and Kasparov was so shaken because the computer seemed to play like a human who didn't even see that he could play Deep Blue for a draw and ended up resigning. That game exasperated him so much that he wasn't able to recover, and after playing at 3.4 and 5 draws, he lost the game 6 horribly. <br /> <br /> The question whether IBM cheated everything boils down to that single move in the second game, in which the Deep Blue made the move that any human would have made but that had, until then, tripped in computers. Joel Benjamin, a great chess master of the IBM programming team explained in the documentary that they knew chess computers were always stumbling in that situation, and consequently spent a lot of time and effort programming Deep Blue so it wouldn't commit the error other computers do. If you believe Benjamin's statement, then the case is clear, IBM has not cheated. Unfortunately, the director moved quickly and never mentioned IBM's explanation for the rest of the film, preferring to cut between the chess shots that play the fake of the 19th century, The Turk and the Deep Blue shots, suggesting that Deep Blue was really controlled by a human as well. As someone who has an understanding of programming, IBM's explanation makes perfect sense - if you knew what you were doing, it wouldn't be terribly difficult to put something in the code so that, if so and so conditions are reached, then do so and so - in other words, telling the computer what to do if a situation like the one Kasparov created in game 2 occurs. This is not a scam, he is doing a good job of programming a chess computer. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is eminently clear that the director thinks IBM has cheated, and the repeated comments on the IBM title increase by 15% the day Deep Blue won suggests the idea that IBM cheated for increase the price of his shares (Kasparov even compares IBM and Deep Blue with Enron). However, there is plenty of outside opinion, both in the chess and computer communities, that Deep Blue won fair and square and that Kasparov lost because he simply could not overcome his vision of computers as "stupid machines" and he got rid of a machine that didn't seem so stupid after all. I just hope the director showed us the alternative opinion. <br /> <br />
