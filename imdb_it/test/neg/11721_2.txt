Ahh, nuthin 'like cheese, explosive, semi-porn, disguised as horror ... This is Jaqueline Lovell (sometimes Sara St. James), the unmarried starlet also in "Femalien", "The Erotic House of Wax" , and that favorite family "Nude Bowling Party". Now it is a fixture in the series of Surrender Cinema films with cutie without talent, protagonists of useless soft-porn exploitation films. "Head of the Family" actually tries to be a real moovie. A crook and a tramp try to get Tramp's husband canceled. They turn to an evil genius of a big brain in a wheelchair, and to his family of moral misfits, who uses mind control to send zombies to make his nefarious desire. Said-genius has a giant head, hence the clever title of the film: it is the entity of the film's humor. But basically, it's an excuse to showcase the wide talents of Lovell and Dianne Colazzo (Ernestina). Huddled with some of the most bizarre dialogues may be the herd (what the heck is "plow the oats", anycow ??), and simply stupid, this titled thriller will attract the charm of the protagonists of the Drive-In Theater, but not another. The MooCow says to avoid the void, unless you are looking for a rent on Teas A & night horror. : = 8P
