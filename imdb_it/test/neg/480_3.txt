As a Bruce Campbell fan for almost two decades, I was thrilled to see his latest film on the big screen with the man himself present. Unfortunately, "Man with the Screaming Brain" was a disappointment in itself. <br /> <br /> Set in Bulgaria - where the Sci-Fi channel makes its original Saturday night movies - "Man with the Screaming Brain" is a curious mix of 50s horror movies, comedies for change full-bodied, violent revenge shots and an exaggerated joke with a touch of romantic reconciliation. If this doesn't make sense, well, not even "The man with the screaming brain". Campbell plays a CEO of the pharmaceutical company that visits Bulgaria with his foreign wife in an inexplicable attempt to invest in the semi-finished underground system of the old communist country. The two return with a former KGB agent turned into a taxi driver, and all three eventually meet their disappearance at the hands of a vindictive gypsy. <br /> <br /> A local scientist (Stacy Keach) and his silly assistant (Ted Raimi), who developed a technique to allow tissue transplants without the possibility of rejection, stealing bodies and positioning a part of the brain of the driver of the cabin in Campbell's damaged skull. Also, they put his wife's brain in a robotic body they just had on hand. <br /> <br /> Campbell flees, and with a hastily redesigned skull and the voice of the taxi driver - whose transplanted brain tissue controls the left side of his body - echoes in his head, part to find and kill the gypsy. (His robot wife does the same.) <br /> <br /> But first, there is an attempt to emulate "All of Me" by Steve Martin / Lily Tomlin when Campbell's two personalities fight for domination on a dinner at the restaurant. Just as he was playing his evil hand in "Evil Dead II", Campbell is adept at making his body appear inhabited by more than one mind. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, "Screaming" comes closer to another Steve Martin film, "The Man with Two Brains", as well as a foolish approach to the science fiction clich√©s of the 50s. However, he tries too hard for a too small result, and this is twice as much for Ted Raimi's semi-understandable Bulgarian meatloaf, which gets too much time for the screen. (Nothing against Raimi, it's just that he looks better in small doses.) <br /> <br /> In the end, it's neither outrageous (or amusing) enough to satisfy as a parody, nor is he serious enough to enjoy as B- movie pastiche. I was glad that Campbell had already left the screening before it stopped, because I was afraid of having to say "Damn, Bruce, it was really ... something". <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best praise I can give as a film is that at least the images stick to the emulsion. And it was twice as good as "Alien Apocalypse".
