Well, where do I start? I can't even imagine understanding this pathetic preteen excuse of a show. Imagine this: a boarding school, where children whose parents are rolling money simply throw them in there to wander around the world alone. It couldn't be more evil than this. <br /> <br /> If you taught these kids, you won't even update them as teenagers, because they hardly behave like healthy homosexuals, they were egocentric, think again. About 23 minutes suffocated by their so-called problems, problems with boys, and things like that. <br /> <br /> The show's heroine, of course, Miss Zoey, played by Britney's Polly Pocket, Little Miss I'm All That sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, obviously has a lot to learn about acting. However, I will give you some face, because its superficial and one-dimensional character does not allow much space for depth. He plays the sun, the moon and the stars of the Pacific Coast Academy, fighting the crusaders for the condition of all women, the equality of all kinds. <br /> <br /> Perfect in any case, always with his two loyal helpers, Nicole, the daffy child, who obviously has too much of Dad's money, and a sturdy girl, Dana, who proves to be very difficult to decipher. Both left the show in seasons 2 and 1 respectively, not that I blame it. But horror of horrors, comes Lola, who considers herself the greatest actress since Natalie Wood, with green feathers in her hair and fake tan. She is even more rude than Zoey, if possible, and even more stupid than Nicole, and hell, we know it can't be possible. <br /> <br /> This show, like all excuses for the television programs Nickelodeon has issued since 2000, is the first victim of stereotypes. Take the girl next door and savor the feelings of her best friend for her Zoey, a great but inarticulate, sometimes best friend, Chase, a cool and arrogant gentleman, Logan, a boy and a crazy girl, who is not very bright , Nicole, what everyone thinks is strange just because she is extremely intelligent, the nerd, Quinn, the perfect model, ultra-dramatic, annoying but super thin, Malibu, Lola, and the hard but soft woman inside, Dana. Now where did I hear these characters before? I'm sorry, but what's so wrong with having a personality? Just because Quinn is passionate about science, and actually worries about his future and is doing well in the academic aspect, in which the rest should also worry, she is "strange" and a "nerd"? Lola at the beginning of the series, turned out to be a potential great character with her impertinent ways and her different outlook on life, Zoey just had to go, pull out the pitchforks, burn her at the stake, return to Weird Town and all that jazz. So much for women's rights. Unfortunately, Lola has become nothing but another OC clone, in all its anorexic glory. Probably so as not to eclipse his mistress. <br /> <br /> But hey, the 2000 generation of MySpace whores seems to love it with the typical fairy-tale love story of Chase / Zoey, the tension between adamant, "hot" Logan and "kick-ass" Zoey or Dana, at your leisure, and nice people. Please, this show exists to remind us that people do not like realism, they prefer a pretentious, superficial and dull lifestyle. I'm sorry to break it to you, it won't happen unless you have an important trust fund and the parents to cushion you.
