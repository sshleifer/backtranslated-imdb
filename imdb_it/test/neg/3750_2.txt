Martha Plimpton has made some prestigious films, working with River Phoenix and Harrison Ford, but has never been able to expand her limited and tapped charm in the same class as, for example, Molly Ringwald. This film, which has just been published, is just an extension of his last attempts in the 1980s / early 1990s to find a screen-person that was identifiable to viewers, and represents another failure. Plimpton plays a troubled young woman who discovers her 21st birthday of being adopted and - worse yet - she was actually abandoned as a child on her parents' doorstep! He goes in search of his biological mother and father, but the viewer has no idea why he would like it (will mere curiosity give you so much determination?). Unattractive material given the management of the sitcom; start on the wrong foot and never recover. Plimpton gives a harsh and gruff show, but Hector Elizondo and Mary Kay Place are fine as his adoptive parents. * 1/2 from ****
