To say also that this film is Sebastien's work at its best, I tell you everything you need to know about man. Sebastien is a pathetic, foolish, not funny at best, but very popular on French television. If watching any of his shows is simply torture for a normally constituted human being, his first film (ans hope only) turned out to be even worse. The apology for Sebastien's rape (the victim falls in love with his assailant) is not only misplaced but clearly unacceptable. I strongly advise you not to bother this image (or any of Sebastien's future features), you would lose time ... There is something on French television that doesn't smell ... and this is Patrick Sebastien !!!
