... don't waste your time looking at this vanity project. My comment has been canceled twice now, for reasons I have not yet understood, in addition to the suspicion that someone involved in "Gone" is not satisfied with what I had to say. So, this time I reduced things to the heart of the matter with an excerpt of my original comments that can in no way be considered a personal attack on anyone, or an unfair comment: <br /> <br /> "" Gone " is the type of railway disaster that gives a new meaning to words: horrible dialogue, drawn up, a script that acts like a fish out of the water, an acting that would embarrass the most egocentric of the divas of the community cinema, the cinematography inspired at the "Survivor" school of swooping shots, followed by static and nostril close-ups, terrible ADR works, special visual effects that are not, pedestrian music that absolutely cannot bear any mood or emotion, terrible editing with useless frost and fade , no artistic direction to speak of - the litany of wickedness goes on and on ... I really felt robbed by the time that brought me to fast forward mind for the most part ... time that could have been better spent staring at a wall ... Under no circumstances should anyone be unfortunate enough to read this subject alone in this "movie", because long before it's over, they will want to have been "kidnapped" before committing the mistake. "<br /> <br /> Case closed, Amen.
