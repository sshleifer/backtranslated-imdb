Another gray, horrible point of slavery of the Corman family. The first space capsule in the crash of outer space returns to Earth (with some of the worst special effects ever) and the pilot appears to be dead. But appearances can be deceiving. He is actually more alive than the rest of the cast, including a paternalistic old misogynist doctor (who was really, VERY boring), a greasy guy who seems to be stuck in the market for hair oil, another boy so boring that he doesn't it also makes a great impression, a scientist who never seems to be hurt or angry about the patronizing of the old man, and a photographer with a haircut Farah Fawcett (pre-Farah, of course) and as much liveliness as a dead duck. <br /> <br /> What are the names of these people? I think it was Steve. Apparently, everyone in the cast, including the women, was named Steve. However, the dead pilot Steve is not only alive, but is about to incubate the little aliens (or seahorses, or shrimp, or whatever) inside his torso. Momma's beast who implanted these little creatures looks like a giant bald parrot with claws. Once again, I am impressed by the skill-laugh factor of the monsters created by the House of Corman. Venus's space carrot in It Conquered the World is still officially the worst, most laughable monster I've ever seen gracefully on the screen, but the Cormans always manage to bear fruit when it comes to evil and flashy monsters. <br /> <br /> They also managed to deliver on other brands too; that is a boring and confused plot, long gray shots (thank God Corman made most of his black and white films, since his colorful stuff still manages to look somehow gray) two or three max positions, stupid and crooked objects and special effects, and a lot of boring dialogues. There are only two deaths in the film (if you don't count the roasted parrot ... the alien blood beast is offended at the end of the film). The greetings sounded through the earth, I am sure, when the alien tears the old doctor's head and (apparently) eats it. Now he can speak in English and he has the doctor's memories. He can also move the pregnant astronaut around like Pinnochio. <br /> <br /> The apparent intention of the monster is to rebuild its race using humans as food and giant laps. In the end there is some confusion (well, more confused than usual, anyway) in which the creature tries to explain why it is doing this, but it makes absolutely no sense. Something about how humanity is going to follow in the footsteps of his race and destroy themselves with something they will soon create. He never really said what it was. It could have been anything from toaster ovens to digital watches, who knows. His newborn baby was stabbed rather than letting the alien crayfish slip out of his body, and the fat boy (and the other boy) burns the alien parrot to death with a Molotov cocktail. Ah, the smell of roast chicken ... it's ... alien. End of story, in which the rest of the characters move away and leave their dead companion on the ground to rot. Oh, hell, why don't you save yourself the cost of a funeral? I'm sure it was what Corman was thinking when he was trying to cut corners and make his scenes as cheap as possible.
