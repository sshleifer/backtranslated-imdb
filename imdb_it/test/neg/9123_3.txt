I really don't think producer George Lucas really decided to make such a horrible following as "More American Graffiti" turned out to be. But in retrospect it was the first crack in his seemingly impenetrable armor. Coming directly from the enormous success of "American Graffiti" and produced substantially in the same period as "Star Wars", this film was the first that Lucas successfully brought to Coppola without having to worry about directing himself. The result is typical of Lucas: much more interesting for its structure and the way in which it is modified compared to the real material. Writer / director Bill Norton has been allowed to use a variety of screen reports and split screens to produce strange associations in the images. While it is interesting to see ironic oppositions of the 4 narrative lines, the style ultimately sums up only the fragmented nature of the film itself. <br /> <br /> Lucas's brilliant original film centered around a group of friends on the archetype "last big night" before the end of school and Kurt (Ron Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard) should go to college . One thing that made that movie work, despite being very episodic, is that you initially had the main characters and eventually came back together. There is a provision of time, like in "Rebel Without a Cause" by Nick Ray, where a certain period of time becomes very elastic and takes on more meaning than a specific time in real life, but everything takes place in a static space. "More American Graffiti" is essentially the opposite - the space is very dynamic, with Toad (Charles Martin Smith) in Vietnam, his ex-girlfriend Debbie (Candy Clark) celebrating with the hippies in San Francisco, Steve and Laurie (Cindy Williams) involved in student protests in Berkeley, and John Miler (Paul Le Mat) drags the races on the semi-pro circuit. In a meeting invented at the beginning of the film, all the principles came together to see John compete, but after that the threads do not come back together and intertwine as they do in the original. Instead they separate and follow the characters through about 3 years, only seeing various events in New Years Eve in what appears to be 1967, 68 and 69. It's easy for the public to get confused, and I think it's right for say we do it While the original film seemed to condense important events and rites of passages into an unreal theatrical time that produced an experience of nostalgia even for those who had never experienced those events, this sequel draws and extends the few points of the plot from epilogue of the original and tries to turn them into a coherent film. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the film for me are those with Candy Clark in SF and Charles Martin Smith in Nam. Some bars fall flat, but the style of those sections is interesting and form a sharp contrast between them. A good movie could have been made if these parts were a little better, and if the other parts weren't so compelling. Speaking of drag racing, the whole plot with Milner talking to a foreign student was really creepy, unpleasant, and Mackenzie Phillips' launch for a cameo didn't help at all. It was just another forced moment, like when they briefly explain why Curt is not in the movie because he is already in Canada. Instead Laurie has another brother who is virtually identical to Curt but has a different name and is now played by a very boring actor. There is a black type of satire in some of the things of Vietnam, very similar to what I imagine would have been the original idea of ​​Lucas and John Milius for "Apocalypse Now". And there's a bit of that manic fun in the San Francisco scenes that made the first movie fun. But despite all this, the rest of the film drags on, as if someone wanted to see Steve and Laurie arguing in their horrible suburban home as if they were auditioning for a Spielberg film about divorce and child abandonment. I think that even if those parts of the film weren't so painful, it wouldn't be comparable to the first film because there is no closure and it makes no sense to return or that someone has learned something. It's just a sort of end to the point where they ran out of money or something, a cheap movie imitating "Two-Lane Blacktop" and many better movies. <br /> <br /> Like the original however, this film has a great soundtrack of hits from the period that is probably worth owning for itself and makes the movie itself almost palatable. The Country Joe and the Fish performances are fantastic, and Scott Glenn has completely fought like a Candy Clark hippie in love is a sight to see - I wonder if even then he had to use a wig? I could not recommend this film, yet it has a little affection in my heart because I love the original so much. Every couple of decades I think I will have to try this movie just to make sure it is really useless as a memory of being one. It's a party killer but it's something that every fan of "American Graffiti" or George Lucas in general will want to see at least once or twice. Show how great effort can go into something and can still be rather half-cooked. It makes you think about how much of a miracle it is that Lucas actually made a film as beautiful as "American Graffiti" in the first place, as if all the elements were in place and all the appropriate gods had been appeased. Unfortunately this was not the case for this film or for Bill Norton.
