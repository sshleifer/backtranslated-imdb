Have you seen all the great adventures of the last decades? If you don't have to worry about this because you've already seen most of the scenes already - and I can guarantee that those scenes were originally in much better movies. <br /> <br /> The story (I'm sure the real storytellers will never forgive me) is childish and stupid (stupid in a way that would make him sound like a band of angry walking dead) . Each character is based on a cliché and ... well, they are nothing but the cliché. And yes, once again all you need to be a hero is to be American. <br /> <br /> At least in Finland have stated that this is the type of film for which the DVD was made. Maybe I should sell my player so ... <br /> <br /> 1/10
