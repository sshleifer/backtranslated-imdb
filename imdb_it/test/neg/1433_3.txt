This film was one of the most boring horror movies I've seen in a long time (and I've seen many). Personally I liked the piercing on everything that was original, but apart from that it was quite unwatchable. I couldn't stand Dee Snider as an actor or as a singer. He seemed to be trying everything he said to make it a memorable quote, which they were not. I can get movies for free and I have not yet thought it was worth having the time.
