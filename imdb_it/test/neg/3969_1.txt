SLOOOOOOOW, lukewarm and battered produced by the '70s, Schlocker showed up as a gruesome because of today's titles; however, this film is worthy of fodder because of the unobtrusive acting, the absent direction and the stupid clothes of the 70s (unfortunately, the MooCow remembers when the Adidas clothing was very fashionable ...). This has the same feeling that some of the best science fiction films of the 70s are acclimplished, namely "WestWorld" and "Logan's Run". While the premise is interesting (rich people clone themselves to keep a supply of body parts to keep them alive in theory forever), the film makes the mistake of subjecting us to Richard (Tim Donnelly), a clone who is at the same boring and irritating time. Donnelly's acting doesn't help, but it fits perfectly with the rest of the cast. Also B-illuminaries like Dick Sargent (TV series "Bewitched", "Ghost with 1,000,000 Eyes"), Keenan Wynn ("Dr. Strangelove", "The Dark", "Laserblast") and Peter Graves ("The beginning of the end ")", "Killers from Space", "It Conquered the World") provide only the best lukewarm performances. Produced, directed and edited by a group of nobility, it is not surprising that "Clonus" is not able to scare anyone, less pay attention to no one! "Actually, there is nothing in the faint film that Schlock fans would love - I want to see some really ugly, funny movies from the 70s, put on anything by Greydon Clark." Clonus "not it's a bonus, the MooCow says even the MST3K version is a yawn, so proceed at your own risk !: = 8P
