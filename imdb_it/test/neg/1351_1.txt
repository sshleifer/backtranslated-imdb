I really wish I had read everyone's review before going to see the movie ... it was one of the most atrocious movies I've ever seen. I was ready to leave the theater 5 minutes from the movie; I should have followed my instincts. The film offered nothing new or clever, it was boring and very clich√©. I was surprised to find that it was directed by a woman! The characters did not represent women I know, they were boring, bitter and melodramatic. The film was unrealistic and depressing and a waste of time and money. And the actors seemed tired, made up and dressed. It has recently been compared to the movie Sex and in the City; it wasn't even half good. My advice, don't watch this movie!
