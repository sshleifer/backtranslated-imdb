I like the "Star Wars" series. I like a nice cheapo science fiction movie every now and then. Heck, I also like the nickel-and-dime jobbels produced by Roger Corman. <br /> <br /> I don't like "The Ice Pirates", though. <br /> <br /> For one, it sounds too cheap, you know? For a film that should take place in space, it looks tight and closed, as if it were turned on someone's front seat. And the special effects, although appropriately, seem more like a foamed metal painted gray. Usually, I don't let things like that bother me, especially if the story and characters are worth it. <br /> <br /> It is not. <br /> <br /> The whole plot, about these neerated space pirates who decide to find an ice-laden planet can merge and sell like water (a hot commodity in the future, I guess) is as original as the jokes, which don't is a compliment. <br /> <br /> Humor comes at horse level (as the castrating one will see soon) and everyone seems to have an irritable attitude. And who told John Matuzak that it was fun? Whoever did it, be ashamed of them. Good old Robert Urich tries, but he is a reliable actor aboard a sinking ship (or starship, in this case). <br /> <br /> I've seen this three times and had the same feeling every time - shanghaied. <br /> <br /> No stars. Despite the presence of Huston (a year before "L'onore di Prizzi") and Carradine (at the end of a once high career), these "Pirates" should travel the axis.
