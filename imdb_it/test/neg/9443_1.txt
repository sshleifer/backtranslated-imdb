Perhaps James P. Lay knows what to do in the sound department if a director watches over him. <br /> <br /> In "Dreamland (2007)", however, he cannot accomplish anything as a writer or director. /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing in this film, no story, no character building, no events, no atmosphere, no plot, no twists, no acting that deserves that name. <br /> <br /> In any of these departments this film is billions of light years behind any short film that has any real thoughts in it, even a minute. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with any of David Lynch's works! <br /> <br /> Actually I think it could be used as mental torture or as negative propaganda material against the West. <br /> <br /> We only recommend your worst enemies!
