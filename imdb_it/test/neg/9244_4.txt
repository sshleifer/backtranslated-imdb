Korine has now established itself as a creator of images of talent and great effect. The promotional posters of Mister Lonely include all the most impressive compositions of the film (although there is one in particular that I have not yet seen in promotional material: that of a nun dressed in blue who mocks a dog with a stick, surrounded by a green forest with torrential rain pouring down). The opening images of this film, by Michael Jackson's double (Diego Luna) riding a small motorcycle on a track, are strangely compelling and wonderful: "Mister Lonely" by Roy Orbison plays in the soundtrack and the images develop at slow motion. There is also a fun and formidable sequence in which the same character mimics a dance, without music (even if a radio sits like a silent dog beside him), in the middle of a Parisian street; The Korine blends into sound effects and jumps that evoke both a feeling of futility and a stubborn liberation in the routine of the character's dance. <br /> <br /> Even the first instance of the segment dealing with the sisters is strangely moving; Father Umbrillo (Werner Herzog) is an autocratic priest about to fly with some nuns and throw food in impoverished areas nearby. In a scene that is both carefree and engaging, Herzog has to deal with a stubbornly obstinate local who wants to fly with them to see his wife in San Francisco. As the exchange develops, Herzog extracts a confession from the man: he has sinned, and his frequent infidelity is the cause of his wife who left him in the first place. This scene, short and sweet, acquires a particular weight after having learned its improvised origins: the sinner is played by a non-actor who was on the set when Korine and co. they were filming - and his adulterous ways had given him, in real life, a lasting and overwhelming sense of guilt. <br /> <br /> The film is now a success; a succession of intrinsically interesting moments that add to a frivolous and confused narrative. While Gummo and Julien Donkey-Boy maintain their aesthetic and emotional weight through coherent structural structures, Mr. Lonely feels victim of the ruthlessness of the editing room. Some scenes were cut from the film, which otherwise would have painted the most complete images of some characters, due to errors in continuity in costume - a result, no doubt, due to the absence of a script and Korine's tendency to improvise . A scene eliminated in particular - in which "Charlie Chaplin" (Denis Lavant) and "Madonna" (Melita Morgan) have sex - would have added a much more emotional conflict to a scene later in the film (I don't want to ruin everything, but it's there to deflate any feeling of warmth or celebration, and, as it is, only half the success). <br /> <br /> The two strands of the narration, disconnected to the letter, are better treated as two completely different stories with the same allegorical meaning; one compliments the other and vice versa. (It has something to do with the conflict between one's ambitions and the reality of the current situation.) But there are not enough Herzog scenes to deserve their place in the film, and therefore any connection between these two allegorically connected wires is inevitably tense - and inclusion is, in retrospect, boring. <br /> <br /> This is an ambitious step forward by Julien Donkey-Boy who suffers above all, at least in similar segments, from having too many characters for the duration film, a defect that would have been even worse if the names of great stars all played (as originally intended). <br /> <br /> With many of the autonomous images and moments of real, genuine connection to the soundtrack, it seems that it would be much more suitable for an artistic installation or a photographic exhibition. As an exploration of mimesis and the nature of representation, it would lose none of its power - indeed, for me, it would perhaps be more impressive. The loneliness linked to iconic performativity (such as that encountered by the icons themselves and those who aspire to be like them) is well captured in images such as the one in which "Marilyn Monroe" (a splendid Samantha Morton) seduces the camera with an Seven-year itch pose in the middle of a forest, or when 'Sammy Davis, Jr.' (Jason Pennycooke) settles down, post-dance, with his back to the camera overlooking an incredible and peaceful lake. <br /> <br /> As it is, moments like these and all those where the randomly chosen titles Michael Jackson's songs creep through the scene, are married to each other in a very cinematic narrative less influential than it should be. <br /> <br /> (For those who see it, I lost all confidence during the late egg song scene. You will know what scene I mean because it sticks out like a sore thumb, like some kind of deceptive trick in the new language cinematographic for which Korine was previously accepted.)
