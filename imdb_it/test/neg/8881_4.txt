so the second part of this film is difficult to follow. I had the first part with the Spanish Inquistion, but the film jumped many years ahead with the France that dominated Spain. The film does little to tell you what happened, and I don't remember much about it. So the film gets confused then. The film begins when Ines, the daughter of a wealthy merchant, is accused of Judaism by the church, in particular by Father Lorenzo. It is called into question and forced to confess. Even the wealth of his family cannot buy it out of prison. His father forces Lorenzo to sign a confession saying he is the offspring of a chimpanzee, hoping to have Ines released. All he gives is a reason to condemn the church to Lorenzo, who runs in France. <br /> <br /> So the film skips many years and the French Revolution is in full force. Ines is released from prison. It was a great make-up job to make Natalie Portman look heartbreaking. Find his dead family and look for Goya for his help. She tells him she had a baby in prison. Goya organizes a meeting between her and Lorenzo, who is now with the French and in power. He is the father. Goya sees his daughter and tells Lorenzo, who decides that it is better to send her to America, so nobody will find out. But before his plans are completed, the British join the Portuguese, and Spain claims power and is now persecuted. That part is not well told in the film. It is as if the film shows that this would happen in one day. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: The film is good until it skips many years after the Inchishion, so the film expects you to understand what is happening. I became too confused then.
