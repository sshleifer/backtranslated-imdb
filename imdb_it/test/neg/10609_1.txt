So, it's Friday night and you want to go see a movie ... whatever you want is something fun, not too artistic, or anything that may require a long night of philosophical discussions. So, pay $ 10 to watch the Team Mod. The trailer for this movie should have tipped me, but come on ... they're the three most beautiful people in Hollywood - wink. But that's all ... a series of Prada advertising on the go. And what have Hollywood producers forgotten? A plot. Why do these kids run through the streets after an unknown enemy? Where are they? But don't worry, after a while you will stop worrying. I was about to get out of this movie, because I thought that sitting in my room and fixing the wall would have been more productive (and free), but by then it was over (90 minutes - it's just a saving grace). So, still willing to waste $ 10? Go, have a nice hot meal.
