Would a different translation make it colder or scarier? Are the subtitles too compact to express the nuances of the original language? Does it matter? You may have heard that great actors can make reading a phone book exciting. Well, this is an opportunity to judge for yourself. <br /> <br /> If it is not about homosexuality, homicide, dismemberment, psychopathy, madness, deviant psychology, then it is a question of acting - acting helped along with many dialogues, so enjoy the acting or the muse on how titillating the dialog is really. <br /> <br /> For English speakers, "Twelve Angry Men" could be a better choice. There is a little more interaction and you can judge if the acting is consistent with the dialogue. You don't have to ask yourself if you are missing something. <br /> <br /> I recommend Andy Warhol's "Empire" to those who love this film.
