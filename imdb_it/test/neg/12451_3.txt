This is an adaptation of a work by Edith Wharton, whose writing is surprising. Unfortunately, this film never gives the impression that these 20th century films do not include the repression and despair of the nineteenth century that describes Wharton's work. Ward and Dalton are not so bad, but Alicia Witt's wooden performance made me jump. He should have interpreted the restless element of the story, but it remained as a stick for the whole film, and I never believed a word from his mouth. When he asks Sela Ward "Why can't I move you?" towards the end of the film, I couldn't help but reply: "That's what I asked myself for the last hour and a half !!!"
