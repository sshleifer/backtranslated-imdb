I love dissing this movie. My colleagues always do their best to defend him, probably for the love of Quentin Tarantino or Harvey Keitel, but they will never convince me that this should be appreciated. Here are some great reasons why: A: The plot goes from the kidnapping street movie to the vampire stripe movie with no set-ups. Suddenly something very real turns into something very fake, which is like sitting in the audience until a Thanksgiving party and then exploding with dynamite. B: That without talent is Juliette Lewis. C: The presumptuous ideas abound like the real torso-and-leg guitars, the brothers with the surname "Gecko", the bad works for the vampire make-up, Cheech Marin who plays three characters (?) And a shotgun that shoots only when "erect" and belongs to a boy who passes for "Sex Machine". If Robert Rodriguez had not pathetically tried to be so innovative with his violence, I could have had fun with this obvious popcorn. The whole project is like having the ideas playing with action figures. The only thing that comes close to being considered my favorite scene is the geography ride-out monologue of George Clooney after he killed his blood sucker, an excited boy and a terrible brother. I swear, I think they thought of it right after. This film is offended and ends up offending those who want the offensive. Horrible movie.
