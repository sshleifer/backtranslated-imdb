Dick and Jane Harper (Jim Carrey, Téa Leoni) end up on the unemployment line when the company for which Dick works is caught in a corruption scandal, and after trying desperately and unsuccessfully to find a job, the couple turns to crime to get them out of poverty. <br /> <br /> I've always been a Jim Carrey fan. It's been a while since he made an upright comedy. The last one was Bruce Almighty who was pretty good. He has shown he can do serious dramas, but comedy is his real element. Having fun with Dick and Jane proves he still has it. Although the film was fun, it was still a bit disappointing. It wasn't as fun as I thought it would be. It is worth looking at once, unlike most of Carrey's films, it does not have a good repetition value. Part of the problem is the script. I was surprised that the script was weak because this is the same guy who made the Virgin forty years. Some lines fall flat and other times they seem to try too hard. If Jim Carrey wasn't there, the film would have been much worse. <br /> <br /> Next to Jim Carrey is Téa Leoni. She's a normal actress, but it's not very funny. She doesn't get along well with Carrey and seems to be phoning her performance. They should have gone with someone else. The supporting cast includes Alec Baldwin, Richard Jenkins and Aaron Michael Jenkins. The latter plays Billy Harper and actually gives a decent performance. It wasn't as annoying as most children's stars. Alec Baldwin was fine and Richard Jenkins tried too hard to be funny. To be honest, it's a bit of a bias here. The film overall was pretty average, but I liked it better thanks to the performance of Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey fans should have fun, but that's all. In the end, Fun with Dick and Jane is a fun way to spend 90 minutes but it's not very memorable. Rated 6/10
