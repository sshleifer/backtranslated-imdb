THE PROTECTOR. Feel the name Think, "ah, it's a lousy Hong Kong film." Guess what - it's not Hong Kong. And yes, it's disgusting. This incredibly stupid movie by Jackie Chan, ruined by us, yes we, the Americans (I'm bubbling with rage, ooh, I think I'll jump out of that window!), Ha Chan like a New York cop who is hunting a gang, avenging death of his friend. Sounds interesting ... but it's not. Don't waste your money by renting them. To show that he could have made a better detective film, Chan made the extraordinary POLICE STORY (1985).
