A feminist trait in which if the viewer believes that: i) wild animals are rarely domesticated by singing but instead they attack, kill and eat (the line that grizzlies never attack unless provoked is a cry - unless "provoked") means that he sees meat); ii) homosexuality is both immoral in itself - and its acceptance is almost always associated throughout history with signs of dissolution and decadence of a society iii) few women are bisexual (in this, virtually every woman is presented as not having preferences for men or women) iv) divorce is much worse than infidelity v) the land is there for humans to use, develop and enjoy vi) is how it hangs over a mother of an adult child to keep in touch as it is on the child vii) a mother raising her child alone is an unfortunate and true tragedy for the child viii) the idolatry of a parent for worthy ideals is a good and healthy thing ix) adults continue to take responsibility for their sexual behavior, regardless of their age, and the duty to engage in this most intimate and give acts only within the most intimate and overtly sacrificial of relationships: marriage - believe me, this film will not p iacer√†! Essentially it is a kind of companion to Howard Stern who is shot down by a woman from Jane Fonda (think of The Electric Horseman). It's bad because the values, the ideals, the script are all so harmful. <br /> <br /> I share other objections to strange things in writing: a) because this man loses every girl he has - because he refuses to reveal that his mother's death and funeral prevented him from holding a appointment with them? It's a mystery because he keeps saying "it was personal" in front of angry and disappointed women. EH? <br /> <br /> b) there is a huge inconsistency (ie the writer wants to have both) telling us that the main character's mother loved his father with everything he had - and then we were told that there he was just a big love in his life - his lesbian girlfriend. <br /> <br /> c) the underlying legal hypotheses are nonsense. We are never told that the executor has the right to live in the property, but only that he must determine the timing of the title of the sole heir and the right to occupy the property. Yet somehow the film makes it appear that the performer is the rightful occupant - which is crazy. (Try to think of any executor of any will who uses the deceased's property before the legacies of the will are fulfilled - it doesn't happen). <br /> <br /> d) the hypothesis in this film is that women are equally attracted to men and women - it is simply absurd. Therefore, we are told: i) that the character of Penelope Ann Miller is going out with other men towards the end of the film - after having been with the deceased for five years - and before that in a satisfying relationship with the protagonist, ii) that the housekeeper of the protagonist after having been devoted throughout her life as an adult to her kind husband - now goes out with another woman iii) that an angry girl with the protagonist would now therefore "like to try a woman". <br /> <br /> iv) that a male transsexual is eager to date the protagonist v) that the character of Mary Kay Place naturally looked at other women in college ("and looked back", he says with an idiotic blow triumphal head). <br /> <br /> This is all just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I agree with others about the sound of the DVD (I had to keep it at full volume and rewind repeatedly to understand names, sentences). <br /> <br /> This is a film about someone who truly despises traditional heroism from any man, hates the idea that a man is necessary to raise a child, hates the idea that there is a necessary connection between marriage and sex. The film is ready for the sermon - and that kind of false message propaganda is not good.
