Weak tale of an evil sorcerer who is looking for a centuries old Satanic Bible so that he can do Lucifer's orders by canceling the creation. Hot pursuit to the end is a 17th-centruy bounty hunter named Redfern and his reluctant companion Kassandra. Does it look like a load of money? IS '. <br /> <br /> This twist of the writer D.T. Twohy gets the superficial treatment he deserves from director Steve Miner (who directed that romantic nonsense "Forever Young"). Obviously, Twohy knows nothing of the real evil. <br /> <br /> Julian Sands flies and cackles, trying to look wicked, while Richard E. Grant only manages to waste his rich talent. Lori Singer's career also went into crisis with this. <br /> <br /> The special effects crew has a little fun and Jerry Goldsmith gives a higher score to his theme.
