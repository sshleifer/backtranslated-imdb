This film is about a young man's painful journey to discover his sexuality. <br /> <br /> The film is raw and unpretentious. It is not based on hot sex scenes to attract viewers. Although the plot may seem inconsistent and disconnected at times, and some events are not adequately explained. I can understand it, though, because this film is a collection of memories that are very personal to the director. The secondary plot of his sister and his mother probably doesn't need to exist in the film, but I can certainly imagine that these are very important events in his life. <br /> <br /> The film's low budget is clearly recognizable. It is a pity that the sound effects are badly made. The narrative and some dialogues (in particular the scene in class with the French teacher) have so much echo, which makes it difficult to understand what is being said. The environmental noise, the noticeable traffic noise, is also captured during the film. When one scene fits into another, the level of traffic noise changes. <br /> <br /> This film is probably not funny, but it certainly serves as an insightful diary of a young man's journey to embrace his sexuality.
