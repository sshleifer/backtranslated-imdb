The Women (2008) by Diane English is sadly a waste of talent. With Annette Benning, Candice Bergen, Bette Midler, Cloris Leachman I like and have fun in everything I've seen, and Meg Ryan, Jada Pinkett Smith, Debra Messing and Eva Mendes who might not be my favorite actors but are nice look , how could the film be boring, predictable, embarrassing, sloppy and simply bad? It was made by Diane English, who is known as the writer of the highly successful TV show Murphy Brown, and is her first film for which she wrote a screenplay. The film was a labor of love for the Englishman who had tried for many years to make it happen and respect it. I also found scenes with supportive players, Bergen, Leechaman, Carry Fisher and Bette Middler in short but memorable, funny, intelligent and funny cameos but in general the film is a second hand "Sex and the City" which was published a few months ago. I didn't find Sex and the City very nice when I saw it, but next to The Women, it was just brilliant. At least, Sex and the City spared us the long and insignificant scene in the delivery room of the hospital where one of the characters was having a baby and her friends were there to support her. Poor Debra Messing, what did you do to deserve the nightmare you faced and us, the spectators with you? Movies like "The Women" give the whole genre, chicken movies, a bad name. There is nothing wrong with the genre, but why is it so difficult to make a really good comedy about female friendships and difficulties, about the relationship with marriage, motherhood and professionalism? These are all very interesting and important topics that any modern woman can relate to. Why create films with lines, dialogues and situations so obvious, predictable, not fun and offensive that they will be forgotten as soon as the film is finished? <br /> <br /> After watching the new movie, I checked the original The Women from my local library and I really enjoyed it. The story was told much better 70 years ago, and it has kept my interest all the way through. The old movie had real star power.
