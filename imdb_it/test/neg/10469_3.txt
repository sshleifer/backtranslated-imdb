Yes, this is what I heard after completing the viewing of this film. The acting is below average and the special effects are horrible. In fact, the worst I've ever seen. It's a very low budget film. There is no way this film can scare you, it has no disturbing or disturbing moments. The bones eater was more of a funny creature to me. It could have been a lot better, but oh, sure, they didn't have a big budget. The movie can't convince you that you're watching a horror movie, lol. I would call this movie The Time Eater (waster). I'm sure you'd have a lot of better movies / etc to watch. Keep looking at it if: 1. you have nothing else to look at. 2. you can view it for free. Not worth renting at all.
