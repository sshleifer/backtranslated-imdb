This film is about pathetic, spoiled, ego-winners who think they have something interesting to say, played by pathetic, spoiled, ego-winners who think they are interesting. Directly from the gutters filled with cokes of the incestuous and farcical theater scene in New York. <br /> <br /> The way so many viewers are induced to convince them to think that all this has to do with any substance remains a mystery to me. Maybe they secretly have the desire to belong to this overpaid and overvalued 'guild of actors' or have they never seen a decent movie? <br /> <br /> Get out, get your hands in the dirty ground and get a real job. Otherwise, kill yourself with a real gun.
