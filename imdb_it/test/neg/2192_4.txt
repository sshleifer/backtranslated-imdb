Lots of flames, thousands of extras in battle scenes, lots of good sets. I don't think the plot has incurred so much expense. The story could have been told much more effectively and would have been more valid, psychologically, if there hadn't been so much macho bomb in the production. Chinese films tend to be like this, in my experience. and I think that this affects the film.
