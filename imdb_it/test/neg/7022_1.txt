Lucille Ball was a powerful power on television in the 1950s and 1960s, but still made an occasional film, most notably THE LONG, LONG TRAILER and THE FACTS OF LIFE. Although his television career remained strong, in the early 1970s his film career seemed to be over - but Ball was determined to have a final big screen adventure, and the project he selected was the MAME musical 1966. <br /> <br /> In many respects the role seemed tailor-made: based on the popular novel that gave rise to two different Broadway comedies, Mame Dennis is an extravagant and wildly uninhibited woman who "inherits "his orphan grandson Patrick - and guides him on a wild tour of life's possibilities, bouncing from one comic spree to another. The music, which included songs like "Open a New Window" and "If He Walked Into My Life Today", was among Jerry Herman's best works. The supporting cast, which included Robert Preston and Bea Arthur, was the best of the best. Expectations were high; the opening of the fanfare of the night was terrible; the film was a disaster. The critics were stunned and the audience was left speechless. <br /> <br /> Regardless of what Lucy fans can say, MAME is a fiasco, so much so that it's hard to know where to start. He is misguided, ill-turned, misinterpreted, and there Lucille Ball is at the center of it all, unable to dance, unable to sing, and grinning like a wax mannequin while an incredibly turbulent choreography revolves around it. But the disaster is not doing it alone; the supporting cast is no better. Bea Arthur and Jane Connell recreate their theatrical roles of Vera Charles and Agnes Gooch; the first is a stage, the second is sad. Robert Preston manages to sing with a smile, but he is practically alone and clearly not happy about it. <br /> <br /> The DVD takes the movie from the pan-and-scan VHS version to widescreen, but that just means there's more horrible to see. Everyone loves Lucy, but only the least critical fan could love Lucy's MAME; while I wouldn't say it's bad enough to make you want to poke your eyes out, you might want to do it. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
