I saw this movie in a Cinema-Club in Germany in 1970. Most of the participants came from the local private school I was teaching. I had seen some Godard films before while living in France and, although they were not my favorites, I could at least make sense of them. Being able to speak French helped me. <br /> <br /> The rather innocuous beginning of "Le week-end" soon turned into a kaleidoscope of images, very well, perhaps too well photographed, which made no sense to me. For me, films, like books, must have a clear meaning. This wasn't for me. I guess I'm not "in" art films. The images continue to haunt me from the film. Until now I refuse to eat rabbit meat, much loved by the French. Whoever saw the film could understand why. Yes, the theme of materialism has arrived, but cannibalism, car wrecks and all the other scenes of destruction and horror have only disgusted me. I'm not sure if I went out before the end, but I certainly felt it. I promised myself that I would never see another Godard movie, and I never did and I'll never know it. <br /> <br /> My assessment: nothing. It was the most disgusting movie I've ever seen. Others may have been more inept, foolish or stupid. I have forgotten those while scenes of this will haunt me forever.
