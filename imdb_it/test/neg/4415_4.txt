There are a number of films where I and my high school friends used to joke. It is mainly the campy works of the 50s that appeared on television in the late show. This was one of our favorites. The soul of a fallen native took life in a tree trunk with a frown on his face. Now my friends have said that if you looked closely, you saw that it had shoes. I have never seen him. What strikes me most is that the natives seemed to be white men with fat black paint on their faces; some looked Italian. They also spoke with the strangest timbre that didn't seem to fit their situation. Like mummies, the mobility of the thing does not seem to offer a great threat. In a fight, one should only walk quickly; I guess it's the old element of surprise. If you see this, don't take it too seriously. Be happy to have a battery of old horror movies that gave us so much joy.
