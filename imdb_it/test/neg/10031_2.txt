All the criticisms of this film are quite valid! It's rather boring and full of all kinds of useless and ridiculous things. A couple who nods at their "good appetite". A medium shot of a desk like a phone rings until someone arrives, sits down and responds at a rather slow pace. Quadruple or more when people look at things. Play solitary banjos and play, take a break for a beer. Telling a joke on a fawn, on a lip-laden frog that tries to learn what to feed its babies, complete with many labiate expressions (which are necessary for the weak joke). Sharing cucumbers and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread, which for the picky becomes unpleasant when talking about people burned in a fire. Lots of close-up photos of animals, birds, insects and spiders in the woods. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a forest fire, then at least a couple of decades later some people in that same forest are killed by an ax. Evidently the killer was not too satisfied with the ax he had stolen and killed other people with other weapons of opportunity or with bare hands. <br /> <br /> If it is true that the film in the version available on the outdoor the video videotape is cut off, perhaps if there is a lot of movies that have been cut, it deserves another look on DVD. Otherwise, it is simply not very interesting, and will probably be patient even with the most avid outdoor slasher fans.
