The toxic avenger ... <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​this film is that a person that the common population would call this more loose person and then after being thrown into a barrel of toxic waste, turned into a superhero which is completely disfigured, it seemed OK also for 1985. This film is listed as a horror ... I even read a cult following with this series .... <br /> <br /> Now this movie has been given even when it was done it was so bad that I couldn't stop watching ... the acting is horrible even for an independent film that I think would be the horror part of this movie ... <br /> <br /> drugs, sumo, entry Godzilla .... They are all for films that promote anti-drugs ... heck I also like Godzilla and well sumo ... I'm not working, but I still think the sumo heights would like to give to this movie the 1000 hands slap and the salt ground in the eyes of the people who made this film ... <br /> <br /> Personally I'm almost ready to write to the movie company that did it and ask them about 87 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> For me 1 in 10 is too high it's too bad that there are no zero (zero) or negative integers to be included in a movie here. <In other words, this film is JUNK ...... I would prefer to look at the dry paint and face explosive diarrhea, so you should watch this movie again ... I would be the first person who would not only use the packaging of this film as kindling, but I'd be ready for a good movie and a script.
