We searched for this hard to find VHS after looking at two excellent Merchant-Ivory back to back images. Knowing that it was an instant box office failure, a failure as a rental, I thought it was worthwhile to see however based on the reputation of M-I. Sin! Nine years ago, it was very much a goal of the Liberal Agenda to wipe out the Founding Fathers and in fact they had had some success in eliminating the Founding Fathers from many American classrooms including, for example, New Jersey; whose eradication of our great founders quickly ended when the Washington Times shined the spotlight on the truth in the New Jersey School Council and their subversive act. A small part of this was underlining the alleged connection of Sally Hemmings-Thomas Jefferson, neglecting the awkward DNA results that could not support the agenda of the crazy left. It does not matter! They got James Ellis, a dubious author of reputation, to put it in a book, and Columbia University signed the deal by giving Ellis a Pulitzer. <br /> <br /> As for Jefferson in Paris, the Liberal Agenda rotation begins in the opening scene in which James Earl Jones is claiming to be Jefferson's son. The spin simply continues in flashback mode in Paris. The unmistakable truth is that even if a person assumes the lie it is true that Hemmings' accusation would be an insignificant detail in the broader question of Jefferson's prolonged and vital diplomatic mission to Paris (as well as in the Netherlands where he secured support crucial financial for America when our child nation was without funds). <br /> <br /> In addition to the Liberal Spin Job, there is nothing else interesting in this monotonous and tortuously boring film. Some of the other stories are really accurate --- adding belief to frame the lie --- but this film takes one of the most interesting moments in American history and reduces it to a remedy for insomnia. <br /> <br /> Please don't ask me why liberals have decided to wipe out the Founding Fathers, because I don't waste time explaining the deeds of these people. Don't even ask them; usually answer these questions with the same answer: "SHUT UP!"
