This film was shot and made in 1987 but did not hit the cinema until 1990. While watching this film I could see the good intentions it had, but I fear that there was not much talent or experience behind the camera to make it work . The story takes place in California in 1890 and some Italian immigrants who own vineyards are informed that they must leave their land to pass a railway. Dennis Hopper plays William Berrigan who offered money for the land but was refused. Giancarlo Giannini is Sebastian Collogero and he is proud to leave and asks other farmers to stand up and fight to keep their land. Berrigan becomes impatient and hires a bunch of thugs to force everyone to break free. These thugs are led by a man named Andrews (Burt Young) and don't hesitate to kill anyone who gives him trouble. Andrews and his men kill Collogero one night and his son Marco (Eric Roberts) vows to take revenge and get the land back for everyone. Marco blows up the bridge that the railway would have needed them and they even destroy a tunnel and this delayed the project for several months and Berrigan now starts taking heat from other investors. This film was directed by Peter Masterson and, in addition to "The Trip To Bountiful", has a macabre career as a director. He's a good actor but here he seems to be out of his mind. This was a film that desperately needed more attention to detail and it is easy to see that it did not occur. Roberts' hairstyle is perfect for the 80s, but I suppose it's 1890! The director of photography is Toyomichi Kurita who became a good cameraman, but this was only his fourth film and he certainly hadn't learned everything at the time. It is not at all a clear-looking film and I noticed in several shots during the day that the sun would be dazzling with something and the scenes simply do not have the freshness that would have helped the overall appearance. The script is just a story of revenge and there are no surprises during the course of the film. We know that Giannini will take it and it seemed only a matter of time. The cast is top notch and they do their best, but the whole movie is uninspired. This was promoted as Julia Roberts' debut film but I'm not sure it's correct. It may have appeared in a movie called "Firehouse" before this.
