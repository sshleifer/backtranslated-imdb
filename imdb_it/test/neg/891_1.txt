I'm a home party fan too ... House Party I is my favorite movie of all time. House Party 4 is a disgrace for all HP and Kid n Play ... This was supposed to be part of a series really ... there was nothing for kids in this movie or any of the other veterans ... kid n play was probably too old to be a House Party movie b / c its kind of focused on teens ... but the kids game might have made at least one cameo ... you can tell how good b / c is he hasn't even gotten to the movies. Immature was in House Party 3 so it was logical that they brought the inheritance ... but they should have represented well ... they should have left it at House Party 3. I am 27 years old and I have watched House Party since I was 11 when I was released in 1990 (16 years ago) and since then I've always been a fan. When I saw House Party 4 for the first time, I thought about what they really thought ... There was nothing familiar about this movie that could be compared to the previous 3 movies. I thought it was a black Ferris Bueller.
