I was very excited when Paranormal State first came to A & E. I thought it might bring some more interesting spectral evidence. The production value looked good and I love the logo. Then, after about a few episodes, I started thinking that this show might not be looking for evidence, but it had a strong religious agenda. It seems that every case they investigate has some powerful evil demon that I can't even move a teacup on the camera, yet everyone is terrified. Then comes a little power of the ritual of Christ that saves everyone. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, we focus very little on the other members of the team. The whole show focuses on Ryan and feels like one of those people who gives you brochures about his church on the street. <br /> <br /> Does the paranormal phenomenon and demons become the new missionaries of Christianity, frightening people to convert? Indeed, this should be on a Christian network. I was very disappointed.
