The surprise screening of this week in GV turned out to be the horror film The Nun (La Monja). Seriously, I think horror movies should try to invent more imaginative titles, even if the story is about the character as described in the title. Who knows, soon we will have spin-offs like The Monk, The Priest, and others belonging to various religious sects. <br /> <br /> The basic premise is that, simply, a ghoul dresses in a nun suit (so he can claim the title) goes around killing former girls of the convent. There seemed to be a sort of conspiracy involved, like the daughter of one of the victims, Eva (played by a greedy Icelandic Anita Briem), continues to discover, with the help of some good friends, as a rip-off of So what did you do last summer (also mentioned, by the way). <br /> <br /> As the number of bodies increases, it is a race against time for our emotionally scarred heroine (am I not always?) to discover the truth and save the day. Delving into the sins of mothers, the film did the unthinkable, that with a dream sequence as an introduction. I hate dream sequences because it's a pretty cheap technique if it's not done correctly, and there are a couple in the movie. <br /> <br /> In part, the film played in moments like Ju-On gone wrong with a lot of references to Dark Water, and could have called this Unholy Water, due to the circumstances and plot points in the film . However, there are holes in the plot, so don't look too much in the plot. One would expect standard twists towards the end of the sadistic nun, and it resembles those that can rival the recent Thai horror film Dorm. <br /> <br /> The acting is rather forgettable, with the cast speaking in perfect English strongly accented. And since most of them are pleasing to the eye, the plot must weave into a love scene in the middle of a witch hunt. What does it give? Hi, you have hantu, you still have the mood ah? Then again, the ghoul is a rather cheap animated / SFX that has an AI embedded from time to time, from time to time, just to arouse screams of timid onlookers. Characters also break every rule not written in Do-Not in horror, so you know and wait for their desserts. <br /> <br /> Maybe you will like this movie? Of course you can. Just make sure you look at it in a full house (it should be easy, since the locals suck for something remotely horrible), and laugh at those who are so nervous that they scream at every "scary" scene. It's pretty funny, and adds to the atmosphere, in addition to what's happening on the screen. Surround sound does not even come close. <br /> <br /> Consider it as if you were watching an episode of Scooby Doo without the jokes, and it's a shame that the gory moments of the movie had to be censored for a PG assessment. Those might have been the best pieces, now left to rot on the censor's floor.
