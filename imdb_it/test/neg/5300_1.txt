Uma and Travolta were very good together, but - unfortunately - when they left the screen, the film was nothing but a series of very boring and verbose secondary characters wrapped in extremely bad writing. Occasional glimpses of grandeur like the dance scene between Uma and Travolta quickly eroded when Harvey Keitel and similar uninteresting thugs liked them. And the white guy who tried to act in black got VERY, VERY hard after too much exposure in the picture. He weighed down a pretty good performance from Rock, the only secondary character you couldn't wait to see leave the screen. Ugly, stupid story. Clearly the writers could not understand if they were writing to Generation X or to the 12-15 year old rap crowd, and the combination turned into a film that kept me looking at my watch!
