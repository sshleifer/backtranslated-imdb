The films use bright blue-black skin tones to create a noir-ish atmosphere for this film, unfortunately they don't work. In fact it is rather irritating because it obscures the demon characters and reduces them to beings of one dimension. <br /> <br /> At least the original had hysterical energy and the proceeds were really amazing. Black blood is not scary at all, and not even the main female demon is appalling in her attempts to growl and growl on the screen in her best Lugosi-style camp. <br /> <br /> The narrative is grossly detached and if you could imagine 'Naked Lunch', directed by Russ Meyer, you might appreciate the attempt to be William Burroughs-esque. Otherwise, give this film a large circumference. Fans of Bava and Argento - once again - are bitterly disappointed.
