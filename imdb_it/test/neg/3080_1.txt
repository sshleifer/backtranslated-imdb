Busy stars (Heather Graham) along with (Casey Affleck) and (Luke Wilson). It is the story of Joline who is determined to find her ex-husband who is going through a mid-life crisis. <br /> <br /> Busy was not at all what I expected to be missing in the comedy that in the end was the genre. He was beyond stupid and unrealistic, Casey Affleck gave a reasonable performance, Graham's recent roles have been lackluster and this is not an improvement. <br /> <br /> Graham's most recent role was Blessed, which I also found misleading and didn't like at all. <br /> <br /> Pro Affleck <br /> <br /> Against Predictable, Unrealistic, Poor Acting and Not a Comedy Movie!
