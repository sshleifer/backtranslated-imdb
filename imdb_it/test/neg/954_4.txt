This meandering tale of mob revenge is simply not very interesting, even with Ed McMahon in a mature role as the heavy boss. Jim Brown kicks his ass effectively, Gloria Hendry proves once again that she can give life to even the poorest roles, and Brock Peters is as decent as The Cop Who Plays By the Book. It's still boring and poorly constructed, and even the print shown on cable is now emaciated by his original James Brown score.
