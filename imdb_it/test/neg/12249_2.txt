There are moments when, less than halfway through the film, I begin to wonder what the creators thought that drove them not to burn all the movie sequences and instead release a film that has no merit. And I mean any guy. This movie doesn't even hold up like a pornographic movie. In fact, Heaven's Tears is completely and utterly boring, and sometimes a little disturbing in its naivety. The girl, who is, as I remember, eighteen, masturbates thinking of an older Nazi who hit her with a car - "bumping into her in the room as a way to present us" the sitcom and film syndrome by Robert Zemekis. Then, at their second or third meeting - take this - he is the shy, the one who is resistant to the girl's sexual advances, yet, all he has to say is "I'm old enough. I want", and he takes her to bed . Then, after sleeping with this girl he barely knows, she feels completed, as if she could die right there in bed with her and would live a full life. It's like "Lolita" without a shred of social and personal comments. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is the most boring part of the film. No interesting angle or originality, not even for sex scenes, which should be the main attraction for this type of film. The masturbation scene is just a camera that surrounds the girl's bed (very fake, as if she were on a stage), and is intertwined with her fantasy of a man taking a shower in a waterfall. The "I am completed" scene is just a close-up of the girl's right side (head down to the breast) with the boy above her, and it's the same blow all the time, even if there are repetitive cuts to a scene quite independent of the Nazi's older sister, who has a sort of incestuous crush on him (it's ridiculous and silly, so it doesn't matter). I think the whole thing lasts from five to ten minutes, and it's neither illuminating nor exciting.
