So on Saturday I was sick of flu and the upside was that SciFi Channel was doing a marathon of dinosaur films that day: the trilogy "Carnosaur", "Pterodactyl", "Raptor Island". Then I flipped through my remote cable to see which SciFi movie he put into his charming Saturday night prime slot. Some films I had never heard of before were called "Raptor". I was pretty excited. The film begins with some guys who go around in a jeep when they are persecuted and killed by a Velociraptor. I was like, "Hmmm, it's weird, it almost looks like a scene in" Carnosaur ", except that it was in the middle of that movie." Then I went through a really bad acting and then a guy was sucked into walking in an underground research lab where he was eaten by a ferocious T-Rex. Now I'm like, "Wait a minute, that was also a scene in" Carnosaur ". Then, after seeing some blatantly torn scenes in" Carnosaur 2 ", I realized what the hell was going on. Roger Corman & Co. ripped off some scenes of the "Carnosaur" trilogy to use them as action scenes, intertwined in a basic "dinosaur" storyline and tried to pass the original film. I know who I am more angry with Roger Corman or SciFi Channel for trying to get through this as deserving of the slot in the early evening.The only reason it was worth looking at its conclusion was to choose the actors / actresses who looked like their counterparts in the "Carnosaur" trilogy and guessed which scenes would be removed later . As much as it pains me to be a dinosaur lover, I have no choice but to score as low as possible because I feel completely ripped off.
