When the young and naive Eddie Hatch, a window dresser from Savory's Department Store, falls in love with a statue of Venus and gives her a chaste kiss, Venus comes down from his pedestal and gives Eddie more than he wanted. This creaky example of what Hollywood can do for a Broadway musical manages to emphasize the inane story and eliminate most of the top quality songs. The aim was to create a safe and popular film without too much investment, while taking advantage of Ava Gardner's celebrity super star. Robert Walker as Eddie gets lost in an ungrateful role. Eddie is not only naive, but uncertain and unlucky. Gardner is gorgeous, but the only things that bring the film to life are Olga San Juan, Eddie's loving but jealous friend, Tom Conway as Savory's sweet owner and Eve Arden as Savory, the secretary secretary. It's a role that Arden could play in his sleep, and she's good at it. <br /> <br /> The musical was inaugurated on Broadway in 1943 and made Mary Martin a great star. The only point of a musical, however, is to have music. Since One Touch of Venus was intended as a sort of social satire, Kurt Weill, composer and Ogden Nash wrote the lyrics, inventing a series of elegant and witty songs and a single masterpiece. Without satire, or clever songs or Martin (or an equivalent showstopper), the film becomes just a weak comic fantasy in which much of the play is predictable and the fantasy is worked to death. <br /> <br /> Not only did the film's producers throw out almost all of Weill / Nash's songs, they brought the film's director, Ann Ronell, to write new lyrics for one of the surviving songs, turning sharp observation into a romantic love story. Ronell was not a hacker; wrote Willow Weep for Me. I wonder what he thought while replacing or optimizing Ogden Nash's intelligent work. <br /> <br /> The film's only bright spot is Weill / Nash's masterpiece. "Speak Low" is a fantastic love song like no one has ever written. He gave one of those ultra-professional and lifeless treatments of Eilen Wilson that he called Gardner. Dick Haymes contributes with a choir. <br /> <br /> As for Ann Ronell, she was one of the few women in Hollywood to become an important music director, as well as a composer and writer of texts. Yours for a Song: The women of Tin Pan Alley is a fascinating documentary of some of the women who have done business, including Ronell, Kay Swift, Dorothy Fields and Dana Suess. And for those who would like to hear that little of the Weill / Nash score recorded by the original Broadway cast, you may be able to track down the CD, One Touch Of Venus (1943 Original Cast) / Lute Song (1946 Original Cast). The music is paired with Lute Song, another Broadway show starring Martin.
