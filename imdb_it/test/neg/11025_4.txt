I decided to watch this film because I had never seen Carol Lombard in any film before. I'm sorry it had to be this because, frankly, is this a dog ?? and also with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn, both great actors. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is simple: try to put too much too quickly into a story about a young lawyer (John Manson played by Stewart) who marries Jane (played by Lombard) within a now from the meeting with her. What is that cliché? Get married quickly, repent at will ... <br /> <br /> In short, the story is a series of episodes that show the worsening financial status of couples, their problems with John's mother, the struggles for paying bills, John's declining status in the office, the arrival of their young son, John Jnr (unexpected and causing further friction at home with his mother), the anguish of couples on their marriage, the illness of the child that gets worse , thus necessitating a heroic flight by a lone pilot (in a fierce storm) to bring a special serum to save the child, and finally John being accepted as a junior partner at the law firm. <br /> <br /> How many more cliché situations could writers include? Perhaps the mother dies soon after? There wasn't much comedy; the drama was lackluster at best; dialogue was painful to hear. Only the acting of the four main actors was adequate. <br /> <br /> Was this the period at the end of the Great Depression with the United States emerging from its long recession? during which many people have experienced all the events portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> So, did it make sense for Selznick to reaffirm the holistic values ​​of family, relationships, heroism, perseverance and initiative? ? all against the background of the "average" American family. Who better than Jimmy Stewart and Carol Lombard? <br /> <br /> And, note that the film was released in early 1939; so, was it planned in 1938 ?? immediately after the United States began producing production for World War II. Thus, this type of film was a big call to the general public, at that time, many of those who would soon have to join England in the war. As many would know here, Hollywood and Washington formed an uncomfortable alliance before, during and after the war. <br /> <br /> However, I'm glad I saw it ?? as a piece of disguised socio-political propaganda. But I'll have to see other Lombard films to get a better appreciation of his acting. <br /> <br /> As another reviewer noted: you see this just to say you've seen all of Stewart's movies; otherwise, don't worry.
