The film is nothing but an exhibition of nudity. Has anyone noticed that all three main female characters appear naked? It seems that the only winning bet for Portuguese directors is to include some (if not many) nudity of the local stars, along with a jargon that is otherwise rejected with horror in today's Portuguese society. If you watch the Portuguese film commercial on Portuguese TV, everyone has included a "hot" scene from the film. I am not saying, in any way, that Portuguese society is alienated; except that the film industry does not seem able to find other successful ways. Returning to the film ... There is nothing left from the spirit of the book, which is a masterpiece. The film could have been good, if the true idea of ​​the book had been emphasized (topical at any time) and not the strictly erotic part. It had almost all the ingredients ... but the "chef" was horrible ...
