I think it's safe to say that if you only watch standard movies at the box office or any premium production don't worry about this movie as you will hate it. If you are a fan of too critical films, don't worry either yourself. If you love science fiction movies and you don't care what capacity you have a vision of the future, then you'll have some fun. It is obvious that the budget for this was super-low, but what they did with the money is worth a pat on the back. Some blazing fire scenes were pretty ugly and the evacuation scenes were terrible, but it is quite obvious that they had good support from a computer standpoint as the planet scenes and alien images were rather fanciful. The dialogue is exhilarating, but acts not entirely poor. As for the story, I'm not sure what really happened to tell you the truth.
