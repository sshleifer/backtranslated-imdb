Being a daughter of the 80s, I grew up with numerous educational and diversion programs (or both), and I continue to learn so much from them now that I admire the wisdom of those who worked on them. After learning that Sesame Street, to cite the best example, was not the only one responsible for the fact that I could read at an adult level before I could walk, it only increased the level of disgust I feel not only towards the Lyons society and the its product, but also those who defend them. As if I had faith in what we assign to protect ourselves or our children, the fact that Barney & Friends still pollutes our airwaves more than a decade later is a discredit not only for the FCC, the American trade and its creators, is a discredit for all humanity. In a world where I can be harassed without resorting to the police, welfare services and child protection agencies simply to be born different from those in power, yet broadcasters are allowed to pump this drunk into my home without being challenged , you have to ask what's wrong with people. <br /> <br /> You see, in a world where we expect them to behave like adults and explain themselves, what we say to our children is important because it will often have consequences long after we have gone Not only the children our attempts to make our children more normal, more similar, more thinking, potentially devastating, what ultimately teaching them is normal, also has an important role to play. So the question becomes one of the things that Barney is teaching our children to be normal. Regardless of such lessons, we are not good if we do not have good feelings, or that someone will change the rules to make us happy when we fail, other shocking things shown to us on Barney's show include Barney's molested children. The issue of child abduction and child molestation is an important thing in our society, and we have since started trying to pretend that it was not, but this would have been one of the most inappropriate ways to present the topic. /> <br /> So far I've only mentioned the inappropriate and emotionally damaging lessons that Barney presents. The addition to the problem are the children shown on the show. I use the word children roughly here, since the age range shown goes from three years up to fourteen. However, no difference in emotional response is shown at both ends. The fourteen-year-olds react to Barney and his proposed situations in exactly the same way as five-year-olds. Autism experts in childhood and adolescence consider this thing incredibly disgusting to expose children. Adults on the autistic spectrum who have faced increasing problems as soon as their needs have not been met, but flatly ignored have a tendency to look at this and feel the need to do that kind of thing with Barney that would make the fourteen year old ones cry. Being as irreverent and sick as the market-oriented shows of elder children like You Can not Do That On Television, they hit Barney proving that not only different ages respond to the same thing in different ways, as different people do. <br /> <br /> So, in response to mdmireles1295, I have to say that I hope they don't have children. For every time I see a parent showing this mess to his son, he gives me the overwhelming urge to report them to the police for child abuse. And I talk like a man whose entire education has been dominated by abuse. They could sing good manners, love, care or share, but the examples they show are not only so unbalanced as to be the opposite of education, they are so devoid of realism that they become dangerous, as Light Triton has already indicated. The kind of lessons that children learn from Barney are that people do not vary, feelings must be suppressed at all costs and the rules are completely arbitrary. When compared to the lessons that variation is what makes the world go round and even the most bitter feelings have a purpose that television taught me as a boy, it is still mind-boggling that the authorities still have to intervene and pull this garbage out of the air . If a parent has done to their child what Barney does all over the world, they should face criminal charges. <br/> <br/> So I gave Barney my favorite two out of ten that I gave to all the rubbish without absolutely redeeming value. In a world of adults who know how to respond correctly to their children, it has no space.
