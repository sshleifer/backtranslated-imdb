I know that Jesse Franco is in charge of a wide range of films, and I mainly go for his horror films, as bad as they sometimes are. I imagine it was a morbid curiosity that attracted me to this, and I wasn't even curious enough to finish it. Maybe it's improved towards the end, but unless you like lesbian sex scenes (of which there is plenty), then you might want to take a ride. So what exactly can you say about a movie that sees a woman peeing in a bowl on the kitchen counter (as she stands up)? Never worry about what is used for later, you probably don't want to know. If this sounds intriguing to you, then this is your problem, but again you might like this movie. I myself am not an idiot, I saw a lot of disgusting films in my time, but at least they were done well, and this is not. Sometimes too much is too much. Yuck.
