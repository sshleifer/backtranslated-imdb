Hard to imagine what they were thinking when they made this film (ie writers, directors, producers, actors, publishers, etc.). Christopher Plummer, a veteran of 129 films, jokes with dozens of other actors with apparently no more motivation than to collect a salary. I guess there is nothing wrong with this, but once paid it doesn't mean that nobody has to look at it. <br /> <br /> It bothers me that there are really good reviews for this movie here on imdb. Art? If you want to see art go to an art gallery, don't watch this movie. Comedy? Watch a repetition of the Flintstones, on the same plot with less waste of time. <br /> <br /> Dabney Coleman gives his usual performance, for better or for worse. And some of the young actors may have had a good experience making this film. But Plummer ???? It was embarrassing to witness his performance, indeed, throughout the film I was positively impressed by him, knowing that this was the fame of Plummer of Sound of Music! I see from his biography that he called Sound of Music "sound of mucus", so I suppose he didn't like it as much as the 100 million people he liked. <br /> <br /> I wonder if he was asked today, how would you rate Sound of Music compared to Where the Heart Is, what would you say .....? <br /> <br /> Probably something like "Where the Money Is" ....
