I was a little too old for this show when I was 6. First, when I was a small child, there were some shows for children that took place on a sesame road from which I looked and learned, but apart from that there wasn't much else. My cousins ​​were all born a few years after me, 7 years were the first to come later. Barney was a very important part of what they watched. When I saw this show for the first time I told my grandmother how she doesn't teach anything, but she uses magic to fix everything. At the time I was 9 years old, how many 9 years have any idea what's really going on in a television program. More and more that I saw or heard what Barney's teachings were, I always told people how bad the show was. The funny thing is my parents who had a baby in the mid-1980s, which was me by the way. They agreed and said the same thing I did. The sad thing about this is my cousins ​​who are older now 13 and still agree with what they saw. Do not cheat his creativity, it is not right to think differently than what someone tells you to do. His o.k steal if the person does not find out or he cares that he is gone. Let's be honest with ourselves, Barney is out to make money not teaching children anything. The more flashy the program is, the more children will be inclined to watch it. Children are stupid not because they are not educated, they simply don't know anything, the second Barney put on a show and the parents bought it. I never believed that TV could influence people like Barney does. If you have a child who reads to them watching a show that teaches them the numbers, don't let them get involved in this show. Barney is like smoking for once, smoking a little and your boyfriend letting your kids watch this show that they are hooked and one day their children will look at the same shit and buy the same shit you bought
