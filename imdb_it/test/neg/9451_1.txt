This is really the worst movie I've ever seen, from the beginning the film goes straight downhill with its poor music, its poor acting, its total lack or the real story or plot. Even for a B series movie, this is terrible. After reading some of the good reviews I thought to keep an open mind and watch it. But all the negative reviews were so right. I absolutely can't understand how anyone could have enjoyed it. I'm a big fan of science fiction and this was much more than I could swallow. You definitely do a favor by switching to a different movie. There are many other better films that deal with this topic. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
