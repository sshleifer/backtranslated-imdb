Here we go to another pop star who breaks into the great land of TV and from my observations of his pop career directors who say yes, your great gwen could be a real star maybe one day you'll be in the films of series A, they would do anything to expand the show, there is not only a pretty face, but they also have the ability to act almost overnight. Gwen has how she found the ability to act by looking at actors like James Dean or Clint to the east, please give the real people of the world that they have to sit behind that box and have to endure the pop stars' efforts to try. Please keep your good pop videos with your jap posse and don't insult the English with your efforts as an actress. however, I will go back to my working class work and think of myself as god, I could do it. but yes, I will remember that I will work until the age of 65 if I live so long and yes, put your feet on a girl with copyright every three months, pah, spouses in money, right xxx
