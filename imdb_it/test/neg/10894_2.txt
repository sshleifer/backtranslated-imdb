This film is about a young couple who flees to start a new life in Los Angeles, which ends up being haunted by a psychopath in a deserted stop. Actually, it's really about the girl (Nicole), since her boyfriend literally disappears in a few minutes. The film becomes extremely fast, and you soon wonder how it is possible to extend its story so that it works. It doesn't take long before you realize that the film does this simply by wasting time with useless scenes that go nowhere. <br /> <br /> The plot is not only thin, but unstructured, stupid and inconsistent. A few minutes after her boyfriend and her car disappeared, Nicole found a mobile home at the staging point. He sees the flashing of a camera and he KNOWs that people are inside, but he easily gives up trying to get their help when nobody answers his doors. After being informed by the killer that her boyfriend is in danger, he goes around for the rest, doing all sorts of silly and useless things. This includes turning on a TV (and even looking amused when he thinks he's hit on a porn movie, even in this terrible situation), sitting, wandering and drinking from a bottle of liquor for hours and hours. Does all this KNOW that his boyfriend has been kidnapped, that the killer is still at large and is following her, and without taking any action to ensure his immediate security (he does not bother to lock the doors or stay traffic warden). Oh yes, she tries to use a radio to ask for help, but why worry even when there is a mobile home with people right here at the rest? It really seems that the writer has forgotten this important aspect while writing this part of the story. <br /> <br /> There is no sense of entrapment or danger ever present in this story. The heroine roams freely in and around the various buildings of the rest, and the murderer drives only occasionally to scare her, before leaving. There is NOTHING that prevents Nicole from taking off (even if the rest is far away from anywhere else, it's better than sitting around), but she chooses to stay anyway. At some point in the film, the main character even RECOGNIZES that he can escape, but he doesn't. <br /> <br /> History is not going anywhere, and instead it simply jumps from a useless segment to a nonsense segment. Nicole finally enters the mobile home, and it turns out that the inhabitants are a family of protected religious fanatics, presumably in love or psychotic. They seem deliberately ignorant or indifferent about the killer 's actions (but there is no indication that they are related to him in any way), and then they chase Nicole after several minutes. <br /> <br /> In the next irrelevant segment, the main character wanders into the bathroom building. He discovers one of the previous victims of the murderer (a young woman named Tracy), who is still alive and locked in a closet. For some strange reason, Tracy starts vomiting ridiculous amounts of blood. Nicole goes to fetch a crowbar to open the closet door, and when she comes back a minute later, both Tracy and her pool of blood disappeared without explanation. What was the point? Nicole finds a bulletin board that shows many missing persons and sees that Tracy had disappeared in 1971. So, was Tracy a ghost or something? The writer never bother to explain. <br /> <br /> Subsequently, a policeman shows up in the middle of the night to be a policeman at the gas station, which was conveniently left unattended all day. Nicole tells him all about what's going on, and when the killer gets into his truck outside the office, the cop walks out to face him. What does the cop do, knowing that something is seriously wrong? He gets up and speaks calmly to the murderer (whom Nicole had even indicated to be the boy who was following her), and buys in the lie of the murderer who was simply driving and needed directions. Seriously. The policeman then talks to Nicole outside, totally unaware that the truck turns around and hits him. <br /> <br /> The policeman immediately begins to tell Nicole that he is a goner who is still "lucky to breathe", yet he strangely does not die for quite a while. The two make a bit more useless chatter, and the all-important fact that he has a gun is annoyingly not even mentioned for too long. When the two finally try to use the gun, Nicole foolishly wastes most of her bullets firing blindly at a door when the killer is probably behind it. With two bullets remaining, the policeman tells Nicole to use one for euthanasia. He shoots one in the mouth, and remains motionless for a few moments, with a fragment coming out of his head. Then, suddenly and inexplicably he shouts "You're lost!" and she has to shoot him again. Absolutely inexpensive attempt at shock. <br /> <br /> Nicole finally confronts the killer and fails. The film ends with a scene that takes place not long after, with a woman arriving at the stopping point, now strangely much more active. In the bathroom building, he hears Nicole looking for help in the closet (closed as Tracy). He lets a policeman in and checks him, but finds an apparently normal and clean closet. The policeman leaves, thinking he has been deceived. A battered Nicole is seen coming out from behind some boxes in the closet (it would have been easily spotted if the cop had spent all 10 seconds watching), apparently too stupid for saying or doing something when the cop was there. WOW. <br /> <br /> This film is apparently the first of a new line of "quality" films directed on DVD, marketed as extremes for theaters. Actually, it's just more clich√©, B-Movie's garbage.
