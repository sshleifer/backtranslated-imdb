I expected this film to originally show before the election. CBS's last attempt to launch an excavation against Bush. This film was just awful but I'm still watching it. ** Minor Spoiler ** I think CBS has the same people who have "provided" the memo with half-cutting the sequence. What's in the plot of the bad boy? The acting can be more elaborate or the dialogue is more like an Ed Wood film. Who ever invented this script, please do us a favor, stop writing. If you want to see decent grade B disaster movies, check out Earthquake, Flood, etc. Avoid this chaos of a movie. Clue to CBS avoids showing us this shit. Instead, give us a replica of CSI. Better acting and more credible.
