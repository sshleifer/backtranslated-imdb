A friend invited me to see it in the cinemas. <br /> <br /> After half an hour we went out and entered the next multiplex (yes, we broke the rules) in time to take the start of Against All Probabilities. <br /> <br /> I remember too many monkeys dancing around saying "oog, oog". Very little of the characters or introduction to the story has captured one of us or was even memorable. He dragged himself to the point of being painfully boring (and believe me, every excuse was good enough to spend time with this particular friend). Production values ​​were excellent, good photography and lighting, but this was a major studio release, and we came to see a movie, not an art gallery. It seemed that Ralph Richardson and Andie McDowell would be wasted on a film so poorly written. <br /> <br /> Maybe if you do the second hour, there is something worth seeing. I don't have much patience with my time. 4 out of 10.
