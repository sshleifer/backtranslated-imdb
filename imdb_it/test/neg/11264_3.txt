I saw this film last week during the Berlin Festival and had medium-high expectations. - The director is Bertrand Tavernier and I knew some of his previous works in French cinema. I actually liked some of his previous films. - The cast: Tommy Lee Jones, John Goodman, Peter Sarsgard, Mary Steenburgen ... I couldn't wait to see all these talents on screen. -I was not familiar with the book on which it is based and I had not read anything about the film beforehand, but was told that it was an investigation film set in the deep south (we have seen many in the past, maybe this will beautiful like the others ...) <br /> <br /> 2 hours later, the final titles appear: THANKS TO GOD IT WAS FINISHED !!!! - The plot is beyond comprehension. If you read the book, you have a significant advantage. There were too many minor characters and there were many useless plot arcs. We didn't understand anything! - The accents. My God! The accent of Tommy Lee Jones is decent, but I still have nightmares from the Cajun-French song of Mary Steenburgen ... - Poor casting in my opinion. I can't believe old Tommy Lee Jones can beat the shit of a linebacker goon ... And I'm not afraid of John Goodman. - Who were these people?!? We barely understand who these characters are and what they do. Is there a bait shop? Tommy Lee Jones has a girl from Guatemala? Blorg! - Comic attempts were pathetic. The funniest thing about the movie was probably the "action" and "suspense" scenes. They were horrible. No shudders Bad acting (Can Tommy Lee Jones make different faces or is he like Derek Zoolander?) ... - And then there's the sci-fi stuff. No spoilers, but it becomes ridiculous and annoyingly weird. <br /> <br /> I don't usually write comments on IMDb but I thought the film was so bad and disappointing that I felt compelled to share my opinion. But it's just me ...
