Almost everything in this film is wrong, wrong, wrong. Take Mike Myers, for example. He has reached the point where you realize his shtick hasn't changed since his SNL days, over ten years ago. He's doing the same cutes-stream-of-consciousness beats and the same voices. His cat is painfully little fun. Look for a difficult way. It's a bit of a strange type A comic, not the cold cat it should be. The rest of the film is just as bad. The sets are incredibly ugly --- and clearly a waste of millions of dollars. (The cardboard cutouts for the buildings in the background would have made more sense than the construction of an entire neighborhood and a main road.) Alec Balwin tries to make a funny impression of Great Santini, but ends up looking inconsistent. There is even an unexpected cheesecake with the fake celebrity Paris Hilton --- which creeps into your mind simply because this should be a Dr. Seuss story. Avoid this movie at all costs, people. Nor is it an interesting train accident. (I hope they'll make Horton Hears a Who with Robin Williams, then we'll have the Spasitc-comedian trilogy with the script for Seuss's movie).
