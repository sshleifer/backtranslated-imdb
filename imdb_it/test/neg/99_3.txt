Four things intrigued me for this film - first and foremost, it is the protagonist of Carly Pope ("Popular" fame), which is always a pleasure to watch. Secdonly presents the brilliant New Zealand actress Rena Owen. Thirdly, it is shot in collaboration with the New Zealand Film Commission. Fourth, a friend recommended it to me. However, I was completely disappointed. The whole plot is absurd and complicated, with minimal resolution. Pope's acting is fine, but Owen is unfortunately underutilized. The other actors and actresses are fine, but I don't know them all. Apart from the pleasant riddles that are scattered throughout the film (and Pope and Owen), this film is not very good. So the moral of the story is ... don't look at it if you don't really want to.
