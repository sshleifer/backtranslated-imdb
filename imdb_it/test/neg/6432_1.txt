I signed this film from my local movie store, not expecting anything to be flash or fantasy. Given that it was a "B" movie, made on a very tight budget. The opening scenes of the film were quite original and so was the plot and this is what made me take the film. However the film becomes very boring and frustrating in the points. The story had a lot of holes and the acting had its right amount of disappointment. At the end of the film I was praying that a higher power would hit me where I was while I was extremely bored but above all frustrated with how the story ended. I still can't understand what really happened and I'm not particularly interested. in conclusion the devil would have wept disgusted to know that Hell (his domain) was used as the basis for such a lousy movie.
