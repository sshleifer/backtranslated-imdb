Very slow, boring, enigmatic film. Perhaps the kind of film that Jean-Luc Godard would have made had he been Italian. It certainly conveys how boring, repetitive, joyless, and empty a person's life can be, but I don't usually go to the movies to find out! The plot (as it is) is not convincing. Because a receptionist of a luxury hotel (an exception due to the dullness of the film) would be a bit interested in a lunatic, moody, smoker and silent who speaks in "deep" aphorisms, confuses me. Very difficult to feel sympathy for the main character. You want to shake him by the throat and tell him to "shoot away!" His brother is a much more human character. The ending is inconclusive and disconcerting. Everyone in the cinema (when I saw the movie) came out muttering about how they almost fell asleep. Of course, it shouldn't be a "shhot-em-up" Hollywood-style party, Bruce Willis and "crash-bang", but a little energy and action would make it much more thrilling. One of the best Italian films ever ?! Pleease ... A home of art, curiosity to the fullest.
