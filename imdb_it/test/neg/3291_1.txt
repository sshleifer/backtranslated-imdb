You have seen the usual stereotyped stories of tired sitcoms, characters, stories a thousand times before, only that it excels at sucking more than others. First of all, there is not a single character on this show who is even remotely nice ... especially that of Michael Rapaport. Dave Gold is by far one of the greatest donkeys that has ever given a television screen ever ... I am reminded of a repulsive. If in real life a father was unlikely, cruel and only generally unfit for his parents ... fratricide would be your only option. To call the stereotypes of the remaining characters would be too complementary. If these characters end up supporting life, the line to pull the plug would be light years long. As this show has concluded a complete season, much less 2 is a mystery. FOX cancels "Arrested Development" and keeps this on the air ??? Tell me the terrorists are not winning.
