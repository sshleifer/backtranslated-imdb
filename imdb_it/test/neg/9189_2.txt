First of all, I am not a fireman, but I am in a kind of paramilitary unit (the guys who are called if an earthquake strikes and the real firefighters need more people for SAR), so I had some training and simulation but I have no real life experience. <br /> <br /> But anyway, there are some points that are absolutely incredible. I can understand that they have removed the mask's mouth / nose and that there is not enough smoke, because otherwise the public would see nothing. But some things defy logic: <br /> <br /> - No second mask attached to oxygen. How the hell do you want to save people through smoking without one? <br /> <br /> - Rappelling people. No, it's not like that. I too would be screaming if someone had attached a rope to me like that and hung me from a building. If you could scream, that is, and not faint from the lack of air because the rope tightens my lungs. The second time you are abseiling, it's better but it's still weird. <br /> <br /> - "High Tip". No, you don't know. Always fight fire from the lowest possible. Don't fight to spread flames, you want to put out the fire, and this is below the flames. <br /> <br /> - No discipline. They are running like a chicken. And they scream all the time, instead of using the radio, and keep the discipline. <br /> <br /> - No tactics. Why don't they work in teams of at least two? You can still separate yourself, but it takes much more than if everyone looks around for themselves in search of victims. <br /> <br /> - Do they really enter buildings without bringing water? I Europe, firefighters would never enter a burning building without it. <br /> <br /> - The firemen on the roof. WTF think they're doing it without security lines or water? - Exploding rooms. Wood and brick do not "suddenly explode". <br /> <br /> The best points are actually the camaraderie and other non-fire parts of the film. It's very kitschy, but it's fine. I'll give him a point for this.
