When I typed Savage Intruder into the IMDb search engine, one of the options he found was Savage Garden: International Video Collection: The Story so Far (1999), the only reason I say this is that I'm a big fan of Savage Garden and you should do yourself a favor and check out some of their music like Affirmation or To the Moon and Back rather than worry about this medium boiler, sorry I just wanted to say it. In any case, Savage Intruder begins with a bizarre montage of what resembles the musical and premiere sequences of MGM and some shot portraits that have no meaning in the long run. It's the late 60s in Hollywood and, in the midst of pomp and glamor, a serial killer is at work selecting the oldest actresses, killing them and dismembering their bodies. A young man named Vic Valance (David Garfield in the role of John David Garfield) jumps off a bus tour to look for work when he stops at the home of a retired actress, Katharine Parker (Miriam Hopkins) who has been a of the biggest stars of the film "but now lives in a big house with an old housekeeper named Mildred (Florence Lake), a personal secretary Leslie Blair (Gale Sondergaard) and a young maid named Geta (Virginia Wing). Katharine has "He recently broke his foot and needs a personal assistant and gives Vic the job. Slowly Vic enchants Katharine's affections and, more importantly, his big wallet. Vic starts shooting Katharine against the other employees, but Vic isn't what it looks like: Vic is a stupid drug addict who manages to get Greta pregnant while still having sex with Katharine.Greta threatens to tell Katharine and ruins Vic's devious plans, but has a close encounter with an ax, no he is safe at home while Vic takes drugs, sex, rock 'n' roll party and gardening at villa Parker while his sinister plan starts to become more and more evident ... <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Donald Wolfe, I thought Savage Intruder was a bit of a mess but at the same time pleasantly amusing. The script is everywhere and can't really decide what it wants to be, Savage Intruder suffers from an identity crisis! The film begins with the discovery of a severed head and limbs, immediately after another woman (Dorothy Kingston) is killed by a mysterious unidentified figure, but then gets rid of the elements of the slasher film she just built by not returning never again to them. Savage Intruder thus becomes a sort of wellness film while Vic makes friends with Katharine and shows her how to enjoy life again and have an implicit sexual relationship with her, it is really disgusting to think that she is old enough to be her grandmother. Katharine stops living the life of a recluse and abandons alcohol while Vic seems to make her happy as they go to celebrate together and organize banquets for Katharine's friend, as she did too. This part of Savage Intruder would not appear out of place in a Disney movie! Every so often the tedium of the beautiful things is interrupted by Vic who pulls up and has some silly hallucinations on his mother (Sybelle Guardino) and cuts a hand with an ax, but has sex with Great at some point. Then, after Greta was murdered, Savage Intruder becomes a bizarre horror film when Vic is revealed for the madman he is. Savage Intruder simply does not flow properly like a film in my opinion, since it mixes various genres with little success. In the same way the elements of the murder crime do not work and are frankly a bit of an enigma, because doing everything to hide the identity of the murderers during the murder scenes, but then perfectly clarifying who is committing them throughout the rest of the film? Vic as a character did not work for me either, one moment he is a cold, calm, intelligent and sneaky scammer and then he is a crazy crazy delusion! Why kill all his other victims, but with Katharine looking for her? What makes it so different? If it is because he has the money, why not pursue it to begin with? So many questions and so few answers ... Some dialogues of the '60s are quite funny to listen to these days as when Vic offers Greta a painkiller, actually hard drugs, and Greta says "What good is a painkiller?", Vic he answered yes "because you are a pain" wow, this guy knows how to charm women! Or when Katharine suggests that Vic is gardening and you ask "do you have green fingers?" he answers "no, but I'm good in the grass!" There is not much blood in Savage Intruder, some severed limbs and a pair of decapitated heads. There is also a pretty impressive shot when someone has the severed hand with an ax which is probably why it is repeated three or four times. The stupid scenes of pharmacological hallucinations must be seen to be believed. Technically, Savage Intruder is OK, the location of filming in the grand villa and in the Hollywood hills probably give it a better look than it deserves, acting as average as the rest of the production. Overall, I would say that Savage Intruder appears to be a murder mystery that unfortunately drives the killer away and therefore does not work. It is a watch of a slightly fun time and at most and a complete mess of a movie for the worse, you decide which one!
