Probably the most disgusting thing that has come out of Australia since Vegemite ... A predictably unpleasant comedy with Barry Humphries in a dual role as the casual Australian diplomat Les Patterson and undercover agent Dame Edna! So many gags of physical functions that even the Farrelly brothers would have been sick, and several rough moments, especially the effects of the horrendous H.E.L.P. virus. Only for extreme toilet humor fans. Oh, and this is "NeverEnding Story II", NOT the "Mad Max" George Miller, who directed ... * Â½ <br /> <br />
