I deactivated it within the first five minutes. He is very sick and disturbing, when I turned him off it was when the beautiful white horse was allowed into the slaughterhouse and his skull was pierced by a small tube instrument. This creature lay on the floor in a state of shock before he died. The narrator said that the animal dies instantly, it is not so. I disagree with graphic realism towards animals, insects or any living creature. I was very disappointed since I just saw "Eyes Without a face" which was a fantastic film and this short film was attached, which ruined my night - because I couldn't hurt a fly, it didn't matter to watch this wild man documentary. /> <br /> reading other reviews on this page, I noticed that they used words like aesthetics - this is not art or beauty. I can imagine that the documentary would be very articulate and profound but not aesthetic.
