At first I thought this little fantasy trip would be a little fun. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> A good cast (Roy Scheider as president) did not help him. History had all the possible worst-case scenarios that could occur in a terrorist nuclear disaster. And none of this could happen POSSIBLE! <br /> <br /> True - the abduction of the President could only be accomplished with the internal help of a traitor in the Secret Service (Air Force One wing), but all that they represented for SOCCER and powerlessness of our country if it falls into enemy hands is ridiculous to the nth degree. Seriously, not even the President can completely overcome the control of the missiles. The case is used only to place orders. In this situation, our system would have completely erased the codes and the whole thing would not have gone anywhere. The destruction of Beijing could not happen - there would have been no launch of missiles because the silos teams would be instructed not to do so (communications include a wired system). There are too many security guards to prevent this from happening. <br /> <br /> True, films like FAIL-SAFE and STRANGELOVE have given a certain credibility to the concept of losing control of THE SYSTEM. But this film goes too far and fails to suspend my concept of the incredible. And that makes the experience a waste of time for the viewer. This film is a failure.
