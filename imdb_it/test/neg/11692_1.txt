Oh, how terrible this movie is! I don't know if it's a horror movie or a drama, because the story and both genres haven't been established very well! History does not move, it is slow, boring and sleepy from beginning to end. This film really bores me! But I really liked the camera work, it's authentic, fresh and clear, even the acting is fantastic, the boy was the great interpreter of this film, but he didn't blow me out of my chair. But this movie makes me take a pillow, lie down on the bed and sleep until the credits roll ... <br /> <br /> Boring! Not worth watching! I tell you, this movie was sucked! <br /> <br /> 1/10
