Having endured this film last night, I turned off the DVD player with the sense of deserving a medal for having the strength to see it until the end. Throughout the film, I felt I was looking at the fillers of the plot that you get in a high-budget porn movie. the acting was stiff and tense, the camera worked appallingly, and the settings and scenes were so poor that it looked like they had lent them from the "Amateur Dramatic's Society" High School. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved this film was that it had in its credits Amy Adams and Harriet Sansom Harris, apart from the fact that it was pure dribbling.
