I don't know what the producers of this film were trying to do or say, but they seriously failed at whatever it was. Unless, of course, the object was absolutely confused with the viewer. I saw this movie simply because there was Drew Barrymore, and it turned out he had a cameo smaller than the small one. The idea of ​​having this guy on a car trip to win a cash prize from a gas station and meeting up with all kinds of wackos is absolutely ridiculous.
