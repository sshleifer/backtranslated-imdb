I can overcome political parody; although this was SUPPORT to be a "Masters of horror" film. <br /> <br /> But what I can't get over is the brazen use of our war heroes (and their sacrifice) as pawns in some washed up the horror maker political statement. <br /> <br /> For me it was simply insulting to profane Arlington and our heroes. I have family in Arlington. The idea that this guy (Dante) can even portray the disturbed Arlington tombs makes me want to vomit. <br /> <br /> I'm done with Dante and I'm done with MOH.
