ATTENTION: CAN CONTAIN SPOILER <br /> <br /> The ripples in the wake of the first "Jaws" film were still in vogue in the 1980s and beyond. Movie monsters switched from radioactive monstrosities to unknown and voracious beasts lurking in the unexplored corners of the human experience (ie: the ocean, deep space, genetics). Although "Jaws" was a milestone in this particular realm of cinematic horror, few films were able to match the visceral impact of the original. "Red Shark in the Ocean" (aka Devil Fish or Red Ocean), is a faithful follower of the original "Jaws" formula. After several unfortunate boats and navigators have been brutally murdered by some ocean creature, there is an initial push to discover the beast, so a failure to study it without horrible results and a final push to destroy it. Although filmmakers have tried to inject a new life into the equation by adding elements of technology and corporate conspiracy, the result is nothing short of disastrous. This film sinks under its own weight of horrible retaliation, fragile acting and economic bravado. <br /> <br /> The most malfunctioning feature of "Devil Fish" is its modification in cookie-cutter format. From the beginning of the film, when 3 different scenes are mixed together, the viewer has the feeling that the film has no technical credibility. It seems as if the editors cut the scenes around a musical score rather than cutting the film and then making the necessary changes to the music. Furthermore, each cut is an intercut and it would seem that publishers have never heard of "fading", "erasing" or "fading". The impact of the scenes can never settle because they are immediately interrupted after the last line and a new scene begins. The stupid tricks of the camera abound like when two of the main characters share a private moment on the beach and a sort of accelerated image of their act is composed over their bodies. <br /> <br /> The music is equally bland. The creature theme is a hopeless duplicate of the "Jaws" theme with slight variation. Although I like to keep my reviews without the MST3K influence, Mike has rightly described black music as "soft core music". Failing to produce tension in a film that relies so heavily on it is a deadly blow to "Devil Fish". The acting is stale, the reports baffling and the whole conspiracy is ridiculous. The question remains that if genetics had advanced to a level that would create a huge chimera of a sea monster to protect oceanic interests, why couldn't more practical use be used to improve humanity? One of the few positive aspects of this film is the idea of ​​the monster, even if its cinematic presence is less than stellar. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is ugly enough to dive below the mediocre. If "Jaws" had never been realized, then the film could be described as medium because its subject would be new and exciting even if it were performed ineffectively. Unfortunately, as a copy of Spielberg's original thriller, it sits comfortably on a pile of cheese.
