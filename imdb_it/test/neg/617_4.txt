'Felony' is a B-movie. There is no doubt. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you look at the cast, you may have high hopes for its entertainment potential. This film is full of all those wonderful actors you grew up with, the ones with the faces you recognize immediately, even though you probably don't know their names. It is surprising that the filmmakers managed to bring all these people together in one project, almost as if they had decided to have a meeting with a B-movie actor. The cast also includes a couple of first-rate actors: David Warner, who many will recognize from Titanic (although my favorite of his roles is Jack the Ripper in "Time After Time") and Lance Henriksen, who many remember as a bishop in "Aliens". These two actors have done an excellent job in their long careers and have made some very beautiful films. <br /> <br /> However, as impressive as this collection of actors is, their talent never shows itself completely on the screen. "Felony" writers spent a lot of money assembling a dream-team cast and then lost their golden opportunity due to an important factor, the common denominator of all B-movies: a stupid script. <br /> <br /> Let's start with a stupid premise. The villains are captured on the tape by committing a horrific murder and relentlessly persecute the film crew to capture the videotape and destroy the evidence. But honestly, why worry? In the time necessary to track down the film crew, it is possible to create and spread a thousand copies of this tape to all law enforcement agencies and the media. Criminals do not seem to realize how futile their efforts are, and they talk as if stealing and destroying the only original videotape will solve the whole problem. Silly ... but I suppose if the bad guys were so logical there wouldn't be a movie. <br /> <br /> Then there is dialogue. Sometimes it's silly, sometimes clich√© and sometimes unbelievable ... everything you expect from a B-movie. Of course, I have always believed that strong performances can overcome many weaknesses in the material. This cast includes actors who are certainly capable of strong performances, and although some cast members are not good actors at all and have achieved B-movie status quite deservedly, one could still hope that the strongest part of the cast will be able to breathe life into their parts. However, it is disappointing to see that some of the actors in this film really seem to take the film seriously enough to give their best. There is not much obvious inspiration in these performances, but then again it is an uninteresting script. Now, I'll admit that some of the cast's most colorful actors manage to add a certain amount of pizazz in the delivery of their lines, but honestly, even the very good actors I mentioned before seem mostly disinterested and uninvolved history. <br /> <br /> Speaking of history ... even if the acting had been of a caliber high enough to make the dialogue seem a little less approximate, it would not have yet redeemed "Felony" from the fact that its writer commits the last misstep of low-budget action film scripts: a plot with lots of holes like a block of Swiss cheese. You can watch this movie a hundred times and you still won't understand how it all adds up. In an attempt to create suspense and always keep the viewer guessing, the writer throws in all sorts of unexpected surprises and twists in his script and ends up with a puzzle, but when you get to the end you find that there are a lot of pieces that they simply do not fit into anything and others that are missing. I admire a good thriller that makes me guess, but creating twists that only exist to confuse you and that are not consistent with the rest of the story is amateur. There was so much that it was never explained that I felt extremely frustrated at the end. If you decide to look at it, be prepared to be confused. <br /> <br /> I haven't even mentioned all kinds of other nonsense about this movie, but I won't worry. The funny thing is, despite all that I said, I have to admit that I can't give "1/10 stars" to Felony. Even if I can't understand exactly why, I actually found this movie a little funny. Stupidity can be fun sometimes if you're in the mood to do it. Besides, I really like some of these actors, and even if their performances are rather dull considering their talent, I still had the pleasure of seeing them. <br /> <br /> Now, I realize that I have evaluated this film from the point of view of a serious spectator. It is quite possible that I completely lost the point. It could be that the intent of the filmmakers was to make a B-movie. Perhaps stupidity is completely intentional. If so, and if I were to evaluate it in these terms, I should say that "Felony" is a classic in the genre of ironic action films. Fans of B movies will love seeing all their favorite actors together in a movie, get a few giggles from the script and be entertained by the healthy dose of guns, explosions and chases.
