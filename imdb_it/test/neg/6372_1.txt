I have collected Iron Man comics since the early 1970s and have always appreciated the character who is very far from the average clean hero and his numerous and varied enemies. There have been no less than three attempts in an animated series for Iron Man and only the original and part of the second have ever done justice to the character. So I was pretty confident that this new version would be good. Boy was I wrong! The art of DVD is VERY misleading and presents an image that is not the film. Punch out of the good, what little there is ... Art and animation are well designed and writing and dialogue are generally good, though with notable exceptions. The characters' voices are very well selected and each character is distinctive and well acted. Now for the evil ... Unfortunately the writers have opted for totally because of the origins of Iron Man and above all of the mandarin. They also decided to make Iron Man and his opponents all in CGI. Bad CGI. This makes them stand out almost like those of an actor. CG's work is often repetitive and dazzling abbreviations are sometimes taken. Even the CG battles are clumsy, further increasing the fact that CG and Line animations don't mix well. The film would certainly have worked better if all the characters had actually decided on DRAW. Another problem is that Iron Man is in his traditional red and golden suit for all ONE battles! And it's not even the big fight at the end. All this drags the film down and is never detected. <br /> <br /> ************ SPOILERS (or warnings) PU F FOLLOW *********** * <br /> <br /> The movie starts with an interesting sequence of credits in stop motion of machines, welds and gears. Then we are presented with what looks like a Chinese temple being restored, and in the foreground a statue of what the fans will recognize as Mandarin. Things go strangely, preventing progress in the restoration of the temple. Guarding him is James Rhodes, a longtime friend of Tony Stark. They appear to be planning to lift the temple from the earth, despite opposition from a group that insists that raising the temple will lead to a terrible disaster. Rhodes is caught in a raid. Stark, shown in a hot tub with a beautiful lady, is informed of the problems and proposes to personally supervise the project and save his friend while in the background the father takes care of the council leaders who are pushing to have Tony removed. Tony only arrives to have his armored escort escorted and torn to pieces. Tony later wakes up mortally wounded in the heart and a prisoner of the rebels. It is saved only by rapid action by Rhodes and a scientist. Eventually Stark has to build the prototype of gray iron armor and make a good escape, but only after some loss of life. While with the rebels he meets a tormented girl named Li Mei, and the two fall in love. The Temple rises and four elemental beings appear (all made in CG) and begin to collect hidden power rings. Stark and Rhody find problems at home but manage to confront the Elementals without success by really stopping them, first using the Water Armor, then the more classic Red and Gold Armor and finally everything returns to the temple and Stark is back in the big gray armor for one final showdown and a run with what could be Fin Fang Foom (also in CG.) Here the story takes an important turn as it turns out that Mandarin needs a host body to demonstrate. This leads to a rather tragic final battle, marred by the fact that Mandarin is little more than a ghost and is not seen until the last 5 minutes of the film. ugh ... <br /> <br /> If you are an Iron Man fan then you probably won't have fun. And even non-fans might find the movie a bit lacking or not.
