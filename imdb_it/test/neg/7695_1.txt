Total dishonor! Really terrible! The script and dialogue are a joke and combined with a director who has no idea of ​​life in Saudi Arabia. It is no surprise, rather it has a Saudi film, the director is Palestinian-Canadian, the writer is Lebanese, the lead actress is Jordanian, and the shooting took place in Dubai, and all these elements show very well to make the film far from representing Saudi society. Yes, it contains some Saudi clichés, the things we see in the comics in the newspapers every day, but that's all. The film had the opportunity to show a real problem with Saudi society, or at least to give us something new and genuine about the problems and concerns of young people in Saudi Arabia, instead it copied and pasted here and there, and the result is It was a disaster. Even the supposed love story in the film does not exist or at least we have not seen it. The only positive side in this total defeat is a good acting cast of support. The veteran Khaled Sami was fun in a badly written role like his grandfather, who is clearly abused, because he looks younger than the actor who plays his son. Even the actor who plays the role of the fanatic brother, Turki Al-Yusuf, did well, in fact he was the best actor in the film. The rest of the cast, being professionals for a long time, did a good job, but lead actor Hisham Abdulrahman was simply bad. He looked like a lovely little bobby for all situations. He couldn't even say his lines correctly. He has a charisma that made him win the title of Star Academy, a very famous reality show, and is good at interviews and TV shows, but it was just the weakest link in this film. The leading actress didn't mind much, but she also acted badly in some scenes and exaggerated her sensuality in an unnecessary way. <br /> <br /> The film was a great success, the Saudis flocked to thousands in neighboring Bahrain and Dubai assisted him when it was screened there, and made a tone of money, then it was screened in pay- per-view, then broadcast on TV, and was in a span of a few weeks. This to collect the Saudi enthusiasm for local entertainment, but unfortunately; the film was neither Italian nor fun.
