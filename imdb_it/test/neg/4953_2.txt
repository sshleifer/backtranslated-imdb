Jack Brooks's quirks are, at the beginning, somewhat fascinating and lend themselves to the deliberately campy feeling of the beginning of this film. <br /> <br /> I found myself getting even more angry when I was led to see this in the end, in the hope that the compensation would be worth the super-boring wait. <br /> <br /> The climax can't start to recover for the whole setup time. <br /> <br /> Normally one could expect superficial characters of this kind. But the fact that the wait-time-before-action index is so high, should mean that the average time would be devoted to some interesting character developments. <br /> <br /> Not so. <br /> <br /> Even without its initial attractions, this film ultimately infuriates and disappoints. <br /> <br /> I wish I could recover all that time, reinvest it in something that pays off.
