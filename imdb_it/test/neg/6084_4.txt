It's a shame that quality actors like Baldwin and Booth have to succumb to lousy stories and scripts just for the money. But hey, it's a cruel world ... <br /> <br /> This is just another one of a long series of yellow murderers who use all the usual twists to try to make it look more attractive than it is . Sure, it has nice locations, it's a brilliant production, there are some good shooting and editing features, and it's quite inspiring, overall. <br /> <br /> So what's the real problem? Quite simply, the whole premise is absolutely incredible. However, instead of ruining a rotten story for you, I let you find out what it is, that is if you manage to overcome it. I succeeded, but only because I like Baldwin and I kept hoping it would improve. <br /> <br /> Not so. And it had one of the most anti-climatic endings I've seen for a long time. Indeed, perhaps never ... <br /> <br /> But it's harmless fun, I suppose, if you have nothing better to do.
