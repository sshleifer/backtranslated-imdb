The most obvious flaw ... horrible and horrible script. This film has had a potentially good story, but it has been ruined by ugly dialogues, continuity problems, things that have never been explained, empty spaces, secondary plots that have gone nowhere and simply pure stupidity. Not to mention the terrible direction of Sandra Locke. Not even two big shows could have saved this movie. So it didn't matter that Devon Gummersall and Rosanna Arquette did horrible performances. The fact is that they are better actors than those in which this film would have us believe. The best of the Arquettes, Rosanna Arquette (Silverado, After Hours, Desperately Seeking Susan) has some good moments - like a great scene in the beginning when she painfully pulls the handcuffs - but offers a weak overall performance, according to her standards. And Devon Gummersall (Dick, When Trumpets Fade, and the brilliant My So-Called Life) is much worse, acting without conviction or emotion than ever. But I will not blame the actors, who were good at other roles. The script is horrible and bad direction doesn't help. Do me a favor ... avoid this movie.
