Swoon focuses on the homosexual relationship of Leopold and Loeb - an aspect of the case that was mostly (and unjustly) ignored by their trial, even by Leopold himself in his autobiography. But, even in the treatment of this Swoon, it does so by far. Worse, it distorts, combines and directly alters the details of the case that will irritate anyone who knows a lot and at the same time will confuse those who do not know it. Although it is an interesting film, Swoon smells. <br /> <br /> 1 in 10 - horrible.
