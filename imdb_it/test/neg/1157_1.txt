Ed Gein's story is interesting, VERY interesting. However, this film is interesting only because it was actually made. The portrait of Ed Gein by Kane Hodder is so far away, it's not even a little strange. Ed Gein didn't behave in a psychotic way in public, he was very calm and collected and always extremely polite to everyone and he talked to whoever listened to him, this is one of the most important things that this film failed to show to the public. But the biggest mistake of this film, on the side of a single frame, is that Ed never killed anyone without being told to do it by his dead mother, who he thought was speaking from beyond the grave. He only killed the people his dead mother said he had to do because it was God's will, and he was very sorry, even if it didn't stop him from experiencing cannibalism and wearing people's flesh. I officially gave this film a rating of "1" simply because "0" was not given to me as an option. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend everyone to stay away from this movie. If you want to watch a movie that accurately portrays Ed Gein and does not try to insert a sub-story love story between a policeman and an imaginary woman who never existed, I highly recommend watching the original film, which unfortunately does not seem to be on IMDb.com although I could be wrong, but I still have to find it here. The original does not stray from real events and does not attempt to distort history. I can understand that I have told the story from a different perspective, but this film has simply tried to change the true story itself, something I find horrible as if someone were making a film based on the 9/11 attack, but it gave a twist to the Canada Behind. Or a WWII movie that says that Hitler was a good boy and that he helped fight the Nazis.
