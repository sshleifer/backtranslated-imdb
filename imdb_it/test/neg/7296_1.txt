I saw this film with a group of Nazis, a French archaeologist and my ex-girlfriend on a small island in the Mediterranean. <br /> <br /> When the tape was started, my girlfriend and I were tied to a wooden pole at the end of this cave as an area. I told her to close her eyes and no matter what happened to not open them. The Nazis and the archaeologist did not close their eyes and after a few seconds began to scream. The Nazis' faces melted and the archaeologist's head exploded. <br /> <br /> After a few seconds the VCR came up from the VCR and returned to its box and the top closed again. My girlfriend and I were unharmed. <br /> <br /> Consequently to this experience, the videocassette was placed in a wooden box and kept in a huge warehouse of identical wooden boxes, to be never seen again.
