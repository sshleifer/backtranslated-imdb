Lowe returns to the nest later, yet another, failed report, to find out that he was assigned to the jury. It is in the plans to somehow get out of it, when he realizes that the defendant is the girl who had a crush on the first grade. <br /> <br /> Living in the past by telling other people about his feelings about this girl (played by Camp), Lowe remembers those feelings and does everything in his power to clear the field of attempted murder, while moving away from the real villains at the same time, managing to create a successful film at the same time. I have heard that St. Augustine is the oldest city in the United States, and I also know that it has some connection with Ponce de Leon, so the background is a good starting point. Unfortunately, it's the only good thing about this movie. The local police are inept, the judge is an idiot and the defender does everything in his power to make her look like Joanie Cunningham! I don't know whether to blame the director for bad direction, or for simply letting the cast make such an unfortunate effort. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was so boring, I couldn't even sleep it! 1 out of 10 stars!
