Kennan Ivory Wayans was so funny in Low Down Dirty Shame that I had to see this and it was one of the worst he ever did and Steven Seagal didn't help much. Start with some strange religious killings that don't make much sense to Jim Campbell (Keenan). He's surprised to see a new partner waiting for him to work alongside him to solve the case, but Jack Cole doesn't seem to be what everyone thinks they are until Jack's ex-wife is killed in one of those ritual murders that they end up making the suspect himself. It's the same thing as all his other films: smoking past, CIA involvement and now trying to be a regular cop. Why does Steven disguise himself as a western movie? And the prayer at the top of it makes things a little confusing.
