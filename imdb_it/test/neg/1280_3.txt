ALL GROWN UP is basically a spin off and not much more than the original comic book Nickalodeon RUGRATS featuring the kids Tommy Pickles, Chucky Finster, Lil and Phil DeVille, Angelica, Susie and (later) Kimi (sister of Chuckies) and Dill (the brother of Tommy). I grew up with RUGRATS and thought it was a great cartoon. He had excellent humor, good stories and the creators of the show, Klasky & Csupo, were obviously very original and creative with the concept of children's adventures. The new show ALL GROWN UP tries to regain the magic of the original cartoon. I was disappointed when I saw it. I found Chuckie "all-grown-up" just annoying and the whole "pre-teen-acting-mature / try-to-be-popular" that applied (unfortunately) * to all * dull and faded characters. There are still some funny and joke scenes in the new series and it was interesting how the artists would make the whole RUGRATS baby gang appear ten years from their age on the original show. Overall, this show is "fair" and only watchable if a) you are a huge RUGRATS fan, b) you have never seen the original show, c) you are a pre-adolescent who has nothing to do, or d) you are so bored that somehow you are forced to see this show. This show is not good. It is not comparable to the old episodes of RUGRATS in terms of quality, humor and all the rest.
