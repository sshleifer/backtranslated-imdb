A young doctor and his wife are suddenly expecting a baby. Both are disturbed by a two-hour memory interval on the night of conception. Interesting twist on a trivial story. Excellent F / X ratio and interesting editing. Jillian McWhirter is exceptional in a cast that includes Arnold Vosloo, Wilford Brimley and Brad Dourif. Brimley brings normality to the extravagant. Congratulations to director Brian Yuzna.
