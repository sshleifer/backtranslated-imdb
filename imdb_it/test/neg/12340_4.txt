Rather like Paul Newman and Steve McQueen with their racing car films, this one has all the features of a "jollies" project for Robert Redford, as he skis up the hill and down the valley under the alpine sun. <br /> <br /> The story is light as powdery snow with the boy from a small town of Redford, David Chappellet (what kind of name is that?) Who, with his eyes on the prize of Olympic glory, raises the nose, without a particular order, of his coach, father and teammates. Women are a simple side-show in her island world, as evidenced by a rather unpleasant shooting scene with an old girlfriend in her hometown and then her selfishly petulant search for, sky above, an independent and free woman, played by Camilla Sparv. The ski sequences are perfect with some good stunts that involve numerous bumps and scratches on the track, but their effectiveness is attenuated by our subsequent familiarity with the television coverage of the skiing events to the present day. I'm also not convinced that the Winter Olympics have the same mass identification with the general public as the summer games, so when Redford eventually wins his gold medal in the final roll, I couldn't really be so excited for him in a way or another. <br /> <br /> Of the actors, Redford, the best forward profile, does not need to do much and indeed not, while Gene Hackman does better with equally gaunt material. Ms. Sparv does well as the main female interest that treats Redford in the way she has undoubtedly treated every other woman in her chauvinistic way. In reality, however, there is a lack of dramatic tension so the action sequences don't completely compensate and you don't care about a fig for any of the main characters. One of those films in which the actors probably had more fun doing it than the audience watched it.
