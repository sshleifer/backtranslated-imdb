My parents used to rent a lot of horror movies when I was a child. We enjoyed watching them even when they were bad, they had a little fun. This was one of those films, a bit difficult to review since I only saw it once as a child, but it's not something I want to track down, so I can do a more in-depth review. The story has some old legend of the dying horror actor. I seem to remember that he acted a bit like Vincent Price, without being nice or classy. He commits murders and dies, but what is this? Is the film already finished? No, as some children for some reason grab the body and are ready for a fun night of being killed by the ham over the grave. I remember that the murders were nothing so special after the first couple and I remember that this film was rather disappointing. He seemed to have a good premise, but he failed to deliver the goods because more interesting killings were needed and that super horror actor needed to add some to his repertoire.
