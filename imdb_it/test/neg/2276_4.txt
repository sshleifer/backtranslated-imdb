This four-hour miniseries production is about two hours longer than necessary, mainly because the directors did not seem to have a clear idea of ​​how to adapt a novel to the screen. They didn't seem to know what to keep and what they could safely leave out. The film opens with Sir Walter's reading from the Peerage book, which is his main comfort in his problems. This introduces the family - which we all know intimately in the next four hours - but serves little else. Similarly, the scenes in which the Musgroves complain about "poor Richard" have no purpose except to drag the story down. Some of Austen's current dialogues are assigned to different characters and some of his stories are recycled as dialogues that fall awkwardly from the languages ​​of the characters. There is also a fill-in dialogue, and this is uniformly terrible. The scene where Charles Hayter is boring Henrietta with his worries about getting Dr. Shirley's curacy was just barely interesting as a narrative in the book; as a scene in this production, it is exultant The scene on the Cobb, when Louisa falls and is "dried up", is completely without urgency, and I wondered if Wentworth's phrase "There is no one to help me?" it may have been directed at writers, as well as other actors. <br /> <br /> This production often appears as a theatrical work that has been filmed, rather than a real film, and this is more evident in the acting, which is the opposite of the subtle: the boom of the lines , exaggerated gestures and actors who have no idea what to do with their hands, feet or faces when they do not speak their lines. Charles Musgrove is in his living room, with his legs wide behind him, and seems to be projecting on the balcony (if there is one) when he talks to the other people in the room with him. Louisa Musgrove's face, when not actively chuckling or giggling, seems to be in a confused rest. Louisa is a dazed, giggling and flirtatious creature, and for a moment I didn't believe Wentworth would be interested in her. <br /> <br /> The costumes are a mixed group, but mostly horrible, and the green tartan dress by Anne Elliot is probably the most alleged period costume ever imagined. We are given dates at the beginning of the show - it's the end of the 1790s or maybe the beginning of the 1800s - yet many of the costumes seem to be Victorian designs, and so about 60 years too soon! The hair is so wrong that I won't even talk about it here. Apart from saying that I won't say it. :-) <br /> <br /> This production does some things well. Mrs. Smith is given due importance, and her story with Mr. Elliot, her dissipation and intrigues, are completely addressed. I was also happy to see the "reconciliation" scenes with Anne and Frederick at the end, which are a valuable reward for the reader but were overlooked in the 1995 production. <br /> <br /> If you love the book Persuasion, and even vaguely like the 1995 film, don't waste a moment (or a penny) on this production; you will find it terribly lacking.
