This was only the second version of the classic Charles Dickens story I had seen, and unfortunately it turned out to be one of the worst. The film opens with a quick live song in which Simon Callow as Charles Dickens begins the story of A Christmas Carol, and therefore obviously goes to the animated story itself. You probably already know, Ebenezer Scrooge is the evil cold-blooded businessman who refuses charity and hates Christmas. He is visited by Jacob Marley (Nicolas Cage) who warns him of the visits of the other three ghosts of Christmas Past (Jane Horrocks), Present (Sir Michael Gambon) and the silent Future / Yet To Come. After all this obviously realizes the true magic of Christmas and promises to be kinder in the future. The only changes I noticed in the story were Scrooge who had mice as friends (a stupid idea), the ex-lover Belle of Scrooge (Kate Winslet) who needed to see him help in the orphanage, the Phantom of the Christmas gift which showed the two children "wants" and "ignorance", Scrooge is persecuted again after becoming cute, and is worried that he cannot keep his promise to remain kind. Also starring Rhys Ifans as Bob Cratchit, Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Cratchit, Iain Jones as Scrooge's nephew Fred and Colin McFarlane as Fezziwig. The animation is not of great quality, the actors have wasted their voices for a useless piece of garbage. The only good thing that comes from this film is the beautiful voice of Kate Winslet, who sings the final song "What If", as for the rest, it's terribly terrible. Very poor!
