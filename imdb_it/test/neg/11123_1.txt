Chupacabra: Dark Waters must be considered one of the most silly and never seen films. I expected at least some passable entertainment because John Rhys Davies was involved, and after seeing this film, I can honestly say that I lowered my opinion of Mr. Davies substantially. <br /> <br /> Why? The acting is incredibly poor. An excellent actor like Davies should have asked more from the cast and director. It was painfully obvious that Mr. Davies was just looking at his watch and hoping the check hadn't bounced. To say that it has just been presented would be an understatement. But at least he showed up. The rest of the cast seem to have sent it from their respective jobs to the various restaurants in Los Angeles where they work as waiters. It's about a cast of strangers! This is the kind of cast that never appears in movies again. They act as if they were audited while waiting at the unemployment office. <br /> <br /> And the special effects? Store bought firecrackers, polystyrene, a cheap rubber suit and CGI effects that seem to come from my 1980 Atari Game. I saw some horrible special effects used in the Sci-Fi Channel movies, but this stuff looked like it was cut and made kindergarten by someone's son. I expected Mr. Crabs and Sponge-Bob to show up at the end to fight the Chupacabra. Not to mention the fact that all the stories of the creature describe him as a small gremlin creature. It would have been a good movie for a character similar to the Leprechauns. Instead, we get a gigantic gigantic creature that is shown walking with accelerated stop-action effects that are laughable. The chupacabra is in one place and then moves at super speed down the hall and it's worth a few laughs just to see it.
