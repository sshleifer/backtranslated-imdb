This film was different from most of the Jimmy Cangey films of the 1930s as it was NOT made by Warner Brothers / First National, but was loaned to a smaller studio. Since it was a "poverty" study, production values ​​are lower than what you might be used to seeing with Cagney's films. Moreover, the plot is certainly one of the strangest I've seen. Instead of being a gangster, he was a good guy in this: fighting for the law. This is not so unusual because Cagney often played lawmen - as a leader of the OSS (CIA ancestor) of the FBI agent. BUT, to make him a Bureau of Weights and Measures investigator it was really weird - especially because he sometimes behaved pretty much the same way in the G-MEN movie! <br /> <br /> All in all, a passer by and that's it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the videotape I saw on Memory Lane Video was perhaps one of the poorest I've ever met. The sound was terrible and scratchy and the print looked very white and had many torn films and gaps.
