Story of an ex-Navy Seal who is now a combat medical officer assigned to a state-of-the-art Russian submarine with a nurse. This is to respond to a request for help initiated by a dying member of the original crew. The submarine was overtaken by terrorists determined to destroy. So let's see the duo try and get control back. And this happens with the fear of US naval forces about to unleash everything it has on the terrorist submarine to prevent it from launching its arsenal. Pay attention to the early explicit sexual scene in the first quarter of the film. A couple of inexplicable scenes towards the end. Watch it when you have time. Nothing to lose even if you let the show run while you go to get yourself a cup of coffee: slow movement.
