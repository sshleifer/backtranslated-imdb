Paul Muni and Bette Davis are monstrously stained while the modest hacker studio Archie Mayo seems distracted and oblivious in this racial provocative film that derives its "bittersweet ending" by condoning segregationist attitudes. Heavy and poorly constructed, the film collapses under its own weight within the first fifteen minutes with an out-of-control classroom scene that never recovers from the moment Mr. Muni starts chewing the landscape near the courtyard that screams and howls away in an almost inconsistent way. <br /> <br /> Johnny Ramirez is a Mexican American on the other side of the tracks who through determination and determination reaches a law degree from a school in front of the store. In his first big case involving a car accident, he shows only ineptitude and is quickly made to look stupid by his well-educated opponents and an impatient judge who recommends being disbarred. Devastated by the setback an angry Johnny takes a job in a gambling venture in which he befriends the owner Charlie Roark (Eugene Palette) who likes his style. The owner interrupts him, but the problems arise with Mrs. Roark (Davis) who also wants a piece of Johnny. He kills Charlie, involves Johnny and slowly goes mad before being acquitted and free to be with a high Wasp company that coldly explains to him that they are "different, wild tribes" and that it will never work. When she runs away to escape her anger, she is hit and killed by a car. Ramirez sells the casino and returns to his poor neighborhood rationalizing that it is better to stay with his own. <br /> <br /> In addition to this shocking finale, Bordertown has a series of bad performances to compliment the overall ugliness of the story. As unheard of as his situation might be, Muni's Ramirez is so abrasive and arrogant that it becomes difficult to show compassion for such a bullish headache. Davis is no better as the less faithful wife that corresponds to the same adolescent emotions than Muni. Lady Macbeth's crazy scenes do not indicate that she was about to become the best film actress of her era. Margaret Lindsay as Muni's American Dream is cold, remote and flat. <br /> <br /> Bad as Bordertown is (and is a lot) remains an interesting indicator of acceptable times and attitudes. The rest is just a mixture of bad acting and an uninspired direction.
