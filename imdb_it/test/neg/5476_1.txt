This filmmaker wanted to make a film without having a story to tell, and so he did. A truly unbelievable mixture of unlikely / inexplicable coincidences and unidentifiable plot, all without character or clear motivation. <br /> <br /> We get snapshots of clich√©s instead of characters. One in particular is the tiny and minuscule crime boss, who projects an exaggerated "tough" character and casts a shadow of cartoonist intimidation over the real and tough guys who have been brought to work for her. Nothing very surprising in the film, except for one shot when the boys jump into the street and one of them carries a small suitcase (as in, the smallest of a complete set of American Tourister) in a bright blue sky, without explanation or apology . Otherwise it's standard visually - another exception is a compelling shot of a beautiful CT bridge.
