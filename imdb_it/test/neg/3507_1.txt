I agree with what many others have said about the superficial and offensive nature of the racism exam in this film. It baffles me that so many people seem to have been deceived by its pretentiousness. I want to comment on the character of Matt Dillon as an example of what is most irritating about this film. Here we have a man who - in contrast to the underlying message of the film that "we are all a SMALL racist" - effectively rapes a woman in public, cruelly humiliating her husband and deliberately spurring him on to make a move that, as he knows, will lead to his arrest or even death. He does all this after dragging the couple without any legal cause, but because, as we come to understand, they are black and wealthy and he is a wounded boy who is now the police and can therefore do what he wants. This behavior is not a little racist. This behavior is evil. It disturbs me that this extreme of racism is held in check by the behavior of another character - triggering its paranoid stereotypes about group violence - to show that everyone is a SMALL racist. Later, we are fed a spoonful of tripe on Dillon's poor old father and how black people took him to the poor house. Should this explain, or worse, excuse this behavior? And did Dillon's character intend to redeem himself by committing the absolutely unmotivated and incredible, ridiculously coincidental act of saving the woman who sexually assaulted the night before? Please. The fact that so many people seem to feel a certain self-complacency admiration for this film makes me feel sad for the superficiality of our understanding of racism and for our apparent lack of commitment to condemn and end it.
