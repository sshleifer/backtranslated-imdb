I fully agree with Greg in Ontario. I saw this movie today with a friend who later went to the theater director and said "This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen." I've seen a lot of movies with this person, and it's pretty forgiving, so I was shocked. (The manager gave him a free pass!) <br /> <br /> I was offended by much of the humor in the movie (yes, the baked potato scene was at the top of the list!). My friend and I are white and I saw the film with a predominantly black audience. For a while I thought, maybe I don't understand this movie because I'm white. Then I realized that nobody was laughing. The writing was bad; the direction was bad; the times were almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> There were some fun moments, there was only WAY too much time between them. Even Airplane Two was more fun than this, and this is saying a lot. <br /> <br /> I was so dazzled by Snoop Dogg in Starsky and Hutch (like Huggy Bear) that I felt confident in enjoying this movie. No .. DL Hughley was funny, as usual, but his role was rather small. Tom Arnold had some funny moments like "the white boy", but most of the other attempts at humor went far beyond the brand. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I was not able to assign a negative star rating to this film.
