Because a director with a resume like Wes Craven would like to give his name to a boring collection of clich√©s as if no one believed it. And if he cashed in on all this - all the 50 pounds judging by the look - he should have slammed the director's door for a refund when the movie was released. There are many "alien" scams and this is one of the worst. Even the reliable Lance Henriksen, with a character stupid enough to allow his children to roam around a dangerous government laboratory, cannot save him. As a cure for insomnia, this rate of 10+. As a quality film, forget it.
