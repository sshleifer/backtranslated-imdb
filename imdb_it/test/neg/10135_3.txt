I know it's impossible to keep all the details of a book in a movie. But this film has changed almost everything for no reason. Furthermore, many changes have made history illogical. Some examples: 1) in the film "Paul Renauld" really meets Poriot before he dies (in the book Poirot receives only one letter), telling him that he is afraid of being killed. This is completely stupid because if Renaulds' plan was successful, Poirot would have known that the dead would not be Renauld (Poirot was in the morgue when Mrs. Renauld identified the victim). 2) The film "combined" two people in one! "Cinderella" has been removed from the film. The girl Hastings falls in love with and Jack Renauld's ex-girlfriend is a person in the movie! Why for god's sake? 3) Hastings finds the victims because he is a bad golfer. Totally unsociable and stupid. 4) The film tells secrets too early (for example at the beginning). So you know things you shouldn't know. 5) The murderer is struck in the end by a person who does not exist in the book. Perhaps because the person ("Cinderella") who stops the killer does not exist in the film. 6) The book is very complex. The film only lasts about 90 minutes. Of course it is difficult to include all the necessary details, but it is impossible if you include stupid things that were not in the book and have no meaning (eg cycling race).
