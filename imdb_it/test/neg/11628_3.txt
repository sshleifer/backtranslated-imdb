Jack Higgins' direct thriller about an IRA bomber forced to fall into a "last job" (where I already heard that plot?) Is treated superficially by cult director Hodges. Mickey Rourke, with alarming red hair, confesses everything to the priest (Bob Hoskins, of all people) who casually witnessed the shooting. The church rules prevent Father Bob from speaking, but then Rourke goes and falls in love with the priest's blind niece. They bind to the church organ. What? Really, this is the plot. Alan Bates is around as the best dog gangster who is calling the shots (literally) and seems to be the only actor to whom Hodges' joking tone is pointing. Bates is ready to do a sort of HONOR of PRIZZI, but no one else, including a sympathetic charismatic Liam Neeson in a supporting role, was informed.
