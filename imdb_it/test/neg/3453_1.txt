Making a movie for less than 1 million could be a triumph for a line producer or accountant, but it does nothing for the public. The balance may have been nice but the viewing experience was poor. <br /> <br /> What will be a triumph for Irish cinema is when people realize that production values ​​and script cannot be sacrificed. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why people spend the energy needed to put together a movie when the quality of production is worse than a low-level television program. <br /> <br /> The shortcomings of the plot were mentioned in another review on this site and I totally agree with what was written. What I would like to add is that the film has touched the surface of many genres without ever settling on one of them. The film would have benefited both from the direction of a simple comedy or a political / social commentary. <br /> <br /> My overall impression was that the film was rushed, thematically developed and visually not up to standard. On a positive note the performance and the music were very good.
