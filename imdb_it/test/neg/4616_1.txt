I had never been released from a movie before. I talked to the idea a couple of times, but this time I did, I snuck in to see the end of another movie, but I had to come back and see the end of the anger while I waited for my friends. They told me that I didn't miss much while I was away, neither did I. I was generally offended by the whole film, in such a grand way that I can't even describe it. My instinct told me to get out of the theater. It was a visceral reaction to a horrible film. The plot focused on the cruel actions of some reprehensible adolescents against vulnerable and distressed others. There was no ray of light, no person responsible for providing contrast. I discovered that even the "good guys" in the film did nothing for me, they were foolish, stupid, whining, or just ineffective. <br /> <br /> Repetitive graphic suicide images were outdated, useless and disgusting. (Not in a way "I'm easily disgusted", but more in the portrait of contempt for humanity). And in addition to the repetition of that scene, in slow motion, from so many points of view, the other visual aspects, (interesting shooting work, etc.) They had potential, but sometimes they became annoying at times. I'm a person who loves movies and tries to find good things about them. I can usually find some good things to offset the non-good of any movie. I'm not saying this movie didn't do any good, but I'm saying that, whatever it was, I can't remember it with all the other crap that drove me crazy. I'm really sorry for that too. Perhaps the best parts were the clips of the classic original.
