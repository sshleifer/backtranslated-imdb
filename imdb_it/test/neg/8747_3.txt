Jessica is a young, virginal and very innocent girl who lives with her aunt on a remote ranch. Jessica is also a powerful medium, capable of dowsing, retro-cognition, precognition and esp. When the handsome young Gordon Hawthorne comes to visit, he is immediately skeptical of Jessica's powers ... until his abilities uncover a lost wristwatch and bring to light an ancient treasure chest. However, the chest holds the severed head of a secular satanist named Gideon Drew, whose powers are much stronger than Jessica's. Despite his warnings of evil in their midst, Drew mentally enslaves all the unfortunates to make eye contact with him. But Drew wants Jessica above all. He needs his dowsing skills to bring his body to light so he can rise from the dead and dominate the human race. Will Jessica's powerful fleur de lis, combined with Gordon's love, protect the ancient evil before it can destroy them all? <br /> <br /> This is not a very interesting film. It certainly could have been - the basic story is interesting and imaginative, but the acting is leaden and the whole thing moves too slowly to arouse interest. Jessica is too innocent, almost annoying, and Gordon, his love interest, is wooden, stiff and totally devoid of emotion. None of the characters is very nice, and the low budget is painfully obvious. Even a hasty ending doesn't help things. Avoid, unless it is the MST3K version.
