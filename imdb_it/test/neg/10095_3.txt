"In the sweltering summer of 1958, the Deuce, a band of hardliners from Brooklyn, find their territory threatened when the head of a rival band, the Vipers, is released from prison. driving his boys through bloody fights to keep the Vipers out, but when his brother (Brad Renfro) falls into a sultry and dangerous relationship with Annie (Fairuza Balk), a Viper's sister, and her own girl is brutally attacked , Leon and his gang fell into a total war to save his brother, his girlfriend and his neighborhood! "According to the description of the DVD cover. This is not "Basket Diaries". <br /> <br /> Think of "West Side Story" being hit in the head with baseball bats and steel tubes, while Stickball left Brooklyn with the Dodgers. "Deuces Wild" has some fantastic Hollywood sets, 1950s cars and soundtrack songs; and, in large part, is well photographed by John A. Alonzo. History and direction never go beyond these strengths, which allow the film to reach the peak during its opening minutes, and proceed downhill. The cast looks good when you read the credits, but it translates into an old, flabby mess of fake pompadour, blood and Brylcreem ?? and a fright wig. A sense of sadness and regret permeates production. <br /> <br /> *** Deuces Wild (5/3/02) Scott Kalvert ~ Stephen Dorff, Brad Renfro, Fairuza Balk, Frankie Muniz
