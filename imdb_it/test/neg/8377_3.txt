This film seemed funny on the cover and I honestly thought "how bad can it be?" I knew little about it. Outside the gates the dialogue was UNBEARABLE. It was invented, unrealistic and not even interesting. Dialogue on TV shows in UPN syndication is more natural. The story was implausible and eventually had almost zero play-offs. The end with the snake is almost confused and seems to be staged. The only remotely interesting character is that of Rose McGowen, who is dumb, which prevents her from ruining herself with clich√© junk dialogues (well, at least until the end, when she too needs to talk). The only thing that also gives this 3 on a 1 or 2 is the Rose McGowen scene. Really terrible. Save yourself the problem and rent something more interesting like a Barney video.
