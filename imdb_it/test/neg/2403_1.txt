The Russians have never launched toys for children full of explosives on Afghanistan, something that has never happened !!! Who invented it ?? Hollywood plays the Russian army as terrible, terrible troop of evil! That's disgusting !! The president of the United States, Jimmy Carter, had admitted that "Soviet aggression" could not be seen as an isolated event of limited geographical importance, but had to be challenged as a potential threat to the Persian Gulf region. The uncertain scope of Moscow's ultimate goal in its sudden dip to the south has made US participation in an independent Pakistan even more important. A large amount of damage has been inflicted on the population of civil children by land mines.
