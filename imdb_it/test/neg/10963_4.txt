Finally, Quick and the Undead is the first film to actually empty its plot. In essence, it is a gigantic plot hole. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the acting was pretty bad, the character's motives non-existent or unbelievable and there wasn't a single character worth wearing. The most interesting cast member (who had great potential to be a protagonist of a dark horse) died in the middle of the proceedings. <br /> <br /> What Quick and the Undead do is an excellent example of how to behave well color-syncing. It sounded excellent when you were considering budget considerations. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, you play as a guy got his hands on a hundred bucks and watched some westerns (especially The Good, The Bad and The Ugly) and then he threw a few elements randomly in a movie ... "you know, they have movies where the characters do THIS! Does it fit in here? No, but who cares! They do it in other movies so I should do it here!" <br /> <br /> Perhaps a good vision for the flourishing filmmakers and colorists (first-year film students). Otherwise, absolutely not to be missed.
