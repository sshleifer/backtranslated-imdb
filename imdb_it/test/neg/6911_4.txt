There seems to be a sub-genre of cheap and tired old-sex comedies, which say the same old things as middle-class couples. A bit like friends, but with more soft porn and without spirit. This film is no exception - he had such familiar situations that I died from deja vu. Did people sit on sofas, turning the clich√©s about sex and relationships? Check. Monogamy against deception with some woman / man who would never actually look twice at some other woman / man? Check. PORN I BADDIES !!!! 111? Check. Any guy / girl in it that seems to be the only reason you're looking at this garbage? Check. The lesson seems to be - when one doubts, to make a tired and old-sex "comedy" on people to whom nobody cares, to make a statement that everyone has already heard three thousand times before. This will make your movie run. It will also attract some sitcoms with no bad wigs!
