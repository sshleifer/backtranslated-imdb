The TV announcer who presented this late on Saturday said he should win an Oscar. A statement for a film I had never heard of ... although I should have noticed something about a television announcer, I don't know. In the event, said announcer was talking about tripe. <br /> <br /> It is a sad and miserable film that leaves a bad taste in the mouth. I couldn't get on with Hoskins' horrible Burr-ming rubber accent. I don't see any advantage in the fact that it's set in the Midlands anyway. <br /> <br /> Unresolved threads abound ... and I usually don't care about this, but half of it doesn't make sense. And when Hoskins says he'll take Felicia from outside his B & B even though he never told him where he stopped ??? Or she who buys in the funeral that clearly never took place (and where was she during those days ???) Clumbsy and bad thoughts through business if you ask me. <br /> <br /> It's a thriller with no emotions. It's full of pretentious business. It's depressing ... <br /> <br /> I didn't like it. I thought it was rubbish. I would not recommend it. Nuff said.
