For years I hesitated to watch this movie. Now, I know why. It was even worse than I expected. Ashton Kutcher makes the worst movie mistake of his career, from 'Dude, Where's My Car?' Tara Reid plays Ashton's dream girl, who asks him to babysit her father's (and her boss's) owl for the weekend. The rules: 1. No shoes at home. 2. No people at home. 3. The chief's son remains out of the house. 4. Do not touch the furniture. <br /> <br /> Well, you can guess at the end of the first twenty minutes, like the rest of the movie will be. <br /> <br /> You know, there are movies like "Meet The Parents", where bad things happen to someone, but it's fun to watch, and it's delivered in a way, that you can't wait to see what happens after. This is not one of those movies. You know from the beginning that bad things are going to happen, and they're mostly stupid things that never really will happen. It's an extremely frustrating movie to watch, and there were about three times when I almost turned it off, because it was so ugly. But, I paid the rent, and I thought I should watch it now. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid was good, and I'd like to see her in other films. However, it doesn't surprise me that this helped hurt his career. <br /> <br /> The end result is a happy ending ... but of course with the kind of movie that it is, you wouldn't expect anything short. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it You will regret it sincerely!
