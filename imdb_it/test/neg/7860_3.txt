While there is much to recommend about Maetel Legend both in the concept and in the finished product, it is ultimately a poor film. Tracing wise is a retelling of Maetel's first life, which is usually unclear; at the same time the writers take the opportunity to tell the story of the car empire. And since Leiji Matsumoto has trouble not including his other jobs, we have a starting point for Emeraldas his sister, his mother: the Queen of La Metalle and a bit of Galaxy Express 999 to give the film a shape. <br /> <br /> In short, Maetel is a princess on the planet La Metalle, a planet with an irregular orbit, which means that her cycle around the nearest sun is reaching a cold and artificial stage. The sun is dying. The planet becomes increasingly cold throughout history, thus increasing the sense of ruin. To protect her subjects and her family, the Queen decides that mechanization is the only way to guarantee the survival of the population of La Metalle. Enter Lord Hardgear, a robot / cyborg who provides the means for work. Through the film, the characters are left to question mechanization, will they still be human? Can you trust Hardgear? Do souls and hearts remain? So, for a fan of Matsumoto's work, there is a lot to enjoy, questions to answer, themes to continue, except it's obvious that the film is meant to be a presentation, as well as a fan curiosity. The negatives, primarily the animation, while Galaxy Express 999, a TV series of over 20 years ago has a poor mouth animation and sometimes a sketchy character design, Maetel Legend has all the worst traits of modern animation and gains so an air of respectability to the Galaxy Express 999. The design is very detailed but unfortunately the animation suffered leaving well-designed characters that "slip", as in the backgrounds move or in the camera zooma, a quick way to animate. However, few, yes, some well-animated scenes are reused several times in dream sequences, repetition and extra scenes. Anyone who looks like the movie will wonder how many times Lord Hardgear can drink the same glass of wine. <br /> <br /> Ahead of the story, While in the concept everything looks great, the finished product is actually a series of plot conversations that is repeated ad infinitum, the number of times the characters encounter the same problems and learns the same things is practically offensive to the public and to the characters, who are apparently much more articulated in previous incarnations. Add to all this a terrible design of characters, who seem lifeless, exaggerated, and the public stays with a film, so I will miss it could be rewritten as a different film, at least the newcomers would not have been perplexed. <br /> <br /> Still, he really has his moments, at least the ending is surprising. The situation of the citizens of La Metalle was rather worrying and rightly disturbing; I imagine I find that whole distressing man-machine theme. It is difficult to know who to recommend Maetel Legend, since it is not well animated, written or executed, as well as confusing once introduced the mandatory cross-reference of Leiji Matsumoto. However I can't help but rejoice when the magnificent entrance of Three-Nine occurs, now it's good cinema. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars out of 5, 2 if you're a fan.
