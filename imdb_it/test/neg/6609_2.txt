the film is simply horrible (2/10). Even if the actors are doing their best (well, sometimes they are not many) the special effects are ... let me tell you so it would be better if there were none. <br /> <br /> The script is based on Sapkowski's prose, so it should be the biggest advantage of this movie. Unfortunately it is the opposite. Nothing remains of the original atmosphere. And it's all very chaotic. Maybe they only had too much material to show in 2 hours. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you would like to see this movie I would recommend you to look for the TV series (same title, same actors, even the plot remains the same) that was done at the same time it was shot the film. It's much better (9/10) and the story actually makes sense :)
