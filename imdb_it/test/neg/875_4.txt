I had high hopes for this film, even though I had not read the book. Richard Gere and Diane Lane together - they should already be good. But the film does not keep its promise. I kept waiting for more depth for the characters and it wasn't there. I have no problem with the fact that it only took a weekend to fall in love. This can happen. But we never really met the characters. I would have liked to focus more on them. The film reminded me of Bridges of Madison County, and that film was far better. I really felt for the characters in that movie, and there was a chemistry (much more passion) between Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep that wasn't between Gere and Lane. Each of them is a very good actor in his right. Simply not the right movie for them together.
