There is a reason to call it a teen movie. On 100 possible points I would put it somewhere in boys. It is predictable, the acting is horrible, especially the minor roles, and above all it is super predictable. The ending is so resounding that I should have left early and maybe it would have passed. By the way, could you call the male a pervert? I bet if it really happened, someone in my school district would have said it. In the end, in the school where I grew up, even though the middle class had over 1000 students, we could have chosen a jerk like Josie as a scam and we would have spotted her out of the crowd. My last word is to save your time, when it comes to TV watch something better, like stock market prices.
