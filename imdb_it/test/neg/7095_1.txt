This movie takes away all the gangster / gangster movies ever made. MP From Last Don has a reference for each film. Acting was by far the worst I've ever seen. Who the hell is John Mario anyway? His acting was by far the worst I've ever seen. Makes you look bad bad actors. As for Master P, it is selling faster than an N * sync concert. I really want to be there to tell the whole production company: WHAT ARE YOU THINKING WHEN YOU PEN THE SCRIPT? "Obviously these people are so fixated on the image of the gangster who decided to make a movie and live their lives as gangsters for real In their mind, one thing I know is that there was no one who wanted to distribute this film, It seems (and how predictable) that the NO LIMIT guys should start, NO LIMIT FILMS This movie is terrible and doesn't deserve to be called a movie!
