I'm a big fan of horror movies, especially the subgenres of the 80s. Name one ?? I probably saw it. Last year, a new little horror film that seemed to slip under the mainstream radar called "Saw" was about to go out in theaters. I was moderately excited. Having heard nothing about it, I thought it would be very promising to judge by the previews and posters (well, except the back ones and the white ones with the severed hands and feet ... those just looked terrible!) I saw the movie in the evening of opening . It was one of the worst experiences of my life. This film was literally and psychologically painful to watch. Why was it scary? ... NO! Because it was one of the most terrible films I've ever had the regret of seeing! First of all, the construction of the script and the editing was completely atrocious, even by horror film standards. Start a sequence in an interrogation room with a victim (Shawnee Smith) who recently survived a serial killer attack, showing a flashback of what survived? NOT SCARY! It was impossible to try any kind of tension, EVERYWHERE, knowing that the victim above was perfectly all right. Sure, that reverse trap thing was creepy ... but BECAUSE I should feel the least bit frightened when CLEARLY, you just showed me that it survived the trial? Unfortunately, the whole movie was built this way. Start with two guys in a cellar. Then, they show the flashbacks of how they were kidnapped ... DO NOT FEAR! Why? Because we already know what will happen to him, given how we have APPROVED the result of the attack. THEY ARE FINE! Get on with the story! Even more unfortunately, the true story was at the most skinny. I couldn't care less about these annoying, pitiful excuses for "characters" and acting didn't help me. Cary Elwes was solid for the most part and then suddenly towards the end he started crying like a lost child as he struggled to keep his American accent in tact (it didn't work ?? the audience I saw this with was in points) . This prompted him to a rash and idiotic decision even if the simplest one would not have attempted. He had other options. Best Smarter. Even given his intense emotional state (horribly communicated through horrible acting), he was still irrational. I didn't buy it BAD WRITING NOTICE! Furthermore, even when some sequences were reproduced directly and without flashbacks, they were painfully predictable. I constantly found my foot touching impatiently waiting for the stupid sequence to end. This happened for the whole movie. I saw every single "twist" coming. Twenty minutes into the movie, I had already called the killer identity, not to mention his connection to his "accomplice (s)" as PRESENT as they appeared on the screen. A better acting could have overshadowed the terrible script. Instead, the actors could also have "RED-HERRING" or "ACCOMPLICE" tattooed on their foreheads. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, I was completely indignant that I had even wasted a piece of my life on this film, and the whole theater was laughing hysterically at the really horrendous ending. Seriously, you'd think they were watching a Monty Python movie. I would have laughed too, had I not been so irritated by the total and utter failure of the film to make ANY thing he intended to do. When we left, there was (no joke) a line to talk to the theater manager to get their money back (it didn't happen). I was absolutely positive that the film would be a box office bomb. The following week, you could not have imagined my shock to discover that "Saw" had reached the top spot at the box office and EVERYONE was talking about this (mostly people who found "Napoleon Dynamite" an epic tale that stimulates reflection and the thought "satire" was a type of rubber). I'm so disgusted to hear people praise this movie that I often feel like I'm about to throw up. It is entertainment for the weakest and simplest of the human race. Those who find a strange Jigsaw clown puppet on a menacing tricycle (it's a doll ???????????????). <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I own every "Friday the 13th", I love my splatter movies, the thought of "Napoleon Dynamite" was exhilarating, I can't get enough of Freddy, Michael, Pinhead or Leatherface, I have an appreciation of fonts for unknown horror gems and I classify "Sleepaway Camp" II: Unhappy Champions "among my top 10 favorite sleds. However, I realize that these films are not the most sophisticated American cinema to offer? I appreciate them for what they are ?? easy and fast fun. "Saw" is cinematic rubbish. The film tries to be an intelligent and semi-sophisticated, unpleasant thrill ride, and bogs down in an annoying, annoying waste of time, money, energy and celluloid. Atrocious on all accounts. Every single copy should be incinerated, along with its weak fans. Shame on all of you. <br /> <br /> Will I see "Saw II"? Perhaps after making a double injection of Liquid Drano, before tearing my ste ssi eyes and impaled white shish-kabob skewers in the ears and colon. My vote: 0/10. Avoid at all costs.
