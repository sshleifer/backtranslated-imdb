Why do those "romantic" films that never go anywhere, always start (and probably end) with disgusting jazz? It's not smart and it makes it look like a damn TV movie. This film was mushy, slow, boring, not original, made of wood and I said boring? <br /> <br /> Harrison Ford was probably trying to be mysterious and crude, but he was just a creepy, muttering cop who seemed to be entering the house of the congress woman as if all was well, when he was acting like a pervert Thomas with a perverse look, almost without bothering to talk. <br /> <br /> And why the hell do they always get British actors to wear with crappy accents - they are chosen because they are famous, and everyone knows they are British because they are famous!
