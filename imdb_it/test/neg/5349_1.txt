Regardless of the fact that the predominant social message of this film - that vigilante justice is acceptable - is justifiable, I was more offended by McConaughey's concluding statement. In a classroom drama, the concluding statement of the defense attorney is pretty much the crux of the film, and when the problem is as difficult to resolve as this, the statement is delivered to the public and the jury. This basically implies that the public considers the rape of a white girl a more horrible crime than the rape of a black girl. I for one find this very offensive. As for the rest, I found the acting reasonable, with the exception of Sandra Bullock, who seems to play her usual bubbly self (it doesn't really work in a courtroom drama), but where is the point of the movie's message it's poor like this. He tells you that vigilante justice is fine and accuses you of racism if you disagree.
