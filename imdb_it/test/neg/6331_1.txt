The Girl of the sleeping car or Terror Express! as it was called on the version I saw, it starts when several passengers board a long-distance train. Three stupid idiots, Dave, Phil & Ernie (Carlo De Mejo), and it is clear that they are there to cause problems while verbally intimidating and mistreating other passengers and staff. As the train accelerates along the way it gets mean when a prostitute named Juliette (Silvia Dionisio) refuses to have sex with Dave, he and his companions decide to hold the whole train hostage so they can have an orgy with Juliette and , well, not much else happens apart from a hero cop and his prisoner who decided to save the day. Erm, it really is ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was directed by Ferdinando Baldi and is complete and complete from crap from start to finish. George Eastman's screenplay as Luigi Montefiori could easily be described as a really boring film as much as a horror / thriller. It's boringly slow, it's 35 minutes before something even remotely bleak happens and overall the film lacks the kind of exploitative elements that Italian sleaze and horror were offering at the time. The film can be compared to another Italian production, the infinitely better The House on the Edge of the Park (1980) made the same year, is a very broad comparison, however, like everything that made The House on the Edge by Park the infamous movie that is absent from The Girl of the Wagon Bed, there is no blood, no blood, almost no violence, there are only a couple of really tamed rapes, the story has no twists and because it is incredibly boring from to watch. Italian sleaze and horror in the late 70s and early 80s are not known for strong story lines or exceptional scripts, but this film scrapes the bottom of the barrel on all fronts. The characters are horrible, the film spends the first 30 minutes more and explains why they are on the train, but all this is quickly forgotten and absolutely nothing comes. I also hated the lame ending and I don't know if I missed something, but was there any reasonable explanation as to why these three lamebrains would hijack a train? I don't think there was, was there? I'm sorry but because your anger for a prostitute is not a sufficient reason, surely the filmmakers may have come up with something a little more substantial and interesting if not more plausible. I think this movie stinks, it's as simple and straightforward as the one I'm afraid of. <br /> <br /> The director Baldi does a good job, to be honest he only has a corridor and some compartments to work with so I cut him some time, having said that the film becomes very repetitive. There is no style and he films the sex scenes as a naughty soft porn core complete with romantic and terrible sounding piano music. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE DROP OF BLOOD EMPTY IN THE WHOLE FILM, it is not a single drop. Forget any gore or violence, otherwise you will be disappointed if you do, as I did. There are a couple of rapes but they are set in an amateur way and have a zero impact, the unpleasant exploitation and the sleaze of saying I Spit on Your Grave (1978) or The last house on the left (1972) are not here. <br /> <br /> Technically The Girl of the Sleeping Car is OK and is quite well done on what must have been a low budget but the setting obviously helped to minimize costs. The acting is poor as usual, even though the original performances have been lost since it was nicknamed. Fans of Italian horror will recognize many of the voices here. <br /> <br /> The Wagon Girl Bed is a terrible film, it's just my opinion but I was bored by the tears that were waiting for something to happen and when in the end I never felt cheated, I want back those 80 minutes of my life. This piece of shit can't even beautify the VHS 99p business basket in the local Blockbuster, one to avoid.
