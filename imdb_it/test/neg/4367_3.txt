It would be wrong and reprehensible on my part to advise you to look at Killjoy 2, you have to have better things to do, wash the car, throw stones in a stream, but at the same time it is nowhere near as terrible as you probably think it is. It's almost a suitable film, which can handle much more than most straight-to-DVD sludge. Killjoy 2 was helped a lot by the maniacal turn of Trent Haaga as the homonymous clown, he throws himself into the role with such a feverish abandonment that he almost points the balance in favor of the film, but, obviously, it takes more than a man in shoes great. Tammi Sutton gives the funniest director cameo ever since Roger Corman in Creature from the Haunted Sea and the whole thing is almost destroyed by the hasty and sugary ending. The whole place is almost fun.
