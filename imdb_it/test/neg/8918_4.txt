I just saw today that you die. It's ugly, almost very ugly. <br /> <br /> 1) Direction and assembly are horrible, simply horrible. Almost made me close the film, Fauntleroy (the director) has no idea what he's doing, it seems he's shooting things at random and some scenes don't make any sense. Also, I hate it when the same scene is used again in the same movie, in this movie some scenes have been used 3 or 4 times. Pretty bad. <br /> <br /> 2) Dialogue is sometimes good, sometimes terrible. I like the fact that they wanted to make the character of Seagal and the character of Treach seem like they were in a similar relationship to the characters of Lethal Weapon, but it didn't work simply because some of the dialogues DON'T SENSE, and I speak English very well, not is that I did not understand the words, it was the fact that the lines and lines of dialogue had no meaning. <br /> <br /> 3) The script is pretty bad. Why are they always trying to complicate DTV action movies? Seagal's wife in the film has psychic abilities, why? Is it useful for the film? NO. Seagal eliminates a lot of people who work for the boy who betrayed him and knows these people without ever having met them in the film. STUPID. The story sometimes goes astray and the jump back without any reason. History is sometimes messy and useless. They should have kept it simple and it would have worked. <br /> <br /> 4) In some action scenes it is not Seagal, it is its stand-in. It can be said why they film him from behind and never show his face. He also beats boys with the martial arts of cinema, not the real ones like the aikido that Steven knows. The stand-in uses kicks and punches in style. <br /> <br /> 5) Steven is good at the film. 90-95% of the lines are said with their true voice. The rest is dubbing, but it's not so bad. This was good. Even Steven seems to have fun in the film and is more involved in the action that he has been in Submerged. He likes Treach as a partner; at least he doesn't seem to despise him. Furthermore, he seems to have been in better shape than in some of his recent films. I hate the fact that he wears clothes to hide his body, but in the same clothes he wears on the DVD cover it looks more than OK and he should have worn those clothes for most of the film, not the stupid long leather coat. br /> <br /> I really think that Seagal was willing to make a good movie. The fact that he arrived late and left early from the set of "DUE FILM" directed by Fauntleroy does not seem like a coincidence. I think he realized that the crew was an amateur or just for a quick penny and he didn't care anymore. <br /> <br /> In the hands of a better company and crew, it would have been a damn good action movie for Seagal. Something like Out for Justice or Above the Law. I honestly believe it. But the people who made the film aren't very good at their job or don't have enough money to do the job properly. Too bad because I liked Steven in the film and Treach was cool (Ice Cool), but the rest was bad. Hey, at least that gives me hope for Black Dawn and Shadows of the past. I think Mercenary could be just as badly managed. But hey, Steven seemed to be back in the same mood he was in while making his best films and at least THIS is reason enough to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked it, but it could have been so much better. 4/10
