Too bad that Mike Meyers chose this for his dramatic debut. It seems that this film was created by a committee that could not decide whether it was a comedy, a drama, a suspense or a science fiction. It starts in a playful way, then it gets darker, and eventually, apparently after one of the main characters was killed, the whole family is standing in the back yard laughing at something. It is totally strange and impossible to tighten together. The acting is extremely uneven, with the older professionals attracting your attention, and then the younger and less experienced actors seem as if they were in a school play. This film has shown me that it is probably more difficult to make a good film than it seems from the really professional price that we see in the houses of first vision and in those of art. This would be a good movie for a film class to analyze. Plot, character, theme, consistency - they are all defective or missing from this film.
