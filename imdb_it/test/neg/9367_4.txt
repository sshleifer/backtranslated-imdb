I awarded this 4-star presentation. I'm all for the script, which was slaughtered beyond recognition in some places. What can you say? They took one of the most beautiful dramas written in the last century and methodically robbed him of his heart, humor and humanity. I don't really blame the actors, who are probably doing their best with a poor direction and incomplete characters (because the complete characters of the theatrical version have had their inside - and their intuitions - torn). I blame the director a lot, who seems to get tired of finding ways to undermine the script. There are so many awkward pauses, awkwardly reinterpreted moments and embarrassed and re-imagined line readings in this TV movie that I sometimes forgot to love the game. I'm not one of these people who thinks that the genial works are automatically inferior to the film (on the contrary), but this particular genius has been tremendously underestimated by this release. Now I hope they will make a real * movie of this comedy. The world deserves it.
