I discovered that this is a watchable and predictable film. There have been some good feats that have given a good degree of excitement and suspense to the story. However, credulity had to be suspended on several occasions for the plot to work. For example, despite having lost the transfer cable, joints and harness when the pilot manually retracted the cart, they fortunately found a complete plane with the Caribbean aboard. According to the plot, piercing a hole in the vault ceiling would have disabled the alarm system in the vault when the system was reactivated (I can't think why), according to Daltry the cordless drill would not be able to pierce the ceiling vault however it was just verified to have a hydraulic drill complete with pipes and fittings to adapt to the equally convenient take-off points in the hydraulic system of the floors located above the vault. Since the aircraft has a closed hydraulic system, it is difficult to see how this can be achieved without affecting the control systems or at least by setting hydraulic pressure alarms in the cockpit. By accepting this for the plot it takes a few minutes to pierce a small hole through the top of the vault (the tension will be able to pierce before the FED arrives there to check the false alarm), however from the moment the vault brings it it closed and, before the FED had taken a few steps to the second security door, they had cut a hole in the roof of the vault big enough to pass. You can accept all the theses and other inconsistencies for a good yarn, however what ruined the film was when what seems to have been an effort by the writers to disregard that until then it was a fairly predictable ending, killed the two heroes (If one can refer to cocks as heroes) Ketchum and Brooks one was shot and thrown from a 747 to 10,000 feet the other more slippery along the cable between the two floors the evil Daltry with one hand manages to unhook the cable who carried the weight of an adult man with the air pressure of several hundred miles an hour pressing on him, letting him fall at his death. Yet in the following sequence these two without any kind of explanation (however tenuous or implausible) miraculously survived by 10,000 feet at most and had time to prepare an elaborate scam to get the money. The only comment on that survival was for Sophie that her brother is a bad blow. Don't expect an Oscar nomination for this.
