It has been said that some directors make small-budget photos like blockbusters. Albert Pyun makes sure that low-budget photos look like high-school A / V project films. This film was practically devoid of all departments. Virtually every scene drags excessively, "experimental" lighting and camera work are terrible, Rob Lowe seems to be tantalizing with acting, and the poor Euro-pop numbers stop the film in a halt. On the plus side, Burt Reynolds does a good job with what he gave (which is not much), Mario Van Peebles is surprisingly decent and Ice-T puts in a long recent series of B-movie gangsters. The worst work of Pyun (Urban Menace), but certainly not the best (Mean Guns).
