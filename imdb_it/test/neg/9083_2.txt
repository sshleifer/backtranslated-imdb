Once again, Bronson's talent is mostly wasted on this shocking 1984 thriller that (uncut) is much more disturbing than most of what is out today. The fact that "The evil that men do" is very disturbing (in his verbal and visual depictions of torture) is not the problem. It is the blatant gratuitousness in which it is presented. Interestingly, this film seems to symbolize that last part of Bronson's career in which he tortured many of his fans with the same highly predictable and non-creative storylines. Hopefully this good actor can be resurrected.
