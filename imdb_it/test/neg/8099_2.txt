First - nick-623, Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941, not in 1942. They did not have to foresee the attack. <br /> <br /> Second - did anyone notice these six industrialists / lawyers / whatever was missing for a rather long amount of time? They were killed * before * the surgery took place! Third: how the hell did you get Lugosi out of taxis without being seen? Fourth - why didn't the Japanese just kill him, instead of putting him in prison with a comfortable similarity companion and his surgical kit? Fifth - oh, what's the use? This movie has some interesting moments in it, but when they explain what's going on, you probably have stopped watching. Otherwise, you won't be interested.
