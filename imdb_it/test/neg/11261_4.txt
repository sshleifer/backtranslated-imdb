I read all of Dave Robicheaux's novels and consider James Lee Burke my favorite contemporary fiction writer. I also visited New Iberia and much of Acadiana to better visualize the setting in most of these books. Needless to say, I expected a lot to see "In the Electric Mist", especially since I thought Tommy Lee Jones would be great as Robicheaux. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed. The story was very discontinuous; the interaction with the "ghosts of the Confederate dead" was superficial and lost the impact and nobility that it added to the book; and Tommy Lee Jones was sad, expressionless and hard to understand as a DR. The best way to describe this forgettable film is to add my "idem" to a previous user comment that this film was like one of those old movies made for TV. I expected Jill St. John or Cameron Mitchell to show up at any time. <br /> <br /> The position settings were accurate, and the photograph sometimes captured the essence of smoky, smoked and smoked rushes, and the grim land graves of southern Louisiana. Too bad the bumpy presentation of the story and the sub-par performance of Tommy Lee interfered with the unique mood and spiciness of the region. <br /> <br /> Next to the final comment: in the novels, the nickname of Dave Robicheaux is "Streak". because of the distinct strip of silver-gray hair on one side of his head. (Similar to what the sopranos Paulie Walnuts would look like if they were only seen in profile.) Tommy Lee didn't have such a vein in this film, probably because the editors are fans of James Lee Burke and they airbrushed the plot after seeing Mr. Jones poor imitation of Dave Robicheaux. <br /> <br /> Final comment: While I generally find that Alec Baldwin is pompous and hateful in most roles, he was by far a better Robicheaux in "Heaven's Prisoners" by Tommy Lee in "In the Electric Mist." In addition, Heaven's Prisoners is much more interesting and exciting, with uniformly credible performances and a more evocative atmosphere than this new film. <br /> <br /> "In the Electric Mist" is ok to watch when you feel "veging out" and there's nothing better on TV. But then, so are the infomercials.
