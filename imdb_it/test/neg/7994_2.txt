Franco Nero plays Cole a ninja who comes to the aid of his war friend Frank Landers (Alex Courtney) and his wife (Susan George) to protect them from a gangster (Christopher George) who wants the land. Things get even more complicated when the mafia takes on Cole's old nemesis (Sho Kosugi) who is also a ninja. The inept martial arts activist, despite having better production values ​​than most ninja films, fails to inject any life in the surroundings, or as far as actions are concerned. A little effort all around.
