I thought the movie was under par. The acting was good but not exceptional, the story was fun but it didn't come out that way. The director dropped the ball in this film. It was not James (jim) or Tea. IMHO was the music that killed him. There's a scene where things go down the hill and Jonny Cash's music is playing - the man was that depressing (not funny) he killed my mood. After the film could not recover. The deportation scene had a potentially funny situation, good acting and good staging - I even smirked, but the music again wasn't suited to the scene. Music prevented me from being attracted to the film. <br /> <br /> I say he has potential but was hurt, I would say that I rushed into the final production. Remember the exquist's prequel: the beginning. The exit of the theater was good, even if so after having seen it, but the exorcist of the film: the domain was much better. The same story is just a different director. The same should be done here.
