This was one of the most elaborate, boring and clich√© movies I've ever seen ... and, yes, I saw Pearl Harbor. Even the likes of Gina McKee couldn't make their way out of the scary dialogue. It has been described as "art-house", this can only be a euphemism for boring, terrible and, frankly, without art. Why when a film has no story, do critics think it deserves to be called art? But much more disconcerting, why did America love it? Without you, this film would have remained on the shelf where, perhaps, it belonged.
