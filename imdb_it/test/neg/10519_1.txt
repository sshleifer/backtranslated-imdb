What can you say about a cross-dressing gangster movie? Not much. With independent filmmaking, this film has all the wrong times. The change is simply horrible. As for the gangster story, he could have been pulled out if the gangsters didn't lack the character. Everyone seemed to be there for some sort of ending. None of which was fun. The usual suspects in this film are the prostitute with a heart of gold, the dying father of the mafia who wants his son to make his business legitimate, the best friend with "crazy" jokes. But the main character, the gangster who loves to dress like a girl. Only his motivation to dress like a girl is that he was robbed by a woman? Strange. The film's ending had to be the nail in the coffin. It was anti-climatic to say the least. I mean, I understand how indie filmmakers don't have the equipment for their own shooting, but they could also use water guns. In general, I would say that the hype that preceded it (before the red carpet in Vancouver) was a disappointment.
