After reading the reviews, I am so relieved to know that I am not the only person who was very disappointed in this movie! I'm a HUGE fan of Nicholas Sparks, I've read ALL his books, most of them more than once. Obviously I LOVED the notebook and A Walk to Remember ... I haven't seen Message in a Bottle or Nights in Rodanthe yet so I can't comment on those ... <br /> <br /> But I did go see Caro John last weekend and I was terribly upset! The film was not good at all! When he watched the film alone, and he didn't think at all about the book, it was still a terrible movie. I did not have the haste and the range of emotions of this film that I had from other films that I liked, especially The Notebook. I wasn't smiling and laughing and crying, worried and scared ... never! From the beginning all I could notice is how they changed everything! The only thing about this movie that is similar to the book is that there is a boy named John who is in the army and a girl named Savannah who is not ... the part of his father obsessed with coins is the only other part that went along with the book. Everything else was completely turned off !!!! First of all, in the book, Allen was Tim's little brother, NOT his son! WHY they had to change it, I don't understand. It makes a lot more sense as it went into the book when Tim was just a little older than Savannah and they grew up together and Allen was Savannah's inspiration for wanting to work with autistic horses and children .... it didn't happen in the movie. .. ugh ... And in the book they spent much more time together than just in those first 2 weeks and then in 1 night ... why did they leave those times out ??? I could go on forever but then I would run out of space! So basically, if you're a big Nicholas Sparks fan, don't waste your time and money on this movie ... read the book again ... because it's awful and nothing like the book!
