A largely forgettable tale in which the mercenary Kerman and the employer Agren travel in the jungle in search of Agren's missing sister. <br /> <br /> Despite its connection with the cannibal family, this film is more than an extreme version of Rene Cardona "Guyana - The crime of the century". Lenzi clearly aims to exploit the (at that time) Jonestown massacre, describing a braggart, a genuine zealot with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania (played with merciless intensity by Ivan Rassimov) who leads his heterogeneous crew. oblivion infected. With her sister on tip, Kerman and Agren try to stop the rot, but after several failed shots, they end up escaping into the "Green Hell", only to clash with the locals and their notorious appetites. <br /> <br /> One in a series of excessive gore celebrations that emerged in the late seventies / early eighties, where each new addition seemed to engage in a one-upmanship contest with its predecessor, trying to devise the most bloody and graphic display ever brought into motion. This lower bet uses all the motives and gimmicks of others, but with much less success. <br /> <br /> These were the so-called "Amazonian natives" who seemed to be Bollywood waste (this film was shot on location in Sri Lanka), or the inept "beheading" and "castration" scenes that have seriously diminished the authenticity that was evident in "Cannibal Holocaust"? You can decide. Without ruining the conclusion, it seemed that Lenzi had given more emphasis to his shock and his orgasm than the fundamental requirement for a cohesive ending, in which all the free parts were resolved. Most unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> As for the others, where the extension of the graphic representations of violence towards humans is limited (thankfully), the directors have not spared the extreme in inflicting the worst possible cruelty on unlucky animals in their search for the most sadistic shocks. Unfortunately, the only shocking thing about this film is that there is talk of mention among others of the genre, which treat the subject more convincingly. <br /> <br /> If there are some redeemable features, Kerman is an affable if a somewhat one-dimensional man, and his group of skilfully dressed co-stars (Agren, Lai and Senator) provide a little of visual respite from the implacable killings.
