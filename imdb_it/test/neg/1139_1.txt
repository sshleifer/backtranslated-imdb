Absolutely the worst experience I've ever experienced. I think my eyes started to bleed. Actually I got sick at night after seeing this. I don't even consider it a movie. Movies should be useful and fun. This fails horribly. I couldn't get past the entire movie, so because the ending could be the biggest phenomenon in the history of cinema, this is a 1 for that small possibility. Otherwise it would be a flat 0. <br /> <br /> I don't see how National Lampoon, or much less any organization, would sponsor this atrocity. Hiring this DVD is currently one of the worst mistakes of my life. Look at this only if you want to make any other movie you've ever seen look fantastic. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt this is the worst movie I've ever seen.
