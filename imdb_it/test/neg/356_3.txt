Clifton Webb is one of my favorites. However, Mister Scoutmaster is not one of his best. His role as a patented curator seems forced and even unpleasant rather than amusing. The film itself is overflowing with mushy sentimentality. Furthermore, the viewer is presented with numerous references to religious faith and American patriotism, which are too reverent and not genuine. Clifton Webb does his best with a poor script. Edmund Gwenn still plays another jovial clergyman and has nothing to do. The main role of childhood is played by a child without talent who shows a flat effect during the whole movie. His only claim to fame as an artist is evidently a low voice like an unusual bullfrog for someone his age. However, once you heard it, you felt it and you don't need to hear it again. Unfortunately, it's in most of the movie's scenes. I find that this child is so irritating that I face forward whenever it occurs. Since he has a lot of scenes in this film, this means that I advance fast in most of the film. There were and there are so many talented child actors; it is a pity that this film contains none. However, Clifton Webb in the traditional wide-brimmed hat and shorts is a sight to behold.
