I am very interested in animal children and have read many novels by Edger Rice Burroughs - but this horrible film could not interest me, nor could I bear all the absurd and unrealistic scenes. I managed to sit alone through the African part and John's early days in Scotland. Let's talk about "unrealistic" and "absolutely silly"! The actors in monkey suits looked like extra large chimpanzees rather than great apes (there is a difference). They did not move with the grace that a wild animal would do. (For comparison, look at some of the best films of Planet of the Apes where they trained their actors to move in a similar way). The monkeys eat large thighs of meat - not a common common monkey as far as I know. I'm a fool for animal stories but the script didn't make me worry about monkeys. The great white hunters of the expedition that John Clayton finds are entirely charicatura. Clayton's parents are shipwrecked on an ocean beach, but somehow it's a long journey down the river to reach the coast - give me a break! Let's talk about 'slow'. Even people who think this is an excellent movie admit it's not an action movie. Away from it. Try to be a character study - unfortunately the decidedly silly part predominates! I haven't read Burroughs' Tarzan books, but many of his other series - they were full of meaningful action and heroic purpose! This film is not there.
