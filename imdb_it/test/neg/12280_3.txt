The action film essentially without plot has two good guys (Fong and Roundtree) fighting with two bad guys (Mitchell and Pierce). Fong is perhaps the most exhilarating protagonist of the action of the 80s, the small part of Roundtree is far from his "Shaft" days, and Cameron Mitchell adds another shameful role to his career, one to sit right next to his laughable turn in "The Toolbox" Homicides "(this man was a respected actor once, now he came down to wear flowers in his hair and complains about people bleeding on his carpet.) Only Stack Pierce acts with a certain dignity. As for violence, don't worry: most of it is too bad to offend anyone. (* 1/2)
