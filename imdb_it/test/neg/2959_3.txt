Based on the true story of two young Americans who sold national secrets to the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War, "Falcon and The Snowman" wants to be both suspenseful and philosophical at the same time, and ends up not being equal to the two departments. It is less the Carré than who cares. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton plays Christopher Boyce, a former seminarian who, disgusted by Watergate and the middle-class values ​​around him, is probably the wrong guy to hire a company that runs spy satellites for the CIA. Sean Penn plays his fellow addict, Daulton Lee, who becomes Boyce's courier, delivering secret documents to the Soviet embassy in Mexico City. An unusual synth-jazz, lack of sympathy or emotional attachment to anyone, and many scenes of kids getting angry in the rooms combine to cushion what could be a good moral-dilemma thriller. <br /> <br /> It's really The Penn movie despite the second billing; his character comes to talk about turkey with the Russians while Hutton plays with his domestic hawk. It seems that Hutton woke him up five minutes before they called "action". With Penn, it's a crapshoot if you get a brilliant or exaggerated performance. Here, it's a bit of both, but more of the latter, especially in the second part when Lee switches from coca to heroin. He screams. He snorts. Arrest the Russian embassy parties. He is punched with telephone directories. He spits in a mirror, a big goober who should have saved for a paparazzo. "I don't know who my friends are anymore!" he shouts. It is exhausting just looking at it. <br /> <br /> Penn seems to have modeled Lee somehow on Dustin Hoffman's Ratso Rizzo from "Midnight Cowboy", complete with overly nasal line readings and constant shifting of the eyes. John Schlesinger directed this film in addition to "Midnight Cowboy", but he seems to have had another Hoffman film in mind, "The Graduate", pulling up scene after scene of Boyce and Lee by the pool, trying to decide how to live their own screw in their golden cage. Too bad nobody suggested the plastic. <br /> <br /> From the opening photos, the news of the American decline juxtaposed with Boyce and his bird, "Falcon" makes it clear that it is a message film, even if the message itself is far from clear, probably because the characters are never brought into focus. Should Boyce be an idealist? Or is he just a mercenary? Hutton and Schlesinger don't seem to know, which makes it more difficult for us. Meanwhile, opportunities to establish some suspense, such as Boyce stealing documents from the "Black Vault" secret where he works or Lee playing with the Russians, are interrupted by jumps to the couple's scenes with their families and friends. It is the normality of the story that Schlesinger finds interesting, but it is the least interesting aspect for us. <br /> <br /> Good stuff: it's interesting to see a film that works with the vibrations of the 70s so early as this one, referring to Maria Muldaur and Tang. Dorian Harewood, memorable in "Full Metal Jacket", has a nice twist as Boyce's paranoid colleague, Gene, who shows Boyce how to make margaritas with a shredder, but has some serious Nam problems under his party facade. Macon McCalman also looks good in a totally different way than the no-frills boss who gives Boyce his high-security job. David Suchet, the official of the Russian embassy dealing with Lee, represents a fascinating mixture of threat and amiability. <br /> <br /> But "Falcon and The Snowman" stands or falls on the question of the two characters in the title, and neither the actors nor Schlesinger are able to extract much in terms of answers. Worse still, after more than two hours in their alternately feral and catatonic company, you don't really want answers. You just want those credits to continue.
