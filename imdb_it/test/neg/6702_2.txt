I suppose the heart of the filmmakers was in the right place but, frankly, this film is really inconceivable. I was offended by the tone and the end of the policewoman. You can't take such light problems! Without knowing the last warning of the movie ... let's look at a guy who shoots down his 9 months pregnant wife and two children and we should follow him for the next 2 hours while trying to establish a new life ?? You can't have sympathy for a character who does this. He can not! Not to mention, nothing is given to us until the last half hour of this film unnecessarily long, why this guy is suffering so much. No flashbacks, no sudden reaction to noise or movement - stuff that real vets suffer from. All we know is that she has a strange wife and cannot take care of her and her 3 children financially. There does not appear to be any research on what current Iraqi veterans are going through. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the film suffers tremendously from a heavy hand and a totally inappropriate score. It's a catastrophe. It is really harmful for some to act really well on the part of the male protagonist and, sometimes, Joe Morton. It provides EVERYTHING what you should hear, and sometimes gives you the wrong clues at all! Once again, this was a brutal thing that this guy did, and then seeing him get a new job, meeting a new blonde, fighting behind the counter making the toast is NOT appropriate! And really, the ending? What a peek out! How dare you. <br /> <br /> There are much richer films that deal with the effects of war on returning soldiers, please don't worry about that.
