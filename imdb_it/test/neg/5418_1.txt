One of the worst movies I saw in the 90s. I would often use it as a reference point when I watch other films; "At least it wasn't as bad as Dear Diary." Three absolutely useless segments, all with the director playing himself - and not so interesting. A whole segment of this hypochondriac that goes to the doctor. Another that characterizes him riding in the countryside on his scooter. For three interesting minutes and fifteen more tortures. <br /> <br /> The only saving factor was the fact that the scooter scene was set to "Koln Concert" by Keith Jarrett. He asked me to go home and rediscover that wonderful album. The best thing you can say about the director / actor / egotist is that he has a great taste for music.
