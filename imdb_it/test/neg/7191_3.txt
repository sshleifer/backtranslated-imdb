When you read the commentary on this film, which is an intelligent and entertaining political comedy based on real events, the only real word is that it is a comedy. If they told you that it is a privileged film about Russian politics - it is not. There is probably only 2% in the film from what actually happened in Russia during that election campaign. Actually in 1996 it was a thousand times more interesting to follow the situation and that was a real funky election campaign. Well, there were US public relations officers working on Yeltsin's staff, but their role was minimal. The entire campaign was totally different from the one shown in the film, it would be much more fun to show all the members of the president who travel across the country cardboard boxes full of money, and the celebrities who give the shows to support Yeltsin everywhere - unless it would be true La do tre only for the respect of Jeff Goldblum, Antony LaPagglia and Liev Schreiber. And on machine guns on the streets of Moscow. I lived in the place that had the highest amount of crimes in Russia in the mid-1990s and I never saw a man with a gun in the street.
