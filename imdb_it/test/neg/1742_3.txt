I thought it was weird and just bloody, not scary. I saw a couple of Japanese horror films, Ringu and Juon, and I loved them; but this film was a disappointment. He never even explained anything about the curse. I didn't see any horror ... it wasn't scary for me at all. All the time I was watching, I was waiting for Kirie to discover the secret of the curse and why it was happening now. If this was an ancient curse, why didn't it happen before Shuichi's father? And he never told us what happened to his father. I kept waiting for someone to tell us the meaning or reasoning behind this curse and then it's just finished. I was very disappointed.
