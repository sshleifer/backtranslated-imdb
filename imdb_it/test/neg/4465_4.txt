Title: Dracula AD 1972 <br /> <br /> Director: Alan Gibson <br /> <br /> Cast: Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Stephanie Beacham <br /> <br /> Review: Sometimes movies can be time capsules that bring you back at a given time. In this case ... our time capsule is Hammers Dracula AD 1972 which brings us back to a time when Austin Powers would have felt at home. <br /> <br /> The story is about this group of children (they were not a band! It was a group!) who loves going out in a coffee shop called "The Cavern". One day, Johnny Alucard (hmm strange surname ... wait ... spells Dracula backwards!) A new member of the group offers the group a new way of making balls. It offers them a night of black mass and black magic. To which they also say "sure why the hell no, it could be fun!" Then, in an instant, the findings are resurrected by Count Dracula from the ashes. <br /> <br /> This film opens with a swinging party in some rich doofus at home. He knows no people at his party, yet all of them are celebrating the night at his house. Do drugs, take out and dance on the tables. The filmmakers made sure that this sequence was completely swallowed up by the young people considered cold at that time. They all say words like "way out" and "groovy" and end many of their sentences by saying "all that jazz". So yes, it's pretty obvious that it's from the 70s. To top it off, there is a band that sounds like "Jefferson Airplane" ... I mean you will be drowned in all the things of the 70s. And while I was watching him, I kept asking myself "how the hell is Dracula with his black coat and getting up going to adapt to all this?" And that's exactly what happens. Old Dracula feels out of place among all the parties and rock and roll and drugs. Many of the scenes in the film are great ... but unfortunately the music they have decided to add to the process does not fit at all and takes you completely out of the mood. Something terrifying or scary will happen on the screen and suddenly a bunch of noisy trumpets and congeals will begin to beat and your just out of the horror element. This sucked the atmosphere out of this movie for me. <br /> <br /> But all in all, putting aside all the distracted 70s music (a disease that Satanic Rites of Dracula also suffered) the film was pretty good. But I will mention it. The story was just a remake of what we had seen before in Taste the Blood of Dracula. In reality the story is damn close to it. Let's see ... a young boy inherits Dracula's ring and ashes ... check. He decides to bring Dracula back to life with the help of some people who know nothing about what they are doing ... check. Black mass to bring Dracula back to a desecrated church ... check. The list of similarities goes on indefinitely. So this movie is not very original if you ask me. <br /> <br /> There are some things that make this movie useful anyway. For example, the fact that the film is a time capsule in London in the early seventies makes the film fun. I kept giggling and laughing every time someone spoke in 70 jargon. I couldn't believe some of the clothes these people wore and the cars they drove! It made the movie fun for me, but we're here to scare you, we're here to see Drac kill some virgins and take revenge on the Van Helsing House. Did we get one? Well yes. There are some good sequences strung there to satisfy the fans of old school hammers. First of all, there is the sequence of the Black Mass that was above all satanic! They quote the name of many demons and a lot of blood is shed. That sequence was fantastic but it was messed up by the music in its most crucial moment. Then there is the true resurrection of Dracula who admits it was great from a visual point of view. A little mist comes out of Dracula's grave and slowly, but surely Christopher Lees, the outline and the face emerge from the fog. Nice shot! I loved it! In the end we make it with Cushing and Lee. And I couldn't help laughing at one point when Dracula threw a piece of furniture into the air. I laugh because he did it in every single movie from the horror of Dracula. It is the tradition of Hammer in which the characters begin to throw candelabra and chairs at each other. And I think to myself, it's not their most exciting things to show to a bad guy who throws a candlestick at our hero. Oh well, whatever, the death of Dracula in this is very similar to all the other Hammer Dracula before this, the vampire gets slapped and then cuts himself into a series of frames until only the ash remains. <br /> <br /> All in all, a film by Hammer Dracula unintentionally funny. He is trapped in the 70s and although this makes him a fun watch (and it's not as horrible as Satanic Rites of Dracula) it still doesn't fit the Dracula universe we expected from Hammer. <br /> <br /> Evaluation 3 1/2 on 5
