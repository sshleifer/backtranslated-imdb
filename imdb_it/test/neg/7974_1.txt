The first question is: how many idiots without talent are needed to ruin a movie? Answer: one is more than enough, if he writes the script and directs it. The second question is: has anyone taught the actors to handle the guns correctly? Answer: hell no. I wonder if Kristy Swanson was hit in the face with hot brass - because damn it looked like that! The third question is: how many times have we made the plot of "conspiracy of a super secret government agency is discovered from within"? Answer: a good pair too! The fourth question is: are Michael Madsen and Ron Perlman overrated? Answer: in this film, unfortunately, yes. The fifth question is: can a pair of tits save this movie? Answer: even three (the couple from Kristy Swanson and the director / screenwriter) no. <br /> <br /> God ... If I see that the killer (most likely) is preparing his weapons for success, and then the morons of the props department give it a completely different set, the first thing bloody in that damn movie, the "suck" meter hits the climax. Time from the beginning of the film for me to turn off the TV: fifteen minutes. Just a little more than what he took in the case of "Alone in the Dark".
