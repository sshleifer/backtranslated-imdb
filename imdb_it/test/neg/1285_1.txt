What a waste of precious time! My 5-year-old daughter brought this house from my mother's house and we saw it as a family. None of us liked it. This miserable film, full of conspicuous inconsistencies, Christian themes and horrible cinematographic qualities, is not even worth watching. It seemed like a bad attempt at a high school theater class to make films. How sad to see talented actors (Chris Atkins, Gary Busey and company) make their way through this trivial and insipid plot. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the dog is cute. The film should have gone straight to the pound. Avoid this movie - your time is better spent looking at the dried paint.
