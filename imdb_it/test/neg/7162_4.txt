This is a nice conceptual piece and Brando's acting is a nice piece of work. Dean Martin is not bad and Montgomery Clift is pretty good. Unfortunately, it's a very long and very long piece that should have been mounted on something closer to 2 hours (it's almost 3 hours). <br /> <br /> We follow the lives of 3 men from 1938 until the end of the Second World War and watch as they discover who they are and what they could become when they discover both the world around them and what they are made of. For some, it is women in their lives who realize this realization, for others it is the more general general circumstances. Too often though, I found myself asking what had just happened or what was the import of a certain scene.
