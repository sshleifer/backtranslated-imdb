The outdoor yarn by director Lesley Selander "The Yellow Tomahawk" (1954) puts Cheyenne against US cavalry with the tough Rory Calhoun in the middle while the experienced Indian scout wearing a buckskin must lead survivors to salvation. This United Artists western was in color, but the television press broadcast by Turner Classic Movies was inexplicably black and white. <br /> <br /> The action opens with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun of "Black Spurs") who eludes several Indians and ride with his old friend and Cheyenne leader, Fire Knife (Lee Van Cleef of "The good, the bad and the bad "), which he killed in his mind. Fire Knife warns Adam that his Cheyenne warriors are ready to wipe out a nearby cavalry fort because it violates a treaty that Indians have entered into with the government. On his way to inform the captain of the blocked camp, Major Ives (Warner Anderson of "Objective, Burma!"), On the impending Indian attack, Adam discovers a beautiful wood nymph that seduces water in a lake seductively. Katherine 'Kate' Bolden (Peggy Castle of "I, Jury") is another one of those silly Western women who wash themselves naked in the middle of the Indian country without any care in the world. The castle seems to be really naked in its bathing scenes, perhaps the most memorable scene of all in this otherwise predictable western. Of course, Major Ives rejects Adam's warning from Fire Knife until the commander realizes that someone broke into his ammunition dump far outside the fort. This is one of the many questions that the screenplay by Richard Alan Simmons leaves unanswered in this 82-minute oasis. Why would the cavalry bury their ammunition in a secret place in the desert instead of keeping it in the fort's premises? As soon as they made this discovery with respect to the Indian attacks, they throw out the hero and leave him as the only survivor. Before this attack, a pair of white diggers ride into the fort. Sawyer (Peter Graves of "Stalag 17") carries an arrow in his chest in his companion. While Adam is taking hot water to help remove the arrow, the greedy Sawyer grinds the tree deeper and kills his helpless partner. Later, we learn that Sawyer and his companion had reached gold. The issue of gold leakage remained unanswered after our heroes survived the test. Adam and Fire Knife have one last pow-wow and Fire Knife asks Adam to deliver the Major Ives or everyone will die. Of course, Adam refuses and the Indians begin to carve whites. James Best in a supporting role as a knight gets an arrow in the back for his efforts. Noah Beery, Jr., plays a sought after Mexican explorer chased by a sexy Indian damsel appropriately named Honey Bear (Oscar-winning actress Rita Moreno of "West Side Story") and Robert Bray of "Lassie" fame is available for a short term as the sick cavalry officer that Kate had planned to marry. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise in this insignificant Western on-site strike in Kanab, Utah, is that the evil cavalry officer Ives, who massacred Indian men, women and children in the infamous Sand Creek massacre, he kept a secret that he too is a native American! Ironically, the bow that Fire Knife befriends Adam in the beginning of hostilities is what our heroic explorer uses to kill the Cheyenne warrior, the fort, after he runs out of bullets. "The Yellow Tomahawk" ends with an ambiguous note. The survivors reach another outpost, Fort Ellis, where Adam and Ives give their respective reports on the matter to an army general, but we never learn the outcome of this meeting. It is this artistic ambiguity or yet another unanswered question. Producer Howard W. Koch has no relationship with "Casablanca" screenwriter Howard Koch. Ultimately, "The Yellow Tomahawk" is one of many pro-Indian westerns that appeared in the aftermath of "Broken Arrow" (1950) in which the native American is considered a noble savage unjustly treated by some but not all whites. Selander, who made dozens of westerns during the 1950s and 1960s, makes this minor western tolerable despite his thin characters and difficult situation. Calhoun stands out from an above-average cast as the ever-useful leader man, and the good-looking castle is worth looking out for its feminine charm. Peter Graves plays a skunk as he used to do in most of his early roles. In fact, Lesley Selander made a more satisfying dramatic version of this film the year before called "War Paint" (1953) with Robert Stack. Incidentally, Noah Beery Jr. and Rita Moreno both continued to attend "The Rockford Files".
