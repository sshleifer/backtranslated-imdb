Roy Rogers (in the role of Roy) and partner Raymond Hatton (in the role of Rusty) join Teddy Roosevelt's "Rough Riders". Soon they are suspended to "round up" the murderer of companion Eddie Acuff (like Tommy) along the Mexican United States. border; they discover gruesome gold runners in the process. Notice how, even suspended, Mr. Rogers is able to let the Rough Riders participate in his Round-up! <br /> <br /> This is not one of Roy Rogers' best westerns. The fighting scenes look like choreographed dances. Rogers sings / yodels "Ridin 'Down the Trail", one of two relatively ordinary songs; and, a highlight, on the whole. <br /> <br /> ** Round Up Rough Riders (3/13/39) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, Raymond Hatton, Lynne Roberts
