Apparently, a massive head injury is the cure for homicidal tendencies, turning a sociopathic killer into an adorable and stupid hunter of dogs. Also (this for women), it seems that the main gate of a psychiatric hospital is a neglected hot spot to meet potential mates. These are just two of the 23 or so absurdities we should accept for this film to have meaning. I love movies and I believed, as I suppose many Americans do (forgive me if I'm wrong), that Hollywood has become the best product. I came to learn how sad and naive I was and I was brainwashed 2) how much European / Asian cinema is more sophisticated than its American counterpart. <br /> <br /> I saw this psychological "thriller" night after watching a Japanese movie called Suicide Club. As the camera vanished in the happy little family of Walter Sparrow who enjoyed a little time around a table from visit to prison (not to mention the paternalistic voice that extolled the virtue of "doing the right thing"), I suddenly had an enlightenment. I had just finished watching a movie that made me feel like I had just had a glass of water when I really wanted a beer. My thirst was satisfied, but it was strictly utilitarian. The premise was slightly interesting, but the story itself, with its innumerable "coincidences" (how do we explain it in finding the book? We will simply say something like "... Or did the book find it?" I'll buy it), holes in it Wide-open storyline (why wifey took the skeleton?), predictability and the obligatory happy ending, turned out to be just another Hollywood hack job. Also, the casting of Jim Carrey was simply wrong. At any time, I felt I was able to get into some shtick from one of his stupid comedies or In Living Color. Is Jim Carrey a hard-boiled tattooed police detective who enjoys bondage and rough sex? I didn't buy it for a second. <br /> <br /> Do you want to disturb? Deeply disturbing? Look at the Suicide Club. History surrounds the mysterious mass suicide of 54 school girls. The film opens with a group of licentious high school students who meditate on a subway platform. Then we watch in horror as they align, hold hands and happily throw themselves at a fast-moving commuter train. Needless to say, much chaos ensues. This is how I intend to go with the plot because I encourage the reader to watch the film. In fact, I'm not sure if I could outline the plot even if I wanted to. What begins as a simple mystery quickly descends into a madhouse of grotesque images. Did I understand the movie? No, not initially like many of the foreign films that my girlfriend presented to me. So, of course, I thought it was "bad". But this stopped in my mind. I went to bed to think about the movie and woke up the next morning and searched on IMDb. I read some of the comments from the viewers and I was surprised by 1) the insights that others had taken from the film and 2) the fact that I missed the whole point of the film so much. I realized that I was so used to being fed by spoonfuls of the "message" of Hollywood, that when I confronted myself with a film that actually required the viewer to actually participate in thinking for himself, I was absolutely not able to do it . It is as if I had been conditioned to "control the brain at the door" of the theater. Am I saying that Suicide Club is the biggest movie ever made? Obviously not. It has its flaws, many of which have been skilfully reported by IMDb reviewers. Am I saying that all American films are bad and all foreign films are good? Again ?? obviously not. My point is that there is a whole world of cinema outside of Hollywood, a body of work that involves the viewer; it forces them to think and question films that do not telegraph plot twists, follow a linear sequence and, above all, do not insult the intelligence of the person who looks. I look forward to expanding my mind as I explore this new world of cinema that doesn't "think for me".
