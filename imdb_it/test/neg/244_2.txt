Following the pleasantly atmospheric original and the fun and silly second, this incredibly boring, slow and eventless sequel appears as a great disappointment. Once again the evil criminal genius of the Pipistrello (his friend Luis Aceves Castaneda) is trying to steal precious jewels from the Aztec Popoca mummy. The Bat builds a heavily clumsy and heavy robot with a human brain to achieve this odious goal. Directly directed by Rafael Portillo, with a spoken and boring script by Alfredo Salazar and Guillermo Calderon, cruddy continuity (for example, the Bat was clearly killed at the end of the previous film, but he is miraculously alive and well!), An atrocious script way slow, an excessive amount of archive material from the first two films, a meandering narrative, a paralyzing lack of action and momentum, largely sad during the motions (not) recitation by an understandably disinterested cast, and a misplaced climate battle staged between the mummy and the robot (the film finally breaks out to break the stupid life with that big shot, but alas it hardly lasts two bad minutes and therefore proves too little too late to alleviate the gravity of the overwhelming general boredom), this unbearably dry, unpleasant and unpleasant nightly earnings rate like a complete washout.
