Apart from some good moments of pretty raw violence, this painful movie is more noticeable for making 68 minutes seem like two hours. <br /> <br /> It begins with an interminably long introduction in which the Leeds family is introduced, including two unbearable tykes and their adult brother and sister, completely cliche Pa and Ma and an incredibly annoying grandfather (played by Charles) Chic "Sales). While sitting at the table, the family is disturbed by the sound of gunshots and rushes to the window in time to see two men killed by mobsters in the street. The mobsters flee through the family home, leaving them witnesses to the crime. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is composed by Walter Huston as the DA crusade who occasionally interrupts long anti-crime speeches to make attempts at the heart trying to protect the family from the crowd. Everything runs in a predictable way. <br /> <br /> The positive points of the film include a couple of decent shootings and a really terrible beating, Nat Pendleton as one of the mobsters and the splendid Sue Blane in a small role as daughter of Leeds. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Huston recite his first jurist crusade, try "Beast of the City" from 1932. Avoid this if possible.
