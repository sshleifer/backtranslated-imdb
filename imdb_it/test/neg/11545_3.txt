One of the problems of popular culture, especially when discussing popular culture in the 1970s, is that mass media, especially television, is usually about four years behind the "underground" media, mainly music. Many people think that the "Woodstock Generation" remained important throughout the 1970s, in reality it was all at Altamont in 1970. In 1972, "underground" rock or the "counterculture" had moved eastward to England and Led Zepplin, Black Sabbath, and David Bowie, the first metal-heads and so-called 'glam-rockers', which were all 'peace and love' - not. Neither of them, in a dark vein, was Charles Manson's "family". <br /> <br /> This obvious pilot for a TV show (which fortunately was never picked up by the networks) is trying to come to terms with a culture that was already as withered as yesterday's flowers. Within a few years - when it was produced, the writer Carlino had already won awards for the harsh tales of mafia revenge and the cultural references are all to "Easy Rider" and Woodstock (1969). actually before, 1966/67 - Woodstock Hendrix, Canned Heat and Sly and the Family Stone had blown up this kind of pop-pop. <br /> <br /> The film is about a bourgeois family that goes on the road to meet the hippies. Wow, friend, farout, outasight, it's a bizarre event on a stock market. However, politics counts for nothing - Vietnam ? a place in Asia, right? <br /> <br /> This medium TV movie (which means stale and empty) is redeemed only by Jeff Bridges' astonishingly mature performance as the young university drop-out that convinces his parents and grandmother to "discover" (hippie ) America. All the rest of the performances are a regular TV series of standard television actors of the time. The director makes use of some beautiful cinematography of locations, but otherwise the film is a poor way to spend 90 minutes. I knew it was all over when Sal Mineo talks about a young escape (which tells the other characters that they are not really there): "He is a latent existentialist". Wow, far away, fantastic. <br /> <br /> A couple more points to be "so bad is fun", but if you don't care about the 70s TV version of the 60s, stay away.
