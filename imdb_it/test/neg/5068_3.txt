Just like Tinto Brass ("Caligula"), the people who made this film cannot tell the difference between explicitness and eroticism. No accumulation, just throw naked women on the screen; no, it doesn't work that way. If the close-ups of female genitalia are not your thing, prepare to look away from the screen in many places (I did it often). The "all women are whores" mentalities in the film are offensive, and the "story" is sometimes absurd and boring (escape is the most boring part!). But halfway there is a random scene that emerges from nowhere and involves one of the prisoners (female) and one of the (male) guards in a naked wrestling match, who wins with a couple of judo moves. Although the choreography of the fight is bad, the whole scene is undeniably memorable. In fact, that scene and beautiful cinematography are the only two reasons why I give this movie * out of 4, instead of 0.
