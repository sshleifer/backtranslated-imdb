I tried to give this show a chance, but it's not really good for me. Although the performance is good, writing is not. The two older brothers, Derek and Casey, are equally annoying; I have the impression that we should take sides with Casey, since she is the protagonist, but I don't find her at all nice. Parents are continually portrayed as absolutely insensitive. The three youngest children are the most watchable things on the show; Lizzie and Edwin are sweet the way they team up, and Marti is adorable. The lines of the plot are a bit far-fetched and the whole premise is mostly difficult to digest - mixed families are common, yes, but this family is not really trying to mix. Overall, I think it's gradual.
