I saw this movie right in the middle as it was breaking. It was around 3 am and I was fighting insomnia with a quick snack. It wasn't so bad at the time, but every time I tried to watch it since then, I can't go in it like I did that night. <br /> <br /> At the time I thought it was nice and I loved the variety of characters, even if they could have done better than Goran V, in my opinion. But the only thing that kept an eye on me was the character of Heather and her sad "commitment" to her husband who didn't want her anymore, which made me feel sorry for her and at the same time do the cheer for her. (Considering that I was in a similar situation at the moment, maybe that's why I liked it so much.) It's not a bad movie, but you have to be close to the character in a romantic way to appreciate it, and we hope you never are.
