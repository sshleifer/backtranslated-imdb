I was attracted by the premise that the show was about demons. From hell. And a door to hell. What I didn't realize was that I was watching some guys running in tunnels chased by small children who might not be demons for the whole movie. Certainly there was a dialogue in the middle, and a great underground scenario, but the lack of a plot, of developed characters, of possible plots or developments in history was seriously lacking. Oh, and for interest, there were no special effects. The entire budget was spent on the salaries of the actors, sets and a lot of time with an underground camera. <br /> <br /> The ending was one of the typical boring and boring endings that makes you say "I put up with this boring movie for that !?" If you want to see demons and a door to hell, I promise you would be better off watching the trailers at the Hellgate: London game which, although shorter than this 5 minute movie, packs more dialogue, character development, action, plot satisfactory conclusions of this. <br /> <br /> The second star is for the effort, but overall a low score for not being able to make a film that stands out, and to promise in the tagline much more than was delivered.
