Star Trek V certainly gains the dubious distinction of being the weakest movie in the Star Trek series. Despite the actors' good acting efforts, he suffered from a general lack of funding from Paramount Pictures. Paramount Pictures was not thrilled with this film in its debut. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the crew of the Enterprise enjoying extended leave from the ground as a rewrite to save the Earth from the total ecological disaster. Their leave from land is interrupted when there is a disturbance on Nimbus III, the planet of intergalactic peace. Captain Kirk and the Enterprise arrive at Nimbus III only to have their ship hijacked by Sybok, Spock's half-brother. Sybok brainwashed from the Enterprise crew and put him on a suicide mission to meet with "God" just beyond the Great Barrier in the middle of our galaxy. Captain Kirk must therefore find a way to regain control of his ship and to repel the pursuers of the Enterprise's Klignon. <br /> <br /> The only bright spot in the film is acting and directing. William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Laurence Luckinbill and the rest of the cast all perform well. Even William Shatner does a great job in directing this film. <br /> <br /> However, the film suffered from a general lack of enthusiasm and funding. First, the part of Sybok was initially offered to Sean Connery, but he refused. So, Laurence Luckinbill got the part. Secondly, many of the special effects have been severely reduced ... reducing the entertainment potential of the films. Third, the scene describing the arrival at the Great Barrier left much to be desired. Finally, the love story between Scotty and Uhura in this film doesn't make much sense ... considering that no such novel has ever occurred before this point in the Star Trek universe and has never been explained as a story of love can suddenly materialize between Star Treks IV and V. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very weak film. You should probably skip this movie and switch to Star Trek VI. After all, the cast and crew made sure Star Trek VI could partially free itself after defeating Star Trek V.
