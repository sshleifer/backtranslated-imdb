I am ashamed to publicly admit that I even covered the cover of this movie! This is an absolute reason why you should do a research on the film before seeing it! The "creators" of this film have called us all the foolish and gullible losers with too much time available. <br /> <br /> Based on the mythical cobra and Indian revival that changes its shape, history takes us for a painful ride. The college that plays more than 40 actors (now really?) Is the goal of their former friend Manisha Koirala (who was a cobra in her previous life, but is now a ghost!) And her pathetic, eternal, powerful cobra boyfriend / killing machine boy Munish Kohli (which fortunately hasn't been seen since then). Now do you need to learn more? <br /> <br /> I vote to study for the next test at school rather than for this movie! Give him a ride if you are sane. If not ... then you'll probably like it.
