They are a great fight. As a surreal story, this film could have been great (as some consider it here), but mixed with acting (director and relatives who play important roles, due to financial reasons, I think) found here. .. even if calling this acting is not just a trait of that word, it is giving it a new meaning! A completely new meaning! <br /> <br /> If you like surreal movies (there are some that I really like, see the Japanese Strange Circus for example), you might be able to ignore the flaws (see above) and enjoy more . There are great ideas here, after all! Many great metaphors and ambiguous scenes, but looking at this (with a group of friends) almost all of us, we couldn't stop laughing ... not the intention of the director, of course! Once again, everyone has their own tastes, as can be seen from the high rating of this film, but I could only recommend the film if you are aware of the work that Alejandro Jodorowsky has done and / or are a fan of!
