I really like Salman Kahn, so I was really disappointed when I saw this movie. He didn't have much plot and what they had wasn't so attractive. But Salman looks good in the film, he looked young and fresh but worth the price of this DVD. The music wasn't bad, it was pretty nice. Indian films are usually at least two to three hours, but this was a short film for an Indian film. The American actress who played the film is the television series Heroes, Ali Larter. His acting had much to be desired. However, she was beautiful in the Indian clothes she was wearing. The whole film didn't have much to be desired and I hope that Salman does a lot better in his next film. Thank you.
