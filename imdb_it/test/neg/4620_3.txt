I have an affection for these twists on British social norms and it is rare for one to lose me. But our bettors have lost me a little. It's a story of social climbers and their joy in breaking the rules, but personally I found it a bit boring. <br /> <br /> I liked the duchess even though she whined a little too much and Constance Bennett amiably played the role of Lady Greyston, a role that Bette Davis could play backwards. <br /> <br /> But the film comes life in the third act when Ernest joins the party. It's so lively and fun (and in truth probably wears more makeup than Lady Greyston). It gets the last line of the movie and it's a gas!
