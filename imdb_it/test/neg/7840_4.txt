"Maximum Risk" is a side step for Van Damme and only a little more than the uninspired B-movie action movie that is expected from Belgian macho movies. The film has huge holes, plenty of big cats, a dense conglomerate texture, and a magnificent Henstridge who spends most of his time looking like he's waiting for a cue. "Maximum risk" does not stand out in any way and probably will not have much appeal other than the usual young male audience. (C-)
