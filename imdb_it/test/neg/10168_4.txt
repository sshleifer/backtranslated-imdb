Two years after making this film, "The Juror" was released. Don't waste time with this. See "The Juror" instead. "The Juror" is essentially the same story as "Trial By Jury", with better acting, better direction and a much more compelling aura. William Hurt was not as credible as a broken cop, and Armand Assante could not have been more unlike a mafia boss if they had dressed him in a clown suit. You weren't involved enough in the way Joann Whalley's character was shocked by what was happening to her. Furthermore, the way he interacted with the jury was not interesting or interesting in any way. The role of Kathleen Quinlan as a prostitute / murderer was not detailed enough and frankly it was not necessary for the plot.
