The film starts relatively well and seems to come from somewhere when an African American passenger sues an airline for negligence. There is a scene where his dog gets sucked into the engine and this is really a sad thing. But the way it is depicted makes it difficult for one to understand if this was an attempt at crude humor or indeed a tragedy to reflect on the extent of negligence? After this point, they have clearly run out of ideas. If you stay long enough, you will soon be treated to one of the worst movies ever made. It is basically a highly racist sequence of drugs, humor, style of every segment of the plane to reflect African American pop culture and practically nothing else. You would think that the only 3 white passengers on board would lead to some hilarious consequences, but nothing similar happens. Basically they were added just to show how badly they could initially be treated and later accepted into the hood if they behaved. To avoid.
