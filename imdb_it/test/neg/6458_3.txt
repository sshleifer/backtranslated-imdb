The role of Buddy Ackerman is not a trait for Kevin Spacey. He played that character's version many times, better films. This is fortunate because it gives his performance a certain resonance without which Buddy would be flat and incomplete like all the other characters in this useless farce. The script leaves little time for the plot or character development, resembling a porn movie in its run to get to "good things". The difference is that here "good things" are not people who like each other, but inflict pain, making the vision appropriate for young people. <br /> <br /> Of course there is nothing wrong with a porn movie if you want to watch people having sex, and I imagine that there is nothing wrong with "Swimming with sharks" if you want to see people who suffer physical, emotional and psychological torture. But if you are looking for incisive satire, interesting characters or anything else that tries to involve more than your meanest passions, you should probably look elsewhere.
