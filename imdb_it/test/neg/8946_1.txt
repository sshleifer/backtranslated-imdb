** SPOILERS ** I rented "Tesis" (or "Thesis" in English) on the strength of the subsequent effort of director Alejandro Amenabar "The Others". Based on what was a brilliant and horribly effective story, I thought his previous efforts would be of similar quality and I was in the mood for a good horror. Instead I found myself with the most tedious and absurd excuse for a slasher film with a lame brain that I saw from the German movie "Anatomie" (which reminded me of it in a sense). <br /> <br /> The plot has potential but is thrown away within the first 20 minutes. It concerns Angela's innocent-n-pretty student thesis (Ana Torrent - Jessica Harper deadringer) on the subject of violence in films. Through some unbelievable circumstances too stupid to enter here, she ends up holding a snuff tape on which two men torture, maim and kill a girl for the camera. Angela and her horror friend Chema (Fele Martinez) are both shocked but intrigued by the tape and decide to get to the bottom of who is responsible. <br /> <br /> This leads to ... well, nothing. <br /> <br /> They never give a reason why they want to find the girl's killers (since they categorically refuse to contact the police during all the events in progress, even when their lives are at risk) and the mystery himself is as limping as Graham Norton in a room full of bunnies. There is only one appropriate 'clue' (the type of camera used by the killers was discovered) namely a) a very weak one and b) moved out in the first 20 minutes. The rest of the so-called "decay" occurs only through blind luck, increasingly ridiculous twists and a SLEW of horrible, transparent and completely useless sandstones that are simply postponed to complete the execution time. <br /> <br /> Seriously - Amenabar may know his stuff about ghost stories but he never clearly read a crime book in his life. The key to a good whodunnit is to have a large group of potential suspects and eliminate them one by one with an intelligent deduction and the gradual discovery of more and more evidence before proceeding to the final breakthrough. In "Tesis", * POTENTIAL SPOILER NEXT * the identity of the killer is correctly guessed by amateur "detectives" almost instantly and then we receive 100 minutes from the writer who weakly tries to throw us out of the smell until he runs out of ideas, launches his Raise your hand and say "OK, you got me, it was him after all"! As for any kind of logic or reason behind the crimes - no such luck. You're watching the wrong movie if that's what you're looking for. <br /> <br /> The only thing that further draws "Tesis" from the simple fact of being a stupid and poorly written thriller is the way it actually tries to make a ridiculous and confusing "dot" on violence in films. I have no idea what position you're trying to tackle, but he seems determined to cram a lot of confused and confused psicobabble, among the rest of the gibberish, and say "look at me! I'm political!". The final scenes, in which the "point" of the film is apparently hammered at home, are so absurd and childish, one cannot help but wonder if Amenabar feels embarrassed now when he looks at it. If he doesn't, he certainly should. This is an "amateur night at the slasher house". <br /> <br /> Overall, I can't believe I wasted two whole hours (I felt at least six hours), hoping something would happen. The urban legend of "snuff film" (and this is pretty much all that I am, despite the way this film tries to suggest that it is a sort of criminal phenomenon that affects the world!) Is an area that can be exploited so enticingly in a good horror film ("Videodrome" someone?) but it's so easy to go beyond the joke in a child "it wouldn't be nice if!" territory with it (eg: "My Little Eye") ... "Tesis" reaches the historical minimum for the "snuff movie" genre. At each level, this is best left dead and buried. I'll assign it 1 out of 10, for some nice lights, but that's all it's getting.
