I suppose you could say that this film has enormous potential, but nothing more, because the boy made the filmmaker to a mess. The plot is practically incomprehensible, the rhythm is lethargic and the acting is pathetic. And what the hell is a commercial rat? Worse, however, the climax of this film is the anticlimax of all the anticlimaxes; furthermore the title does not seem remotely accurate. The only redeeming feature of this film is the beautiful dark-haired woman ... well, even the blonde girl was pretty, but she was annoying and not as beautiful as the brunette. Anyhoo, as with many movies, this is only to be seen on MST3K.
