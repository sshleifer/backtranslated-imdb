It's the only movie I almost gave up and that would have happened if my friends hadn't been to the movies with me. Normally, even if I don't like a movie, I think it's still worth listening to it until the end. In this way, you can really claim to have given every chance to redeem yourself. But with The Million Dollar Hotel, it was so terrible that I just wanted the experience to end as soon as possible. I think I probably wouldn't have been so deeply disappointed if this film was made by a minor director, one of whom I didn't like very much. But coming from Wenders, it was even more shocking. I know Bono from U2, a good friend of Wenders, I wrote the script for this abysmal movie, and I wonder why Wenders left him, as a buddy's friend like the two. "Attack to one day's work, Bono", is a phrase that easily comes to mind while you see this mess. Pretentious, disjointed, a mixture of every possible contemporary film stereotype, a naive and transparent attempt to come across something extravagant and daring, with the most irritating characters I've ever seen, especially the protagonists, Jeremy Davies, Milla Jovovich and Mel Gibson , none of which I don't normally like. The happiest ending I could have wished would have been to drop a nuclear bomb on their collective leaders in order to get it over with as soon as possible. On a positive note, the first five minutes of the film are extremely good, with an extremely moving soundtrack from U2. But the opening shots of the film mean that the rest of the film (which from then on undergoes a spectacular immersion) is all the more disappointing as they are a promise of cinematic quality that has never been delivered, not even narrow.
