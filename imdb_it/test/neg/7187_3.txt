There is not much to say at the end. You would expect much more from a director who has made better films in the past. It really looks like he did it without really caring. The actors are doing their job (although Belmondo is anything but surprising), but you don't engage. In a word, it's boring. This is even more disappointing since I repeatedly heard that this film could be considered a reaction to all the great American successes, which are considered a threat to the French exception by those who cannot admit that they should turn to another work. I tell you, if this is the best reaction we should get, boy, I will soon feel very depressed ...
