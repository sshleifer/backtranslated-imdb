Ah the science fiction channel. How often do you disappoint me? Very often I think, have you ever shown good movies? OK, you gave me the great "Heroes" and the discreet "The Lost Room", but they are serious, and as far as the film is concerned, there is nothing positive to say. Bad acting, bad direction, terrible characters and a shallow story, and this is only for beginners. I checked the director Allan A Goldstien and I wasn't surprised not to find anything interesting in his resume (in fact I'm almost thinking it's a pseudo name). The premises of four motorcyclists who come out of a motto in a national park when one of them has an accident that needs a park ranger to come and rescue them only to be caught in a forest fire is weak and predictable that you know every beat first happens. The head man Bryan Genesse the park ranger is so mean he is terrible. Launched as the martial arts boy of the action hero in the footsteps of many others, this guy makes Seagal and Van Damme look like De Nero. The supporting cast is a little better and well before the end one remained hoping let the fire swallow them all then from the film team. Avoid at all costs
