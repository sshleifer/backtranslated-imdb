Assault on Precinct 13: 3/10: Let's remember for a moment that Assault on Precinct 13 is a remake of a classic action movie. Taken completely for its merits, Assault is a debacle. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the Rio Bravo scenario. About a dozen people are trapped in a decaying police station in Detroit (If Detroit's location is giving you hot Robocop and interruptions stop right now, it could easily have said Topeka in the opening credits and nothing would have changed. in the forest it would have made more sense). Surrounding them are our villains; corrupt cops. <br /> <br /> Now I know what you think. Corrupt cops? Were the Nazis and drug cartels busy that weekend? Of course these are not ordinary cops. These guys are right on the cover of the latest Tom Clancy video game. Yes, we have body armor; helicopters; laser sights; night vision masks jobs. So we have thirty S.W.A.T. members / Special Forces armed to the teeth verse 4 policemen (fuck drunk who is new year), 2 girls in party dresses and half a dozen criminals. <br /> <br /> So how do our heroes defend themselves? The truth is that they cannot. They should all be dead within a maximum of ten minutes. (Not to mention the characters inside have an annoying habit of walking past the windows.) Now an illogical scenario is not a good reason to make a nice pan of an esp movie. an B-style action movie. However, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne and Ethan Hawke, all the other characters seemed a comic relief. (At least I hope they were) <br /> <br /> While Ja-Rules and the characters in Leguizamo are pretty mean. It's the minstrel show of Aisha Hind that takes the cake. Rarely has a more stereotyped African American character appeared on the modern screen. His performance resembles a frat boy in blackface and drags ghetto acting. <br /> <br /> In the original assault a gang member takes control of an ice cream truck and walks around the neighborhood shooting at the girls in the head. Since then I have had an irrational fear of ice cream trucks. After this assault I have a perfectly rational fear of remakes.
