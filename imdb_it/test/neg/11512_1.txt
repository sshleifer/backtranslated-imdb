For those of us who are part of the real ballet world, this film is completely ridiculous. Ivan Kirov was basically a gymnast, not a dancer. Viola Essen at the time was with Ballet Theater, now the American Ballet Theater, and a decent good dancer, but except for Dame Judith Anderson, the acting is amateur and Checkov is completely over the top .... embarrassingly so! I saw this film at the age of 14 and at that moment, having never seen a ballet, I was very impressed. However, later in life, long after completing my dancing career, I bought the videotape, curious to know what it was like after so many years. I couldn't believe how naive Hollywood could be in the ballet world. But it was made in the mid-1940s, before The Red Shoes or The Turning Point, the latter giving a true image of the ballet world. The entire cast of Specter has now disappeared ... Ivan Kirov (not his real name) dies at the age of 79. It was his one and only film, later held by a Chicago businessman .. so the word goes.
