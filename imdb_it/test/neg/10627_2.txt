In what tries to be a positive story, Dolph Lundgren leads a group of mercenaries to take control of a tropical island that looks a lot like paradise so that the men who hired his team can use it for ... bird droppings . In fact, the nitrogen gas that oozes from the manure on this island is what they are looking for. <br /> <br /> There was only one positive thing about this film - the position of the island where it was shot was beautiful. Otherwise, the story drowns leaving the actors with nothing to work with. Result: a lot of violence, a lot of language, a lot of blood and a few strokes of topless women. If you want useless violence (sorry, the plot can't even make sense of violence, even if it tries), then this is the movie for you. Parents: keep in mind that this film is full of violence and blood, driving the R rating.
