When, oh when, will Hollyweird write a decent computer-based movie? I can't believe that people consider this film a credible story. <br /> <br /> No computer operating system could ever survive that annoying scrolling interface. It might look nice on a movie screen, but if you tried to use it for a while you would go crazy. <br /> <br /> As for "tracking" people as they did, they simply can't be done that way. Network security alone would prevent this from happening. Key stroke logging was ridiculous to say the least. <br /> <br /> As for the software that had to be installed, no system administrator would allow installing such important software on a production system until it has been tested, retested and tested again on a system of sand bags. <br /> <br /> But probably the worst part of the film was the "virus". There is no way that a virus that runs on an operating system will work on any other system. And as for a virus that could take out a mainframe it's a couple of seconds, just a beggar's sideboard. There is no way for an open dial-up connection to have super-user access required which would allow system file deletion. <br /> <br /> I could go on but I can't be disturbed. <br /> <br /> A porn has a plot better thought than this pile of garbage.
