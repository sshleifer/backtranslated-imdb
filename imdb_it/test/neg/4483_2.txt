OK, let's start with the good guys: beautiful scenery, Channing Tatum is easy to look at, Amanda Seyfried has beautiful hair, that's all. How much of this film went to the press room? Probably the plot, the action, the good dialogue and the point. Terrible acting, horrible and uncertain dialogue. Let me tell you how serious it is: my friend who always cries in movies has reached the part that wanted to evoke tears, and she laughed so hard that we thought she was crying! The film seems to want to take a stab at too many problems - war, loss, autism, cancer, but it fails so miserably to cover every topic satisfactorily. Make sure you have something to munch on and your cell phone to return text messages!
