Now let me first say that I love the terrible films of God. Especially horror movies. I watched hundreds of movies on Mystery Science Theater 3000 without pain. But this is the worst movie ever on the planet !!! I had to turn it off it was so bad. It was little fun and simply unwatchable. Give me 3 visions back to back by Manos The hands of destiny or monster A-go-go on this every day. Avoid this movie like the plaid !! Now excuse me as I go to splash my eyes to purify them from the filth I had to observe to get a decent judgment for this film. Only a decent gag in the part I saw was that the killers are now an extermination couple for extermination Hitmen. Even that wasn't fantastic of a gag.
