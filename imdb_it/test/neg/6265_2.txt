Stop me if you do so much earlier, some cheerleaders, their coach and a couple of guys are trapped in a cabin in the woods when an invisible killer kills them one by one. Too bad for me, after I completely erased Jim Wynorski after the horrible "Busty Cops" (it was a long time that his last really good movie was "Hard to Die" in the 90s), for some reason I still hopes an alleged sequel to "Slumber Party Massacre". Unfortunately, even my mediocre expectations were not met. This release isn't as fun as the three previous films in the series (and yes, I'm including SPM 2, which should tell you something) Also, how can you have a slasher movie with this little gore ??? I mean, come on now !! <br /> <br /> My Grade: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Ricky Ray remains topless; April Flowers and Charity Rahmer show tits and donuts in a shower scene (April strips back later in the film), and Tamie Sheffield gets topless and bares buns
