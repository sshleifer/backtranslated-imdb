A fixture in IMDb Bottom 100, after seeing it is not difficult to see exactly why, apparently, fails miserably in almost all bloody departments! <br /> <br /> Take the assembly to begin with; calling this choppy would be excessively free! In fact, one night the producers got drunk and sliced ​​and diced the film reels with some scissors and child glue, so the resulting mess couldn't have been worse than what we actually have here. In addition to this, the vapid story drags on mercilessly for what seems like a tortuous infinite before finally reaching the decidedly lackluster climax. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the always Michael Sopkiw game, the poor performance of most of the cast is not very helpful and the actual beast that causes all the problems is somehow less convincing than gently put it. In truth, all in all this is a pile of complete shit, if I've ever seen one. <br /> <br /> Dear, my dear ... and to think that Lamberto Bava has directed this to ... tut, tut indeed. <br /> <br /> Note: This was released in the UK with the alternative title of Devouring Waves, although lacking most of its gore scenes, which ironically are the only reason why it could be worth the worth watching.
