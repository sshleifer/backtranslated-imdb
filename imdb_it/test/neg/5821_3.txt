I saw this movie at our crossover film festival, and I couldn't wait to do it because it was shot in Mississippi and played Karen Black. I was deeply disappointed by the clumsy script that never flowed and by the apparent lack of effort on the part of the actors and the director to understand something of the culture they tried to portray. In five minutes, have Lee and Griffin become such profound friends? Which one was fucking the girl under the tree? It was not clear. And there seems to be some law in Hollywood regarding southern accents, and you rarely hear anything remotely approaching the everyday sounds of the south., Despite the terrible, "this must be the way they sound, just soften the" r "approach "to talk, so many times the actors come out of it completely. Aleksa in particular looked like a street in New York that lasted during the "emotional" scenes, and nobody played Mississippian. The character of Walt Goggins was supposed to have originated in the city of Morgan, Louisiana, but it did not resemble at all the mix of new orleans and cajun accents of that city. The other annoying point seemed to be a stimulus for the writer to make us all feel that every man must have homosexual impulses within himself. Before starting a firestorm here and I am accused of homophobia, I enjoyed many movies with gay love themes, especially "punk" "when love comes" and "b monkey". But this seemed to be a man's desire for all young men. Well, Tennessee Williams has already covered this ground, and has done a much better job. So, I wonder, if the Coen brothers can get dead culture and regional accents in films set in Minnesota and Mississippi, why nobody else? What a waste of my time.
