Perhaps the most extravagant outlier of Alfred Hitchcock's career is this direct comedy by the director, who works alongside Carole Lombard with Robert Montgomery because a couple who finds a mistake has invalidated their marriage. Where are they really together? <br /> <br /> Contrary to what others say, here is an element of suspense: the idea that these two miserable people could escape each other, free to inflict their terrible other, unworthy companion. <br /> <br /> It is fun to read here the comments of how miserable Lombard's Smith Smith plays this film, because the role of Montgomery is just as heel. He runs Ann, triggers witnesses, short-range clients: just the kind of lawyer who gives a bad name to his profession. Ann is also a bully, the kind of wife who holds her husband hostage from work for six days for a small quarrel, bringing up things like what she did in Paris when she was 20 and hadn't met her yet. "I forgave you!" she says, as if she were big of her. <br /> <br /> For David, a revoked marriage is an opportunity to have a little illicit pleasure with his "mistress" before finally tying the knot. For Ann, it is an attempt at premarital sex that must be rejected with a bottle of champagne on her head, followed by expulsion from their apartment and her life. <br /> <br /> The acorn does not seem to be far from the tree, as Ann's mother is shocked at apoplexy when she learns what David tried to pull: "Oh my poor child! Thank God your father is dead ! " <br /> <br /> This is a rare good line in this laugh, unlikely comedy. <br /> <br /> This can be called an example of the "comedy of marriage", in which the bonds of marriage are challenged to be reaffirmed. You can also call this example of what Roger Ebert calls the "idiot plot", in which the plot depends on the main characters acting like idiots. Hitchcock seems to have a laugh at the tense American morality, but he can't really do much more with him than a sexless scene where an elderly couple is shocked by the sound of a strong plumbing. <br /> <br /> Lombard died in a year of the film's release; it was the last movie of her that she lived to see. What a pity it could not have been something better! She was also arrogant in "My Man Godfrey", but with so much sympathy you didn't have to just go with her, you wanted. Here he plays for the laughter that is not there while sadistically breaking David's ribs again and again. Montgomery looks up very similar to Groucho, a study of laziness. <br /> <br /> The only really decent thing in this film that lasts more than a few seconds is Gene Raymond as David Jeff Custer's law partner, who plays for Ann and acts with honor and decency. Raymond underestimates his numerous reaction shots, and even a drunken scene, all with good results. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** A guy so discreet is Jeff that Ann ends up rejecting him for not fighting David after she pushes him into a confrontation, calling Custer "a piece of jelly". Jeff leaves the scene, leaving Ann and David together for their future murder-suicide. Here is a Custer who managed to escape a massacre! *** SPOILER END ***
