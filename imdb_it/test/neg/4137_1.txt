A boating holiday, a married couple, an angry waiter and a shipwreck is the reason for the start of this movie. <br /> <br /> I like tits. No question about it. But when the main character teams up with anyone who has the most fish at the moment, especially having sex with them and playing the role of the constant victim, my anger rises to a whole new level. Take two boys (a husband and another man), put a pure bomb woman among them, on a desert island, subtract all his moral problems, put a lot of moral problems on the men and mix in a big bowl topics, fish and a zippo lighter and you'll be reminded of a piece of junk film like this. <br /> <br /> The acting is, I would say, good. There are some bloopers but not many as far as I could see. The main female character makes me sick. This is due to its lack of moral values. The man with the most fish gets his attention. Even if one of them is her husband, she sees no problem in being unfaithful with (Manuel) the other man because "I have to do it to survive". How can you justify having sex with another man to fish when your husband is thirty paces away? And won't it even benefit? The female character has absolutely no problems in justifying everything she does. If he does not get approval for his actions, he is a victim. <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone to see this movie. This is the kind of movie that will make pretty much anything else that you will see this year in a pleasing cinematic experience.
