This film is on the level of "Welcome Home Roxy Carmichael" for the biggest pieces of trash that have ever hit the big screen. If these guys weren't gay friends of Adam Sandler, this script would end where it should have been: like the toilet paper of a great movie of the time. I hate this movie, it makes me want to hurt people. I have to admit that I have high standards, but honestly I would prefer to look at Step Up 2. The saddest part was when I registered on IMDb and I read that your junk pieces gave this film a rating of 6.9. This is a testament to all the retarded in our society who will go to see terrible movies that are only an hour and a half long, fucking and grassy jokes with little or no originality. After seeing this evaluation, I would like to suggest "Tyler Perry's House of Pain" to all of you guys who liked this movie; you will see a certain high quality humor on the same level as this abominable abomination.
