I think many friends of people who have acted in this thing must have done it and evaluated why I'm telling you, it's just awful. The acting is worse than the soapopera, the effects are like something you would see from a 1970 episode of Doctor Who, the story is, well, there's no story. And they continue to always use the same 2 minute song over and over again. And the werewolf? Is it like the muppets they used in Wing Commander, the giant cats, remember how bad they were? The werewolf is so bad. Seriously, the guy who directed this is terrible and should never address another, except perhaps his son's school play, but even then, he should pay the public to see it. Ghostwolf is nothing but a bad joke.
