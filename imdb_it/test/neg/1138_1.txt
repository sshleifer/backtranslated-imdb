I can't believe I bought this movie on DVD. I don't even remember seeing him on TV last year. Why couldn't they just have made a real sequel to one of the best Christmas movies ever made? Damn it and Randy Quaid looks like he did the same drugs as Jerry Lewis. I didn't know about this movie until I bought it tonight and thought I'd check it out on IMDb and see how it was evaluated. I made a mistake. If you are reading this review, keep an eye on it and stay true to the first Christmas holiday. Well, at least I didn't pay more than $ 10 for it. Maybe I can exchange it and recover half of that at Tower Records. Then again maybe not. PS I haven't seen it yet, my DVD player went tonight to watch another wonderful movie, The Chronicles of Riddick (Unrated Director's Cut), a real fool.
