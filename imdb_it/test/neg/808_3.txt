As a South African, back in South Africa after a 32-year stay in the UK, I regret to say that this film is a huge disappointment. The three main problems I had with the film were: a) because Swank and Ejiofor, an American and a Nigerian, had the main role. This country is full of talent and does not need to be imported ... b) Gillian Slovo has been trading her fighting credentials for years. She is a very mediocre writer and even her novel does not hold the flabby direction of Mr Hooper ... York as they wander freely around the poverty of the Karoo. Where was the consideration and sensitivity required by the client and the director? Yes, the film is finally moving - how could it not be? - but the general mood at the conclusion is of enormous disappointment. The heart is in the right place but needs a pace maker.
