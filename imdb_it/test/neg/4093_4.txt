This was a blow condemned since its conception. The only idea of ​​this was blades - to take a secondary character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing tone in a family-rated PG movie. I wasn't the least bit interested. Then the trailer arrived. Not only did he only confirm that the film would have been little fun and generic, but he also managed to give the film WHOLE; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every point of the plot, every line is told in the trailer. It's like a 3-minute version of Cliff's Notes from the film. So obviously I wouldn't have paid to see it, but once I hit DVD, I thought, I'll watch it for free. Maybe Steve Carell can save him. <br /> <br /> No. <br /> <br /> I am still baffled as to why he signed up for this. He must have owed someone a favor. The lines were so flat and obvious, and the director obviously asked him to go for a very wide comic style like that of Jim Carrey of the original Bruce Almighty. But it's not funny. The studio obviously tried to cash in on the virgin's 40-year success, complete with many of Carell's past co-stars, a reference to the movie on a theater curtain, and another sequence of closing musical credits. But even the talented Carrell cannot save him. His co-stars are not much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill and Ed Helms just wasted. Wanda Sykes is not wasted, it's just a waste of anything she does, and her horrible jokes and reactions just make you want people to quit her job. <br /> <br /> The story itself is only predictable and lazy. You hammer over your head with obvious preconceptions, like Evan's contempt for the environment (he drives a Humvee filling up with gasoline, chooses to use the wood of the endangered trees for his house, hates animals ... .), and in the end it is just finished - the maximum preaching both for the faith and for the environment. <br /> <br /> Because the film was made for everyone it is quite disconcerting, but I really don't understand how it would have become the most expensive comedy ever. The only real effect is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those in the scenes is one of the worst and most obvious blue / green jobs I have ever seen. Maybe renting live animals on the set cost a fortune. Who knows. But whatever it was it cost them so much, it didn't translate into quality, that's for sure. But hey, it wasn't by far the worst movie of the year. There are still many thicker ones like Norbit and Death Proof.
