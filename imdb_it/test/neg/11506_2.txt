when this show first came to Disney, I like that it started watching it all the time. It quickly became one of my favorite Disney programs, but this show somehow turned into something scary and disappointing. <br /> <br /> Now I find the second and third seasons to be fun, they look like a few shows for kids. I bring that garbage. The first season was truly unique because it showed Sadie who loved science, animals and creatures. The first season was a lot of fun. For the most part I don't like the second season because of Ben. It bothers me and pisses me off shit. Also the plot in the second season sucks and is simply horrible
