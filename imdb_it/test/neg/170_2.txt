There were so many classic films that were made where the protagonists were liars out of the ordinary, yet they are made to look beautiful. I never bought that stuff. The "screwball comedies" were full of that stuff so there were a lot of Fred Astaire movies. <br /> <br /> Here, Barbara Stanwyck plays a famous "country" writer who has been lying to the public for years and feels he has to keep lying to keep his person (and his job). He is also lying to a boy who is getting married, another topic that has always been trivialized in classic films. <br /> <br /> She is a woman from New York who pretends to be an excellent cook and someone who knows how to handle children, etc. Obviously you don't know anything and the lies accumulate so quickly that you lose track. I imagine that this should be fun because in the end the lessons are learned and true love prevails, etc. Etc. Pass the bag. <br /> <br /> Much of this film is NOT fun. Stanwyck was far better in the film noir genre. As for Dennis Morgan, well, the bag goes by again.
