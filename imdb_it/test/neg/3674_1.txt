Val Kilmer is almost nowhere in this film, unlucky for him! He plays maybe 30 seconds of screen time and his role is completely irrelevant. After seeing the movie I can't tell you which "role" plays in the movie !! ?? OK ... they suck you the first hour by diving into dark underground tunnels. Spectral movies shot in dark underground tunnels easily suck most people for the first 30 minutes to an hour. So you'll start wondering, "why am I looking at this?" I remember thinking how easy it is for a director / writer to use dark underground labyrinths to make a film. It is enough to film the people who go around the dark galleries and have instant "suspense". But this is where this film goes no further! We all ask ourselves what there is to sting in the night, but there is nothing out there in the darkness in this movie, but more darkness. History is even worse. Apparently there is a story behind the film I learned of "after" watching the movie. But the film uses a dialect so poor that it was never seen clearly during the screening. I still don't understand what the writer / director meant. Some children trapped underground by a misguided sister in Russia? Why? Are they in our time - at the same time as the characters? Are they ghosts? <br /> <br /> This was an absolutely horrible film that prompted me to write my first IMDb review to warn others to avoid it.
