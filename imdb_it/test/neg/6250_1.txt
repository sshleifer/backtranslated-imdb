Before I start, I have to inform you that I love horror movies with passion. THEIR! I've seen thousands of them and rarely one that I don't like. I'm forgiving a lot of the horror genre. One of the biggest lines in the history of cinema is in the movie "Ed Wood", where Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) goes crazy and shouts at the overly critical producers after commenting on the "set" economic and continuity problems of "Plan 9", " You don "I don't know anything! Have you ever heard of "suspension of disbelief ?!" "Well, I try to bring with me the philosophy of" suspension of disbelief "in every horror film I see and usually work. Unfortunately, it didn't work for me during the screening of Cheerleader Massacre. <br /> <br /> Strike One: <br /> <br /> The first thing you'll notice about this "movie" is that it's shot on video and has the poor style of a home digital camera. The camera work and quality are so bad that it makes daytime soaps make a breathtaking comparison.In fact, it makes the video footage of Troma and Full Moon look good.And, this is bad. <br /> <br /> Strike Two: <br /> <br /> Jim Wynorski: This "director" probably imagines a chip from old Corman, but nothing could be further from the truth. Roger Corman fired fast, furious and under budget, but was able to deliver an original and tight film. Although Wynorski offers a cheap film, cheats its viewers (and perhaps other artists) while stealing whole pieces James Horner's "Humanoids From The Deep" and "Battle Beyond The Stars" and inappropriately yields them to the Cheerleader Massacre. On the back of the art box and during the credits, the score for music, Dan Savio (an extra in "Deathstalker II" by Wynorski), is wrongly attributed. You'll also notice how Cheerleader Massacre jumps from one movie to another and goes back while Wynorski raises whole scenes from "Slumber Party Massacre" and "Humanoids From the Deep". Wynorski used this deception, fourteen years earlier, in his horrible version of "Not of This Earth". <br /> <br /> Strike Three (you're out): <br /> <br /> While Cheerleader Massacre does I have a little nudity, (40-year-old teenagers playing teenagers and the set of fake breasts the most coarse I've ever seen in a horror movie, ugh), the murders are relatively bloodless. What the hell is this all about? The film is titled, Cheerleader Massacre, but a handful of off-screen murders, in my opinion, is not added to a massacre. He doesn't even add a bad mosquito bite. <br /> <br /> The film's story is clear enough: an invisible killer sneaks into a cheerleader van (old girls playing boys) until the van runs out of gas and the "girls" are forced to hold up in the lonely two-story mountain home. I won't ruin the ending for you, but this is one of those "movies" in which the person who is obviously the killer is obviously not the killer. The Cheerleader massacre would have been great if it had been filmed, directed by Joseph Zito and had special effects by Tom Savini. Instead it is a shot-on-video disguise by Jim Wynorski. Ouch. <br /> <br /> Please, please do not buy or rent this abomination. If we continue to support these clowns, the more talentless video junk will produce. Exit and rent "The Prowler", "The Last House on Dead End Street", "Delirium" or "The Burning". You'll be glad you did.
