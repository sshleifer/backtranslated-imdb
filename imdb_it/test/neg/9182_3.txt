this comic is not right, lol I do not at all agree with a lot of things that you have portrayed but it ended on a positive note, but for me and for me we will not see it in our family mainly because we fight against stereotypes every day and this cartoon only confirms what white people think black people behave like the comment of one of the black girls made on the cartoon is that her boyfriend was so aware (he was white) that he really offended me that it's not something that we, as people of color, take lightly, is a state of being that blacks realize when they realize their true capacity
