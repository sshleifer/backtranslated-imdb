Time has not been kind to this film since the days of sound transition from silence. The plot has a gangster who falls in love with a socialite who wants to help his luck violinist he loves. There are obviously complications. The problem with the film for me is that it hasn't aged well. Performances are everywhere, with some emotional scenes that seem so exaggerated that they are ridiculous. A late exchange in which Carol Lombard throws someone out of her room made me howl with her singing song. There are other times when the film becomes static, a sign of the limits of the microphones. It's not a bad movie, it's just that the technical limits of the film intrude into real fun. Normally I'm forgiving, but this time I couldn't follow the flow (then again the copy I saw was absolutely horrible). It's worth shooting in a tolerant mood (and remember that Robert Armstrong actually did more than play Carl Denham in King Kong)
