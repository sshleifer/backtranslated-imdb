So I got it from the store where I work before being released (the release is 8/21), I've seen it and I'm speechless today. They could have had a decent movie here, but they ruined everything in painfully obvious ways. <br /> <br /> First of all, the parts with John Krasinski were fun, and they are the only reason I gave it over a 3, but they are interrupted by bad acting and terrible "serious" reflections about life between the main character (Andrew Keegan) and his girlfriend (the annoying Lacy Chabert). It would have been much, much better, like a simple comedy for Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like it, because I think Krasinski is fun and wants to see it done well. The story was not bad, just not very original. But the direction (and a lot of acting) was terrible. I swear they had trouble keeping people's faces in the shot and they went ahead anyway. <br /> <br /> Their carelessness is shown when the weapons expert corrects another character and says that a "Dirty Harry" gun is not a. 357 magnum but at .45 (it was, as everyone knows, a .44 magnum). <br /> <br /> So, see this if you really love John Krasinski 2- you want to look at low budget (and badly-managed) movies or 3- Have too much time available (it's me!)
