This film is a classic nonsense of the 50s. In his favor, the plot manages to trigger an alien invasion without actually producing the aliens themselves. But let's go now, if the aliens needed energy and could absorb it from sources like hydrogen bombs, why should they come to earth? Why shouldn't they just suck it from a STAR!?!? The only credible reason for the presence of Kronos is a direct attack on terrestrial society, not just the collection of energy. None of this is even intimated; Kronos may have been built by a superior race, but its activities on Earth are the most primitive. The end that the plan of the scientists-heroes for Kronos is based on nothing but a pseudo-scientific meaningless language. This is equivalent to the "Reversal of polarity" move, which has been used so much in bad news that it has become a joke in itself. Low and behold, this causes our unwanted visitor to release his collected energy. No one in power seems to care about the impact that the release of so much energy (which at the end of the film includes, among other things, the entire yield of a hydrogen bomb) will have on the surrounding environment. And unfortunately, when the film ends, the surroundings are the suburbs of Los Angeles. Ooops!
