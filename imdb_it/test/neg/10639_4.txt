this fourth installment of the series is the last to have a film version, although it seems to be directed at the video movie. OK, I think, but nothing special. The acting is the worst ever seen in the series up to this point. and like the third film, there's not much in the way of imagination. Furthermore, the phrase "directed by Alan Smithee" is never a good thing. Emmehe is the pseudonym used by filmmakers when they want nothing to do with the film. , is an acceptable film in the Hellraiser series, but not much more than what is a slight drop in quality from number three, and a huge drop compared to the first two. For me, Hellraiser IV: Bloodline is a 4.5 / 10
