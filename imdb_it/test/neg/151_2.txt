This film didn't do it for me. I like horror and splatter movies, but this has very little to do with horror. The effects are cheap and when you cut one of your feet it looks so fake. The same applies to other effects such as tongue torture and intestinal sex. They may have spent a little more money on the effects. <br /> <br /> With so much sex (with pixelization as in all Japanese movies) this is just a sick fetish porn and there seems to be a market for sick things like this. While more bloody, for me it adapts to titles like Squirmfest / Purge and the Genki series. These films show girls eating and playing with every fluid that comes out of your body, eating insects and fish roughly and having sex with all kinds of strange animals, like toads, eels and ... A look at the covers will say fans horror to look elsewhere. No horror here, just sick and degrading sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Horror fans should avoid it and are better at taking a look at Guinea Pig2: Flowers of Flesh and Blood or even August Underground Mordum. While these are not great, they offer at least a horror experience and Niku Daruma absolutely fails in that department.
