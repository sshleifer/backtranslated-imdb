I never thought that a movie could make me regret being registered with the HBO service. Now I know better! Usually Jack is one of my favorite actors, but even he couldn't save this part. Not that he tried. Jack plays his usual Eastwick type character. Unfortunately he did not move to the American Southwest. He is credible as a desperado cowboy like Pee Wee Herman. There is no margin to the performance and for this reason the comedy fails. It's almost stupid. The rest of the cast was worse. The timing in the delivery of the lines is apparently something that the protagonist had not completed in 1978 and the others simply seemed happy to be there. My recommendation to those of you interested in seeing this film is that you save valuable time for something like looking at dried paint.
