Tyra Banks must teach these girls that it's not just about being beautiful on the outside. Even the interior counts for something. Many of the previous winners seemed semi-decent, but they are horribly cruel and are creating problems for other girls. I see Tyra less involved with girls in every season. About the only thing worth watching for Top Model is Mr. Jay Manuel. Recently, Tyra had a competitor who was a pre-op transsexual. I felt that he should have done more to encourage her. It was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy that showed through her feminine appearance. Tyra should have given her advice or maybe she could have sent Ms. Trannie Ms. Jay to help the girl. Instead, the competitor was met with harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism. It's a shame because I really enjoyed the first 3 seasons. There is a reason why Project Runway has all 4 seasons on DVD and Top Model has only 1 season on DVD. It's called taste. Top Model seriously needs a lot of revamping and a bit of humanity.
