Coming from Kiarostami, this art-house art and sound exhibition is a surprise. For a director known for his narratives and acute observation of humans, especially children, this excursion into minimalist cinematography poses questions: why did he do it? Was it to keep him busy during a beach vacation? <br /> <br /> "Five, 5 Long Takes" consists, you guessed it, of five long takes. They are (the names of the titles are mine and the times are approximate): <br /> <br /> "Driftwood and waves". The camera remains almost motionless looking at a small piece of floating wood as it is moved by small waves that break on a beach. Ten minutes. <br /> <br /> "Watching people on the waterfront". The camera stands still looking at the ocean horizon and a walkway. People walk through the camera frame, their faces too distant and blurred to make them interesting. Eleven minutes. <br /> <br /> "Six dogs by the sea". The camera stands still watching the ocean horizon with a strip of sand nearby. Far away by the sea, six dogs don't do much, they just relax. Sixteen minutes. <br /> <br /> "Ducks in a row, pack of ducks". The camera stands still watching the ocean horizon near the water's edge. Dozen and dozens of ducks run in single file from left to right. I assume Kiarostami released them gradually. The last two ducks suddenly stop on their track and suddenly a group of ducks roll silently from right to left. I assume that Kiarostami picked up the ducks and re-released them all at the same time. It is not the first time that it deals with the contrast between organized and disorganized behavior. Eight minutes. <br /> <br /> "Symphony of toads, oops, I mean cacophony, for a stormy night". The camera stands on a pond at night. It is pitch black, except for what appears to be the reflection of the moon on the waving water. It is a stormy night and the clouds run to cover the moon. The screen goes dark. What remains for us is the cacophony of frogs, howling dogs and, in the end, early morning cocks. Hit me if it was done in one shot. I saw this segment as a sound composition put together in the editing room and accompanied by a simple visualization. Twenty-seven minutes! <br /> <br /> With the exception of slightly amusing ducks, this exercise in minimalism has left me cold. A film not essential for Kiarostami's admirers. <br /> <br /> I thought of classifying "Five" at five, but four is what it deserves. <br /> <br /> The film is dedicated to Yasujiru Ozu.
