There seems to be a great deal of potential for the plot of this film to be something worth watching. The acting was flat and the story lacked depth. There was too much reliance on the work of the cameras, which had some highlights. I have to agree with the other negative comments. I just wish I had read them before buying the DVD. The movie might be worth watching for free and you're bored crying in advance. There would have been much more plot development with the reason why there are homeless people in Moscow (ie post-Soviet "capitalism", the rampant use of drugs (increased heroin trafficking from Afghanistan), more development than why rebirth of Russian orthodoxy after the fall of the USSR, the same archaeologists, or even more in the struggle against nihilism.
