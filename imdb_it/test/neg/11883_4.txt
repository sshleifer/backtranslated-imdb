This is a voice of a person, who has just finished watching the second season of Rome, almost in unison, and took the opportunity to see "what happened next" - this film conveniently takes the flight where Rome ends. If you find Rome as an abomination, a diabolical feast of poor historical precision, then you could enjoy the Imperium: Augustus. But if you believe that Rome is a good thing, if you like complicated intrigues, the atmosphere of decadence and the work of actors, then Imperium will evidently appear to you as a too timid, superfluous and boring soap opera with not many redemptions factors. <br /> <br /> There are some actors who for my tastes look slightly better than these in Rome. In particular, I didn't like Cleopatra's image of Rome as a drug-addicted sex addict. There must have been a lot of strength and dignity in that woman, and the Imperium actress adapts much better to the part. O'Toole and Rampling are good, and so are others. But then ... If you've known - and you love - Atia as the super cool bitch, you'll find the depiction of her in Imperium - like a mother tearing goose tears in an apron - absolutely ridiculous. There should be some cursed characters in the Empire, but these actresses rely heavily on watching men and nothing else. You will not find interesting female characters in this epic. There is also the painfully comic Maecenas, which we see as a strident drag queen, although there is little historical evidence that it was such (once it referred to "being effeminate in its pleasures" in the annals). <br /> <The interiors are rather sparse and are based on cliché clichés. The great Cleopatra room looks like something out of a computer game or a children's playroom in an Egyptian theme park. There is really poor 3D graphics, not up to 2003 standards. <br /> <br /> The action is presented as a series of flashbacks that Elder Augustus is reliving. So let's take a quick look at some historical events, some of which are presented well, while others are not. A disproportionate amount of time is wasted to show Livia as the "eternal flame" of Augustus. This business doesn't sizzle even for a moment, the dialogue is superlame and everything is topped off with a musical note indomitable by tears. Whatever the amount of reality that the show aims to capture, the last shred of it is destroyed by dry synchronized dubbing (most actors don't speak English). <br /> <br /> Everything is warm in this epic. True, there are more historical precisions than in Rome, but dramatically speaking, it is simply boring. The characters lack depth and clarity of dialogue. Camera work is often reduced to static shots and lighting offers nothing to please you. <br /> <br /> There's really no one to love or hate in Imperium. Regardless of whether you liked or disliked Rome, there are much better movies and miniseries around. Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of a Empire is something I recommend.
