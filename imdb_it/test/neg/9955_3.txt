There are so many holes in the plot, I ask you if they knew they had an audience for this and they just launched it. I don't know much about George Zucco, but I've seen him in two movies. Obviously, he was chosen as a loving father, mad scientist, vampire boy. It looks so normal. I'm surprised it's over in the genre. This is the typical, "I will create monsters that can be used to fight like an army." By transferring wolf blood (or coyote) to his hired hand, he turns it into a werewolf. Glen Strange, who was one of Karloff's successors as the Frankenstein monster, plays the amiable gentleman who is victimized because he trusts the crazy doctor. At first the scientist is able to control when Petro (his name) can be transformed. But, like the invisible man, he suddenly starts morphing by himself and becomes a responsibility. There is a small love story of the daughter and a reporter in a high-pitched voice (Golly Miss Brooks). He wants to leave, but his father, the doctor, won't allow it. He is also led by a group of his peers who have mocked his research before and will now have satisfactions. The way in which plot to embarrass them or kill them is rather far-fetched and depends a lot on Petro and the guys waiting to be attacked. It's not a great film. The highlight is the atmosphere of the woods while people and monsters hide around the Spanish moss. Once again, the citizens are a group of morons, who seem to have escaped from a bad westerner. One thing that has remained with me is that a young girl is the first victim and this seems unusual for a film of this era. There is also an old lady who smokes a pipe who knows werewolves, but nobody listens to her.
