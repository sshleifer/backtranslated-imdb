Disastrous Mishmash has a team of street sweepers running into SOS Poseidon upside down, hoping to loot it before it ends forever. The sequel to Irwin Allen on his 1972 blockbuster "The Poseidon Adventure" arrived in the SEVEN YEARS LATER theaters! Never mind that nobody cared anymore, why give us such a poor production, full of indistinct characters and disgusting actors, just to throw away the memory of your greatest success? You could end up feeling really sorry for Michael Caine, Sally Field, Peter Boyle, Jack Warden, Karl Malden and Shirley Jones if it wasn't for their lost expressions at sea (good for some stray laughter). There is a time when Saint Jones is tempted to take treasures just for herself and she timidly begins to fill her pockets which is an involuntary cry. The film was a career mess for everyone involved, especially Allen, who never fully recovered from this. * from ****
