I can't believe I sat in this trash. Palms in D.C. (already mentioned), a fake-dead manikin so obviously artificial that I thought it was SUSPECTED to be a mannequin ... until it left a blood stain ... drawn dialogues, ridiculous plot. I think it's a shame that Jill Ireland's final film before her death was this stinker. Don't waste time - I wish I hadn't. The only redeeming thing is that it was on cable, so I didn't waste my money on top of everything.
