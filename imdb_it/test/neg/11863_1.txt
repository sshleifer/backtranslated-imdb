I like dark humor and non-PC things, but not if it's without purpose, but to elevate yourself. Crushing a group of people without any trace of self-mockery is crap. <br /> <br /> There are people who could make the concentration camp jokes fun, but whoever made this film unfortunately failed even in the VERY easy task of making fun of the Turks in Germany. It is a very easy task, but if you are the equivalent of Germany of an innate wiry (= a southern weaned of a village where virginity is often lost for farm animals) you will certainly fail in this and even in life. I have heard and seen so many funny things about minorities in Germany, but this "movie" (this piece of shit that is listed here is an insult to the next worst movie) sucks like the calf encountered some years ago in this film.
