OK ... at the time of writing, 65 people voted for this film, taking it to 5 out of 10. My guess is that only the film crew voted. So I'm here to bring some justice to everything. <br /> <br /> Never has a film caused the public's intelligence more than this. Given, I laughed a bit loudly - but the movie / story absolutely didn't want me. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of bad movies. A LOT. But man, this takes them all away. <br /> <br /> Speaking of '96 computers, ridiculous acting and wheelchair pursuits - and we have young Tarantini who can't get their ideas funded. Yes, life is a cruel joke.
