I didn't care much about this, it seemed too invented for a documentary. Furthermore, the directors seemed to be oriented towards certain characters, yet I was completely unpleasant towards the protagonist because of what they chose to show me. <br /> <br /> This film disappointed me because the story and the people were interesting, but the film fell flat due to a quick editing that didn't allow the viewer to have enough time to understand each scene. History developments have been ignored in place of showing men in boxers or other things that were secondary to the story they were telling. <br /> <br /> I advised you to skip this and just read about this story.
