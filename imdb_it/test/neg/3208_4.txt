Sending the Critters into space seems like a fun idea, but was there really a need for a third film, much less than this fourth? A film with Brad Dourif can't be all bad, right? Well, maybe in this case. This cheap science fiction movie reads the lovely klutz Charlie (the trustworthy Don Keith Opper) who is about to eradicate the last two remaining eggs of the Critters species when Ugh (Terrence Mann) tells him he is about to break a kind of Trans - legislation of species in danger of extinction. Then, at Ugh's request, Charlie places the two eggs in special containers inside a space capsule. Unfortunately for Charlie, that damn thing takes off for space and he's trapped inside. The smoke beneath his feet places him in a hibernation stasis and wakes up 53 years later inside a decrepit space station <br /> <br /> while Captain Rick, with a fat cigar, rude and eager to alcohol centro is opening the Space Pod trying to see what are the possible novelties in any sales or exchanges. Rick, unbeknownst to him, lets out the two creatures that feed on his flesh. You see that Rick and his crew found the spaceship adrift and with its intense dollar signs blinking in their eyes, then they hooked it. Ugh reports to them (now in a prominent and prominent position as an adviser) that money can be made if they dock at a space station under the Terracor organization. Once the crew has stopped, they discover that this station is in ruins with many corridors in bad condition, but what is worse is the computer of the Angela station. Angela is a real thorn in the crew's side because she was left unrepaired without proper maintenance for some time. It takes some little tricks to open and close the doors, not to mention the elevators and computers. Brad Dourif is Al Bert, practically the IT manager (.. and he is practically the real leader of the group because he is the most balanced and intelligent). He appears to be a paternal figure of Ethan (Paul Witthorne) who just wants to reach the earth to find his father ... but this story does not necessarily reach his zenith. Bernie (Eric DaRe) is mainly in the film for being a drug victim for crunching critters. In the film, Charlie, after a critic enters Rick's mouth and eats his throat {yuk}, becomes the crew's guide in understanding what they are fighting. The film has some elements that I found rather confusing (or for a better word, ridiculous) .. the two creatures grow rapidly in size, are somehow able to coordinate a ship for the Earth, let alone grow to size huge in this space station laboratory. The crew is able to draw on a register from a Dr. McCormick (Anne Ramsay, whose badge is found in a coat thrown to the side so Ethan discovers his access card} showing signs that Terracor was trying to create a species to exterminate worlds and people. Knowing this worries Al Bert who wishes to leave Angela and his bleeding station for greener pastures. Things don't work that way because Charlie, well-intentioned (thanks in part to the "ancient" Colt 45) of Al Bert, he kills a creature that came aboard, but by firing several bullets he hits the main steering systems of the ship.There are so many repairs in order, but they stop them when Ugh and his assault troops stop at Angela and show that they are not what Charlie thought he was. Ugh is a changed man and Charlie realizes that he is completely evil and his mission is to preserve the Crites for cruel nature purposes (ra ppresentazione types of corrupt corporate governance?). This betrayal is what changes Charlie ... maybe he has grown a little (a little) and now he understands that some people simply change for the worse. Charlie and Ugh will come to face these creatures ... will the crew be able to escape from a space station that has set self-destruction? This film doesn't really exploit the critters as much as the other three films. I think we can clearly see this as the real end of the franchise. The first film was a hoot ... really fun fun. But, as this sequel approaches, the critters have just worn their welcome. The cast, however, gives the film a boost. The critters get to feed a little, but their plans for global domination are underdeveloped. Their role in the film is not established at maximum heights. I said to myself, you have this huge space station with the unfortunates trapped on board ... couldn't you take this idea and run with it? Unfortunately, they don't.
