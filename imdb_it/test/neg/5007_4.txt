What is wrong with CURACAO (also known as THE DEADLY CURRENTS although the reason why the name changes I have no idea) can probably be summarized where a woman tells her lover: <br /> <br / > "Keep it down small, I'm trying to sleep" <br /> <br /> It is not the dialogue that is the problem or the way it is delivered, it is the fact that the actress has a Central European accent. Nothing wrong with that until it is revealed that his character is from Philadelphia in the United States! This struck me about this thriller as I watched it: the way accents don't match their characters. Apart from Philly's woman with a German accent, we see a South African with an English accent, a local police chief who plays like an Irishman who plays a Gestapo officer and, worst of all, George C Scott who plays someone who is Dutch or British with an accent looks like he could be American-dyed South African. Soon you give up following what's on the screen and you end up focusing on what nationality a character can be because of the strange way they talk. It is interesting to note that this site did not give this film a country of origin. With so many different actors from different countries, you feel that this was produced by the United Nations <br /> <br /> Even if you are not curious about accents or dialects you will probably have to give up on following the action anyway because CURACAO is a plot in less. Things happen like an exploding boat, and a hostage situation, and the hero is recruited as an agent for South African intelligence, but you are left scratching your head wondering what the hell he was leading.
