A comedy that robs inspirational sports films, The Comebacks tells the story of an unlucky coach, Lambeau Fields, who takes a group of college misfits and pushes them towards the soccer leagues. In this process, this lifelong loser discovers that, after all, he is a winner by redeeming himself, saving his relationship with family and friends, and discovering that there really is no "I" in "team"! <br /> <br /> I decided to look at the unrated version of this movie. More than thirty minutes have passed and I think it could be better than the theatrical version, feeling that people hated this movie. After all, thirty minutes of extra footage can add a lot to a movie. Well, I certainly did wrong. It was as bad as the recent "Meet the Spartans" but it was thirty minutes of torture! <br /> <br /> Really, who is approaching two hours of film spoofing ?! A smuggling film is short because if it goes longer, it would be excessive! Honestly, I love stupid comedies. Heck, I liked "Movie Date", "White Chicks", "Epic Movie" and "Little Man"! I imagine that when it comes to smuggling, it's a success or a miss, and I definitely missed that. <br /> <br /> On the lighter side, from the many lines of this film, I'll say about six or seven made me laugh, even some that made me laugh out loud. But it's not saying much. Following those jokes, there were more torture scenes and insults. <br /> <br /> I can't see how people would say this is not a terrible parody. In fact, there is so much room for product placement like Meet the Spartan, there are so many fun little dance sequences and jokes. I will say another thing that I like about this movie are the songs. They are some great songs here. Overall, watch it if you like smuggling movies. Skip it if you like funny movies.
