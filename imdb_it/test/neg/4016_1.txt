An "independent" film that, from the back of the box, promises twists, adventure and an emotional adventure that we will never forget. This film also pushes us to watch him performing Rachel Lee Cook with a leading role. After the first twenty minutes, you realize that this movie will give you NOTHING. The story goes on purposelessly, revealing nothing new or important to keep us interested. All three "disturbed" characters have only small grains of background that force us to worry. Just as you reach the end, everything about the story is altered and instead of helping the audience reach your goal, you have no idea and, more importantly, you don't care about "why". The director, who also thought it would be a good idea to act, seems to enter the film without any experience or knowledge of useful filmmaking. The whole piece looks like a college "art" film made by a freshman student who tries to hide a lack of real talent.
