Now I know that a lot of black humor makes fun of typical black things such as gold teeth. But that doesn't mean they are always fun. Not being a threat is an example of this. Urban film certainly lends itself to satire. The problem is that Wayans and spouses not only try to satirize the typical ghetto culture, but they also detract from the valid claims made in urban films like Boyz 'n' the Hood or Menace II Society. I personally think that the creators of this film should take their heads off the bowel movements of their white masters. In addition to this, the film itself is terrible. It's absolutely not fun. The jokes are racist. Instead of satirizing the urban film genre, the filmmakers show their views on "ignorant" urban blacks (ghetto). Now there are other jokes in this movie, but I think this is the main rate. <br /> <br /> In conclusion this film is shit and the producers should use their talent to make a comedy / satire. They have examples in Men With Black Hats (which was made before this film) and Friday.
