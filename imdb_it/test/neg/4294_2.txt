"The Yoke's on Me" is undoubtedly the most controversial film in the 23 years of Stooges short films. The reason is understandable; according to today's standards, this film can be considered racist. For this reason, it is rarely shown, if ever, on television. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that, for the record, the Japanese seen in the film were not soldiers; they were Japanese-Americans sent to a transfer center during World War II. They have been treated and shown as the enemy of evil in this film. According to all reports - including the US government, which made excuses and reparations in the 1980s - Japanese-Americans during the Second World War were as loyal and hard-working as any American. Their imprisonment during this period is a dark stain in American history. <br /> <br /> There are some Stooge laughs in this film, but the memories of how the Japanese were treated during this time cheat the value of entertainment. Let's not confuse the loyal Japanese-Americans with their representation in this film as evil. The loyal Japanese-Americans and Japan's evil empire of World War II are not synonymous. 2 out of 10.
