I got out of this movie and only did it once with the Australian film Sweetie 20 years ago. After about three minutes I wanted to kill the camera man and I couldn't believe that this movie was actually shown anywhere and ... guess what - he was nominated for two Independent Spirit Awards. What???? No matter how realistic the dialogue is (I will never use the word "friend" again!) - who wants to listen to these conversations? I don't go to the cinema to be annoyed but that's all I got. The only good thing I came up with was the realization that if this film can reach Sundance and other festivals, anyone can do it. Well, wait, after all it might not be a good thing ...
