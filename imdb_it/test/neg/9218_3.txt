You should have the right to expect from people who make a film about the Second Coming and the Third Testament, who have read the other two, or at least know something more about miracles and the Day of Judgment. This film contains absolutely nothing relevant to viewers who are interested in Jesus, religion or philosophy - there is only standard British social realism with guttural dialects and chubby characters in pubs. <br /> <br /> Actually, good candidates for a true Third Testament have been published several times - as "A Course in Miracles" or "Conversations with God". All have new stimuli and angles for Christian faith and theology. <br /> <br /> The most interesting information in the IMDb classification is not the number of stars, but how many people took the trouble to vote. In four years, only 387 people have bothered to vote for this film. As usual, fans are the most eager. For a comparison, take a look at "Jesus Christ, Superstar" - original 1973 version.
