'Bland' is probably the word I would use to try to start describing this film. I only saw him because he had a good evaluation here and I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> Basically the film is about racism in a post-9/11 America and the director tried it with a sledge hammer! There was no subtlety in the film and it looked like they were trying to get some sort of Magnolia feeling for the movie - which is never a good idea since that movie was three hours of boredom and confusion just because it started to rain frogs at the end ... <br /> <br /> All in all a HUGE disappointment.
