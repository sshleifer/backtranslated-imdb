I just saw the movie premiering tonight and it's a movie just for kids. Does not improve or add to the original Disney film in any way. There is a style of Scottish pastiche all messy, not helped by a weak writing (where the motives are piled up with the spade) and by the acting that is irregular and often not involving (despite what we read as a decent cast). I have no problem with the wee dog - although there is a certain "Skippy the Bush Kangaroo" quality (see below) of his shots. <br /> <br /> * For those who do not know, "Skippy" was an Australian children's television series from the 1960s where the kangaroo would be an essential part of all the stories. It is said that to make poor old Skippy "act", they attached an elastic band around his mouth which he then tried to break off with his paws - a bit like appearing to communicate with human actors !!! Bobby has a similar range and you don't buy his heroic save series at all. <br /> <br /> The advice would be to bring children between 8 and 12 years old. Below that, they could be scared. In addition to this, if you love it or love it, good luck to you, but this is strictly cardboard cut film for the non-demanding. It is a missed opportunity because there is a real pathos and cuteness in Bobby's story and this film fails to complete it.
