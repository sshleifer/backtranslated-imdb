For a film that has achieved so much recognition and evaluation, this "Rosemarys Baby" spinoff is a big mistake. He begins to say that Andrew / Adrian whatever his name is because he is so confused that he no longer knows who escapes from a cult with his mother and is soon kidnapped by a strange lady who ends up taking care of him as if she were his mother. The acting is terrible when Andrew grows twenty years old and looks terrible with his sunken face, without ceasing to smile and the clothes of Dukes of Hazard seem more like a drunk than Satan's son. In fact, all he does is drink and fall on himself in a rambling way as he tries to confront his past and the last memory of his mother running away on a bus screaming at him. Find a friend who looks like an angel, but is quickly killed and thrilled in a hilly scene that looks more like a Christmas tree. Andrew is captured and the cult with the members of the first part tests him to see if he is really the Son of Satan. His fool does not pass the test and gets up from the gleaming altar with myme makeup and night club stage jumps and dances like a clown on a crack !!! This scene is memorable and worth watching. The ending is terrible and rather predictable considering how stupid it is in the whole movie. Don't look at this piece of junk or you'll lose respect for the first part.
