The only thing more full of holes than the premise of this film is the script. Flatliners is the ideal showcase for the glorious, flamboyant, blatant lack of talent of Joel Schumacher. The plot is totally illogical but super-fake-ponderosa and everything is directed by the artist in an inch of his life in the most banal and overheated way. I love how the autopsy room of the medical school is a marble cavern-vaulted mausoleum illuminated in red with huge Rembrandt paintings hanging on the walls. I love how Keifer Sutherland drives an army jeep with the canvas. No one in Joel Schumacher's films lives in a non-eccentric way. It is always an alternative universe in which everyone is young and painfully trendy, but rather, strictly and obsessively, according to an idea of ​​middle-aged, middle-aged hip-hop man and child. And holy shit! The part where Brother Baldwin n. 16 dies and comes back to life and then is haunted by all the women he slept with "I call you" and "I just need space" is the funniest thing in the universe world !!!! What kind of world do we live in where Joel Schumacher manages to keep making people make money for him? "Flatliner" made me want to review the entire work of man solely for the type of high quality yuks it contains.
