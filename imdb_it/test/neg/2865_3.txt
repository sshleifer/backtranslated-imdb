I enjoyed a lot of GÃ©rard Depardieu films and I expect this film to appeal to me much more than I do. The main reason is that I didn't find the movie very interesting or fun, so I didn't care. Also, even if he doesn't sleep with his stubborn daughter, the idea that she's lying telling everyone he's his much older lover is just crazy! Yes, I know there is no incest and I know no one around them knows that he really is his father, but I found that every child who passes his father while his sexual lover is too crappy and prevents the movie from being really funny . Also, I didn't really like this little brat. Apart from his lies, he seemed very impertinent and self-involved. I would have preferred if she had somehow got her "come-uppance" and somehow been punished, as she simply didn't like it.
