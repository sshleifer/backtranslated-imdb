First of all, I would like to make it clear that I voluntarily submit to watching terrible films. I saw what I thought was the worst of the worst. In my mind, the films could not be worse than those of the likes of D.E.B.S., Leprechaun 6: Back 2 Tha Hood and Terror Storm. Until I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> The Pirate Movie, without any exaggeration, is the WORST MOVIE IN THE WORLD. I was informed before observing that the film was, indeed, terrible, but I did not believe the accusations. Believe me when I tell you that this film is simply an abomination for the cinema. <br /> <br /> Start with a 3-minute clip of a pirate boat apparently in the middle of a battle with themselves. "The End" splashes on the screen. Unfortunately, it's not the real end of the film. The film is about an unpopular, awkwardly nerdy girl named Mabel who carries a ghetto blaster and is attracted by ambitious homosexual pirate boys. She drowns and has an overly drawn hallucination in which she plays a poorly dressed skank who falls in love with Frederic, who has just come down from the ocean. He could actually be homosexual. The Pirate King has a tang studded with rubies and diamonds. Play and squeak when you hold it. <br /> <br /> There is song in this film. You might get the impression that this is a hilarious musical. It is not. Trust me. They are the worst songs you have ever heard, and at the end of the first original piece you will be looking for objects to pierce your eardrums. <br /> <br /> There are "references" to other films in Here. With references, of course, I mean "obvious cheating". The inclusion of Indiana Jones, Inspector Clouseau and the lightsaber were, in effect, anti-hilarious. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is, in its best moments, painful to listen to. The direction is staggering, and at some point you can see the platform in the scene, which is not very well hidden. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if there is also the shadow of curiosity in your mind about this film, get rid of it. There are times when people want to see how bad something really is, but this movie is not worth it. Put it completely out of your mind and forget about it. If you have your mental capacity at heart, then I beg you, NEVER ALWAYS LOOK AT THIS FILM.
