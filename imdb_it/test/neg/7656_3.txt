This film is not a bit ugly. It's not even bad. It's horrible. You know you're in trouble when Charo appears in a movie. He must have had the "Love Boat" week. George Kennedy, at least he's a player - he's there to try. Actually, he's fine. And it's nice to see Martha Raye. Jimmie Walker is fine. There is a slightly better acting than the '75 Airport, but which film does not have a better acting than the '75 Airport? One thing I liked about this movie is that it has had more than other catastrophic films in terms of plot. At least they made an attempt at subplots. What really hurts this movie are the special effects - ugh! Not too special if you ask me. This is the kind of movie that is really, really fun at 2am if you had fun with your friends and you're looking for something to laugh about.
