I didn't even watch the whole movie. Now, I like the sci-fi movies of the 1950s even when they are extremely inaccurate, but that just annoyed me. First, a crew member on the spaceship speaks and behaves as if he had reached the tenth year. Looks like he should be on a bowling team, not in a spaceship. Outside the spaceship window the crew is marveling at the Earth and this tit says "Can you see Brooklyn?" and another boy says "Sure". And the tit says "Damn, I wonder who's throwing?" Forgive me for a moment, I think my sides are splitting. <br /> <br /> When they stand up in orbit for the first time, the tit says "The moon is just to watch! Bring me back down! Watch the crew while it makes outstretched mouths and scream from the accelerating G forces during takeoff is not even one of the best moments of the film. (Perhaps the best moment of the film can be identified by a large "THE END" on the screen.) <br /> <br /> We also discover that they cannot open the door because " the breast "anointed him before he took off. Of course, a spacecraft will be" fattened "by a crew member, who we will later learn he never had even a space suit and knows nothing about zero gravity. As he told Baby Huey the fat and overgrown duck of the comic, "It seems logical!" The effects of weightlessness in space are so ugly that it is painful to watch. (Everyone knows that, in the absence of gravity, everything tends to rise.) < br /> <br /> How this movie gets 6.3 stars out of 10 when other movies of superior quality are no longer valid, it is a mystery to me. I really like old science fiction movies, but this isn't realistic, and the lame attempts at humor in the characters by throwing that scene from a gas station don't work at all - it ruins the movie. I think in retrospect it's not the whole film that I hate as much as the fact that "the breast" is so obviously not someone who would be on a spaceship - not even to "fatten the hatch". OMG. I wonder if he even checked fan belts. Maybe if they left the "boob" out of the trip, it wouldn't be HERE so atrocious. Even so, it's only average. What everyone else is excited about, I don't know. <br /> <br /> Want to see a space movie from the 1950s? 'Rocketship X-M' beats everything for hell. Perhaps not so much "realism" but a more serious story and less stupid characters.
