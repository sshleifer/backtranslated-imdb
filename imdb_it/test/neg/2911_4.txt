The pro-American war movie propaganda that came out in 1942 has the East Side Kids becoming tough against any Japanese who sight in their neighborhood when they learn that they are too young to enlist. Eventually they learn that they were mistaken in their distrust of some individuals, but it also happens to come across an espionage ring that they then decided to bust. The film is quite harmless in its fashion, although some may be offended by the fact that innocent Asians were actually identified during World War II. Overall, however, it is a fairly general effort and both Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall will have better moments, the best of which tend to come here when they advertise.
