Before starting to rip this film, you point it out - I LOVE THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. That story is one of the best romantic adventures ever written. The movie that stares Jane Gray is very good and the Broadway musical is the most exciting thing. So, I thought that when I heard that this movie was coming out it would be nice since it was a BBC movie. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, it was a weak, totally stupid story that failed to capture the wonderful story. <br /> <br /> There were no exciting escapes with daring disguises. There was no deep love that made your heart beat as Percy left the room and Marguerite sighed as her husband left her again. <br /> <br /> All he had was a confusing plot and a lot of out-of-the-sexual development and violence. <br /> <br /> Sink me! What a horrible movie! <br /> <br />
