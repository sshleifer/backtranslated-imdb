I was forced to watch this movie for my Reigonal World Geography course. This movie is what's wrong with America today, instead of finding the best way to get out of difficult situations or situations we rather complain about how it's someone else's fault. This film crosses the fall of Flint, Michigan and attributes it 100% to General Motors. In doing so, Moore does everything he can to make General Motors executives wicked just because they are doing their job in a capitalist society. Moore projects several evictions throughout the film and does not even ask once if the person is evicted due to a dismissal of GM. Also, never interview the owners of the filmed tenants. Moore does everything to distort historical events to fit his political agenda in this pure propaganda film.
