I was ready to hate it, but it turned out to be surprisingly tolerable - although MTV's cinematic style (shot on DV, to boot) is rather painful! I liked the self-deprecating style of the script, as well as his central idea of ​​bringing the female vampire to double as a contract killer. As for the cast, Eileen Daly (better known as the "star" of those horrible introductions of "Redemption") has an undeniable presence on the screen - and is rather sensual, despite her age; however, Christopher Adamson's criminal leader is hateful. David Warbeck has a brief role as a doctor (nicknamed "The Horror-Movie Man"!) Who conducts an autopsy on one of the vampire's victims; the film seems to have taken a long time to shoot while Warbeck died in 1997! There is a lot of nudity and violence at hand, but it doesn't make much sense (especially because the subplot involving a secret vampire society that infiltrates power structures is barely developed); the film is too long for its purpose, and eventually slips into tedium during the last half hour.
