well, what can i say. WHAT F ** K? There's really not much to say about this, really. The only way you'd like it is if you, like me, are like a bad horror to laugh at. <br /> <br /> ACTING - VERY INCONVENTIVE! Just look at the last scene with the main actresses running! Texas rip off CHAINSAW MASSACRE! but in a bad way! Just awful! <br /> Gore - Really not credible. In one scene they use one of those knives that have a cut part that fits a body part etc. Using this, with the addition of red ketchup, his alleged 2 looks real, although in reality it is not. br /> <br /> Plot predictable "Children get lost in the woods on weekend camping" ripped off from Friday 13. <br /> <br /> Quality Killer Mask-scary if you're afraid of clowns, a bit Incredible that someone would choose this as their costume anyway. The director obviously realized that all the good costumes had been used in all the other horror film films out there. <br /> <br /> TOTAL- 3/10 * / ***** ps- stay away from CAMP BLOOD II, that made the LORD OF THE RINGS look like.
