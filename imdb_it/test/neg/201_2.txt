This film, despite the list of B, C and D celebrities, is a complete 90-minute waste. The plot, with its few peaks, was very predictable. He was so foolish that I can't believe he's taking the time to write a review. Flex, to his credit, has grown in his ability to act since he played Michael Jackson in a TV movie a few years ago. Tangi, on the other hand, regressed, as she had more talent in the role of Felicity's scholar some years ago. As I sat and watched this movie train, with its pitiful production and the horrible sound quality, four other words came to mind to qualify what I thought of this film. However, in an attempt to keep my writings G Rated, I will simply say that this film is another four-letter word that starts with an L. LAME !!!
