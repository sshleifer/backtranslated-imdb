The main problems of "Saw" are related to the tremendous screenwriting errors that only an uncritical spectator will do nothing but obviate. The main question is what is the purpose of the killer in his lying on the floor? The film tries to show that the killer's purpose is to cause harm and destruction to his victims, he loves to play with other people's lives and feel the control over their fears and weaknesses. So why does he just pretend to be dead between the two main characters? An incredible improbability: can a man pretend to have died for more than an hour or two without moving a single muscle or even without breathing so as not to be discovered by two men in the same room? It makes no sense except to be the final effect (d) of the film. The killer always seems to have control over the plot and if he is lying like a corpse this may not be possible. In the end, it doesn't work. The right place for the killer should have been a darker and untouchable shadow behind the false shadow (the nurse), but not the floor of the white room. The director should not have shown the face of the murderer and perhaps the site where he is hidden. So the film would be a good thriller. However, "Saw" is just a fiasco. Hitchcock, please, come back.
