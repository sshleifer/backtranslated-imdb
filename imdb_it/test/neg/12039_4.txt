They show that police officers, when they can't find the real culprits, always blame their parents and accuse them of sexual abuse of their children. These films always represent the press as a pack of animals and have parents coming out of the court to feed the hunger of the press to humiliate the pain. Has anyone ever heard of a back door in these films? Here, you have a psychic who tells them exactly what happened and WHERE the body can be found, but the police are not informed and no one listens to his findings. <br /> <br /> The police are portrayed as a scapegoat that you don't know what they are doing and there is always an external detective, like Ed Asner, who arrives late on the case, believes in the parents and solves the mystery. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, after the parents were released, they did not spit in the face of the stupid police who put them in prison, took their child away and accused them of killing their own child . It looked like I had seen this movie many times before.
