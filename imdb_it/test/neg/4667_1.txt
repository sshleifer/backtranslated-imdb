<br /> <br /> I liked some of the 80s Hollywood action movies. They had icons like Arnie and Sly, but I think the action movie of the 1990s collapsed to new depths. The worst of these, I believe, was Armageddon. <br /> <br /> The plot is shamelessly invented and brings out the worst clich√©s as it tries to excite the spectators. The melodrama is so lousy and mushy that you can't really expect Bruce Willis to disappear from the screen. Liv Tyler, who had acted admirably in several independent films directed by masters like Bernardo Bertolucci and Robert Altman, unfortunately decided to jump on the commercial bandwagon. This film symbolizes the new Hollywood aesthetic of great special effects and precious little dialogues or authentic melodrama. This is the norm these days and I start to wonder if there is a role in Hollywood for writers. It seems that they only use hacks and committees to write easy scripts. The rest starts with technology. There is not a single piece of great human emotion felt in Armageddon. It just looks empty and tasteless. I can only think of one positive aspect of this film and this concerns Liv Tyler's father who does not even make an appearance in the film. The band of Steven Tyler, Aerosmith, provides an acronym for the film - a ballad that really stands out and at least tows the strings of the heart a little when the closing credits arrive. <br /> <br /> I cry for Western civilization if people like this film are predictable and cumbersome. It is synonymous with superficiality, lethargy and a decline of the human intellect. I'd rather even watch the eighth Friday 13th.
