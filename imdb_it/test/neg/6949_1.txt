Terrible, waste of time. There is no field or value of garbage in this. I saw the best amateur films made by 10-12 year olds in cinema clubs. <br /> <br /> Why can anyone ruin a movie about vampires and lesbians? <br /> <br /> It's not a movie to put together some vampire / sadomasochist enthusiasts in the same room and just shoot it. <br /> <br /> I didn't find anything good in the film. There was no plot, no real actor, no real special effect, no humor. Some overweight Goths touching each other cannot be called sex scenes. Not at all. <br /> <br /> Well, the graveyard was nice but you should shoot a vampire movie in the dark. <br /> <br /> The purpose was probably good: create a trash movie in a spirit of Ed Wood. The problem is that you can't intentionally make a bad movie. It takes talent and an effort to make a "real" film. Ed Wood could miss the money, but he certainly had an effort. These guys lacked everything. Ed Wood was a genius over these guys.
