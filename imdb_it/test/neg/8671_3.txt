This was just a TV show here in the United States. Others have commented on the loyalty (or lack thereof) of the novel; the 1983 BBC version is far superior to this and all other aspects. Given the purpose of the novel, it should not have been condensed to 85 minutes. The key sections must be rushed or hinted or omitted; there is barely enough time to enter the chronology of events, so the development of the character must be sacrificed: we cannot make much sense of who the people are, which deprives us of what makes Austen so great. <br /> <br /> One of the main criticisms for me was the cinematography, which I thought was simply horrible and quite literally disgusting. The camera constantly performs ultra-close-ups and swirls in circles. Perhaps on a small TV it is OK, but on our 40 "hi-def screen it was so dizzying that both my wife and I had to look away from the set repeatedly (my stock of Dramamine was over) this distracted me from the lackluster I'm-just-reading-what-in-the-script acting (isolated scenes are well done, but not enough to save things). <br /> <br /> Adding the score so far in Complete lotteries JA: I would rate "Northanger Abbey" a success, thanks to the superior management and production values ​​(and the story lends itself better to a short treatment), "Persuasion" OK (even if it is not the same as the other versions, with the condensation new guilty), both far ahead of this attempt, I hope better in the two remaining novels in this Digest Jane Austen of TV Reader, like others, I'm grateful they left P & P alone!
