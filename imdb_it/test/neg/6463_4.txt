One Thursday evening at 10:00 pm, my local subsidiary in the west of ABC broadcast the pilot episode of "Northern Exposure". The ABC Network usually broadcasts "Men In Trees" in that time slot but the program was anticipated for a live sporting event. <br /> <br /> Although both shows are set in Alaska and filmed in the Pacific Northwest (Washington State Exhibition, Trees in Vancouver, BC), review "Northern Exposure" (as well as some episodes of "Sex and the City ") reminds me of how disappointed I am from the hybrid hybrid" Men in Trees ". <br /> <br /> Anne Heche can be a good actress with the right material. Unfortunately his role as a writer who ends up in a small town in Alaska gets on my nerves. Perhaps because I feel that Heche is miscible, I am not convinced of his "caught out of water" character. <br /> <br /> I also can't help thinking that the supporting cast fits the typical stereotypes. The appealing-looking venue, the friendly bar owner, the bush driver, the local police officers, the dim but well-intentioned radio DJ, etc. <br /> <br /> The only stereotype that could have been broken was the teddy bear and the veteran "ER" actor Abraham Benrubi as the local bartender in love with two different women. Considering that one of the executive producers is the director James Mangold, (his films "Heavy" and "Cop Land" had leading characters who were great men) so it doesn't surprise me why Benrubi was chosen in a non-typical role. > <br /> However, I can understand why there are many dedicated viewers who love "Men in Trees". It adapts to the eccentric niche for television audiences. I wanted the show to find its own voice instead of borrowing ideas from better shows.
