There is something wonderful about a "revenge" movie. Everyone wakes up in the morning believing they are the star of the "movie" and that anyone who interferes with their personal program is somehow the enemy. Revenge plot films work especially well if a person has low self-esteem. Rather than reacting at this time, the "hero" attracts the inner anxiety built to engage in a single act of power in an attempt to restore balance. Quite naturally, in the "real world" this kind of revenge rarely alleviates tension because life is not a film; after the revenge has been decreed, the actions taken have their consequences. Good revenge helps people ignore this bitter pill. In the films the credits have been resolved and all responsibilities have been resolved. <br /> <br /> "Swimming With Sharks" is advertised as a comedy, no doubt an act by the producers to understand how to sell this oddity. It's dark, but it's not a dark comedy ("Company Of Men" and Todd Solondz's works are very close). Some parts of the film are so brutal that they go back to the "torture-porn" genre that everyone is so obsessed with ("Saw", "Hostel"). There are some laughs. There is also laughter in "Saving Private Ryan", but it is not a labeled comedy. <br /> <br /> The intrinsic problem with this film is that it has not earned its case of revenge. Apparently it is a young man who is abused by his boss and eventually leads his boss hostage to "repay him" for all the mistreatment. The hero (rightly called "Guy") is an "ordinary man", so vague that we literally know nothing about him ... what does he do with his free time? Do you have friends / family? How did he get where he is? What are his interests (this becomes a recurring motif in the film, undoubtedly inspired by the same struggle as the author of the film ... "What do you want?", The answer to which we are denied a vague trick of an ending)? It is very difficult to take care of such a character, even if it worked well (even Tom Hanks becomes a creep in the wrong shot, like "Punchline"). Kevin Spacey in the role of the boss, "Buddy", should be a monster but he is too charismatic as an actor. The best laughs came when he abused his assistant - he seemed almost surprised how much the audience probably is in what Guy will suffer. When Kevin's character is tortured, the sight suddenly becomes empathy for him. Guy is suddenly filmed as a monstrous monster without rationality. At this point every message of the author has been lost; there is no "hero" in this film, ergo, there is no reason to worry at all. <br /> <br /> It is not a way to suppose that this story is based on the author's problematic career in the world of cinema. I worked for a similar leader and can guarantee that it is not so far-fetched. I had similar fantasies to satisfy the desires at that time and I thought I was justified. I thought you could conquer the most beautiful woman in history (in reality, the ONLY woman - it seems that there are all four people in the universe of this film) just to be your greedy and naive ego, that enthusiasm he won awards and a boss abused you because he was a bad person. Time and tides have revealed the truth that most "monsters" are really only the demons of an individual's personal psyche and resentment is usually based on the self. As the film points out, if Guy were so unhappy, he had to leave. The film offers no second thoughts, despite the "surprise" conclusion. We still don't know anything about the protagonists, we can't even be sure that everything they said is actually based and everyone magically manages to have his cake and eat it too. In short, there was no point in this story except to emphasize that (shock!) The film business can be quite brutal. <br /> <br /> There are many good films that tell solid and satisfying revenge style fantasies, both the variety of well-being ("9-to5", "The working girl", "The devil wears Prada") and not so much ("War Of The Roses", the remake of "The Hills Have Eyes"). This is not one of them - despite a fun turn of Benicio Del Toro in the role of Emily Blunt from "Prada" and some interesting works by Spacey and Michelle Forbes, this is a frustrating, bad, confusing and slightly boring self-indulgence by a director who has, hopefully, "worked everything out" by now ...
