They did it again: ripped off the title of an old show, then destroyed nostalgia with boring "re-imagined" stuff. The 1960s cartoon was one of the most enjoyable of his time, a good-natured satire of super hero comics. The character was drawn halfway between animal and human, like Mickey Mouse. Here they use a real beagle; it's almost like making a Mickey Mouse watch with a real mouse. <br /> <br /> Most of the clever ingenuity that made the original show fun is missing from this movie. Instead, we get a clumsy ex-cop who is even more stupid than Cad. And some pet owners who don't add anything to the story. Cheese effects (the talking animation with the dog is embarrassing). Poor script. A stereotypical dwarf who plays Simon Bar Sinister. The type of person with the jay they hired to give Underdog a voice is painful. You would think that at least they would have obtained an impressionist of the voice to approximate the humorously distinctive voice of Wally Cox for Underdog. But no. There are at least some affectionate references to the original material (such as rhyme lines), which raise it to 4. <br /> <br /> Only small children who love dogs can enjoy this. Everyone else should get a DVD of the original cartoon series. Look at this only in despair.
