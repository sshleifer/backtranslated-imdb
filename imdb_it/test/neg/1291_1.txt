I registered on IMDb solely for the purpose of warning others about this film. Has anyone ever received funding for projects like this? This is the mystery. Goodbye to Harry could be the worst movie ever, except that I tried to erase the others that rival this blathering idiocy. The wrong plot, the unbelievable logic flows everywhere. I can't spoil this movie for you by revealing everything that will make your experience less enjoyable. There is nothing funny about this movie. I have the CD and I'll send it to you for free, it's so bad. First come, only served. If I know you, this offer is nothing, because I wouldn't do this movie on anyone, not on purpose. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
