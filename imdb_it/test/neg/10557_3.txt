How come so many talented or at least charismatic actors end up in this dance? Nothing is very good in this film, but the worst things are probably the script and the direction. <br /> <br /> Apparently this is the heart of director Damian Niemans, since it is both written and directed (and he also acted). He is himself a card magician and seems to have named characters in homage to other famous magicians. This was his first feature film as far as I know, and probably his last. <br /> <br /> Is it difficult to indicate exactly what makes him so poor? but I would say that the story and the character are not credible (the script) and that the direction does not give it any boost (the director). Plus ?? poker scenes are bad in the worst way in Hollywood (super-hands, Hollywood rules)! The alleged twists of the film are totally predictable or totally unbelievable. They end up tying a knot to a story that at best can be described as "some decent scenes"!
