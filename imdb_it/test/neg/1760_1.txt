I had to write a review for this film after seeing it last night and read some of the comments from people trying to classify the grief of this movie in wfmitchell's post)). I don't fit any of those classifications. The other classification that must be on the list is 5) people didn't like this film because it wasn't good. I found the film to be booring and forced. My wife chose it to show us why she is a huge Kidman fan and also likes Jude Law. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Law, it took me a long time and a huge amount of suspicion of belief for me to believe in his southern accent. I can't help but wonder if they didn't make his character less talkative on purpose, so we shouldn't hear that tortured accent so much. <br /> <br /> As for the film, it took a long time before it became interesting (about 1 or 1.5 hours), and then it fell flat in its final. The interesting thing is that I didn't know that this film was directed by Minghella. About 40 minutes into the movie, I asked my wife "this won't be another real English patient?" He absolutely was. <br /> <br /> Regarding the battle scenes. I'm trying to think of a word to describe the scene of the opening battle, but I think the most descriptive word that accurately describes is simply "stupid". He was forced, he was incredible, he was stupid and he was stupid. (After the battle I looked at my wife and asked "was he really stupid?" To which she nodded his head vigorously). <br /> <br /> The only bright spot in the film was the Zellweger performance. The role was a little more than that of any major role in the comedy, but it worked. From his way of talking, from his walk, from his mannerisms and especially his little jokes (my favorite: "If you want to have 3 feet in the ass all you have to do is listen to the boyfriends talking to each other"), has been able to create an almost cartoon-like character who did his job extremely well. <br /> <br /> I just didn't like this movie and I have to ask myself what kind of people say they like it (or the English patient). I suspect you could classify them into a category: 1) soap opera fans
