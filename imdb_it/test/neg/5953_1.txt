Horrible, horrible, horrible show. The questions of the "real world" dealt with blatant originality. Stereotypes galore. What the hell is going on with African-American (black!) Guys? Power Tyrone! Horrible show, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible. The fact that it lasted three seasons is a beggar's belief. This show is really perfect for intellectuals who accept mediocrity. <br /> <br /> Saved by the bell almost seemed fun compared to this. Well, in hindsight, no. It is of the same banal type and therefore equally lacking in intelligence. The only thing missing so far is the message of Jesus is GOD. The mentality and liberation is the same, yet somehow it feels evil and soulless. You can almost hear TV executives buzzing words against each other. In fact I felt so irritated at this excremental existence show, I felt compelled to comment. <br /> <br /> Horrible, horrible, horrible show.
