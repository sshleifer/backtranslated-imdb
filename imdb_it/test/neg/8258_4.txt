In "Red Letters", Coyote is at the vortex of a university professor who writes to an inmate and gets more than he wanted. There are two reasons to watch this movie ... Kinski is one and Piven the other, although it is difficult for their sparks to shine in such a complete directorial disaster. Everything is wrong with "Red Letters" ... a complicated script, a bad one, a camera, editing and above all acting that is sub-part of the Coyote, etc. Battersby has taken a story with potential and turned it into a serious and amateur film not worth the time.
