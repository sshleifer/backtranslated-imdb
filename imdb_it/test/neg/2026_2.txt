The initial voice sounds like "The Wind" could be a rather intriguing film, but as the story unfolded I knew it was downhill from there. The most important things about this film were the terrible acting works of all the main characters, (except for some scenes that involved Mic's inner turmoil), there was a total lack of character development and absolutely no point in the plot - What were the writers thinking? <br /> <br /> Michael Mongillo has won 2 horror / sci fi awards for "The Wind". EH? What was so scary about this movie? ANYTHING! Except for the 2 video footage of the evil resident, the rest was more than a 'made for the t.v' thriller - it shouldn't even have been changed. If you want a much better film about the "Shallow Grave" rent of "murder among friends". <br /> <br /> 'The Wind' * / *****
