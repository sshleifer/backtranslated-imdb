I should have known better ... the clues were on IMDB.com. This film was written and directed by the same boy who has no precedent. The cast is a group of strangers with the possible exception of Joe Estevez who seems to specialize in bad films. Etc. Suffice it to say that I see no reason why anyone would want to see this horrible, amateurish attempt to make a film. Activate any broadcast channel at 3:00 and you'll see better movies. Nuff said.
