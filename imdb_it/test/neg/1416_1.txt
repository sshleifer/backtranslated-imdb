How is it possible to make such a bad film with such actors? Were they forced to do so? The plot has nothing to do with an idea of ​​how things would have gone if a comedian were presidential candidate. They don't even try to give an impression. Just when you thought you were seeing a commentary by famous liberals on Washington DC politics (the first five minutes), the film runs off track and in the B-movie drama on 1) a computer voting error, 2) the semi-legal evil regulars who wants to cover it with the most original lines in history, and 3) a neurotic but extremely cute female programmer who tries to tell the next president. Soon she will be the victim of the evil gentlemen of the X-Files computer company, who - instead of killing her - drug her to make her seem unreliable. But when she gets to Washington, she doesn't tell him. Indeed, the film changes from the B-film drama to the idiotic B-film-love-drama. So far, we are so far from the original starting point of the film, that many people turn it off. I almost did it. If only it could be INTELLIGENT to love drama, but no! It is not! It's the kind of "oops I'm so nervous that I'm always stupid, so please love me for this" -kind of love drama. All with a slow and slow rhythm, which has nothing to do with the political plot of the film, with the plot of the film's X-files or with the comedy plot of the film. All the graphs fail at all levels, which every annoying bit of meaningless dialogue reminds you of. The amorous part must be the result of deciding during a binge drinking "hello, there must be a dynamic of love between the presidential candidate and the extremely gracious programmer, yes, that will work! Attack it there!" br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Lewis Black is castrated and placed in a role where not a single Lewis Black line comes out. Lewis Black's anger is replaced by the hope that it can emerge in the film, which he never does. And Christopher Walken is thrown into a hospital with heart problems, to duplicate the dramatic effect of the heart attack of the President's closest aid to Westwing. Watching Christopher Walken being castrated as Lewis Black in roles that constantly struggle uphill to look casual and Westwing-ish, but fail as Titanic every time, is like watching a big blue whale dying on a beach. Heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> And then, enter the lowest point of the whole film: raises the incredibly complicated ethical question: should Robin Williams become president, knowing he was elected because of a computer glitch? The American Dream And All Good prevails while lowering the presidency live on TV, as Lassie would do. With the usual patriotic charm of the Presidency and the so boring atmosphere we are creating the historical atmosphere that Westwing cultivated in abundant quantities over the next few million years. <br /> <br /> the director and screenwriter, Barry Levinson, is now on my personal list of writers and directors. I've always been away. This film must be seen as a symptom of a faulty production process, in which people (including Barry Levinson) have had to spend money on production because of their personal relationships and not their abilities. This is a project designed to satisfy the career desire of low-skilled people, and the aforementioned great actors have been induced to participate. This is the only explanation that can be there. <br /> <br /> PS: The voting error on computers was due to double letters in Dobbs, Kellogs and Mills. Of course it was, what else could it be when you write a script and you can't tell a computer from a dishwasher.
