In the third part of "Left Behind" the producers did not bother to put ANY KIND OF CONTINUITY in the plot. Although all the weapons on the planet have been confiscated by the United Nations, World War III suddenly begins at the snap of a finger. Within seconds the ex-lover of one of the main protagonists moves from passionately seducing him to pure hatred to a melancholy confession of love without any trace of direction. <br /> <br /> But above all this film is really an area without irony. After the president of the United States accepts Jesus as his savior, he immediately becomes a suicide bomber and blows up a skyscraper in the city center. Osama Bin Laden will be very jealous when he sees this movie!
