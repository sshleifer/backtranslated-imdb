I saw this movie last night at the Berlinale as part of the competition. It was announced as the "world premiere" of the film by the host (although it seems that people here have seen it before). I have to say that I don't know what to do with the film yet. I am not familiar with the book, I bought the ticket only two hours before and I only had a limited knowledge of the plot. Not enough, as it seems, since I had trouble getting into the film. The film is sometimes told by the character of Jones, but somehow that perspective didn't suit me. And I can't really tell if some of the laughs that the movie got were calculated or not. The cuts were abrupt and disruptive, the scenes seemed somehow slapped and the narration didn't always make sense immediately (even if the supernatural parts are excluded) - the actors were really good but somehow they couldn't save the film. It was fun but sometimes just in the sense that I sat there thinking about the technical details of the film and what went wrong with that. I still don't know what kind of mood the director wanted the film to have. It was a strange mixture of light, darkness, supernatural. Unfortunately it didn't attract me at all and I preferred to look at it with a technical eye. But thinking about what's wrong with a movie while you watch it is the best sign that a movie has somehow failed. I would certainly have expected something else with these actors involved ... too bad!
