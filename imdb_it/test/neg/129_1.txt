I can't explain what a load of junk this movie is. How really I can't. it's just so ugly. <br /> <br /> plot = crap acting = crap budget = so low it's ridiculous <br /> <br /> Jesus, it's like the only good thing about this movie is the fact that the main character was pretty hot . <br /> <br /> The only people I hear, who think this film is good, are the ones who took part in the film. I'm sure they didn't finance it because there is no money put into it. (HAHAhaha to the point where the heads shave) <br /> <br /> This movie has already wasted too much of my life, so I won't waste any more time writing my review for it.
