This film was very disappointing and, except for a few moments, it wasn't flying at all. More than anything else, he was simply stupid. The music was bad and the plot took place like a BYU bowling game ?? very predictable (avoiding the embarrassment with the score, a burst of touchdown delayed play, a rally that falls shortly and leads to a loss). In essence, the half-childish / half-ingenuous Will (the film's fetcher) and his confused brother Danny (we'll simply call him a Democrat), treat Kirby (the movie "Sweet Spirit"), the 3rd member of their unfortunate " boy band "by Mormon," like a shit until the man and the father's figure in the film (the stage director, Jill) talks with Will and straightens him. Probably, Will's personality changes 180 degrees and he is immediately the mature and conscious leader of the band.This would be a nice, maybe funny, 10 minute concert, but the fact that the film lasts 93 minutes really sucks your life if you look at it until the end. the money you would normally spend to rent this show and burn it in your fireplace or throw it in the toilet more fun with much less effort.If you want to see a better film of the same genre, take Santi and Soldati ?? not a comedy but a show infinitely nautical miles hours (actually, Kirby has more fun things in the saints than he does in SOP).
