I saw this movie and all I can say is this ... I am not a film student, nor am I a bit of an artistic intellect trying to look for a deeper meaning in everything I don't understand. However, if I had to do it with this movie, my thoughts would be ... <br /> <br /> Yes! He's addicted and now I can imagine ... he was stumbling one night and he sat with his friends laughing and saying things like that, hey ... wouldn't it be funny if the nuns really wanted to fly? What if one of them just fell off a plane and fell for a while, bounced off the ground and got up and left? * noises * or if buckwheat gave the pope a bath? oh my god, I'm just kidding you thinking about it! Guy! We have to make a movie about it! And then he tells his friend while he's laughing ... Oh and wouldn't it be funny if people loved him and called me a genius for it? So for me, this is what happens when a guy does too much drug and writes a script and produces a movie. I should have done LSD to figure out what this guy was thinking, so could I even laugh? Because I have to tell you, I wasn't laughing. I was yawning and checking time. <br /> <br /> I think that anyone is trying to find a deeper meaning is hysterical. I had never heard of this director until I came to read the reviews, which I did because I was upset about losing the last 2 hours, or how long it had been (I felt 12 hours of my life) and I can never get it back, anyway ... I read that this guy is a heroin addict and wanted to die for art ?? what the hell is that? So my point is somehow proven. This guy is not all there, he is a drug addict, and his film is the proof ... So please stop trying to find a deeper meaning. If one really wants to understand everything in this film, leave some LSD and sit back and relax, then it might really make sense. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of when I saw the Last Days of Gus Van Sant, another movie I was crazy to watch. I can't help wondering what the ratings for that movie would be if the same people reviewed it. It seems that if the director of the film is totally out of rock, or if it is a French film with sex and subtitles, or if it is a cartoon, it will get good reviews, hands down, anything else is boring and has already been done . BLAH, bring the boring please!
