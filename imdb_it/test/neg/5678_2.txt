I was a big SNL fan at the time of Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd, Gilda Radner and many other memorable stars. But every time I tried watching it in the past more than ten years I was very disappointed and sometimes even disgusted by it. Ten years ago I believed that the show could not survive, since it had become completely devoid of the kind of humor that I could understand, yet it continued to connect, which I always found dismayed, wondering why in the world could find its lame humor nothing funny. Whenever I've tuned myself in the last ten years, I've never been happy to have done it. In fact, I've always been annoyed with myself to stay awake and waste time. For me, the absolute low point came several years ago when I really liked the young popular male actor who was the guest host. At one point, that night, he played a big star, maybe himself, and in the script, the "Mongo" character, I think, played by Chris Kattan, I think again, ended up in the back seat of a car with him. What followed was Mongo being forced up and down and up and down on the actor's knees, with him screaming hysterically as he presumably was sodomized. The audience was laughing out loud and shaking my head, amazed to find it a stranger, amazed that NBC could even broadcast something like that. In the following years I tried several times to get closer to the show with an open mind, hoping that he could regain the clever sense of humor that I loved for so many years. But, until just a week ago, for me, he didn't. Not even close. An exception: during the 2008 presidential campaign, I thought Tina Fey was fantastic, and she was the only one who kept me in tune. But those of Sarah Palin, while they were hysterical, were still not enough to save the rest of the 90 minutes and I would always hate not turning it off as soon as I heard the familiar "It's Saturday night !!!"
