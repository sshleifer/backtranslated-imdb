I suppose I should be honest and point out that I don't believe in ghosts. That being said, I am very interested in the subject and I enjoy a scary story as much as the next. I'm a fan of Ghost Hunters because they at least try to give a scientific point of view to their investigations. Even the first episodes of Most Haunted had a field entertainment factor for them. The paranormal state has none of these qualities. The cases themselves have the potential to be interesting, but as with so much "reality TV" these days, they suffer from overproduction, poor acting and silly scripts. The creators of the show freely admit that writers "guide" the stories. I heard they are going to the shoehorn in a romantic subplot to appeal to the young female demographic. The show also has many other flaws. As others have stated, the narrative quickly becomes like nails in a blackboard. Visual and sound effects quickly become irritating. I am willing to suspend disbelief for fun, but this whole "demon with a vengeance" story is simply ridiculous. Given that the producers of this show are also responsible for brain fodder like MTV Laguna Beach and Newport Harbor, I suppose this is no surprise. If you're a huge fan of Ed & Lorraine Warren or a big "reality" junkie, I guess you'll find a lot to appreciate in Paranormal State. For the rest of us ... I recommend you avoid.
