RKO was trying to increase his actress JOAN FONTAINE when they chose her as a flying nurse, strong enough to force a doctor (JOHN BEAL) to deal with the escape from responsibility in this little programmer. TCM put it on the air as a springboard into Joan Fontaine's career. <br /> <br /> Fontaine is sincere and does an acceptable job, nothing more, and John Beal is ok as his love interest. But it is obvious that PHILIP HUSTON (who has the appearance and the arrogant manner of a young James Garner) is the actor who should have shared the best pay with Fontaine. Whatever happened to this handsome actor? Why didn't RKO promote it, along with Fontaine? He showed the skill of a light comedian. <br /> <br /> These are the kinds of thoughts that came to my mind as I watched this rather lukewarm drama that never lived up to the hard promise of its title. The story itself is rather boring, only occasionally coming to life because of Fontaine's lively heroine. <br /> <br /> He photographs gracefully as the nurse and skilfully wears his serious expressions, suggesting that there was more to be exploited in the future Data. Beal never went into an illustrious career and his performance here shows why. Strictly lackluster. <br /> <br /> But whatever happened to Philip Huston? The proof here is that he should have had a useful film career. <br /> <br /> Note: look at Dwight Frye (from "Dracula") as the out-of-control patient on the plane.
