James Bond film admirable but weak especially because both the hero (Bond) and the villain (Blofeld) have been seriously destroyed. Lazenby is too big and innocent to play Bond. Look and behave more like a good-hearted companion, but of a dark nature, in a police action movie. The director and the writer try to establish his credibility, but his way of saying as "Royal Baluga, North of the ..." is not effective to affirm it as this worldly and sweet scoundrel. Savalas does not do a bad job, but his characterization and behavior are better suited to a mafia gangster. The characters best interpreted in the film are those of Tracy and her father. But the performances of those actors when they share the screen with Lazenby only serve to emphasize his shortcomings as an actor. This film is too long (140 minutes) for a James Bond film and offers no excitement until the Bond mountain escape, where it begins to rise. This film is very hard, but it's not up to it. Many elements of Bondian are present and the climate battle is top notch, but I always have the feeling that something is missing while watching this.
