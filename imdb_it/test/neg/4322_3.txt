SPOILER IN ADVANCE! The mummy (Lon Chaney Jr.) is at liberty in a New England university city in search of a university student (Ramsey Ames) who is the reincarnation of his beloved princess Ananka. Boring, slow (even at 65 minutes - it moves more slowly than the mummy!), It acts indifferently, but it is worth waiting for the ending. Mom takes the girl (!!!!!) and gets old quickly as they both sink slowly into a swamp. This is (I think) the only time in a universal monster movie that the monster took the girl! Apart from that, this is a very amateur night. Probably the worst of the mummy sequels - and this is saying something!
