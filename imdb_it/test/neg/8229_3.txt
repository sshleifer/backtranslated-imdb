This is not a good movie, but it is easily the best Troma Studios film I have ever seen. Lloyd Kaufman - the "brain" behind Troma - doesn't care about a good story or a moderately funny movie. His main concern is to make something bizarre. And his definition of bizarre often reflects my definition of terrible cinema. <br /> <br /> In this film we have the titled character Luther - whose favorite pastime is not baseball, but biting the heads of chickens - receiving his release from the block. The board of directors deemed him rehabilitated, despite the fact that he does not speak - he merely dodges like a chicken - and has a series of razorblade-shaped prostheses at his disposal. Obviously, once Luther was freed, he sued for chaos, first in a grocery store and then on a farm. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$$$ (A lot of violence in this often insipid Slowly, Luther sinks his daggers into a poor old lady waiting for a bus stop and then spends the rest of the film terrorizing the mother and daughter on the farm). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$$$$ (Stacy Haiduk has a noteworthy skin in her photo, as the former Lois Lane (I don't remember which edition of Superman she came from) gives us a scene of shower followed by a romp by bed with her boyfriend - a boy who does not have it I have no problem with Mrs. Haiduk The extended video of the shower scene in the extra DVDs offers the viewer a little more than Stacy, it is rather something). <br /> <br /> STORY: $ (Forgettaboutit !!! Whitey Styles' script could be the worst ever written: the way Luther is released from the asylum throws all the credibility out the window. Ogue is something that a "Pre-schoolers could write and the actions he writes for his characters border on the absurd. It is as if Styles has spent ten years without human contact and has completely forgotten how people react in certain situations." <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$ (The film belongs to Edward Terry who actually does a decent job as a Geek. It's rather threatening in a stupid backyard manner, while Joan Roth as a mother does a super job in support but Haiduk and her boyfriend's lack of chemistry made their roles embarrassing at best).
