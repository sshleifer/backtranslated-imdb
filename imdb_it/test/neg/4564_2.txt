I usually love teen / high school genre movies, but this film really lacked originality. The only premise that this film has is four friends who cheated in high school and the tension it puts on their friendship. There is not enough depth in the story or in the characters to keep the viewers' attention throughout the film. The acting is not so bad, even if the actors don't really have a lot to work because the dialogue is tripe and clich√© '... After seeing this film, one has to ask why a producer could run into a project like this and thinks: "I MUST do this movie". No wonder it wasn't possible to get a film version. Andrew Gurland is a hack, avoid or burn.
