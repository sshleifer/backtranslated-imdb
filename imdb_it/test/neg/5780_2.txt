Alexandra Maria Lara: A very beautiful and seductive woman, but not a good actress. In all the movies where I saw her, she looks like the exact same character. Whether it's DOWNFALL, NACKT, VOM SUCHEN UND FINDEN DER LIEBE and now WO IST FRED! She is always (acting?) The young woman with a good heart, who is a little naive and does not know how to handle the things that happen to her. He has a repertoire of probably five different facial expressions with which he works abundantly. Personally I have difficulty believing that he could play a mysterious and slightly hateful character because he is not here. So she's typified as the beautiful girl next door, which is her, but, once again, she can't smell when it comes to acting. Til Schweiger: same thing! The film: definitely stupid. Since it was an American film, it would have been a great role for Adam Sandler, who I don't even like. I was not offended by the fact that it is a film with handicapped people, I just thought that the jokes that followed were not funny at all. I giggled two or three times, but when I was halfway through, I was just bored and bored and wanted to finish this movie.
