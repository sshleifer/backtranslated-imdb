"A bored TV director is introduced to the black arts and astral projection by his girlfriend, learning the ability to separate his spirit from his body, man finds a renewed interest in his life and a sense of well-being. He is sleeping, his spirit leaves his body and his uncontrolled body roams the streets in a murderous fury ", according to the synopsis of the DVD cover. <br /> <br /> The synopsis is not entirely correct, as it turns out. <br /> <br /> However, the film opens with a dizzying example of "out of the body" by handsome director Winston Rekert (like Paul Sharpe), just discovered from the "astral body" experience; it also prefigures an imminent duel. The young Andrew Bednarski (as Matthew Sharpe), being a kid, draws the images of "The Blue Man", as he begins his homicidal spree. The handsome detective John Novak (in the role of Stewart Kaufman) discovers that the victims are connected to Mr. Rekert. Novak's investigation leads to the supernatural; a first example of Karen Black (like Janus), with whom Rekert fears he fell in love. <br /> <br /> Several cast actors perform well; but, "The Blue Man" ends up binding in a knot. Aka "Eternal Evil", her unsatisfactory story tries to be too smart for her own good.
