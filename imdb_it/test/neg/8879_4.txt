After seeing this film several times, I came to the conclusion that Milos Forman made a very audacious decision for the creation of a muse for Goya, when the artist led what he would most consider a stormy and passionate life while the French revolution and the Napoleonic era raged. throughout Europe, surely one that would have enough drama to draw on. While I understand that Mr. Forman was reporting in the microcosm of the tragedy of Ines's life, the devastation of the world at that time, I felt left out that there was so much part of Goya excluded, so much of his humanity. The strongest and most eloquent point of this film is that, due to the fallen nature of man, each of us is a bad potential in the flow of life, each of us has the evil within us that we must fight with the help of God. How eloquent when Goya says he should have helped Ines more, as is true for all of us! We must defend and protect the innocent. The superbly ironic scene in which the priest, once imprisoned and sentenced to death, pronounces the death sentence of Lorenzo who originally condemned him is a genius's stuff. I was left to desire something more when the credits rolled. Perhaps less of the unreal coincidences and more of the inner life of the characters.
