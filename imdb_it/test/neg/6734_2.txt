Since I come from Norway (one of the ten richest countries in the world), it was a lot of fun to watch how we use trucks from the 1950s and live in medieval cottages. And since we have very strict laws about guns, it was fun to see how much pistol there was in Norway during the five minutes of shooting. Mr. Direct-to-video even managed to bring his silencer in a short time, so he must have powerful friends in the customs. <br /> <br /> Please do at least some research before going to an "exotic" country, guys - you could hurt the feelings of old fans. <br /> <br /> Sverre - old fan with hurt feelings.
