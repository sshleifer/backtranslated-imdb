The worst part about this movie is that it didn't have to be so terrible. <br /> <br /> They had a good budget, even if so many films do; they made her cute and pretty and, above all, they had the 21st century lesbian audience that would have embraced a positive lesbian movie ... yet the writer and director went out of their way to lift every single film redone on torment lesbian and confusion in colleges, (you know, the place where lesbian love lives and dies). <br /> <br /> This is a theme that has been repeated over and over again in the film, but something that viewers - if you use this electoral forum as a clue - don't seem to have enough. <br /> <br /> Every element of this story was so exaggerated, overly fake and artificial that it was painful to sit. The main characters say it all: the crazy, abandoned, genial, rebellious tough lesbian girl (well, they took a super nice femme like Piper Perabo and tried to make her angry, but she didn't attack very much) seduces a pretty rich girl who is destined to betray her. <br /> <br /> Looking at them at every step of the way there is the character 3, a good, well-intentioned observer, with wide eyes and a good girl. I say "every step" because it shares all its thoughts with the public through the most rigid and foolish monologues. <br /> <br /> His jokes seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, even if they are trying oh so, so hard to seem that a fifteen year old would really be, um, you know, well ... talk. "Listening to them (making love) with their noises was um, you know, like, well ... okay!" he says of his two unbridled roommates, who roll in the bed next to her. <br /> <br /> Later he asks Graham Greene, the famous American actor who is completely wasted in a gardener's role (!) "Is it wrong to worry about what people think?" <br /> <br /> Excuse me, but are you a teenager, or are you 7? <br /> <br /> Granted, Piper Perabo (as Polly the tortured dam) and others do a good job for the horrible lines they are forced to utter. Perabo has a good energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera. It would do well in a decent project, so this is in no way a criticism of acting. <br /> <br /> But this story is WITHOUT A CHAMPION in perpetuating every single stereotype about lesbians all gathered in one character. They couldn't stop with her (Polly) to be a furious, mad-passionate and secret genius who ran out of math problems for the wordless teacher. Oh, but it's after he argued with the teacher who dares to accuse her of "gabbing". <br /> <br /> "This is a word (male) they use against the USA (women)!" he says, jumping out of the classroom. <br /> <br /> Is this all the writer could invent? Or maybe we should ask: why stop here? <br /> <br /> Poole and co. he continued and made Polly a poetic and dark child who communicates with the wild hawks by shouting their name in the woods. <br /> <br /> Cue the slow motion, science fiction, Xena's atmosphere! <br /> <br /> Then we write it to his mother of birth ... (most lesbians are orphans hungry for love, in case you were in the dark). <br /> <br /> Then we have two teachers (one tense, one zotic type with wide laces in the neck) who wander around all the action (the school seems terribly big for only 2 teachers) ... they give tense looks of dark child / seductress / bird girl. Hmmmm. I wonder if something good, you know ... um, FUNNY is happening between these TWO TEACHERS ?????? <br /> <br /> There is simply no excuse for anything wrong with this. The heartbreak happens, but surely the writer and the director know that lesbians exist in much more sophisticated times than this schlock. <br /> <br /> I cannot reveal the end for respect to those who are forced to sit up to the end, but if you are not laughing, I can only imagine that you are crying. And not for the right reason. And I don't mean dull scenes.
