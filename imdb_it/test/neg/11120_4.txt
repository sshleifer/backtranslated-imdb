Apparently in early 2005, SciFi Channel threatened to release incriminating photos they have of John Rhys-Davies and said, "We need you to be able to act in another SciFi original." The scary thing is that he's really damn good at this movie. This is really saying something, since this is a stupid feature of the SciFi creature; you have to put a little feeling into it to be well acted. Unfortunately, no one else does. It's your stereotype of "mormon" movie on a cruise ship. The cryptozoologist wants to keep the creature alive, the Navy SEAL think they have everything under control but they don't know what they have to do and they all end up dead, a girl jumps into the role of the "sexpot" like Rhys - Davies' daughter and the creature cause about 100 travel companions. What this film is going for is, it's VERY fast and lively; you're never bored or you're waiting for another kill. Apart from this, however, it does nothing to stand out, and it is foolish that this thing crawls on all the ceilings and cannot be injured by the machine guns of the Navy SEALs, but can be subjected to karate in submission by the daughter of Rhys-Davies. He went back and forth giving this bad boy a 5, but for the stupidity I mentioned above I'm giving him a 4.
