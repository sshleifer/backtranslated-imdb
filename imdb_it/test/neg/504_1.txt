The director spent a lot of time making the scenes really realistic, up to the historical photos and all the sounds of the old West bustle. Too bad the producers and director / screenwriter, Michael Cimino, spent zero time on any of the historical facts of what the Johnson County war was actually about. Much of the war was about how public land should be used for grazing. The cattle did not want the poor sheep shepherds on earth to compete for fodder on this cold windward plateau. The entire epic does not mention grazing sheep, which was one of the most important reasons for the war. <br /> <br /> The worst scene is the battle between peasants and hired assassins. Peasants are shown circling armed men like a lot of Indians would do in previous Hollywood movies. The fact is that the Johnson County Sheriff William (Red) Angus, with a team of 200 or 300 men, intercepted the armed men and trapped them in a barn on the TA ranch. I doubt any woman took part in the siege. <br /> <br /> Ellen (also known as Cattle Kate) Watson and her second husband, James Averell, were hanged from a lynching about three years before the invasion of Johnson County. She was never a prostitute. This was a straw widespread by the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (WSGA) in order to discredit it. The fact that the plot makes her become a lady of the brothel only serves the interests of the WSGA. <br /> <br /> I object to the use of names of real people in a plot that is so clearly fiction. There is no data in the events, timelines or backgrounds of the characters. For Michael Cimino to use the real names of people who were vaguely connected with the Johnson County war (and previous events) it is beyond me. <br /> <br /> The film could have been much more interesting if it had lived on the political implications of the federal government's intervention in the affairs of a state government and what happened after the WSGA assassins were rescued from Calvary. Some efforts were made to prosecute the Cattlemen who were responsible for the Johnson County prosecutor. But since Johnson County could not afford court fees and the governor of Wyoming, Amos W. Barber, claimed the WSGA, the charges were eventually dropped. <br /> <br /> Overall I think the film was just an excuse to show Isabelle Huppert naked for most of the three and three-four hour lengths of the DVD version.
