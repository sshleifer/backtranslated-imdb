My qualifications for this review? I own all the Alien and Predator movies and have read and read almost every book I can find related to this series. <br /> <br /> I can safely say that this film is a Stinker. Save your money and not waste time. If you like action without thoughts, blood without brains, no plot to tell and how to be taken by Hollywood, watch the film. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the serious Alien series, send a message to those who don't know, about paid clothes in Hollywood & 20th Century Fox and don't give them a penny. <br /> <br /> This film has so many holes in the plot where you can sift the dough. Read the other negative reviews to get the big picture, it's all to be said with precision, so I don't have to repeat them. <br /> <br /> The characters in this film are cardboard. You want them all dead. And the film does not disappoint, almost everyone dies. Even the warm blond, with bubbles. Do you feel sorry for her? No. No plot, no character development ... who cares. The Predators are now also idiots. They scan everything except their dead warrior. Suppose they are a high-tech company, right? In the movie Predator, they scanned the soldiers and the girl to determine who was armed. The trophy kills. In AvP, they scanned Charles Weyland and left him because he had cancer. Big hole in the plot! <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the R score is due to the fact that they have children in the film who grimace, a lot of blood and violence and there is a hospital scene in which a very large woman is injected pregnant with bibs. It is implanted by Hybrid Alien with 4 or 5 eggs in a mouth-to-mouth scene orgy and they all hatch, say, for 30 seconds. Gore sensational in abundance, nothing more. These scenes are ridiculous, not serious. It's almost as if the violence happened and the alien looks at the camera and waits for applause, a thumbs-up or a nod. <br /> <br /> The aliens in this film are all about performance-enhancing drugs. They grow fast and spread quickly throughout the city, tons of them, everywhere in record spawn time. Pathetic because it doesn't stick to the plot of the series and adds nothing to the continuity of Aliens, Aliens Predator. <br /> <br /> I have noticed that positive reviews are written by people who love blood. Laughable. As a film, as a continuation of the Aliens franchise and the development of the Aliens vs Predator franchise, this film is a clich√© of cheesecake at its best. If you followed this series faithfully, all the rules are broken and the Aliens and Predators are reduced to comic book characters. <br /> <br /> There is no fantastic and memorable action scene. There are almost no special effects worth remembering. There are no brand actors. The plot is as thin as an onion which ends with: "We have two choices to get out of this mess ... the hospital or the city center!" I'm almost wet too. The city center means that everyone will be enchanted by the Big Brother who somehow knows that the city has been infested because they have an AWAC in the air that can see the infestation on a radar screen in special Red Spots effects. I almost fell off my chair. Alien radar with red dots of special effects on an AWAC above Central America. I'm sharing my stomach laughing. <br /> <br /> Having to go to the Helicopter Pad made me choke on my popcorn. Has anyone ever played a game called ZOMBIES !? You have to win your game pieces on the helicopter. I'm almost wetting myself with laughter. <br /> <br /> The ending is enough to make you shake your head in amazement. Who hired 20th Century Fox to write this script!? OH, OH, ask me ... a Grade 5 student. There really is no other answer. Oh yes, there may be another answer ... Low Budget Sci-Fi Cheesecake. <br /> <br /> The ending? "Colonel Stevens takes the Predator pulse gun for Mrs. Yutani (Francoise Yip), who tells him that the earth is not ready for the technology it represents, Colonel Stevens knows that Yutani does not want the technology to be used on earth. " You're kidding me, right? Ms. Yutani? Who is Ms. Yutani? (forshadow: Weyland-Yutani: The Corporation) She is in the film exactly 2 seconds and yet, in her infinite wisdom of the Far East, she says that the world is not ready for technology. Seriously??!! The Brothers Dweebs (Strause) as directors? Who is responsible for this hemorrhage-abortion of a film? They are the Doug and Bob McKenzie of the directors, yet Fox has entrusted them with the Alien franchise show. They are advertised as special effects experts and yet the film all has low budget special effects. Hmmm, I see a pattern. Laughable. <br /> <br /> This movie is made just to empty your wallet. It serves no other purpose. It has no plot. It has no major characters worth mentioning. It is disjoint. Does not adhere to any of the principles on the characters established in the previous films. It does nothing to advance the franchise. The special effects are lame, low and low budgets. And it has no end to talk about. It is low budget and designed strictly to take your hard earned money. Nothing more. <br /> <br /> Save your money. Or watch it on TV where it will end very soon. Buy a bootleg or lose the bleeding ulcer altogether. There is a reason why Fox did not show critics this film in advance. Critics would have eaten this mess alive and nobody would have gone to the cinema to see it. JR Giger, the original creator, is right now, leaning on a toilet that overturns his lunch. <br /> <br /> 20th Century Fox, this movie is a stinker. It's worse or worse than Alien 3. You insult us. <br /> <br /> Flush now ...
