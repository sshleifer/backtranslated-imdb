Ben, (Rupert Grint), is a deeply unhappy teenager, son of his unhappy married parents. His father, (Nicholas Farrell), is a vicar and his mother, (Laura Linney), is ... well, let's say he's a somewhat hypocritical soldier in Jesus' army. It's only when you take a summer job like you assistant to an eccentric and eccentric, now forgotten actress, Evie Walton (Julie Walters), who finally finds herself in the true 'Harold and Maude' fashion. Obviously, Evie is profoundly unhappy about herself and it is only when these two sad bags find each other that they can put aside their mutual unhappiness and embark on the road to happiness. <br /> <br /> Obviously it's trivial and sentimental and very predictable but it also has a difficult side, and Walters, who could sleep, walking through this kind of thing if he wanted, is excellent. It is when he puts the madness aside and finds the pathos in the character, (like hitting the bottle and throwing up in the sink), which is at its best. The problem is that she is the only interesting character in the film (and it is not because of the script that does anyone any favors). Grint, on the other hand, is not only unhappy; he too is a bit boring while Linney's starched bitch is completely one-dimensional. (However, he has the English accent off pat). The best that can be said is that it is slightly pleasant - with an emphasis on mild.
