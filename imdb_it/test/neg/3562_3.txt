This film tries to say something profound; I'm not sure what it was. Too much has remained unsolved at the end for me to understand the main point. A couple of scenes really asked me what was left on the editing room floor. I don't think the wall was very well developed, I never understood what was happening. When the mother finally reveals it, I cannot establish any connection with the boy's silence. What was the point of the boy who didn't speak? He was just delusional or had acquired a kind of power. What was the scene of the burned girl? Another power that the boy has or what? I don't understand how this has developed a character or moved the plot. I took the bully but what happened to the dog? Has the dog returned or did Mama get rid of Fido in any way? <br /> <br /> There were several additional plot elements that were more confusing than use. Like the radio talk show in the background that talks about the war in Iraq. I think he should have created a sort of comparison with the pain and insecurity the mother and Addison were experiencing, but for me it was distracting and tense. I didn't buy the link much. I also found out that the teacher was getting on Addison so as not to say "here" for the appeal a little too much. The mother who saw the doctor was useless, how did the plot serve? Was it to show how desperately the mother was, or was it something about the medicine I had not received? Was it the father who returned in the last scene, or just a boy? So does writing on the wall work? What happened to the dog?
