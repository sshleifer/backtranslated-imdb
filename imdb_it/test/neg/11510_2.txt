The first time I saw a commercial for this show was when my sisters were watching the Kim Possible movie. The advertisement showed Sadie and her friend discussing the meaning of the word nothing. It's one of the stupidest advertisements I've ever seen. Basically, they go back and forth with lines like "Nothing is one thing, so technically nothing is something". When I saw it, I thought it would be yet another limping Lizzie Maguire from Disney. But I had no idea how bad it was. <br /> <br /> Forward forward about 3 weeks, when my sister turns on the T.V. Naturally Sadie has happened. What I saw was to be one of the most unwittingly entertaining shows I've ever seen. How did it go? Something like this: <br /> <br /> Sadie, a vegetarian hugger, has an incredibly unhealthy and obsessive crush on the monotonous and misinterpreted acting of Owen. For some reason, her friend Margret decides that Owen needs to be "tested" to see if he is as good as he looks. What exactly do these tests involve? Well, one thing they do is put a cockroach in his notebook. Why? So that she can be picky and ask her monotonous knight in shining armor to take it off. What is a test like? Because if it crushes it, it is petty and indifferent and does not believe that insects, as Sadie says, "are also innocent animals". DISEASE OF THE DISEASE AND PESTILANCE! THEY WANT TO BE DELICIOUS! But of course, Owen touches him from the window, and Sadie is still in love. But that is not all! Margret says she needs to be challenged once again, about something "no boy can pass". This involves pushing scarves down your pants (yes, you read that right) and walking to buy them to see if they notice their big butts. Predictably, he does not notice, and we see Sadie in her bizarre and strange world of notebooks. Sadie decides that she wants to be with Owen forever, raise a family with him and, as she says, "live like wood ducks with their brood." It is simply wrong. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: this is the strangest and most crazy show I've ever seen. For those who like to fool stupid things, you'll love it. For anyone else, skip this show.
