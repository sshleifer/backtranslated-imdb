This film was rented for free, I had no misconceptions about it being a very bad film. I rented it for Thanksgiving because we eat turkey and then the family watches a terrible movie. So ask, what makes this movie so ugly that you only gave it 2 stars? Dialogue. The lack of dialogue makes this film perfect for a deaf audience. In fact, if you entrust it, just turn the volume down to zero and insert a heavy metal CD from your favorite artist. I know you'll like it better. The plot of this holiday turkey was so bulky with technology and geeks that you needed a translator for fiction. Now for all of you who love good science fiction effects ... eh, they are not much better than video game trailers or cut scenes in the worst cases. Actors, or both, don't have much to look at. They don't say much for the whole movie. Many of the technical aspects will make you laugh like the scene in which the hero binds to a missile and shoots him in the city 70 km away (he never showed how he landed). In the previous scene we see a robotic pistol throwing a 12-foot cannon at him and he misses more shots. Furthermore we are told that the political division between antagonist and protagonist is bio-technology (genetically improved humans) compared to cyber-tech (machine-powered humans), but both seem to be cyborgs or enhanced humans. What told me this was a bad movie in the rental shop was the cover that looked like a video game cover and there was only one copy, the good new releases have many copies available.
