so if a guy meets you and says "I want you to look at my erection!" don't be alarmed, maybe he wants you to watch the movie he made about how his house should be built. Yup! that's the only thing that happens in this movie! it's like Warholian's worst BEEP I've ever seen! it's like filming the inside of your bathroom before rinsing it, in fact, it's less interesting to look at. <br /> <br /> but if you look at Lennon's Erection, you know that the noise has also been very background. I mean, really, it's like the building was attacked by space mutants from hell or something! meanwhile, the building under construction is growing as can erection (in almost 20 minutes, what a result). <br /> <br /> so if someone asks you to watch his erection, make sure he wants to record everything.
