What really struck me about this film was how little the plot made sense. So many characters were introduced by chance, it was like I imagine that "THE ROOM" by Tommy Wiseau is rethought for the Disney Channel set. We had the wise old couple who continued to go out where "Jane" worked, telling the same story about how "soda" brought them together, or Jane's mother / stepmother who casually cried that they would all show up at random moments . /> <br /> The acting of Aaron Carter is certainly the strong point of this film: I couldn't wait to see all the scenes in which he appeared. Editing is painful, with scene cuts that make no sense. The character of "Jane" is really irritating, hanging around and chatting about "J.D. McQueen". The "Music Awards" scenes are more depressing than anything else. And the ending of this film is surreal.
