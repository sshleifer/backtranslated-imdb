Well, as someone can really think that this film is fantastic, it's so beyond me ... I can't even understand how anyone can find this movie remotely funny, the only character that is going to do it, is the evil super nerd game designer and this gets old after a while. This film is so predictable, the jokes are not funny they are forced, you see better acting in the red light district, and the story sucks is so predictable, you know EXACTLY what is going to happen. Even the characters do not react as they should, try going to the hot chick who is your boss at work and telling her that you are banging 2 crazy people you live with at the same time, her answer would not be (smile) "Ok, let's get back to work" . I didn't laugh once during this movie, and I wish I had never seen it or spent $ 3 to rent it because it's not even worth it. Adam Sandler produced this film, I lost all respect for him. All his films are the same, his comic style has become old since The Waterboy came out, if I knew that Adam Sandler produced this film before I rented it ... I would never waste time. This film is the worst you can get from every aspect ... the new ace was not an intelligent comedy film, it didn't have a murderous plot ... but it was original and it was hilarious. I'm not beating the movie because it has a 'low level' humor, I'm wrong because it sucks, it's a piece of Hollywood shit. If this film were presented to a production company and did not have "ADAM SANDLER" behind it, it would be thrown into the garbage faster than a used condom. If you want a good film on the observation of popular culture, Cheech and Chong, or Whitecastle. If you rent this movie, all you get is a generic comedy aimed at 14-17 year olds, with rock music at every possible cut, acting that will make your eyes narrow and your stomach, and comedy that is equivalent to watching your friend stoned eating mcdonalds for an hour and a half. Don't do it .... for the love of God ... this movie sucks, treats it for what it is and looks beyond all the glory of Hollywood behind it ..... Hercules in New York was the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's actually so ugly that it's fine. This instead was a very expensive film that sucked just as much, if not more.
