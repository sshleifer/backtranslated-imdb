The Red Comyn murder in Greyfriars Abbey was far from one of the most horrendous things ever done in the Scottish War of Independence and the battles (and killings) in churches were not at all unusual. Not long after, the wife of Robert Bruces, her daughter, two of her sisters were captured during a fight in a church where people were killed. And comparing it to the Berwick massacre in which the British massacred at least 8,000 non-combatants (some, yes, in churches) is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Having said that it is not a well-made film. It is slightly antidote to the absolutely ridiculous representation of Robert Bruce in Braveheart. Whatever Bruce was, he wasn't a wuss. <br /> <br /> Too bad they didn't do a better job than this because someone should make a really GOOD movie of a war that is so amazing that it sounds like something someone invented going from complete defeat in the battle of Methven to a secret return from hiding in a long guerrilla war at Bannockburn. This is not however. Poorly done and to a large extent badly written and recited. Sin!
