"The Snow Queen" is based on the famous and beautiful fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, about a girl, Gerda, who embarks on a dangerous journey to save her friend Kai from the clutches of the Snow Queen. This adaptation attempts to capture the story's sense of adventure and bright, complex images through lavish sets and production projects, but fails on many fronts. <br /> <br /> Like so many Hallmark productions, the potential of the story is completely undercutting with heavy-handed scripting and direction. The two actors who play Gerda and Kai are pleasantly bland but forgettable; Bridget Fonda as the Snow Queen looks the part but is otherwise uncomfortable for the role. There is a remarkable lack of dramatic tension in this menacing three-hour miniseries. At least some of the stimulation problems can be attributed to the addition of filling scenes that add very little to the original story, particularly at the opening time that introduces the main characters. <br /> <br /> That said, "The Snow Queen" would be ideal for pre-teens with a penchant for imagination and a little patience. It is a great pleasure for the eyes without being scary, and the acting is launched at the sort of upper level pantomime that describes the plot in a very, very bold text. Make sure you also read Andersen's story.
