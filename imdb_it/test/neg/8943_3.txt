OK, so this is horror? I get horror - but I don't get horrible. Black and white is artistic but too black is excessive ... just say about lighting. The story - a serial killer ....... lots of these around. It was done in the past and yes, it will continue to be done ..... but I hope not. My question is, when will the public get tired of reliving this maddening dilemma? I imagine the director thought he would do something different - portray killing children. Well, it's been done before. SO I suppose it had to go to shock value ... get them killed in the darkest of fashions. Ok ..... the public was shocked ...... disgusted .... disgusted ..... numb. And getting up from my seat, I heard all these things. So the director was successful? Yup! Absolutely! These are the things he wanted me to hear and do. Now what do I do with feelings? And more importantly, what is the "message" here? With the extraordinary talent that Francis Xavier was "gifted" with ... could he ever consider the idea of ​​applying it to make films that talk, I dare say, to get out of the darkness? I was left in the dark after seeing this movie, my soul was attacked .... is this what this trade is about? There are many such movies out there - they make the money they tell me. So what happens to people who want to see all these depressing images? What is happening in this world that people will pay to be horribly shocked? I would see him again ..... never.
