This is the story of a manic policeman who, for some reason, has it for a young university student and his companions. After reporting it to his supervisor who in turn suspends him pending psychiatric evaluation, he finds an opportunity for psychology to torture them when, on a bet, children enter the security of a department store and open the door. Only, they get stuck in the store, along with the weirdo. Murders and chaos are underway, and the boys run trying to survive until the morning when they might be able to escape. <br /> <br /> 'Dangerous Game' would probably have been a "cat and mouse" psychotherapeutic thriller probably if it was set in a different position. The thought of a psychotic cop chasing a group of innocent teenagers in a department store didn't work. Especially when he comes face to face with his trembling prey quite frequently and yet, he doesn't do anything serious often enough. There was no real comparison as it would have been enough for this kind of story, and it could have worked better if we say, for example, that the boys were free in the neighborhood and left to defend themselves from this strange (especially if they are served a few days while making them more and more paranoid ... even if discounted, this is also a clich√©. <br /> <br /> What a pity, too, that it couldn't have been a better thriller, considering a funky cast of young people Australian characters. Even a light-hearted adventure, despite the madness of the bad interspersed with the image, could have even made it more satisfying. Instead, it started fresh, and it certainly had a lot of action sequences, but it ended up border on the ridiculous.
