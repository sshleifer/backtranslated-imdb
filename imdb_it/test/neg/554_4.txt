I'm really sad that this is the first negative review I've ever done for a movie ... EVER.I could bear to watch this movie, and it's the second movie in all the movies I've seen that's right. ... a downgrade The first is Open Water, which has never had any points. The Next Karate Kid had no mention of Daniel (correct me if I am wrong, please.), And that end line was a shock. It was like, "If he has to fight ... win." then he showed the bird that was flying around and the pan flute was ringing, and I was like, oh. Ok, so it will take a while for this next part. AND THEN CREDITS HIT LO SCERMO. <br /> <br /> GEEZ MAN !! I hope I will never have to see a bad movie again, I apologize for those of you who love The Next Karate Kid, really, really ...
