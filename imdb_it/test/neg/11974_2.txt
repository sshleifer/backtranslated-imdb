... with a budget of $ 500 and a bottle of ketchup. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of C movies without talented actors, a ridiculous story, cheap effects and bad camera, this movie delivers. <br /> <br /> All others are advised. You could probably make a similar movie with a couple of friends in your backyard and a home-made video camera. <br /> <br /> The film is still good for some laughs. Watch it with some friends and comment on how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 for involuntary comedy. <br /> <br /> Why the hell do you have to write 10 lines? I've seen comments with fewer lines and writing this is just a lame filler.
