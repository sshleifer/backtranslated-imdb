Rented this tonite from my local video store. It was titled "Black Horizon". I imagine someone thought it was good enough for a 2004 re-release ... Micheal Dudikoff is unfortunately not a ninja in this film, one of the main flaws of this film. Another big flaw would be that the action scenes of Ice-t are stolen from other films, especially the first scene of his rescue, which is directly from the Wesley Snipes movie "The Art of War", with Ice-T mounted in. I hope you paid for that footage. <br /> <br /> The plot is horrible, the special effects have had little effort (they love those threads that hold them in space), the acting is of wood (even the accents of New York / Russia). The ice in the film is useless. These guys have also forgotten the fact that there is no gravity in space, but I guess they weren't worried about it. <br /> <br /> Micheal Dudikoff should go back to doing what he is good at doing and doing American Ninja 6.
