The revisionist history - which makes the evil Marquis de Sade a semi-heroic romantic - is quite shocking. But the atrocious acting, the amateur cinematography and the terrible dubbing make this film painfully bad. The only reason to keep looking is that almost all the women in the film are wonderful. And, incredibly, being tortured for days, with his hands tied up high, apparently doesn't detract from a woman's beauty, hairstyle and make-up. My hypothesis is that producers mostly went to Russia, choosing women for their appearance - and willingness to work cheaply - rather than acting. If you decide to watch this because you have nothing better to do, or you are a film student looking for bad examples, move quickly into any scene that does not involve nudity.
