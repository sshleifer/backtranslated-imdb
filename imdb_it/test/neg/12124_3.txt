I have to say it's better than most SyFy releases, but that's not saying much. <br /> <br /> The plot is that someone buys a game made from the bones and skin of a dead witch from the Spanish Inquisition (and no one ever expects the Spanish inquisition!) He and his friends play the game, only to be interrupted halfway when the friend who made the round of the beer is killed in a way that the game predicted. <br /> <br /> The following is a series of killings typical of a movie like this or any Final Destination movie. He has the puzzle at the end and the interesting subplot with the cop who wants the game to bring his family back ... but otherwise, it's just a mess.
