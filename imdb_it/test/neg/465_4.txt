I must say that I was not impressed at all, probably because I was expecting a lot more from this movie. Perhaps an emphasis on religion or science or the meaning of life, not just a few lines. So if you expect something to think about after watching this movie, don't do it. It is more psychological than philosophical. I vote 4 because of the end, it gets a little clearer and because I have great respect for BBC documentaries. There are a couple of very interesting scenes that actually made sense. It was a brilliant idea to add it to a film related to the theory of evolution, too bad that this was not the main subject. Ah, I just forgot to mention that for more than 1 hour, the film is quite boring and somewhat cruel.
