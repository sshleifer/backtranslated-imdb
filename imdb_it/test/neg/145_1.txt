This movie is really a big piece of trash that tries to look like a Hollywood production. For a profile of a story (stupid robot story) ... bad acting from talentless pop idols ... and are trying to "FIGHT"! ! ! My God ... those miserable actors use threads to make them look like "good fighters" ... :( and I hate that arrogant Edison Chen ... the worst actor I've ever seen !!! I'll never do it Touch new his films AVOID this movie at all costs !!! I wanted to give him a negative value out of ten ... not even a value of 0/10.
