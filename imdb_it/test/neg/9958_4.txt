Fortunately you don't need a lot of "learning the book" to understand where this is going ... Obviously a row of poverty that clashes with the great success of Universal THE WOLF MAN (which was realized only a year before ), he always finds - generically George Zucco in another of his "crazy doctors" patented as a brilliant scientist Lorenzo Cameron. Cameron, who opened stores in the wetlands of what I assume is the Louisiana bayou, is plotting revenge against four of his former colleagues who humiliated him and forced him to resign from his previous job. You see, they scoffed at his claims that he was able to mix the man with the beast to create an unstoppable army of wolfman creatures that would be useful during the war. Fortunately, Cameron has found the ideal test subject for his injections of wolf blood - a gigantic and sharp fool named Petro (Glenn Strange). Petro is quite unable to know what's going on, he doesn't ask too many questions and lets the doctor tie him to a table and shoot him with whatever's in his syringe. This results in a temporary change of the man who becomes a werewolf. Cameron takes him out of the villa using a secret passage, so practically a big boy (Strange was 6'5 ") in overalls with a thick beard, hairy paws and a series of oversized plastic teeth running around the woods for the most of the time After an eyewitness has seen the beast and a young girl killed, the locals grab their rifles and organize a team to hunt Dr. Cameron, who can control the beast with a whip and also has a useful antidote to reverse the effect, he also drags Petro into the big city to try to track down the professors who mocked his original theories and destroyed his reputation in the process. Also, around the house is Cameron's daughter, Lenora (Anne Nagel), as well as Lenora's nosy reporter boyfriend, Tom (Johnny Downs), whose first inclination is to deal with a prehistoric creature walking straight (!). <br /> <br /> in many mo of, with unimpressive ensembles, cinematography and m ake-up, as well as a fairly substantial cast, remains watchable thanks to the histrionics of star George Zucco. I have no idea why Downs received top billing; it shows half an hour and actually has not much to do, nor is it so impressive to do so. This is the Zucco show all the way and he is a big drunk and delirious, he talks to himself while he imagines talking to his peers ("I'm not interested in your idiot ambushes!") And I temporarily slip in and out of health mental. Strange seems to have modeled his interpretation of a semi-retarded country hilarious, exhilarating and slow to talk about Lon Chaney Jr.'s entire work, from Lenny in OF MICE AND MEN, to his performance as WOLF MAN. In any case, Strange and Zucco do a good job playing one another. My favorite part is when Zucco calls him his "guinea pig" in front of a colleague while Petro sits and smiles staring at a handle. Some of the muddy bog scenes are also quite suggestive.
