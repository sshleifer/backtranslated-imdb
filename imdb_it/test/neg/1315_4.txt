The production values ​​of this film are not up to the status of Hollywood successes and the script is not up to the status of a cult. What remains is a tired formidable attempt on the genre of the catastrophic film that will disappear at low tide. <br /> <br /> A decent cast, or cast of Miss, or can not be disturbed. The beautiful Joanne Whalley is unable to bring any gravitas to the role of Police Commissioner Nash who wears the most irritating headdress of the skirt over the skirt. <br /> <br /> Jessalyn Gilseg plays the most important part of the director of the Thames Barrier with all the conviction of a fair candy floss. His nationality and his Canadian accent were presumably written to attract a transatlantic public. His first appearance in a tight-fitting pink jogging suit as he arrives at work is laughable. <br /> <br /> The part of the "old git siren that was right" is played by Tom Courtenay as if he were acting in sleep, and the various twists designed to energize his son, played by Robert Carlyle, struggle to get any response from him. <br /> <br /> Nigel Planer seems determined to commit hari kari rituals for his failures like Met Office Director, or his acting, or both, and only David Suchet emerges with a little credit for his role of Deputy PM. <br /> <br /> There was enough in the story, and cast and the effects of having produced a decent effort. Unfortunately it didn't happen.
