Horrible horrible movie, I still can't believe that my friend convinced me to see it! No plot, bad acting, funny scenes and very stupid dialogues. All I have to say is that this film is the worst movie I've ever seen and it's worse than Halloween III, which I gave even at 0 stars. So I give him 0 stars and 0 out of 10, well here a 1, but you get the point.
