Undoubtedly, the least of the Spaghetti Westerns I've been looking at lately: basically a makeshift of Leo THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (1966) with three disparate characters intertwining with each other (and occasionally forming wobbly alliances) in the their search for hidden gold. Leonard Maltin classified him as BOMB; even if it is quite harmless, it is also routine and, fatally, the three main roles are stereotypes, that is to say, uninteresting: Eddie Byrnes is a bank employee with ideas about transporting his train shipment; Gilbert Roland is the "legendary" but old Mexican bandit (his frequent mistakes in Spanish when excited are rather corny!) Which, apparently, is still irresistible to women; George Hilton is an enigmatic bounty hunter trying to emulate the Man With No Name of Clint Eastwood. The director Castellari - whom I saw at the Italian retrospective of the film B held during the 2004 Venice Film Festival, in which he came out as the most pompous director of the cult film! - shows a bit of genuine sentiment for the West (based on two Franco Black efforts above the average in the genre, I ordered his collaboration with Castellari KEOMA [1976] ... I'm keeping my fingers crossed now!) and the film is the ironic approach is equally deplorable.
