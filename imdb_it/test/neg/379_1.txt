If you're in the mood for a really terrible movie, it would be hard to find something that could even be compared to this. I spent a lot of time watching a lot of terrible movies just for the sheer joy I get, and man, this is one of the worst. This movie was so bad, I had to buy the third Beastermaster online. That wasn't so bad, which is surprising since it was directly to the video. This is one of those films that it is difficult to understand how it was made in the first place. I mean, someone had actually read the script (or many scripts, I'm sure they did several drafts) and said "Yes, that's it. Here's some money". Actually, they probably just wanted to do a Beastmaster 2 before they even had a script, then they went with what they had. Ack, horrible. So, if you're a fan of really bad movies, watch this. It's a real classic, and the film doesn't get much worse than that. And if it does, please let me know.
