1983 was an exceptional year for Stephen King's books that came to the big screen. Christine, The Dead Zone and Cujo were all released a few months apart. While The Dead Zone was easily the group's choice, Christine and Cujo were both rather mean, and it is a close thing about which is the lesser of the two. If pushed for an answer, I would say that Cujo - marginally - is the weakest. <br /> <br /> Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace, fresh from the success of Elliot's mother in "ET - The Extra Terrestrial") is a mother whose marriage to her husband Vic (Daniel Hugh-Kelly) hangs on a wire. She has had a relationship with a local worker and is now focusing on whether or not to leave her husband. Dragged into marital distress is the young Tad Trenton (Danny Pintauro), son of Donna and Vic, and a rather messy child with a chronic phobia of the dark that often leads to severe panic attacks. Donna and Tad take the family car to a nearby repair shop for mechanics, but when they arrive their self-locking stops stop. Things get a lot worse when they discover that the mechanic, Joe Camber (Ed Lauter), is not there (he was savagely killed by his domestic dog Cujo, a giant Saint Bernard who was recently bitten and infected by a rabid bat.) the dog has trapped them in their car and is trying everything to get into the vehicle to tear up these two unfortunate victims. The weather is very hot; not a living soul knows that I am there; the machine does not start; and the dog seriously wants their blood ...... <br /> <br /> Cujo has the potential to be a genuinely tense siege thriller, but never really gets into action. I read the book and it is rather disappointing - certainly for King - so it's not surprising that the film version is so small. On the printed page, King was at least able to generate some degree of tension, but the film is critically hampered by the fact that a Saint Bernard is simply not very scary. The "visuality" of the cinematographic medium serves as a constant reminder that Cujo is a Saint Bernard. In the book, it was possible to forget it. In the book, sometimes Cujo seemed to take on the appearance of a monster. Even with the relatively short execution time of an hour and a half, Cujo becomes a boring and patient experience, sometimes involuntarily funny and certainly never as suspicious as it would like to be. They even omitted the cruelly negative ending of the book and replaced it with a "all good ends well" conclusion so that the public can go home in a good mood !!! Chalk this down as another adaptation of the lower king.
