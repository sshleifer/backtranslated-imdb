Ok, anyone who wants to see a great work of art should NOT watch this movie. A sophisticated cinema expert will undoubtedly be sickened by the horrendous values ​​of production and the sight of an excellent actor (Joseph Cotten) who earns himself. Mr. Cotten must have really needed the money or he was too old to realize that the film was shit. The same phenomenon occurred with Dana Andrews, who at the end of his career appeared in the field and terrible FROZEN DEAD. I know that Mr. Andrews was struggling with alcoholism, but why did Cotten make this mess ?! <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it is a reworking of the Frankenstein plot. The first half of the film really looked like a serious but seriously flawed version of Frankenstein's original story. Then, inexplicably, they introduced a daughter. This was not a bad thing ... until then, suddenly, they decided to stop making a horror movie, but to create a soft-core porn movie !! The change was dramatic and bizarre. It was as if they were saying "ok, Mr. Cotten has finished his scenes and gone home, ... now sir, ... STRIP!" <br /> <br /> The problem is that on every level, the film is simply horrible except for the monster's trick. Although not exceptional, it is still nice enough to see. But the bad script, the acting and a $ 17.46 budget have conspired to make this a gloomy and terrible movie - one so ugly that throwing a little nudity at the dangers out there shouldn't be enough to entice someone to see it .
