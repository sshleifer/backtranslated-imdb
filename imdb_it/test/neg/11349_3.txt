Any of Law & Order's, CSI (take your pick of cities), and Homicide: the weakest episodes of Life on the Street are superior to Bones's strongest episode. <br /> <br /> David Boreanaz is stuck in disgusting Angel mode, and Emily Deschanel also plays "Bones" ... unrealistically. The actors overall have terrible scenes together, whether it's forced acting or horrible lines. <br /> <br /> Murders become predictable after a while, as the foreshadowing and clues are too obvious. <Br /> <br /> Music is fine, although sometimes it is not necessary. <br /> <br /> All in all, Bones is certainly not the show that I recommend to watch during weekdays because it is a carbon copy of best shows with unreal characters and increasingly boring stories. <br /> <br /> Skip this if you can.
