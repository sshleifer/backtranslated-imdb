This film is sometimes scary, maybe not more than when a naked George Kennedy tells his girlfriend that he wants a little more sugar. Fortunately, her nakedness is covered by a blanket, but the image is even more terrifying than anything you can find, for example, Schindler's List. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this film was inspiring; inspired me to watch another movie. In one scene, when a hostess talks about male pilots, Kennedy asks: "Why do you think it's called a 'cock pit'?" Charming. <br /> <br /> And yes, contrary to what some have written, this film is very, very bad.
