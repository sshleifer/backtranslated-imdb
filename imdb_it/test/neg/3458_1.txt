CRAP! I accidentally watched this movie, thinking it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003. I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it. Too bad for anyone who has given a prize to this garbage. I completely hated this movie, in fact I didn't see it until the end. After an hour I couldn't stand it anymore. I am disgusted by the fact that people are amused by such a crappy script, that it seeks and fails to snatch a dozen other stories of human interest and a recitation of the BA-AD. PAINFUL. I consider 1 star out of 10. An amateur could make a much bigger movie.
