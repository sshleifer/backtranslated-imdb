What movie is this ??? A horrible film with the old boring concept of infidelity that has already been reached by the "Bhatt camp". Movie stars EMRAAN HASHMI, UDITA GOSWAMI AND DINO MOREA. The film has "No Base". That's right ... Dino an Udita is married and lives in a rich villa. However Dino does not like Heard to the heart because he only wants his wealth. Love someone else (Tara Sharma). So he corrupts Emraan to have a relationship with Udita so that he can catch them and eventually split up with Udita .. Like BORARE !! However Emraan falls in love with Udita and vice versa. Finally, when Udita gets the prison for killing Emraan, Dino tries pretentiously to save her by showing his false love for her. On the other hand, he does not understand and feels he really loves her. So she lends all her wealth to Dino. Eventually Dino leaves the police station and goes with Tara with all the wealth. What a fraud !! The songs are good and they are the only good thing about the movie. Now the individual evaluations: (out of 5) Emraan: * * Hearing: * 1/2 Dino: * 1/2 Overall: * 1/2 Direction: * * History: * Music: * * * 1/2 Final evaluation: * 1/2 Poor performance and poor fusion ....... Music: good ... I consider the movie: 1.5 / 10 (Don't waste your time !!!!)
