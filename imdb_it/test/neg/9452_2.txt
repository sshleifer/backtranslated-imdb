A really terrible film, really low budget, with a terrible acting, a complicated and inane plot, a modest reworking of vampire stories mixed with modern science. <br /> <br /> The result is a total disaster, meaningless to most parties, with very limited and cheap effects. It's not even funny, like many of the low-budget independent films of this type <br /> <br/> A waste of time
