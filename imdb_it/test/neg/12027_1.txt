I bought this film unnoticed at a science fiction convention and got what I deserved to do something so silly. In short, this film is not plausible, boring and unwatchable. <br /> <br /> I was so bored and disgusted by the lack of plot development that I turned off to see a repeat of Mythbusters. I understand that this is a very low budget move, or at least it seems like a very low budget move, but that doesn't justify the horrible acting, the terrible plot and even worse camera work. It looks like something a group of university students did between lessons and getting drunk. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the villain wasn't so ridiculous and the plot was something that could actually happen in real life compared to the law the application could become so serious that it's fun. This movie is not funny, it's just ugly.
