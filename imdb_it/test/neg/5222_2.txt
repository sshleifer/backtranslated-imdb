OK, I'm 26, so I've been with all the action heroes of the 80s, and Chuck Norris along with Seagal, Van Damme and the rest of the boys have been my childhood heroes, fighting the bad guys, shooting dozens of one-round bullets only;) I saw the ad for this movie on TV a couple of days ago - Chuck Norris was throwing fireballs from his fingers. Whoa! "It's a lousy movie to see!", I said. And indeed it was. Only much worse. It is very difficult to see the whole film - full of religious thoughts, ridiculous zombie monsters, serving Satan, the whole idea of ​​a plot set in a forgotten community, which represents all of humanity - is a load of fundamentalist Christian wet dreams. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against Christianity, even in films, but this lacks taste, it lacks almost everything that connects with common sense, come on, Chuck Norris who plays an ANGEL, whose work is to take care of the small town, where Satan lives?!?! The whole plot is so damn straight and boring, not to mention its stupidity (yes, it's no longer stupidity, we're talking nonsense like ... like a joke of a retarded child) making a terrible film, done as far as I'm concerned about the elderly for people very devoted to the Catholic Church, because the young spectators laugh at almost every scene. Technically it is not correct, fx are worse than those you saw in the early 90s in TV series, the plot seems VERY stupid, actors could easily be exchanged for cardboard supports, without mentioning the music that, as far as I heard , it was played on a childish toy piano. I've seen a lot of movies, even the worst ones (those on the lower IMDb list) like "Space Mutiny" or "Manos - hands of destiny", BUT don't believe me anything comparable to this ridiculous, terrible, horribly recited movie that brings to mind some jokes of the students rather than a regular production. Avoid it. At all costs avoid it. There's nothing to laugh about either. Chuck Norris officially ended his film career.
