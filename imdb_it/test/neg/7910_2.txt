After a humiliating experience on a plane, Nashawn Wade (Kevin Hart) sues the airline and uses the money he wins to start his own full-service airline. What makes it different is that it has sexy hostesses, a nightclub and no less than Captain Snoop Dogg in the cockpit. Soul Plane is a very racist comedy, except that it's occasionally fun. Soul Plane has been described as an "urban" version of Airplane. The problem is that Soul Plane doesn't even come close to reaching Airplane's laughter. The beats in Soul Pane are too offensive and mostly not original. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't laughing because there were funny moments. However, I expected more and left the theater disappointed. <br /> <br /> I would compare Soul Plane to Airplane 2. The latter was just a remake of the first film, while the first is just a rehash of obsolete, raw beats. There is really no creativity behind the film and there are only a few funny points. However, I don't think Soul Plane is "low 100" bad. Right now, the film is ranked at number 82 and this is a bit harsh. I'm not saying this is a good movie, but it's not terrible either. The execution time is only 86 minutes, so it's not too painful to watch. For stupid comedies, you can do much worse. <br /> <br /> No one in the cast is very good but it seems that they are having fun and this helps. Kevin Hart was very annoying as Nashawn. He had some funny jokes but he is a very poor man. Snoop Dogg, who was slightly funny in Starsky and Hutch, completely disagrees. Tom Arnold was indeed tolerable and that was the biggest surprise of the film. The most annoying person in the film was Ryan Pinkston. It wasn't funny at all and it would never have been fun. The funniest cast members were Missi Pyle and Mo'Nique. They gave the best lines and made me laugh harder. In the end, Soul Plane might be fine if you're looking for a stupid comedy, but it would probably be better if you skip the movie. Evaluation 4/10
