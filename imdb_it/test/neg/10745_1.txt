Dear Mr. Dante, <br /> <br /> Friend, seriously ... the title of the show is "Masters of Horror". And as it may be, it should be an opportunity to show your horror, to show the world why you deserve to be called a "master" of the genre. Apparently you misunderstood the exercise. Apparently you thought it was your chance (or worse, your duty) to educate the American public about your political beliefs. And your attempt turns out to be disgusting, overbearing and above all predicative. <br /> <br /> The only reason why SOMEONE marked your short as a high score is because their political views match yours and they are the kind of people they wear. I don't mind having that kind of policy pushed down my throat. <br /> <br /> I, on the other hand, don't give a damn about what you believe, they believe, or believe ... I only want messages that are so obvious (not subtle) and not funny (not satirical) out of my horror. And while there were certainly other "Masters of Horror" that were great disappointments of the time or where I was only generally confused because that director (william malone?) Would be considered a "master" of genre ... yours does not go beyond the the rest of the series alone is missing. <br /> <br /> So next time ... can you please keep your preaching policy for you?
