Komodo vs. Cobra will not light the world. It is not a distinctive sign of the history of cinema. What it is is a group of underfunded films that try to make another film, make another salary and continue to support themselves and their families. As such, I offer a lot to these efforts. I mean, come on, it must be hard to be a Russian special effects technician. There are not a lot of big budget movies made there. BUT - they are a dedicated group and more than willing to throw it all into any lame American monster prank needs SFX at affordable prices. And it gives me a kick out of looking for the same positions appear over and over again in these films. If for some reason you find yourself looking at it again, look at the sequence in which Pare and company are going through a "jungle". Look at their feet and you will see paved walkways. And if you happen to still have a copy of "AI Assault" (shown a week or two earlier also on SciFi), you'll see the people there wandering through the same jungle. Come to think of it, I think the helicopters land in the same clearing in both gestures. I can admire the thrift of these films. Every dollar really appears on the screen! Just a shame that there are not enough dollars ......
