Make it all too easy in this movie. It reminded me of Indiana Jones where it hides outside a submarine during an ocean crossing. Everyone knows everything that's happening, it's really easy to get everything you want in the White House. I don't even know why I looked at half of it. Because I like Charlie Sheen and Donald Sutherland. I expect the usual ability to dodge bullets from every angle, and be able to run faster than a motorcycle (it's usually faster than a car in a garage or an ally). It was silly, above all, and I didn't even know I had a ten-story elevator in the White House. However, anything conspiratorial is always interesting.
