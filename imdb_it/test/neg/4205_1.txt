Would you like to see a movie in which Chuck Norris takes the bad guys aside and calmly discusses with them the mistakes of their ways until they see the light and, with tears in their eyes, shake hands, right the wrongs of the world in peace and harmony and forever end the reign of evil in the world? <br /> <br /> Well, forget it, Jocko. <br /> <br /> "Breaker! Breaker!" instead he goes straight for the kick-off while our truck driver Chuck runs his great equipment in the small town where his little brother is detained by a corrupt judge and his even more corrupt lawyers. <br /> <br /> Chuck Karate kicks, chops, slices, julienne and crinkle cuts all the bad guys into sight until an evil man dares raise his head. A lot of fights are in slow motion, for excitement purposes, but it only helps to fill the film to fill 86 minutes. <br /> <br /> And there are many fights here, which leave only about 15 minutes for the development plot ... and this is all the plot you get. But what did you expect: calm discussion? <br /> <br /> A star for "Breaker! Breaker!"; and this is a small 10-4, good friend.
