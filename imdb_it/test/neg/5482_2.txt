They are only 2 stars because they have done a lot of work to make this game look good. I've played a lot of good and bad games and I think this game has the most boring story I've ever had to listen to. The best thing they could have done is let you skip conversations (but no, you have to listen to them while they talk for 10 minutes) and keep doing the same things over and over again. Get on the building, save the citizen, kill a guy. IT'S ALL EQUAL! Ubisoft should really hire someone with a little imagination. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the Prince of Persia series (first 3). The story was good and you wanted to know what will always happen. I don't even hate Prince of Persia 4. But I think anyone who was in charge of developing the Assassin's Creed story should be banned from writing another thing for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> Boring story and the same missions over and over again! If only one of these two things was good, it was worth playing.
