The Mod Squad is not a film, it is a void. This is the most fascinating thing and the thing that made me look? I had never seen a movie that offered absolutely nothing before. It is a film without any reason to exist, apparently intentionally designed to appeal to anyone as if it were done simply as a contractual obligation to someone that the studio really does not love. There is no plot, there is no characterization, there are no stage action scenes, there are not even scenes as such, only a progression of more and more empty shots projected at 24 frames per second. I'm not talking about emptiness like in a stupid summer blockbuster, but empty as in "We don't have pages yet, so just point the camera at something and stop when you have 90 minutes." It makes you appreciate the "artistic achievements" of Charlie's Angels and S.W.A.T. much more What he offers is far too much of Giovanni Ribisi in his most annoyingly execrable doing his bastard son of a thousand idiots who imitate Marlon Brando's routine acting method, Michael Lerner dancing with Omar Epps and ?? no, that's it. Oh, Clare Danes has a nice smile in one go. And Dennis Farina has the feeling of being killed soon. Honestly, the most useless film ever made, it's like Humanite without jokes but, you know, for children.
