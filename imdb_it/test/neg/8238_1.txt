I took this film and I was horrified to discover that the film is based on the rape of a young girl whose parents knowingly carry their daughter. My first thoughts were that I never felt more ashamed of being an Indian than a Hindu. I found this movie to be really terrifying. Please don't waste your time. As for the music, there are at most 2 horrible songs and the film used is cheap. Beautiful scenes are not what India is known for. I just hope I shed light on how disgusting this movie is. Yes, it could highlight how bad people in power can be, especially when it comes to religion, but sitting and watching almost 2 hours of this film can make anyone almost laugh. If you're looking for a good Indian movie, check out something from director Mira Nair.
