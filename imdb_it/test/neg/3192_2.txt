Probably one of the worst films ever made, I'm still trying to figure out if it was meant to be fun, but I certainly didn't enjoy it at all. Perhaps the film has lost something during the English-Italian translation, I don't know, for sure I lack the courage to look at it again in the original version. <br /> <br /> My rate for this 2/10, and I feel like I'm pretty generous (let's say that 1 point is for Liv because she's a good girl, and the other point is for those decent actors who were trapped in a useless, useless and pathetic movie) <br /> <br /> Take Care Alex
