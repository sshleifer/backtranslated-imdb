Wow, what's on the shelf of the video rental shop in front of me? Nothing but a questionable "sequel" to 8MM. It was not a great sequel to a film that had a very final ending and an abundance of emotional depth much greater than this movie. <br /> <br /> Basically, from the profile of the plot, an American diplomat, David Huxley, and his girlfriend, Tish Harrington, venture into the sordid underground world of sex and pornography in Budapest, Hungary to find out who is blackmailing with a porn video of them with a prostitute, Risa. The whole story is based on the various characters that make up these various sex clubs and joint strips throughout the city. The mystery is solved when, in the end, Tish discovers that the ransom money for the video and (essentially later in the story) his girlfriend who left his trust fund are basically going back to his future husband as the story unfolds until in the end bitter. <br /> <br /> I didn't like how this had nothing to do with the original 8MM. The only thing close to the original is the kind of thriller it was, the fact that David ends up with a kind of slavery about him to keep him prisoner seems like the vicious world of the first movie, and the fact that the whole movie he has the noble sex in almost all the key scenes. Otherwise, it's a completely different film. He made a bad love story, even before the end is known, which makes the end more a possibility because I didn't believe the words that came out of David's mouth all the time. But we were warned that he was a liar on most things that could get him into trouble. <br /> <br /> There were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the "shocking" moments of the film, which were trying to arouse emotions in the audience to cheer for Tish to understand the plot so that he could leave this sexual debauchery "hellish". I counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to show. Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing more than movies with naked women on it to make the DVD look totally provocative. <br /> <br /> David was not a hero for the whole film. You could imagine that it was the main problem long before the end. The actors who played each role were all new to me, which could explain how they got so many of them to strip to get "respect". There were holes in the plot (how did David and Richard finally hit Tish's father by getting the lease they wanted when David was so taken by this damn investigation to try to find a prostitute?) There were technological moments of style ( like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen), and a gay character who did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character. Even the tag line on this profile for this video is complete, because it wasn't even a last breath. No one really dies. But they had a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere ... but they were good 10 seconds on an hour and 3/4 of a movie. <br /> <br /> Go and rent (and maybe buy) the original. It is one of the best and most original films by Joel Schumacher. It has everything better from this movie. I wouldn't recommend seeing it unless you want to compare apples with oranges.
