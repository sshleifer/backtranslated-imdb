I'm rather surprised that anyone has found this moving or moving film. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of the film seemed to me an excellent, albeit provocative, idea for a film about a rare type of relationship, but one (if I can judge from the real life examples I have known) it is extremely deep and loving. <br /> <br /> However, the film is scripted cheaply - badly scripted - and although it has a number of very nice shots, I didn't find anything special. <br /> <br /> Probably the biggest problem is that it is too short and poorly composed to give the public enough time to invest, emotionally, in the characters: we don't really care about any of them, and therefore their stress and obstacles they don't really touch us. <br /> <br /> I think of a REMAKE - from the script up - with the development of some characters by some really good writers - it could greatly improve it. It is instructive to compare this film with Brokeback Mountain, which the writers brought to much higher levels than those of the screenwriter - screenwriters who were clearly aware of how to write a classic tragedy and performed their task with care, planning and superb mastery! However, people just seem to redo those movies that don't need them! You really don't miss anything if you skip this: I found it really very disappointing, and it was saved only by getting a 1-star from me by virtue of the audacity and anxiety that it took to make a film about this delicate subject .
