I found myself more and more angry when the film progressed. <br /> <br /> Basically, Dr. Crawford (Dennis Hopper) predicted that a meteor would hit the earth. The "powers that are" do not believe him and decides to build a refuge for survival within a mountain for a small collection of people. <br /> <br /> Jake Lowe (Peter Onorati) is a bit ugly about his makeshift reporter for a scruffy tabloid who receives a tip from a friend who thought he was dead that something was happening in the mountains. He undertakes to investigate. <br /> <br /> While trying to enter the secret shelter for survival Jake spends a great deal of time shooting at people or beating them at an inch of their lives. He spends the rest of his time attacking Dr. Crawford on who gave the doctor the right to decide which people should survive the meteor. <br /> <br /> I found myself wishing that Jake would do a great favor to the future and turn a gun on himself. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this turkey.
