Why???? What a disgusting disgust of an alleged movie ... from the poster it looked like a nice movie .. what a disappointment .. who the hell is the male protagonist? He looks like an old retired retired cop ... I'm a cop and I can say ... the man can't act ... go back to being a cop ... no screen presence ... because they showed his naked hello, like it's Mel Gibson, what the hell not ... put the director out of action ... this guy has no business doing a movie ... I seriously doubt that gay men or women find him attractive ... anyone cast the film is a talentless hack that has no talent hack in the head .. it's nice that we white guys are always getting asian women but because a nasty white man why not dean cain or brad pitt as the white guy .. why Do Asian women like ugly white or black types in what I see ??? I don't understand .. it must be low self-esteem .. <br /> <br /> The only sexy girl who can act in the film was Kate Holliday..because there was a warm white chick among all the rest the ugly chicks Asians who think they are hot and can act ??? <br /> <br /> Only two actors in this film, the Poetry Guest at the end of the film and the only warm white chick in the masseuse .. TL Young and Kate Holliday should have been the protagonists of the film .. < br /> <br /> The Asia Character was ridiculous, it seemed that he was trying too hard to be a kind of black ghetto / sexy girl ... the key word here is "try" .. Gina .. you can't act and not you are physically sexy enough for this kind of role .. you have to play character roles and be more humble in your presentation car .. <br /> <br /> I think the actress is Gina Hirazumi ... I saw her on IMDb and she is a great Asian actress ???? if that's the case, I don't want to see what the bad Asian American actresses are. <br /> <br />. No wonder Hollywood has no Asian American actors !!! if this is the best they got !!! were they supposedly winning some sort of Asian film award ?? give me a break ... it seemed they had just made a movie for the sake of putting a bunch of Asian girls in them ... they're not even hot..Jina ... you're not sexy .. stop trying .. play the character roles and improves your acting .. you're not a leading female type ... <br /> <br /> If this movie makes money, pigs can fly ... apologize for being so candid but I feel that these actors / actresses need to improve or work on their craft: with the exception of the two actors I mentioned, who should have been protagonists .. I say this in love for all the Asian girls who star in the film, please do what they say your parents and go and be doctors / lawyers / and engineers ... and act sideways for fun..wellly that's what you are doing now .. I'm not trying to be bad, but I hope this will be read and I'll push you to get better or do another business .. there wasn't any mmeno a message ethically in this film .. <br /> <br /> I would not be surprised if "Soap Girls" was secretly financed by members of the Ku Klux Kl a special department of propaganda of the Asian American hatred of the Klan <br /> .. Otherwise the Asians have to hate themselves ... seeing this movie makes me grateful to the viewer that I'm not Asian ... you guys are pathetic. . You have a little respect for yourself, Asian people.
