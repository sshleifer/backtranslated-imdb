First of all, the Mexican werewolf in the Texas title is misleading as many others have pointed out. Actually it is El Chupacabra, which is a werewolf-like creature, but it is not the same thing at all. <br /> <br /> Production and assembly are simply disgusting. When it was all over, I probably wouldn't be able to give a very accurate description of exactly what the Chupacabra looked like, because every time he was in a scene (despite one or two exceptions) the camera was all shaking and you could only see the face of the monster clearly. The special effects were ridiculous, but you can expect a low-budget horror movie. <br /> <br /> Along with the terrible production come the bad actors. Now a couple offers quite plausible shows (Erika Fay and Martine Hughes), but then there were the bad actors (all the others), who seemed to have no emotion when people died. Then there is the absolutely terrible actor (Sara Erikson), who gives one of the 2 worst performances I've ever seen in a movie. I mean my god, she was indescribably bad. <br /> <br /> The plot was very simple. Basically, a Chupacabra is in a small Texas town that kills local residents and a group of teenagers try to stop it. However, even if the plot was so simple, some holes in the plot have managed to leak out. <br /> <br /> However, horrible film. However, if you're looking for a movie to tease and laugh with your friends one night, this would be pretty good. My friends and I enjoyed watching this. Probably the second worst movie I've ever seen, 1/10. Terrible.
