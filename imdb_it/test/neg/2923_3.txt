A very disappointing film by Oliver Stone that, unlike his recent epic "J.F.K.", fails to stimulate any kind of real emotion. "Talk Radio" talks about the talk-back master "Barry Champlain", a very noisy and opinion-filled man who can upset a lot of people and yet still attract an audience, most of whom think you just want call and abuse him. His boss in the film (Alec Baldwin) sums up his character very well by saying that he is just a shoe seller with a big mouth. And as Barry (Eric Bogosian) gets the threat of death over the threat of death, the end result is almost inevitable. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of film that usually has something very powerful to say. However, "Talk Radio" fails to make a serious comment and remains a frustrating and useless film. <br /> <br /> Thursday 17 September 1992 - Video
