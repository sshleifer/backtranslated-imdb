The creators of this film must have sat down one day and said "let's make fun of the Russians and at the same time show people how advanced we are (Americans)". The film portrays the Russians as an inferior people who cannot understand the brilliant ideas advanced by the Americans. It is true that American campaigns are probably more professional and based on expensive studies than in other countries. However, this film goes far and exaggerates the differences between East and West. To me it looked like a propaganda film made during the Cold War.
