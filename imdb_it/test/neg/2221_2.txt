Sweetly fun and aware cheezy - but what else could it be? Cushing in one of his poorest roles, and he often sounds nicknamed. McClure is too convinced to be believed, but who can blame him in the wasteland of this film whose plot on ancient reigning human dinosaur birds has the "charm of the period" of the 19th century, but not enough and unfortunately the script carries racist connotations of the literary genre in films. Nice work by the actors, but a poorly designed production.
