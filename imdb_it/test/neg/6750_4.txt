This was obviously a low budget movie. Show in every scene. What is nice to see is where it was made. Much of the film was shot in Columbia, California, in the Sierra Nevada mountains near Sonora, California. Part of the film was also shot in Jamestown, California, very close to Columbia. There is a railway museum in Jamestown and they used some of the old trains in the picture. "High Noon" was also shot in Jamestown, as was "Back to the Future III".
