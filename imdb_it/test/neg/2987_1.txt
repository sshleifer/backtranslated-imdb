I have no idea how it is rated so high (5.8 at the time of writing), but this film was absolutely horrible. The acting was not entirely negative, but in reality it did not make any sense and the general quality was poor. Obviously it's a B movie (or C if there is such a thing) and it looks like it was made during a weekend in a friend's house or something. I like all the low-budget films and I generally watch everyone I've met, but that's really bad. I mean "The Fanglys" badly. I don't know what else to say, but I trust this, because I actually sat through this horrible and horrible film and I can spare you the effort ... Don't worry. Seriously ... Don't do it.
