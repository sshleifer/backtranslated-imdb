First of all and for the most part I would just like to say that I returned from retirement for writing deserved comments on horrible films. Only the movie called "Scarecrow gone wild" could bring me back, so here I am. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I like to start with this comment. OUCH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This film was really horrible, I mean, I know it would have been bad. But I had no idea that I would have spent 60 minutes of a possible 90-minute movie laughing at what I thought was a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the biggest flaw in the movie (to me that is). Ken Shamrock. Now if the memory serves me correctly, Shamrock is one of the most dangerous men in the world. Now if I still need memory, it was also in this stupid movie like a stupid comic relief (or so it seemed to me). I mean, how else do you explain all his lines. My favorite phrase of all time in this so-called movie was "It's been a long time". OK ????????? The funniest thing about that sentence was that no more than five minutes before he said so, he was sitting on the beach talking to the boys who would soon die on how the scarecrow dam could not be killed. So if he is aware of it, why will he ever try to fight it as soon as he sees it (the scarecrow that). As I said before, it must have been the comic relief, except I don't think his fellow UFC are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Now that I've finished that well-deserved movie paragraph /> <br /> I have to admit that I can't remember a lot of scenes, and this is not good considering that I watch the movie no more than fifteen minutes ago. So what I'm about to do is list the first five things that don't go in this movie 1. Usually when horror movie monsters have their own theme music, they're not heard by victims or even by the monster itself. So, because there were almost all the people involved in this movie able to here this pathetic whistle. I mean, I saw the face of the scarecrows and nothing said it was the kind of whistle. <br /> <br /> 2. Because there were never killers on a beach. I'm sorry, but I threw the story out. Beaches are associated with feelings of celebration and vacation. But I guess this horror movie thought it would be such a success that it would change everything. Also it was me or the beach seemed to have the size of someone in the living room. I mean every time an actor or actress ran on the beach, they seemed to be running in the same spot. <br /> <br /> 3. The girl who runs in the gray suit pants. This really disturbs during the duration of this film. I mean, he looks so ridiculous. He also didn't help anyone who looked like he was the youngest of the whole group. I mean what she liked twelve or something. There is no excuse for someone to be so skinny on the camera. I mean, the camera doesn't add something like ten pounds or something, so what was its excuse. <br /> <br /> 4. People try to get record deals on the camera. Just when I thought this movie couldn't have any acclaim, the desire to be Gorth Brooks came out and oh man it was lame. I don't remember the whole scene, but from what I remember it wasn't nice. This guy starts singing this song about something that has nothing, and I don't mean anything to do with what's going on in the movie. The most fun part of the whole event is how everyone seems to like this. I mean, the only person who doesn't really know how to react to this is the "token black guy". And this is sad because if I am not mistaken it was he who encouraged this latest addition to American Idoal. But here is where it becomes fun. While this guy is all in his new song or whatever. In the distant distance we see or kill the scarecrow. And the boy seems more excited about this. I mean, actually there is a time when he seems to be really jealous of this guy. So what he does for this jealousy, well, I'm glad you ask. He waits for the boy to finish his song, and then the boy will finish. I don't want to give away the scene of death, but I can tell you this. If that scene doesn't make you laugh, then nothing on this earth will do it. <br /> <br /> 5. This film was much longer than I expected. And it didn't help that they tried to snatch some pathetic bull in the end to squeeze another 10 minutes from this movie. I mean, I admit, I didn't see the turning point, but it had a lot to do with the fact that I hoped the film was finished and finished. But no, they had to make it distort s ** t. Needless to say, when I say it's coming, I have just turned off the T.V. and I said f ** k, it is not possible that the film got worse. Thanks to my fairly quick judgment I can say that I'll never know what happens next. But I promise that I don't care !!!!!!!!!!!!! Everything and the movie is good for a laugh, but please don't buy it. Just post it on one of your friends and watch it out there.
