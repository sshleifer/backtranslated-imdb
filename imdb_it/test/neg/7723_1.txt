I'm sorry, but they left the impression that these commandos fought the zombies first. But surely they don't behave as if they've seen a zombie before. Jumping and turning their backs on them as amateurs. Second, the characters are written rather badly. The actors did the best they could with what was given, blamed for bad writing and bad direction. Finally, and here is where the spoiler warnings are higher. They lose the champion twice and the girl Jennifer Holland doesn't know if it was a little or less. How stupid is it? As much as it hurts to be bitten, you might think that you would know it, in addition to liters of blood trickling from your body is a good clue. Foolish, the first film had its flaws, but it has a re-watchablity, unlike this disaster of a movie, which I could barely get over once. I give the HOUSE OF THE DEAD 2: NO GUTS, ALL THE STUPIDITY THE CRAP-O-LANTERN
