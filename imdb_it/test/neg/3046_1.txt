This movie is bad. Really bad. So bad made me want to shoot me in the forehead. I hated this movie First of all, the plot went absolutely nowhere and in the 30-second teaser trailer something shocking was seen for this movie. Secondly, anyone who has seen the original in 1979 knows that it was a bad movie and completely unworthy of a remake. By far the best part of the film is the house in which it takes place. Which isn't saying much for the actual movie. There were parts in the film when the music becomes very suspenseful and you're sure someone is around the corner and it turns out it's the maid or the cat, but when someone is really around the corner it's impossible to even be scared because you were expecting the whole movie. So save yourself, save time, save headaches and watch the trailer. It makes absolutely no sense to see this film, not in the theater, not on DVD, not on TV, never.
