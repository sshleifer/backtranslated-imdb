This film is a bad movie but to get a nutritional value I recommend watching it again with Rosemary's Baby. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to learn by seeing how different directors can draw different performances from the same actors who play the same characters. Observe Minnie Castevet (Ruth Gordon) and the good work she did in the first film compared to the terrible performance in this film. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to see how the same characters were played by different actors. Which leads me to wonder if anyone involved in the sequel was aware of the first movie and some of them saw Rosemary's Baby before doing so? <br /> <br /> If your interest in movies is purely superficial, it is best to avoid this. I have a lot more to say about this movie, but I really don't want to go there.
