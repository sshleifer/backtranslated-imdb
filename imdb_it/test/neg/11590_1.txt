Where do I start? First of all, the story sucks. Acting sucks, the effects really suck, I think I'll start with the story. The story of Komodo vs Cobra: number one, does not explain how or when Komodo and the cobra also arrived. Or for that, how it was created. Acting: TERRIBLE! It seems that the director just took some people out of the street (which is probably what he did). And last and certainly the least, the effects: they are so horrible that the komodo doesn't even look like a komodo, just a dinosaur, which seems incredibly unrealistic. The water does not even move when the cobra appears. All in all: terrible piece of shit, don't even think about renting it.
