The little T-Rex is at liberty in a small western town, prompting Sheriff Eric Roberts and animal control agent Melissa Brasselle (who goes through his role in a very disinterested way) to get to the bottom of things. They discover that a mad scientist (Corbin Bernsen) is, unbeknownst to the government's sponsorship, continuing with a long-abandoned US research project called Operation Jurassic Storm (he!) Creating an army of dinosaurs in an isolated underground laboratory. In a short time, our heroes get trapped inside, the marines are called, the power goes out and the dinosaurs are free to make a quick lunch to all those who manage to put their claws and their jaws. <br /> <br /> Despite an often inextinguishable script, full of holes in the plot, inconsistencies of character and limits, this direct copy on video of JURASSIC PARK and CARNOSAUR is fairly digestible garbage, thanks to good production values, passable FX , occasional laughter and a lot of mindless actions. <br /> <br /> Someone pointed out that an opening scene in this film was stolen by CARNOSAUR, but anyone used to watching Roger Corman's productions knows that it allows filmmakers to freely reuse clips from his first films to save time and money. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
