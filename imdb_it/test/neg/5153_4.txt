I will say one thing for Herman, in the United States: he will probably always play well with the Minnesota public. I can't imagine that there is another place in the world where a reference to Bemidji's fast life or a phrase like "I knew there was something wrong with Iowa boys" would have brought the house down. Actually, I liked the first hour enough. Basically, a group of lonely country boys brings out a personal announcement and finds his city besieged by willing female suitors (are suitors a gender-specific word?). It is not progressive, of course, but it is certainly fascinating in its own right. Too bad the filmmakers felt the need to tack on a sub-plot invented on a conniving golddigger and her violent husband. Overall it's just too cloying for his own good, but you have to give some props to a movie with the courage to give a guy with Kevin Chamberlin's construction a naked love scene. I will always applaud the depiction of people who do not respect the usual standards of beauty as loving human beings, but it is not enough to redeem Herman, USA. To paraphrase Jello Biafra, it is the nostalgia of an era that never existed.
