Perhaps we are too attached to the big shows when we hear about the antiquity brought to the screen. Perhaps we expect too much from these films. However, if we, as spectators, are offered too little, what happens then? <br /> <br /> This is what I thought after seeing IMPERIUM - NERONE by Paul Marcus, a part of the production series on the Roman Empire. AUGUSTUS by Roger Young, the first IMPERIUM film, included at least Peter O'Toole but what does this film include? <br /> <br /> Almost nothing specific. The historical errors are so serious that the film changes facts and rather constitutes a distorted image of the Roman Empire of true history. During the film, we see Nero Giovane: young during the presumably long reign of Caligola, young during the reign of Claudius and finally during his reign (historically 14 years). And ... he dies anyway. According to the film, Nero, born during the reign of Tiberius, lives for more than 40 years but seems to be in his thirties when he dies ... Continuity with invented history is the biggest problem of the film, which makes it not logical, not to mention trustworthy. Nero loses his father, he is raised by slaves. At that time, his mother, Agrippina, is exiled from Caligula. Later, however, he suddenly married the emperor Claudius, who already had sons and just married him Messalina. In these moments of the film, we see Acte (Rike Schmid), Nero's lover. Okay, it's historically "accurate"; however, no source shows that it played such a decisive role in the rise of Christianity in Rome. In the film, she is not only a devout Christian, but also a witness to the miracle of Saint Paul (brings a young girl Marzia back to life). Moreover, historically, there was nothing similar to Nero seen on the court of Caligula since Nero was born in the kingdom of Caligula which lasted 4 years (37-41 AD). I understand that movies can change something but such an error makes the script absolutely unreliable! And many, many other shortcomings related to the contents that are difficult to enumerate but after 30 minutes of watching this film, I doubted that I was watching a historical film or a total fantasy. <br /> <br /> As for its artistic features that provide us entertainment, they are just as lame as the story here. The performances are artificial, the cast simply has beautiful faces but weak acting skills. Perhaps, I am too attached to Peter Ustinov or Charles Laughton in the head, but Hans Matheson does not adapt to Nero at all. He could have some of the good moments as an actor, but never as the notorious Roman emperor. Is an artist burning Rome for a song? Is a cynic who hides love from his relatives? Is he a cruel ruler who sacrifices the lives of thousands of innocent people for "supposed justice"? None of these. He is just a young man who does not know how to govern and, in the long run, begins to release the fire that burns inside him ... John Simm is out of place in this film as Caligula and absolutely inferior to the other portraits of the character film. Elisa Tovati is just as sexy as Poppea; yet it could have been much better. The costumes are inaccurate and the sets are not surprising. A low budget translates into low effects and, consequently, low entertainment. <br /> <br /> But what made me more angry in this film and, consequently, I give them 1/10 are some absolutely unacceptable moments: <br /> <br /> - the death of Poppea and the speech of St. Paul with Nero to his corpse, <br /> <br /> - mention of Claudius on the current conquest of Britain on the occasion of the feast and soon of his death (he conquered Britannia while Messalina was his wife long before his death), <br /> <br /> - Tigellinus kills Agrippina (Laura Morante), mother of Nero, <br /> <br /> - Nero's arguments in the speech to the senators, <br /> <br / > - finally, the death of Nero - a calm day at the lake and an indifferent suicide that leads to a morality called by Acte "Let us forgive" <br /> <br /> All in all, this film is a waste of time and it is absolutely useless as another production concerning the Roman Empire. It is better to make a good film in 30 years than ten little ones over 5 years. 1/10 - should not have been done at all.
