I love the old "monster movies" for the pure value of the field. This doesn't disappoint if you find this kind of fun stuff. <br /> <br /> Acting is pure shit from the 50s. You get used to it when you've seen enough of these ... dialogue is very silly and ultimately forgettable. You're just there for the giant bird. <br /> <br /> The "science" in this film is hilarious. A monstrous otherworldly avian capable of manipulating the anti-matter ... intent on unleashing chaos and eating people ... an alien who came to Earth to nest. Some of the best scenes in the film (which have no bird in them) include "scientists" explaining what is happening. <br /> <br /> Much has been said about the ridiculous bird puppet. It looks like a new little bird ... bald and ugly with ruffled feathers. He can even croak like a hungry, angry newbie. However, the bird scared the shit out of my three-year-old son, who had big nightmare nightmares for the evening. It's a bit creepy. <br /> <br /> I was very sad about the scene in which the egg turns. (Somehow the egg is not protected by an antimatter shield.) But I'm a bird lover, what can I say?
