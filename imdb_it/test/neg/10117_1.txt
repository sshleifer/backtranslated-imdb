This is truly one of the most terrible movies of all time. It's boring, ponderous, misinterpreted, and pretentious creeping teeth. I watched for about an hour waiting for a sort of drama to unravel, before realizing that there was none. Shooting a shoe string on the budget was particularly painful. These must be the worst day for night shots since Plan Nine from Outer Space. <br /> <br /> The only feature is barely the ridiculous "demon" who wanders the countryside with a plastic cat basket. How scary is it? And I liked the moggys used as extras, I suppose they are less cheap. Although it seemed a bit obvious that they had been lured into the room by the careful placement of some tunas. <br /> <br /> This movie is so terrible that it should have a public health warning. There was a queue at my local video store when I picked it up, of people asking for their money back. I'm not kidding!
