the film is precious, and the cage is a child. <br /> <br /> but someone will agree with me in saying that the punk representation in this film is ATROCIOUS?!?! <br /> <br /> where is the fight? the Ramones ?? misfits? social distortion? the cramps ?? sex guns?! ANYONE?!?!?!?! the music is that this movie is incredibly disappointing! AT LEAST they play the cure. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Randy's feathered hair and crinkled khaki ... <br /> <br /> this definitely looks like a "punk" movie like a lot of the movie industry squares see punk. <br /> <br /> Even though it's a film from the 90s, punk SLC paints a much more accurate picture of the punk rock scene in the early 1980s. just say.
