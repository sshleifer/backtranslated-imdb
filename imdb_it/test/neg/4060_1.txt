[ATTENTION: some spoilers included, even if it is a documentary.] <br /> <br /> I bought this documentary because I like the work of directors D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus, which includes MOON OVER Broadway, STARTUP.COM and THE WAR ROOM., All the terrifying documentaries I highly recommend. Looking at this ultimately boring and unconvincing account from Depeche Mode's 1988 tour, I realized that they had nothing to do when they went to edit this film together. The band members were certainly less than imminent on the camera; so, undoubtedly, the competition to add fans on a week-long bus trip has been added to liven things up a bit. Really, now, I mean, come on. Who thought a concert film of a synth-pop band with three keyboardists and a singer would be a good idea? Of course, I like the music of Depeche Mode, and Martin Gore writes good melodies, but seeing them in concert never seemed interesting, and this film is a positive test. Unless you're a big Depeche Mode fan, stay away from this documentary ... it's a complete waste of time.
