I loved this movie! It is the best parody of Russian cinema to date. Who else, apart from Sokurov, could have electrocuted Tarkovskij so brilliantly. Did you think "Stalker" was slow? Well, jump to the plate. "Mat i Syn" makes "Stalker" look like "Raiders of the Lost Ark". In no way should you miss this movie! There is no excuse: even if you live a hectic life, you can still enjoy this movie to the full while holding down the fast forward button on the VCR. Sokurov gave us the first feature film that can be appreciated in 12 minutes. I suppose the next great masterpiece of the form will come when someone will have the vision and courage to exhibit a film that consists of no sound or image - 45 minutes of a black and silent screen (not already explored in "In The Soup"? ). Apparently the director (and fans) have forgotten that "motion" is the first word of "film". <br /> <br /> !!! MAIN HOPE FORWARD !!! <br /> <br /> Do you want to reach the heights of the genius that this film has achieved? Here is a detailed guide: <br /> <br /> 1. Find a talented photographer. <br /> <br /> 2. Find some subjects and a suitably picturesque landscape (think of Tuscany!). If you need inspiration, look at some luxury car or perfume ads. <br /> <br /> 3. Shoot around 3 rolls of film. <br /> <br /> 4. Photoshop results to play with saturation, blur and proportions. <br /> <br /> 5. Now just get out of your camera, film 40 of the best photos and make your "actors" murmur off the screen. Don't worry about writing it ahead of time - let the actors give what they want (lines like "Do you want a drink?" And "Let's take something to eat" are really all you need to fill 8 minutes or so). If you can't think of sufficient dialogue - no problem! Just repeat what they say a couple of times. If that's not enough, let the camera work anyway. <br /> <br /> Congratulations, another masterpiece! As a bonus, if you want to distribute it over the internet, no problem! Static images do not compress anything with standard mpeg encoding: a 73-minute movie should probably be around 2-3 megabytes, even at the highest quality levels.
