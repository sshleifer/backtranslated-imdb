Most of the comments on this film are positive, so I thought I'd try to correct the problem. I came out of this movie wondering what was going on. Now I know it and I still consider it a poor film. Initially I served a sequence of dreams that seemed too obvious. I was happy to have a free ticket for the movie or I would have asked for my money back. Film critics and critics love this film, which confirms to me that most of them would rather look smart than the review of how an audience can enjoy a movie. The 8+ rating of this film is so misleading. In 20 years this film will not be comparable to real greats like The Godfather. The film has good performances by both protagonists, but it's not enough to save the film. (nor the lesbian scenes!)
