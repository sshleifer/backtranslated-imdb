Now, I'm a big fan of Zombie movies. I admit that Zombie movies are usually not that good, but I like them anyway. Despite the disgusting acting and worthless dialogues that occur in almost all Zombie movies, this is by far the worst. See, there are some basic rules with zombie movies. 1. Zombies are suicides. Tactics are rarely used and NEVER behave like a boxer. They don't dodge a blow to the head, they take it with a bad smile. They don't try to hit you in the face, they grab your arm and bite it! 2. Zombies cannot speak. Only in the Evil Dead. Otherwise, DON'T TALK. 3. Don't fight zombies with weapons at close range. You get lost in a melee fight against the zombies. Firearms are used. In this film, however, melee is the way to go, which is wrong. Very wrong. <br /> <br /> He had NO ransom quality. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a Zombi movie, see one with an average score above 3 on IMDb.com
