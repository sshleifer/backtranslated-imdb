A young woman, Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander), and her boyfriend, Jess (Joey Mendicino), become targets for a deranged serial killer after stopping for a "comfort break" at a remote roadside refreshment spot. <br /> <Br /> What could have been an effectively frightening chiller in the most competent hands, turns out to be a confused and badly considered disorder under the neglected direction of John Shiban (who also wrote the script). There's a good dose of juicy violence, a brief smattering of nudity and confident performances by the cast, but the silly script leaves the viewer with so many unanswered questions that you can't help but feel disappointed. <br /> <br /> On the surface, the film presents itself as a classic "killer-on-the-loose" film based on clich√©s, but Shiban (a former writer for X-files) throws some subtle supernatural elements which suggest that his goal was something else entirely: a ghost story, with the rest acting as a home for a vengeful specter destined to punish sinners. <br /> <br /> Reading the film, checking the viewer's theories here on IMDb, and watching the extra on the DVD, some elements of the plot begin to make more sense (although, even with the advantage of more information , there are still many questions left unanswered). In my opinion, any film that requires so many investigations to make itself understood (only partially) is not particularly valid.
