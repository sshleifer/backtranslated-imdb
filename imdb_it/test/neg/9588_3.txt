This film tries to pierce the era of the Hollywood studio and the morality of the 50s. Guy Stone is a Rock Hudson type, but both the screenplay and actor Matt Letscher end up channeling a scornful and cruel version of George Hamilton, which makes the character unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Guy Stone is such a reprehensible human being that the public has trouble accepting this waste of human skin. Unlike Hudson, who was gently promiscuous, Stone is a hateful person who consciously uses and then throws away the sweet and beautiful young people who share his bed every few hours. <br /> <br /> Veronica Cartwright is Jerry, Stone manager's lesbian celibate. Cartwright is very good, but the director doesn't know what to do with her. The fault lies in the dialogue, which is a bit clumsy, and the film suffers. <br /> <br /> Carrie Preston's Sally owes a lot to Ellen Greene in "The Little Shop of Horrors". As written, Preston's Sally is good for a laugh but little else. The newcomer Adam Greer is lost in this film. He can't act and seems to have been chosen for his sexy body and good looks. <br /> <br /> Like many recent films, "Straight-Jacket" is a "dramedy" - a comedy film that sprawls in a drama of about two-thirds of the film. And, like most dramas, "Straight-Jacket" fails miserably. <br /> <br /> Despite the expensive Skywalker Sound services, the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. Excessive use of the musical soundtrack also creates a careless amount of signals. <br /> <br /> The film never managed to satirize anything of the 50s. Unlike "Singin 'in the Rain", which perfectly captures Hollywood's ambivalence about the advent of sound and the mindset of the formula film studio, "Straight-Jacket" fails to represent Hollywood in the 1950s at all the effects. The dialogue, the sets and the behavior of the key characters are anonymous rather than stereotypes that died in the 1950s in Hollywood. The same can be said for the satire of the general costumes, social trends and trends of the 1950s as a whole. Compare the transformation of Guy's house with the dead satire of the 1950s house in "Little Shop of Horrors". There is no comparison; "Little Shop" hits the nail on the head, while "Straight-Jacket" doesn't even know there's a nail. <br /> <br /> Even the reasons seem to be haphazard. Rick Foster should be a liberal of principles, but he falls almost immediately for a crazy materialist like Guy Stone. Rick has been comfortable with Guy's closet status for many months. But when the time comes to go to Italy, it becomes in conflict for reasons that are not clear. And even if Sally seems to fall in love with Freddie during the party, this plot point disappears a few minutes later without comment. Rick comes out as a gay man in the 1990s, not a gay author from the 1950s. Indeed, modern morality suffuses this film - which it should not, if it were indeed a satirical look at homophobia in 1950s Hollywood. There are also holes in the plot of this ragtag film. Saul repeatedly says he is going to send Freddie Stevens to the feds, but he never does, allowing Freddie to get out of Guy. The plot of Jerry and Saul for "inside" Guy never makes sense, nor does Sally's sudden decision to blame him. And although Guy has admitted to being a homosexual, apparently it doesn't matter and ends up with a famous star and playwright. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, none of the production values ​​can save this film. Michael Pinkey's cinematography is pedestrian. Sometimes, the film looks almost like a movie shot rather than a movie (especially the scenes in Saul's office). Everything is limited to medium shots and the film is incredibly static. Even the editing of Chris Conlee does not help the film. Long scenes that would benefit from entering close-ups or changes in viewpoint remain uncut. It is not clear if this is due to lack of coverage or bad editing, but the overall effect is to create a sense of lethargy. <br /> <br /> The film relies heavily on the CGI effects of Guy's house, created by the visual effect designer Thomas Dickens. But the CGI looks awkward and hokey, and is very remarkably amateur. <br /> <br /> My general impression of this film is that jokes are cheap and easy, the plot confused, the characterizations wildly incoherent and distant mark, the satire non-existent, the executions extravagant and out of the mark, and comic free time. It's almost an amateur movie. It's like someone taking a high school production and throwing $ 10 million.
