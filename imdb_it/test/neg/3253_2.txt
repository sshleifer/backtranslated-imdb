Have you heard the theory of cloning redundancy, in which a copy is poorer than the original? Caddyshack 2 is a perfect example of this. They try to duplicate everything from the first movie. Now, in some cases this work. Robert Stack is actually a little bit better than Ted Knight, when they play essentially the same character. I really like Randy Quaid, who is neither more nor less offensive than Bill Murray in the original. But Jackie Mason is not Rodney Dangerfield, and worst of all, C2 has proved once and for all that Dan Ackroyd is one of the worst comedians of all time. There is very little I like, and C2 nailed the coffin in his "comic" career for me. He seems to feel the same way, clinging more to the tuff like Driving Miss Daisy and hosting Psi-Factor. Besides that, it's mostly, "been there, done that" for Caddyshack 2. Look at the original twice rather than each version once, and you'll get more for the rental money.
