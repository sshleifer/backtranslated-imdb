I tried to watch it twice, even though I wasn't able to go through both episodes. For me, it's basically not fun. I can tell where I should be laughing, but I can't. I've never seen the original, so I'm not comparing. I also love comedies, including comedies like Married ... With Children and Family Guy, but this show doesn't do it for me. The jokes are lame and flat, and the acting is mostly annoying. Advertisements have made it seem interesting, but it is not. They are trying too hard to be different, and they tie to force humor. That style doesn't usually work too well. I don't think this show will end the season. Of course, I could be wrong.
