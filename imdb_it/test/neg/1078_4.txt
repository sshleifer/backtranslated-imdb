I was really disappointed with this movie. Great actors, and potentially a great plot, but it just seemed to be limping. <br /> <br /> Charlize Theron was masterful in her role and beautiful, but it seemed that 90% of her screen work was in car chases made with Austin Minis. The positioning of the product went wrong, so it was very wrong. <br /> <br /> The management also seemed wrong. Edward Norton is the villain, and it was so obvious from the start. Every time the camera passed over him, it would have lasted too long and Norton would have made a face or something. Come on, Hollywood, give us some credit! It's okay to surprise us with a twist without having to telegraph. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this movie was just below average. I have always been one to appreciate the work and talent of a film, but this does not have it.
