This film is full of pseudo depth of thought and is cloying in its script, which includes a boxed voiceover and an incredible dialogue. The dialogue is metallic and dull in the way that Spike sometimes (not always) is when he writes "certain" characters. For those who like nonsensical films like Pieces of April and One Hour Photo, this is another one for you. <br /> <br /> That said, this comment is nothing against Ryan Gosling who showed his fantastic ribs in The Believer. A film that shows that films are a director's medium, and when a film is rotten it is fair to say that the blame is there and not in the actors.
