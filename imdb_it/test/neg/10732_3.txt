A killer (John Karlen) with a penchant for really bad disguises (Afro wig on a white guy?) He goes around in his van looking for victims. Detective DeCarlo (James Luisi) is on the case and finds the killer rather easily simply by stepping out of the local pool and looking for someone who looks strange (again, the afro wig comes into play). Following the killer at his home, DeCarlo decides to create a risky puncture involving a female police psychologist. <br /> <br /> Inspired by the crimes of Ted Bundy before being captured, KILLER'S DELIGHT is a rather predictable and cheap deadly serial. Director Jeremy Hoenack has no idea how to retouch a movie or even make it full of suspense. He knows how to show a lot of close-ups of the killer wringing his hands! The only thing that really took is the atmosphere of the 70s captured (watch out for the bathroom wallpaper). Well, this is a negative ending. The Media Blasters / Shriek Show DVD has a lot of nice things even though it includes an audio commentary by Hoenack and Karlen, plus video interviews, trailers and an alternative opening.
