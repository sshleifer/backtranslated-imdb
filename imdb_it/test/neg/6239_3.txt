Don't watch this movie, go see something else ... I was very disappointed, I can't rate this movie better than 3. The acting was pretty good and I really liked William Dafoe as the villain, but I can't understand why this movie arrived on the big screen. The story was old and was shown in over 100 films and over 1000 TV / film series. The main problem was basically: nothing is happening. Take a kidnapping, let the villain give the kidnapped wife the money, make the police look stupid and boring and extend it to 95 minutes, you have your "Clearing" movie. The only 2 reasons why I did not evaluate this 1 were a) Dafoe and b) the "B-plan-final". There are not many endings you can give a kidnapper movie ... 75% of these end up with A, 20% end up with B and 1% end up with something unpredictable. Boring, boring, boring
