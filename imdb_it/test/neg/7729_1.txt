It is almost embarrassing to say that I even saw this movie. I mean, it doesn't take much to create a good zombie movie in addition to good special effects, lots of blood and blood, some scary moments and a decent storyline. House of the Dead 2 does one of these things right? No, not one. Of course, it's not as bad as his predecessor, by Uwe Bowle, and that's the only thing about this movie that scares me. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this film is infamous, with lines like "What do you do to live?" in response "I kill zombies" and "I was never a disk jockey, I was a soldier." The special effects are embarrassing even for a TV movie, I mean seriously, the zombies all look bloody with swelling lips. The base of the army in this film is a garage, with a desk and an open room. This film is such a low budget that you can't even get the co-ed locker rooms. In reality it seems that this entire film was shot in a middle school. <br /> <br /> Also, why are all the women in this movie models? And that's why everyone in this movie is so indifferent to what's going on that they simply let the zombies kill them. Hell, a boy approaches to feed the zombie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film also makes the worst of the Scifi Channel movies.
