I saw the movie at the premiere of Lawrence, Kansas. This shocking story of a group of licentious high school students who kill the competition for the prom queen was simply horrible. It fails for many reasons: bad acting, bad script, no clear point. But above all it seemed that the filmmakers were saying - "Hey, I have some money, so let's make a movie!" - without really thinking about it. Sorrowfully most of the independent films that do not suffer from that mentality alone. They simply don't seem to realize that it takes more than money to make a good movie ... or in this case, even a watchable one. With this film I am not ashamed to say that if I didn't know any of the crew, I would have left. Simple like that.
