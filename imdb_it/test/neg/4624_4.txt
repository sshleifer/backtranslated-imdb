This film started with some promises: a big name cast, good looking set, but then it fell apart. <br /> <br /> Most of the time you can't tell if it's a serious movie or a comedy. One minute they are talking about how there is no joy in killing and next there is a fighting scene set on funny music and funny jokes. <br /> <br /> Some performances are quite negative, mainly by Patrick Swayze and Piper Perabo. He also has some big lines like: "When I get married, it will be about love". Uh. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this movie is that it's just boring. Not enough action, not enough humor, not enough plot, not much of anything actually. Just a lot of clich√©s and moments of sweetness. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, a film with "Dragon" in the title should contain many more dragons than the few (and pathetic CGI dragons) that have appeared in this film. <br /> <br /> The SciFi channel cannot show * any * good movie?
