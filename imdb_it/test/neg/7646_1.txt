Apparently the film has a bitter anti-Bush message ... If it does (I don't understand it), that's all. It is a boring and useless time. <br /> <br /> It's too serious sometimes to be a comedy, too slow to be a thriller, not funny, not compelling, not exciting, not cinematic. It is all too much to be the other way around, and vice versa. I was amazed at how bad a movie can be. I didn't even think about watching it. <br /> <br /> I've seen literally hundreds of movies, and I've never been so compelled to write a warning on IMDb. Avoid at all costs. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> Even "The Making of ..." is painfully boring. It's just people talking nonsense with a lot of jokes inside the camera, a kind of home movie. There is also a part where a guy takes you on a food tour that was consumed on the set by the film crew. Anyway, beat the film I guess ...
