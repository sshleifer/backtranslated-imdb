Because whenever I mention this film to someone, I have to listen to 10 minutes of praise about it. I have come to the conclusion that any film that has an extra touch is considered "brilliant" by anyone who looks at it. Is this really what the movie has become? Or is it that every time someone says "Wow, it's so beautiful" everyone has to agree with them and they don't have a personal opinion? The way this film has a rating of 7.5 is a disgrace to the film industry in general. It's also become another movie that "needs" two sequels for this, so I'll have to hear about this horrible franchise for a while yet. <br /> <br /> Now for the movie and why it's so bad. The original concept of it is not so bad, as there hasn't been a good serial killer in a while. The script of this film is horrible as well as executive. OK, so it's a low budget movie, but this shouldn't change the story or the writing. The actors could not be worse in their attempt to make us afraid of this murderer or simply to be afraid of this film. So they go out and take a big name in Danny Glover, but his talents (whatever those are) are wasted because HIS CHARACTER IS WITHOUT DOUBT. Why was he even in this movie? What his whole fight was in the end turned out to be useless and misleading for what the public believes is happening. This is obviously the intent of filmmakers, but there couldn't have been a better way to do it without making us look at all that junk. And then comes the "big" turn (was this the third or fourth?) And the whole audience is shocked and leaves the theater as if it were a kind of masterpiece. Of course, the film makes people talk about the plot and what doesn't, but that wasn't the only flaw in this film. Management was trying to be too creative with what he was working with, and flashback sequences were used simply as a shock effect. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, even if you enjoyed it, go back and review the movie and you will soon understand why it is not worthy of the praise it is receiving. If you haven't, check out Se7en for a fantastic serial killer movie. This is what this movie wanted to be. I have discussed more topics on this film than probably others and will continue to argue against it. Please do not support this franchise not only for your own good, but also for mine and for everyone else. Hollywood needs to find a good horror movie to do, rather than 1,000 remakes, sequels and "shock" movies (like this one). Oh yes, the tag tag 2 looks really promising: "Oh yes, there will be blood." Yaaayyyy !!!! Sweet!! blood, this must mean its true right? Give me a break. Sorry everyone who loves this movie, but bad writing, flashy direction and bad acting don't make a good movie.
