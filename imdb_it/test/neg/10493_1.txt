Mixing small town sheriffs, high school students, fake rock music, and some weird kills for, well, no reason in particular, this movie is essentially a re-creation of "The Giant Gila Monster" - except without the monster of Gila, of course. <br /> <br /> Now, anyone who has seen "Giant Gila Monster" knows that it is one of the worst movies of all time, often so slow, it's not even funny. And I can't believe that in 1967, "Giant Gila Monster" had gained such a reputation that the young directors were dying to get to work on a sequel, not to mention a remake. So someone will explain to me why this movie was made?! The dance sequence, among other things, is historically interesting, although about three years old; but this too is ruined, since it continues ... and on ... and ... on ....
