In the mid-1800s, Irishman Dennis Hopper (in the role of Daniel Morgan) emigrated to Australia, looking for a part of the continent's gold. Instead, Mr. Hopper finds himself marked and thrown into a tortuous prison; there, he is gang-raped. Upon leaving, Hopper connects with the aborigine David Gulpilil (as Billy), with whom he seeks revenge against the sadistic Bill Hunter (like Sergeant Smith), Jack Thompson (as Detective Mainwaring) and others. In the end, revenge becomes heroism; Hopper is admired and assisted by the common people and hunted by corrupt and powerful authorities. Hopper's "poorly human" performance certainly fits the bumpy feel of the film. Gulpilil is the head of a supporting cast. The staff involved in "Mad Dog Morgan" is not only worth a look, but also a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> *** Mad Dog Morgan (1976) Philippe Mora ~ Dennis Hopper, David Gulpilil, Bill Hunter
