I remember this bomb coming out in the early 1980s. At first it seemed like a great idea. A reinterpretation of an American classic with the help of modern cinema techniques of the day. There was a bit of a lash on the treatment of the original "Lone ranger", Clayton Moore. The movie studio had threatened legal action if Moore continued to play himself as the true lone ranger. (Moore performed in children's hospitals as a lone ranger for sick children). For many Americans Clayton Moore was just that; the one and only ranger. I had always thought that the study could do justice to both the fans and the legacy of the lone ranger if Moore was treated better. Maybe even a cameo in the new movie. Why this was not the case, and many of the viewers remained in droves. History and acting were also weak. All this added to a big box office bomb, and rightly so. Personally, I'm glad the studio lost a lot of money after the way the real lonely ranger was treated. Don't treat an American icon like this.
