This is by far the worst and most stupid show I've ever seen on TV. It is almost physically painful to see an adult (well over the age of twenty) doing nothing but torturing and teasing his parents, who always seem to have the faintest idea of ​​the stunts they are forced to endure by their evil son and by his equally stupid friends. Of course I know his parents are inside, but I really hate how they always behave as if they were completely taken by surprise. Everything seems fake. And I really hate the intro of the show, in which a voice above asks "Bam Margera, what will you think of next?!?!" (I think so, anyway), and Bam himself replies: "Whatever the f ^ * k I want!" - WOW! Bam is really an infernal raiser - living at home with mom and dad! - of course the word "f ^ * k" is replaced by a good beep, but we get the message. Bam is the real rebel deal - at least in his eyes. Clearly Bam and his team of numb skulls focus on an audience of teenage boys, and of course it's an MTV show, but please raise the bar a little. It's painfully predictable and stupid, and therefore nothing but boring.
