Good God! This film must have a new classification on the cover "look only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!". I'm disappointed. I couldn't wait to make a good horror movie for the weekend ... I needed an adrenaline rush and that tingling feeling that went down my spine. But this film didn't do it. A pretty good story but acting, dialogues and horrible movies. He was bumpy and sometimes utterly foolish. We had actors looking in the wrong direction of the camera, people talking loudly (by themselves) and telling what they felt and what was going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, stupid cliches like "I just need you to hold me" in totally wrong places and situations. Thank you for allowing me to download and apologize if I had offended anyone, but it was a waste of time and money.
