I know ... I know: it is difficult (if not paradoxical) that there is such a thing as a "credible" fantasy. But, for me, there is also a condition in which TOO disbelief interferes or distracts from my general opinion of the film. The latter was my case with regard to Goliath Awaits. Not only did I have too many unanswered questions about the plot, but also some interpretations, I thought, were a bit exaggerated. (Perhaps, however, it was the script: ask them to recite too many trivial, predictable, obvious reactions (over-?).) Others have already said enough about the plot. I just hope it was done - and, I think it may have been - more convincingly. P.S.: This is a FRESH commentary on this film - I just finished watching it a couple of minutes ago; not a memory of years ago.
