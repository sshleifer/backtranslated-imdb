This was one of the most dishonest, insignificant and non-peaceful films I've ever seen. The representation of the other, of the Israelis, was racist, backward and unjust. For one, the song played on E.S's car radio when it was matched to an extreme-right Israeli driver was "I made you a spell" by Natacha Atlas. The style of the song is quite Arabic, but it was released on an Israeli compilation CD, and I even listened to it on the radio in Israel. Many Israeli songs (as well as architecture, food and jargon) are influenced by Arab culture, and there is no reason why an Israeli Jew could be offended or angered by a nearby machine that plays that song. The way E.S. he looks so calm and collected with his sunglasses and the cold glow, through a long, still turned, is meant to force the viewer to see the Jew as haggard and racist, and E.S. as noble and temperate. <br /> <br /> I have traveled all over Israel, and have never seen an IDF recruitment poster since the service is mandatory. But in the film, not only is there a recruitment poster, but it describes a stereotypical image of an Arab terrorist and the words "do you want to shoot?" This is an extremely inaccurate representation of the mentality of the majority of Israelis and Israeli soldiers, and such "publicity" would not even exist on a random Israeli highway. Including it, the director aims to convince the public that Israel is a society of anti-Arab racists committed to murder. <br /> <br /> The ninja scene was free and unnecessarily violent. A Hollywood-style action scene involving Israeli soldiers shooting Palestinians would be just as unwelcome in a film directed by Israel as the ninja scene should have been. But for some reason, the images of an unrealistic, non-comic and violent scenario manage to arouse applause from the public since the director smeared so much the Israeli side, that every shot of Israeli soldiers killed would be welcome. The director shows absolutely no attempt to build bridges, depicting the "other" as human or working for peace; violence is meant to be the only solution. This is favored by exploding tank scenes, falling guard towers and other random acts of destruction. One of my best friends serves in the Israeli army, and the targets in the shooting ranges are never Arab women dressed in black, or any other quasi-civilian on canvas. The soldiers at the checkpoints are instructed not to shoot the head of an approaching Palestinian unless it is clear that their lives are in danger; the method, according to my friend, is to provide a warning cry, shoot in the air or around the area, and then if all else fails, shoot the leg and then interrogate and hospitalize. The arbitrary targeting of a woman in the lead, as shown in the film, is not the correct procedure. <br /> <br /> In addition to these inaccuracies, the directing style was also poor. Repetition became repetitive and no longer appealing. Symbols, such as the Arafat cartoon drawn on it, are forced out of any actual plot or integration structure in the setup; the hot-air balloon is Palestine that penetrates and regains Jerusalem, and is created by E.S. The ambulance controlled by permits from Israeli soldiers, followed by subsequent Israeli ambulances flying over the checkpoint, is an overly explicit claim of a double Israeli standard by the director. The director's attempt to show life in Nazareth as sad and useless is done with excessive; showing the routine of random people over and over again, even with a slight change each time, and emphasizing that no cast member ever smiles and is minimalist in dialogue almost screams the purpose of such scenes, the desolation of life, without leaving ample space for personal interpretation. By contrasting a "section" of the film, daily life in Nazareth, with the second section, the checkpoint between Ramallah and Israel, the director subtly blames this desolation on Israel, but never provides any direct evidence of why such blame can be correctly I spent hours trying to figure out why the music ended abruptly and started abruptly, and why many modern fashion show and metal action tracks were included in the score. I still can't find an answer. I heard that the music was out of place in this film; the contrast between quieter scenes and intense scenes was actually annoying and not influential or stimulating. I can understand if the director wanted the music to provide some comic aspects to certain scenes, but I discovered that there was nothing comical to be found in Israeli soldiers shooting targets or fighting a ninja, or that a woman had to suffer a another walk through a checkpoint, even if defiantly. In fact, I was tempted to close my ears during intense scenes and bothered by the lack of a score during silent scenes. Whatever the director's intent, he only provided auditory displeasure throughout the film. <br /> <br /> This film has no legitimate political message because it provides an inaccurate and extreme representation of the other and neglects to actually address any problems. It is a propaganda film, because the director intends various symbols, styles and scenes to get sympathy for the Palestinian side, while showing the Israeli side as cruel and inhuman without exception; the vibrant atmosphere of a Hollywood scene full of action or intense music is shown in every act of violence by the Palestinians against the Israelis, so that the almost inevitably positive and electrified feelings that music and cinematography arouse from the public are directed on one side . There is no thought, reflection or in-depth understanding of the conflict by the public; emotions are simply pulled from one side and kept there, in a clich√© "good versus bad" scenario. I believe this film lacked the depth, quality and power of other Palestinian films, such as "Paradise Now" and "Wedding in the Galilee".
