Well, Killshot is not terrible, but it is approaching. The production values ​​are decent and the main actors do a good job (except Rosario Dawson in a wasted role), but the story is simply pathetic. I don't know if Elmore Leonard's book had such stupid characters, since I didn't read it, but I suppose the book should have been at least a little humorous. The film has no perceptible humor. After the first twenty minutes, you'll be screaming on the screen "Oh, come on! Nobody's so stupid !!" Simply put, and without any spoilers, everyone acts conveniently for the plot, which makes no sense anyway. A very frustrating and unrealistic film, which can explain it sitting on the shelf for as long as it has done.
