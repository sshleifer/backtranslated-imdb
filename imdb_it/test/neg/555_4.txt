I can accept the fact that this was the karate guy NEXT so Ralph Macchio can be happily retired from the series, and while Hillary Swank is great for the role .... the movie's plot is simply terrifying. <br /> <br /> Mr. Miyagi's old friend of World War 2 dies, leaving his widow to take care of his rebellious niece when his parents die in an accident. The girl doesn't have any discipline yet she is the hero because the local ROTC ... which I will explain in a minute, needs to take it. You know the drill ... Miyagi takes it under his wing and eventually defeats the bad guys and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> His hokey, his cheese, his 90's ... but it's not even the long and the short. My first case of "huh?" Is it because there is a "military division" in high school? I thought that stuff came out in the 1960s, especially in a public school. As far as Michael Ironside is concerned in his role as the main heel, since he was involved in a military high school? My next complaint is that during the dance scene, the militants launch bungee to scare people ... why? The thing that I noticed during all 4 movies was just the end that the heels suddenly turned in the face after all the absurdities that made the main character pass (Billy in part 1, Sato in part 2, Kreese in the part 3). This film is no different. After Ned and friends have practically sabotaged the prom, they blow up Eric's car and threaten Hillary Swank with the whole movie ... Ironside tells them to beat her and they are like "um ... no" If you're going to make pathetic turns of face, at least make sure the characters haven't done anything too high, like blowing up a hot rod. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the love story between Eric and Hillary Swank. ... trivial but nothing melodramatic, which is a breath of fresh air from the trash Ralph Macchio pulled in the first 3 films. <br /> <br /> I'll say for your movie, after watching the first 3 movies, I can accept that it's more or less a spin off ... but I can't accept the whole military thing, too unusual to be taken seriously. Now if Ironside and the crew were a wrestling / football team and he was the coach, it would have been more credible. <br /> <br /> Ironside and Morita deliver the goods, Swank is OK ... the rest is the same as something, the only thing you notice is when they blow up the hot rod, which was nice 4 out of 10
