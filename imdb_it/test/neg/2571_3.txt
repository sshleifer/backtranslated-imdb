Steven Seagal has made a really boring, bad and boring movie. Steven Seagal plays a doctor !!!!!! ???! This film has some action scenes but they are poorly oriented and have nothing to do with the rest of the film. A group of American Nazis released a lethal virus, which is able to wipe out the state of Montana. Wesley (character of Seagal) desperately tries to find a cure, and this is the story of The Patriot. The Patriot is an extremely boring film, because nothing happens. It is full of boring dialogues and illogical gaps between events and stupid actors. In this film, Steven Seagal is totally crazy and I would not recommend this pillory to my worst enemy. 3/10
