A couple of men are shipwrecked on a remote island. They are then captured by a mad count who lives there with a small group of servants; while the unfortunate leper of the count lives in the prison of the castle. <br /> <br /> The Dungeon of Harrow is practically a work of hacking a movie. The amateur actors spend the whole night through the film, while an annoyingly insistent score plays continuously in the background. The various pieces of action are all filmed in an incredibly energetic way; in fact the film in general is completely lethargic. It just seems to drag it forward and forward. And even if the ending isn't bad, you'll be hard pressed to worry about that point. As an example of 1960s Gothic horror, this is strictly an example of a tavern. Unfortunately I can't recommend this really.
