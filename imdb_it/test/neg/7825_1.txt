The trailer is so deceptive ... I thought it would be a good movie ... What was the point in bringing women to Hong Kong to be killed? They could have done it in Paris. And the first half hour of the punch: <br /> <br /> - You love me! <br /> <br /> - I don't! -You love me! <br /> <br /> - I don't know! -You love me! <br /> <br /> - I don't! Repeat 100 times ... then ... Well, I don't love you ... So I'll shoot you! : D So here's why movie piracy is a good thing! Imagine if you could even give money for this torture! I'm sorry for the time I lost watching it ... filmmakers should pay me <br /> for the inconvenience ... The worst movie ever seen ...
