Telly Savalas sums it up as the Mexican revolutionary (although he is paired with Chuck Connors as a martinet military) in this joke but still a bit boring pastiche about the life and times of the famous historical figure. A previous attempt, VILLA RIDES! (1968) with Yul Brynner in the role and co-star with Robert Mitchcum, he tackled these events in a more sober and larger scale. As such, PANCHO VILLA is a typical European enterprise that is all too typical and indistinct, despite its credentials; the end result is more often silly rather than amusing - though some moments, particularly action sets and a scene involving a brawl within a church, offer a little pleasure. Oh, and Savalas even goes so far as to sing the final titles!
