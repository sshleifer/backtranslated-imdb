It is evident that the director, the writers and all the others do not know anything about their religion or the people who practice it. This film is infinitely imperfect and overall a complete shard. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a scene in which the rabbi enters the ritual bath of the woman while a naked woman is taking a bath, puts her hand on a woman's head there and blesses it. This is a mockery of the laws, only in this scene some of the broken laws include: modesty, a rabbi would never enter a ritual bath house while there are women inside. <br /> <br /> Improper contact, a rabbi would never put his hand on a woman's head, not to say that it is not the way a blessing is given. <br /> <br /> The ritual bathing woman is soaking a naked woman by pushing her head under the water, the laws relating to the ritual bath require that the whole body come into direct contact with the bath water; this means that no one should be in contact with the person who was bathing, certainly not pushing them under! <br /> <br /> There was more alone in that scene alone, how dropping 13 times (where does this concept come from?) talking about the rest of the film was a total mistake. It is frightening what ignorance can invent!
