I paid $ 2.00 for this piece of shit, I want my money back. is a horror advertising film that is not so groudy <br /> <br /> There are many MANY plans in this film, including acting, the lack of a real horror, the lack of nudity (which besides the initial Nurse (dress porn) and the flash of the naked corpse that still breathes, there is none. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is perhaps the best thing because it has guitar riffs or optimal tracks. <br /> <br /> There are your usual typical characters, the jockey, the athletic woman, the nerdy boy (who looks more like an athlete), the policeman / ranger (who has the biggest gap in his teeth I wanted to put on some dollar coin in that gap..or go for a field goal) the mysterious fella and the girl Pure. <br /> <br /> The trick was pitiful with the side views of dr chopper showing a clear "line of make up "and natural skin tones, the DVD cover is clearly photoshop / enhanced to make the cover more attractive as Ã¨ Dr chopper looks like an old "plopper" The uncultivated women who go around the dr chopper are not explained and ook as convincing as the rest of this film. <br /> <br /> The twist was VERY predictable and the abundance of evil-looking FAKE arts was ridiculous, what they thought, ... throwing some limbs around and some fake blood and you have a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Dr Chopper himself is the stupidest character I've ever seen in a while, although I think the creator of this film was tense for ideas and maybe I tried to use the rhyme Doctor and chopper (bike) and I thought the "bingo" would make a lousy movie about this. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse before ..... but this is simply ugly. everything is ugly ... the lack of suspense ... the lack of a real horror or character development ... the lack of a decent storyline ... the only good thing about this movie was when it ended. This film does not fall into the category and is very good "for me too / <br /> <br /> Overall 2/10 the director / screenwriter / editor should know better.
