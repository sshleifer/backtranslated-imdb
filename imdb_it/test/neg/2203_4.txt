Made and published at a time when the Internet was becoming enormous, this is a plot that Hitchcock would have loved. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Hitchcock was not around to do it, and we were occasionally a suspenseful but mostly silly thriller, which is (barely) held together by Bullock's intelligence. <br /> <br /> It was released in 1995 but is already dated, and the amount of computer errors and inaccuracies must be seen to be believed and you don't even have to be a dot.com person to locate them!
