"Black Vengeance" is an alternative title for "Ying hung ho hon" AKA "Tragic Hero" (1987). I just saw this on VHS, along with the first part of the story, "Gong woo ching" ("Rich and Famous"), also in 1987. (The poster and the 2 photos on the page are for a set of 4 DVDs of films with Rod Perry (The Black Gestapo), Fred Williamson (Black Cobra 2), Richard Lawson (Black Fist). The fourth film is called "The Black Six". Strangely, while the characters keep their original names in "Rich and Famous", in "Black Vengeance" the character of Chow Yun-Fat is called Eddie Shaw, Alex Man (Man Tze Leung) is Harry, and Andy Lau is called Johnny . Also confused is the fact that 1994 is given as a copyright date on both films. Perhaps that was the year they were nicknamed Americans. According to the release dates published on IMDb "Tragic Hero" was released before "Rich and Famous". Was there any reason to release the sequel first? Despite some comments from users, I liked these films, even though they are not among the best of CYF like "The Killer" and "Hard-Boiled" which are really amazing. However, if one day I come across a set of 2 DVDs of "Rich and Famous" and "Tragic Hero", I will not hesitate to buy it. It is hoped that these comments on "Black Vengeance" make it clear, which was also for me, a mystery about where it belonged to Chow Yun-Fat's filmography.
