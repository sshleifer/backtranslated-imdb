I saw this film for the first time a few weeks ago, and it was probably one of the most boring and unpleasant films I've ever had the misfortune to see. First of all Matthew Modine is a terrible actor, and he has ruined most of the film, besides that, the plot is just too silly. The only reason he was recorded in this film was because of Alec Baldwin, and his character was eliminated fairly quickly. Unless you are a Michelle Phiffer fan, you should probably avoid this movie like the plague. Many people can't praise this movie enough, but I can't understand what people find so fantastic about it. If it is supposed to be the black humor that makes this film so fantastic, then I imagine that everything can pass for comedy these days.
