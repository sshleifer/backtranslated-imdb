Here is the example number 87.358 of the anti-biblical prejudice of Hollywood, so typical of them. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, Ray Liotta's wife did and the women are interviewed for the position of housekeeper. The first interviewee is an old style (dress, mannerisms, words) that immediately establishes strict rules, stating that "there will be two hours of study of the Bible every day". <br /> <br /> Said, of course, to make it look like reading the Bible is the worst punishment you could ever inflict on someone, especially a child. Once again, the Bible is equated with suffocating and petty people. That woman, of course, is immediately discharged. <br /> <br /> Of course, the liberal black woman (Whoopi Goldberg - who else?) is the one who is hired and, voila, saves the day! <br /> <br /> Yawn.
