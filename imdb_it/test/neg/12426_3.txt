What can I say about a film as bad as this? The people who made this film haven't even tried to make the monster look realistic. You never see his head again, and his head is just a giant puppet that has little movement except when he opens his mouth to roar. And the sound they used for roaring is the best part. In many places in the movie it looks exactly like a TIE fighter flying over! I couldn't believe it when I first heard it and had to rewind several times to make it sink. Apart from the terrible monster and the noises it creates, there is not much more in this film, except for some absurd scenes attack and the Scottish madman who attacks children trying to have an intimate moment in his castle. However, it is watchable if you like this type of garbage. I know I do it ....
