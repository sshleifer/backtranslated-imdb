some argue that this is better especially because of acting; but it's really much worse for reasons that exceed the improvement. <br /> <br /> the source from which all problems arise; history. apart from one of them, people are shot point-blank, with a shotgun, in the chest and survive for hours without medical treatment, there is a bigger problem. Nic, the gangsta with a heart of gold is willing to do anything for the friend he just met that day; and this includes asking for help from an evil spirit. Ce-Ce, who comes out of nowhere with a past in voodoo, is willing to summon Killjoy, as long as Nic can "hook" her. the acting, although improved, is still horrible. these people could not convey emotions from a paper bag. the script doesn't even help them. stupid lines, and I can only take any direction from the director. this script was read as Shakespeare in high school with a teacher lashing at them as they left. <br /> <br /> while this movie (if you can call it that in its 80 minutes of execution (thankfully)) it is perhaps even more fun than the first because of all these things, it's definitely more painful to watch. 1/10.
