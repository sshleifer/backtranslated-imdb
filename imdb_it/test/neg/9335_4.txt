It wasn't until I looked at the trivia section that I discovered that the original producer / star of this movie Tyrone Power died during its making. This undoubtedly explains why everyone on the screen seems to have the mind on other things, a symptom of what appears in a very early scene involving a battle that can only be described as pathetic. Do you know when you painted a wall until you are completely bored? Well, this is the kind of expression fighters have on their faces when they swing their swords very unconvincingly <br /> <br /> The plot centers on Soloman the King of Israel who has a relationship with the Queen of Sheeba and her people are not happy about it. You can't blame them because there are some more beautiful things in the world than Israeli ones, even though Israeli women all look like Cherie Blair here! The modern day Israel is also very cosmopolitan, with the majority of Israelis born outside the country, but it would have been true a couple of thousand years ago, where everyone speaks in European and American accents <br /> <br /> After a lot of talk and a dance sequence that must be seen to be believed (and this is not praise) we have a culminating point where Israelis in numerical minority must defend themselves against a massed Egyptian army that cannot read a map otherwise they known that there was a canyon in front of them. This is what I don't understand - Even if they are blinded by the sun, the Egyptians spend ten minutes in office towards the Israelis who never realize that they are heading for an open gorge! Isn't it a little illogical? It is also a revealing mistake since the horses, wagons and men who fall into the canyon are obviously miniatures. <br /> <br /> The film ends with Soloman killing his treacherous brother and praising God for his victory. But who needs Moshe Dayan, Arik Sharon or God when you have an idiotic enemy who can't see a ravine in front of him or shakes a sword as if he painted a wall?
