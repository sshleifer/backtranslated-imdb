Many of you out there didn't like this movie ... you were right. A small minority of you has really loved the movie ... I can't say you're wrong. For me, this film was too stupid. I have seen many stupid, stupid comedies, but this one overcomes all. While I was watching I couldn't stop rubbing my eyes, not believing what I was seeing and trying to decide if I should laugh or cry, while * REALLY STUPID * stuff was happening on the screen, and people were leaving the theater. <br /> <br /> According to the main characters, time travel is accomplished, enter any museum and you will really travel into the past. Also, if you're looking for an after-death experience, go to the nearest planetarium, you'll meet Lord there - sorry, Loydd and you'll receive important commands ... Everything I have above doesn't really make sense, right? Well, go ahead, watch the movie (I almost never regret the films I watch), you probably won't like it, but you'll be fascinated by the writer's ability to ultimately produce the script STUPID ... <br /> <br /> I'm giving it a 3 out of 10, it's not good, far from being the worst ...
