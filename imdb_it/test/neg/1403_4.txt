This miserable psychodrama uses every cumbersome device in the book to attract attention and sympathy from us for its characters, who, with one exception, are not worthy of any warning, let alone two precious hours of filmers' time . <br /> <br /> As in "Ordinary People" by Robert Redford (a superb film that clearly shows the emptiness of "Heroes"), a late boy died, leaving his family prey to the mourning. In this case, death was suicide, an event that almost always poisons the emotional well-being of the survivors in a particularly corrosive way. We follow these people over the next 8 or 9 months. <br /> <br /> The father (Jeff Daniels) becomes a stiff, generally mute, usually stiff drunk who secretly takes leave of his job for months, instead sits on a park bench all day, and insists to set a plate full of food instead of the deceased son for each meal. He treats everyone else in the family with unerring malice. He sees his doctor regularly, but the question of therapeutic intervention in his obviously dysfunctional state never occurs. <br /> <br /> The mother (Sigourney Weaver) screams to the neighbor, by the way, is caught when she stupidly tries to buy "marijuana" (her term) in a head shop (which adult would actually never try such a stupid stunt?), and, towards the end, faints in a coma with a lung condition that everyone in the theater takes is cancer (she is a heavy smoker). Ms. Weaver has some lines of reversal, but generally behaves too unintelligently to deserve much empathy. <br /> <br /> It is not that there are no people out there who behave in such silly ways when particularly stressful circumstances arise. But why make a film so drastic? What can someone learn from this couple's conduct? <br /> <br /> The deceased's older sister (Michelle Williams) is far away in college and too happy to distance herself from the family zoo. The younger brother (played by Emile Hirsch) is the only credible member of the family. His suffering is genuine, his causes are many and his conduct is consistent in the circumstances. But the character of Hirsch is too delicate, too dark and dejected to bring the film. The other bit players, the subtexts and the charlatan, the unreal dialogue don't help. <br /> <br /> The subject of suicide is repeated almost casually in the case of two other minor characters. So what is the writer-director, Dan Harris, who is trying to say about this subject? Which is not a serious thing? Why Jeff Daniels agreed to interpret a father's sap as written in this script is something that only his therapist might be able to answer. Avoid this dog. Instead he rents the Redford classic. My vote: 4/10 (C-). (Seen on 02/17/05). If you want to read more reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites.
