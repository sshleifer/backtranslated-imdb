It's a time machine, that's fine. It works in "real time" for 96 minutes, but seemed 96 years old. The first 20 minutes were completely superfluous. Large amounts of "dead" time in all. What happened? When will something happen? Who cares? Apparently the film was made on a limited budget, known for your construction as follows: The Morlochs: nothing like saving a little money by reusing Lord of the Rings sets and costumes, part I, hey? The "scary guy" in charge of controlling the Morloch ... The scariest thing these guys could think of was someone wearing one of Gene Simmons' old costumes: (from the Kiss group)? Little known fact: the freaks of the future have perfectly manicured nails. <br /> <br /> Save your money, save your time. Move on to this.
