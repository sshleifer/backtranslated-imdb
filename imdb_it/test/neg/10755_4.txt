What we know of Caravaggio suggests an agitator agitated with a healthy sense of right that lived between whores and thieves and cheaters and put them on canvas. The themes of his works were sex, death, redemption, above all, finding the sacred in the profane. He lived in an age in which homosexuality carried a death sentence and political intrigue normally entailed fatality in a society defined by the maximum "strangling the boy for the purity of his cry". <br /> <br /> One cannot criticize Derek Jarman for his cinematography, nor his recreations of Caravaggio's paintings, and certainly he cannot be accused of moving away from homosexuality. But frankly, Jarman never strays from the caricature of the 1980s. Italian patronage becomes the London art scene of the 1980s complete with gracious waiters and calculators. Sean Bean is a sexy piece of Northern rough that oils his bike. Tilda Swinton performs a transformation worthy of a Mills and Boons ("Because, Miss Lena, without that gypsy veil, you are beautiful ..."). Jarman provides Caravaggio with a particularly trivial reason for the murder that left him in exile. <br /> <br /> This may have been a visually stunning treatment of a man whose life was dangerous, exciting, violent and decadent but who nevertheless raised the lives of ordinary people to the status of Renaissance masterpieces, watched by emperors and king. Instead, what you get is Pierre et Gilles do Italy. The graceful bodies of the young are shown to perfection, but never the men who inhabit them. Jarman seems to satirize the London art scene, showing it to be superficial and pretentious. Using Caravaggio and the Renaissance in Italy to take stock is to use a silk purse to make a pig's ear. In all honesty, this film remains visually stunning, but in the end it is as two-dimensional as the paintings it describes.
