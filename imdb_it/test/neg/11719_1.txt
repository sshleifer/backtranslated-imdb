No blood, no blood, no rewarding death scenes ... stupid stupid dumb mute. Dear God sitting through this film made me sick. Sick patients. Very boring ... extremely boring ... <br /> <br /> There isn't even a humorous aspect in this movie! I can't find a good thing to say about it, apart from the main character he had a beautiful body ... I guess. It is certainly not worth the fifty cents I paid to rent it.
