This film was horrible, especially considering the work that must have gone into its production. Although it's not as bad as Ax 'Em, it's pretty awful. Take into consideration the obvious rip-offs of Gladiator and Raiders of the Lost Ark, and what do you get? This buffet of wooden tricks and make-up. <br /> <br /> The film starts like nowadays for most zombie movies. An assembly of interesting jumps and a radio transmission of the blast to hand. We see our hero (Ryn, probably the worst 'zombie hunter' in the modern era: he counted about four or five times when he scratched his head with the barrel of his gun or looked down into the barrel as he blew) cutting the fingers of the zombies . Later we learn that these fingers are collected for rewards. <br /> <br /> Well, Ryn seems to be a rebel in his ways of dispensing zombies; coming to the point of buying chum * gasp * from his French friend Hans (who is not really French, he speaks with a strange Middle Eastern accent). As Ryn uses his friend to collect a bountiful bounty from Lost Hills, all hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> And the horror of the movie comes up. The zombies are put together pretty badly. I have seen comments that praise their make-up, but it was rather amateur in my opinion. The obvious Halloween stickers were used to make zombie faces and there were points where a girl looked like she was wearing a clown mask instead of a freshly peeled face. Oy Vey. <br /> <br /> To summarize the next sixty minutes in a few lines: Ryn is back stabbed by Hans (who has made a deal with some other zombie hunters, Blythe is the ringleader), gives him a second chance, returns again stabbed by Hans again, then shoots Hans and arrives in Union City where he discovers that Blythe is poisoning the cities for profit. <br /> <br /> This is really about the plot. When Ryn reaches Union City, all the bad guys are gathered in a house that is evidently so massive that it takes Ryn to reach the top floor. People die, Ryn lives and the movie ends with one of those cynics "is he going to kill himself?" scenes. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILER * I will have to blame most of this mess on Nott. The management was horrible. EVERY person played a frown other than Hans, who was easily the best "actor" in this MacBeth discard group. When they reach Union City, a mass of zombies attacks the crew and the zombies obviously have not received advice or ideas on how to walk as if the appendices were rotten. A woman is swinging as if she is swimming in mid-air on a Sunday walk. <br /> <br /> Some movies are horrible. This film is one of these simply based on how logic seemed to be abandoned in order to keep a story flowing. It works occasionally, but in this regard (where the plot was already in ruins), it doesn't. <br /> <br /> Avoid it unless you want a decent laugh.
