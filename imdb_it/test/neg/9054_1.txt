An IMDb reviewer calls Eaten Alive a movie for the "cannibalist". Are there any such people? I didn't know. But if you're one of them, hey, take a ball. The rest of you might find this tripe a little hard to digest (pun intended), even if, like me, you consider yourself a connoisseur of horror movies. I have been an avid horror fan for about 15 years, although I never had the cannibal subgenre until a few weeks ago, and I believe I owe my short-lived interest in these films that induce the strangely groan to China total disregard of copyright laws. You see, I bought a two-disc DVD collection of all Wesley Snipes movies for 20 yuan (about $ 2.75), which turned out to include Last Cannibal World, The Mountain of the Cannibal God, Eaten Alive, Cannibal Holocaust, Next, with Nicholas Cage, and something called Voodoo Lagoon, along with Blade 1-3, in Chinese. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> Being a second sequel, I immediately had a sinking feeling when the film opened with a cannibal in street clothes that roamed the main American cities, shooting unknown Americans with poisoned arrows and then running away at full speed. Having exhausted the ways to keep the cannibal films scary, it seems they are now headed for the mainland. Later, you might be shocked to learn that this guy does a "training exercise". Block your daughters! <br /> <br /> In a short time the film settles on the old routine of her missing sister, while a young blond woman named Sheila begins her investigation into the disappearance of her sister, who does not resemble her in any way, but she is willing to do it to spend most of the naked film so I guess it doesn't matter. It seems that, after shooting one of his victims, the unfortunate cannibal we encountered at the beginning of the film, unused to the life of the big city, came upon the street and was struck by a moving van. <br /> <br /> The brilliant police find a mysterious film about him that shows Sheila's sister involved in a bizarre ritual behavior, but apart from the movie, the boy is a complete mystery. As the pitiful police chief complains, "we know nothing about him except that he is dead!" Poor boy, it must be a headache from all this. I recommend a nap. Fortunately, Sheila is the kind of girl who can throw tens of thousands of dollars like it's nothing in her sister's search. Perfect for buying a caricature of a sturdy backwoods guide, since the police certainly won't help. <br /> <br /> Obviously, nothing new has been added to this tiny subgenre. On the contrary, cannibalism seems almost a background for a completely different type of bad film, about saving a person who has disappeared from the dangerous elements. Thrilling the texture of that clothesline is not difficult, all you have to do is add a jungle cult of people following a boy who calls himself Jonas, who believes in using pain as a way to bring man together nature, a process called "purification". Personally, I prefer to just pee out occasionally. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of the movie is when Sheila is captured by one of the cult members - an overweight guy who seems to have taken a three-day weekend from the office to appear in this movie. While he pulls out his reliable medical kit to give her an injection, he warns her: "If you don't believe in Jonas and purification (through pain), God helps you." Then he gives her a shot and, when she walks away from the little pinch, politely apologizes to her. I feel a true believer in this boy! <br /> <br /> As for blood, there are a lot of unpleasant sound effects on random shots of slaughtered animals and more than enough disgusting footage of women cut and eat alive, so I guess the film is up to of his name. Acting is surprisingly bad, as can be expected and, interestingly enough, editing is also incredibly messy but still strangely effective. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think you should be able to relate to people who believe in totally crazy cults to relate to anyone in the movie. There are a lot of extravagant religious ceremonies taking place, which makes it increasingly difficult to understand why Sheila's sister decided to turn her back on normal society. I'm all for individualism and doing your own thing, but come on. <br /> <br /> After a while the film descends even more into your escape based film, just before witnessing the wilder interpretation of Glory, Glory Halleluja in the history of cinema. WOW. <br /> <br /> Note: in this film, a woman is raped with a severed snake. If you need one more reason not to watch it, seek professional help. Avoid this mess at all costs.
