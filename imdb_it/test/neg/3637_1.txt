For every Nickelodeon fan who watched the net in the 80s and 90s, there was always something good. You have entertained acts like You Can not Do That on television. You had strange, but beautiful shows like Pete and Pete. You even had cartoons that taught morality like Doug. But just like Disney, Nickelodeon fell into disrepair, limiting its demographic aspects to shallow preadolescents and giving us scant excuses to invent new and innovative shows. As I tried to watch Zoey 101, I simply shook my head in disgust. <br /> <br /> The setting could not be more fake than this. Each character attends a boarding school called Pacific Coast Academy, which boasts everything a spoiled child wants. A sushi bar, laptops everywhere, flat-screen TVs in every room, fantastic dorms to hang out, etc. The children in this show are rarely seen in class and it seems that there are no real masters. It feels more like a place to spend a nice summer vacation than work and study while preparing for college. <br /> <br /> Even the characters were a factor that pushed me away. Each episode consists of boy problems, situations that they themselves have caused and problems that should be solved. Each character is a stereotype. Zoey (Jamie Lynn) seems perfect in everything she does, and each of her friends asks her for help when they feel they are in grave danger. Only by guiding her to have no other side. I went to school and I can tell you, nobody is like that. Chase is stupid. Logan plays the arrogant guy. Quinn plays a nerd that is highly unrealistic in what he does. Michael is an idiot. Lola is a clone of Nicole. Dana is fine, a tough person. Why not use a bit of originality? Something that is unique to these characters and different from other personalities? Is being the stereotyped the best that the creators of this show can give? Instead, these actors are boring personalities with sense in that there is a lack of creativity that involves their roles. There is nothing here to amaze or astonish. <br /> <br /> Not only that, but the show is clearly aimed at focusing on adolescent children, in front of a stage where they have to evolve from being a child to being an adult. During that time they must learn to study on their own, make their own decisions and do what is right for them. Zoey 101 contains none of these values. In this case, we should believe that looking good and having a stereotypical personality is all it takes to succeed. I'm sorry, but it's just not true. People cannot expect things to be delivered to them as the actors of this show and leave those things alone there. If I expect things in Zoey to happen in real life, then I would live in a fantasy world locked up in a dream house. Nothing in this show refers to those who face health and money problems. Nor does it refer to children who want to learn something meaningful. <br /> <br /> So in conclusion, Zoey 101 is a show made by Nickelodeon that only falls on his face. It shows a horrible message for children and I think the show itself is simply inappropriate for them. Of course, it has no morbid violence, but it teaches everything to make a child act and look stupid. A horrible sight, and should be forgotten with the rest of the garbage that Nickelodeon has made over the past few years. <br /> <br /> 1 in 10.
