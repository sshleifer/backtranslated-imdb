Closet Land is a bad job with superb actors. Nothing more (or less) happens in the film than the endless abuse of an attractive woman imprisoned by a sadistic police officer. The setting is minimalist. This could be considered a soft S & M porn because the drama lacks all points of reference such as time, place and political context. Since what happens is cut adrift in a futuristic fantasy environment, the abuse becomes purely personal. The pornographic aspects are justified by the fact that it is a warning about the evils of the totalitarian government, but since there is no real context for the torture of this young woman, we are disturbed but we have not learned anything. <br /> <br /> What is the point? Does that torture exist in the world? That the prisoners who abuse are bad? Do those dictatorships abuse innocent people? We already know that. Closet Land has echoes of works such as Darkness At Noon and Ionesco's Rhinoceros, but both works were created by competent artists whose work had a historical context and a depth of meaning. This work is amateur and the dialogue is sophomic. A precise thumb down.
