I have to say that Krasinski is the only reason I even watched this movie. He is good. However, the rest of this film is so below average that it is not worth the time and effort spent watching this film. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of technical / aesthetic problems: that is, selections of shots, shots, camera movements within monological sequences, extremely poor editing (probably due to the total lack of fluidity in and between the shots), and in general to a terrible acting (except Krasinski). <br /> <br /> It was too theatrical (in acting and presenting) to develop any kind of suspense moment in this film ... which is surprising, because it is a bank robbery, which should be at least somehow exciting. <br /> <br /> How does such a bad film made, and then released, AND THEN distributed? <br /> <br /> Kind of reminds me of a thesis project by a film student C, probably not even that good.
