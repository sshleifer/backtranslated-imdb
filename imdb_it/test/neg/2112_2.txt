How the hell can you have such fantastic actors in such a miserable creation? This is one of the most stylized pieces of trash I've seen in a long time. Not only is it poorly written, it is a product of poor management and editing. Cinematography is so horribly manipulative and unoriginal, and editing is confused beyond imagination. The real ideas that underlie the plots (cloning, toxic waste, climate change) are good to start with, but where the production / management team takes them is a large cesspit of dirt, whose number is seen in an episode. And this is a scientific series? I'm a doctor and all I can say is that science in this movie is shit, almost embarrassing to watch. I felt really bad for the actors involved since they were all extraordinary.
