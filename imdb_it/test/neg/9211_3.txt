Something not so great. "Silence of the Lambs" remains Demme's only film, and of course I include all the overvalued left-handed exercises in indulgence on the big screen, some of which I haven't seen - and never will. <br /> <br /> This is a light comedy that spins a thriller somewhere halfway. The first semester is a bit difficult to seduce; it is neither funny nor particularly interesting. Daniels plays a stupid and stupid naive idiot who is so gullible and confident that he challenges beliefs. His animated acting is often annoying and barely funny. He is actually lying to Griffith at the beginning and tells her that he is married, with children, when he is actually divorced! Throughout the history of humanity and films, any married man who meets a woman he likes will lie - if he lies - and says he is not married. (Later, the unbelievable or credible logic behind this was revealed: he wanted "to protect (himself)." What a bunch of crap ...) The fact that his character makes all the wrong decisions and does all things They made me really impatient to have Liotta hitting him when he joined him in an ex's apartment. <br /> <br /> What happens in Daniels' apartment is the classic end of the movie fighting to the death that the good guy - even if very stupid - wins in a predictable way. However, at least the last half hour has some action, something is happening, and Daniels no longer has the opportunity to be animated. The film lacks credible characters (both main and marginal), and the feeling is too 1980s, which means that the film looks rather bland; visually ugly. Sayles still makes a cameo as a policeman. The film is perhaps even a little too heavy on the side of coincidences. Griffith, once again, plays a baby with a tender and mute appearance, but, as usual, he is convincing because he is a dull-sounding girl. This was a previous film, before his lip augmentation and breast enlargement surgery; he compares the natural breasts he exposes in this film to the balloons ready to explode that briefly flashes years later in "Nobody's Fool". <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my "biographies" by Griffith and other Hollywood intellectuals, contact me by e-mail.
