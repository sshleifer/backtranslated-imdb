After his father's suicide, Charlie 'Kid' Davis (Ray 'Boom Boom' Mancini) accepts the invitation and advice of his friend Tiny (Michael Chiklis) and travels to Las Vegas with him trying to become a boxer. On the way they meet Gina (Jennifer Beals) hitchhiking, they give her a ride and she becomes Charlie's girlfriend. Johnny Ticotin (Rod Steiger) is convinced by Tiny to be Charlie's couch, and the powerful agent Alex Dumas (Joe Mantegna), after seeing him fight, becomes his manager, promoting Charlie's career. This film is so boring that it doesn't really deserve a lot of time to write it. I don't like boxing, but sometimes I watch some useful movies on this topic. But this is horrible! Predictable, full of clich√©s, with a horrible leading actor, a pure waste of time. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Body and Alma" ("Body and soul")
