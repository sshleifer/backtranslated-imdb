I went to this film hoping for an imaginative touch on the Second Coming. Boy, I've never been wrong. The BBC is amazed to see a movie, totally idiotic in creating suspense, crazy in building intensity. And this movie is no exception to the rule of how the BBC sucks. <br /> <br /> Ugh, the laborious and laborious rhythm was painful to sit on. The first 30 minutes seemed 2 hours. I kept looking at my watch, wondering when the useless and monotonous blow would end. They wasted a perfectly good actor in the lead role, because the material is so lazy, and sloppy, written. All that happens is just to kill time. <br /> <br /> Over 155 minutes, only 15 minutes are interesting (the controversial ending). What a pity. Reading the plot summary is more interesting than watching the movie. The preaching, the "I am God" infinite bla bla bla, the dumb as the boring boring miracles ... UGH. <br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK AT THIS COURAGE.
