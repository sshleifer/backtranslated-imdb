One of the commentators on the subject of Lil 'Pimp (dbborroughs of Glen Cove), he understood well when he said that the film is really bad, but I am an exception when he / she commented on the animation. <br /> <br /> The animation was not bad due to Macromedia Flash. It was a bad animation because it was badly directed. Flash is just a tool. In the right hands, an artist can create full and fluid animation like any Disney movie and, in the wrong hands, it can look as bad as things on the Internet, which is where Lil 'Pimp originated and should have remained there . <br /> <br /> Studios such as Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, Disney and Warner Bros., create wonderful animations using Flash (eg Puffy Ami Yumi, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, Mucha Lucha, etc.). <br /> <br /> Lil 'Pimp was a piece of badly designed tripe because Revolution Studios bought Media Tripp and Lil' Pimp was one of the included properties. Roth and the company thought they would make a quick penny using an asshole like Lil 'Pimp and the fiction was perpetuated by the producer, Amy Pell. The reason for this third quarter of aborting an animated film is that none of the Revolution Studios executives had the pragmatic brain of being marginalized by Mark Brooks and Peter Gilstrap (they really did their best but were out of their minds) and hire real writers, directors and at least a semi-competent producer. They did one thing correctly though, they hired some of the best storyboarders, designers and animators in Los Angeles, but as Lil 'Pimp shows, you can buy the best sports car on the floor, but if you are a moron, you will certainly destroy it
