This film may have been the first Puppet Master but I was definitely bored when I saw this stupid movie, I wanted a refund. This was a bad series for the puppeteer and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks it was terrible. For some it was great, but for others it was a ticket to snore-villas and boy are they right. The puppets didn't even do anything and they didn't kill people. It should not be seen by people, so I warn you not to see it. You will be disappointed even by fans who love Puppet Master, it was a waste of their time and didn't make much money. No one managed to kill them but one or two, very useless. <br /> <br /> 1/10
