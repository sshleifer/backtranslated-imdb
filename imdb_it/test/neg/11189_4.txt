I'm a big fan of surrealist art, but this Bunuel film (with some ideas from Dali) has left me cold. Bunuel held a grudge all his life against the Catholic church and delighted in trying to offend Catholics in fairly foolish ways. This is one of the most foolish; almost like what you'd expect from an eighteen-year-old in film class. The last minutes of the film, which have nothing to do with anything else, are a last resort to religion. <br /> <br /> If you read "scholars" about this slow-paced, sometimes funny, film, it's all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression. If this is really the point, then Bunuel expresses it as round as possible. The central male character is a nasty ugly who loves to kick dogs and bring down blind men on the street, and mentally transforms advertisements into strange sexual fantasies. Is this behavior the fault of the church (for interrupting his love), or is he just a jerk? I vote for the latter. I think Bunuel had a lot of personal speeches and he chose Catholics as the ones to blame. <br /> <br /> There are some moments when you could cry, "Aha! Surrealism!": A cow in a bed, a giraffe falling out of a window (a poor model), a man shattering a pillow of feathers, a woman who rinses a toilet while we look at images of bubbling lava (or a pit of mud ... hard to say in B / N). The rest is forgettable self-indulgence. Unfortunately, Bunuel was still chasing the same bogey-men for the rest of his career (Viridiana, Discreet Charm ...). If you're interested in seeing surrealism on the screen, take a look at Jean Cocteau's early works.
