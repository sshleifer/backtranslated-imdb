Well ........ how and where do I begin to describe this absolute nonsense? Imagine the moral of a Hollywood-style western, immerse yourself in sumptuous help in the most trivial soap opera plot, and try to fool the kids into thinking they are cool by dressing them in something 'contemporary'. This film is a whole package and absolutely devoid of substance. <br /> <br /> Start with the promise ... young people who dream of becoming a rock star and engage in a kind of excessive heroism that everyone can laugh at. After that, everything goes downhill ... faster than a bob without brakes. The scene involving the first concert with Steel Dragon is one of the most pathetic pieces of "kitsch cine" I've seen in a long time. The singer appears on the stage for his debut and falls down the stairs ..... he gets up and sings ??? ...... or will he stay there on the floor and won't sing ...... who cares now? The situation gets worse, but I don't want to get bored, having to remember it in all its heartbreaking details. If you look at it after this review, it's your fault!
