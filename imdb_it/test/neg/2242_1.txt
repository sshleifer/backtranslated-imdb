This film does not deserve a descent review, it just made me decide that I won't go see Tarantino's next film. And I loved Tarantino's movies. <br /> <br /> Non-artistic, not fun, not witty, not funny, nothing, just boring and stupid. If this film was Tarantinos first, it would also be his last. <br /> <br /> Tarantino must take a good grip on himself, otherwise his next film will be 3 hours without meaning, boring and not cool dialogue. He seems to have fallen in love with his dialogue - and his love is blind. <br /> <br /> After finishing your popcorn there is no more reason to sit in a theater anymore.
