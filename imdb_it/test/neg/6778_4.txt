This film describes a truly horrible event, to be sure. But everything falls from the poor performance of the whole cast. It is impossible to feel the emotion of almost all the characters, since all the emotional scenes seem parodies of themselves. For example, a character is shot at the beginning of the film, and you get the desperate cliché, "I'm going to do it, Sergeant?", "Yes, it's nothing", but it looks like a sketch of a movie by Wayans Brothers ( I don't know if they still made the movie War) or something with Leslie Nielsen. <br /> <br /> The sergeant played by Sean Penn reminds me of Al Bundy from Married With Children, while Fox is the biggest cliché of self-deprecation of the good guy you can imagine ... Thank God, he curses and smokes during this. <br /> <br /> His "NOOOO !!!" Emotional is definitely more suited to comedies like Back To The Future than the so-called serious films like this. <br /> <br /> To their credit, some of the "main" scenes ... (without giving too much space, where they actually perform quite horrific acts) ... are well made and make us take the subject seriously. But nevertheless, not thanks to acting.
