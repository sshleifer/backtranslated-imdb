Basic structure of a story: Beginning, Middle, End. <br /> <br /> Sometimes this structure is played, we get Memento or Irreversible and the story is played backwards. Sometimes it's not linear, a la Pulp Fiction. Regardless, they all have a beginning, a central part and an end. <br /> <br /> This is the first film I have ever seen that has no end. <br /> <br /> At the beginning: the girl's best friend is expelled. <br /> <br /> Medium: the girl has to face without her best friend. <br /> <br /> End: non-existent. <br /> <br /> Not that having an end would have saved this film, but at least it would have been complete. <br /> <br /> It is an exercise in apathy; we get a mix of party characters, and they all turn out to be critics. Boring, vain, silly and pale imitations of people. <br /> <br /> And here's the action within this movie: NO HAPPEN. Nothing happens Mischa Barton tries to speak with a warm English accent, Dominique Swain complains a lot and Brad Renfro gets a blowjob from an old man. End of the film. <br /> <br /> At the time the credits were launched, I had a horrible feeling that many prisoners had to hear: the time periods, those precious minutes of our lives, were just wasted. <br /> <br /> The only passable point (and this is a very emphatic SOLO) is Brad Renfro. He acts well. Lacey Chabert I like, but no luck here. Thanks to the good work in other films, I will forgive Mischa Barton for this parody, but I hope all the cast members have been slapped in the face for their involvement. <br /> <br /> Please, I beg you. To avoid. Do not fool yourself into thinking "I will make myself an idea". My sister told me never to see it, and I ignored it, wanting to make a decision. It was a bad decision. <br /> <br /> I've never hated a movie. There are many that I don't like, but I've never hated a movie. Until I saw it.
