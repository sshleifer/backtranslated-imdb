The most terrifying thing about director Carter Smith's new horror film "The Ruins" is the end credits that list comedian Ben Stiller as one of the executive producers. What Stiller was thinking when he dumped his dollars into this damned carnivorous undergrowth cooler that creeps up on his victims and devours them. Oscar-nominated screenwriter Scott B. Smith of "A Simple Plan", adapting his best-selling novel, firmly adheres to the clichés and standard conventions of all the scary 20-year-old sagas where reckless youngsters do everything but the pleading plea the forces of evil to eat them. The stupid characters were not enough to contend in this nihilistic absurdity, we are treated to another film in which American tourists are in danger simply because they are Americans. Furthermore, unlike the really good horror films that explain why monsters need to feed themselves, "The Ruins" provides no explanation for the supernatural tricks of its evil vines. <br /> <br /> The set-up of "The Ruins" resembles the 2006 horror movie "Turistas" in which South American slimy trapped brainless American backpackers and collected them for their internal organs. Indeed, "Turistas" has generated some legitimate thrills and chills. "The Ruins" generates nothing in terms of chills or chills. A mischievous mastiff that suddenly jumps on the camera to growl at our heroes is as close as possible to the thrill. <br /> <br /> The rest of "The Ruins" borrows from another film: "The Descent", a superb 2006 chiller about a group of girls immersed in a nightmare experience when they get lost in a labyrinth of caves inhabited by albino mutants with a desire for blood for murder. I also think of a couple of other films that are served intentionally or unintentionally. They are the classic horror film Hammer from 1968 "The Lost Continent" on the murderous vegetation that threatens innocent spectators in a sea of ​​abandoned ships and the cult class Roger Corman "The Little Shop of Horrors" (1961) on a New York florist who Growing facility for the man in his shop .. <br /> <br /> "The Ruins" takes place in the picturesque and sunny Mexico where four loving American college students, Eric (Shawn Ashmore of the "X-Men" movies) , Stacy (Laura Ramsey of "The Covenant"), Jeff (Jonathan Tucker of "Sleepers") and Amy (Jena Malone of "Pride & Prejudice"), are completing their tequila-filled spring break. Stacy loses a precious earring in a motel pool, but a useful Teutonic tourist, twenty, Mathias (Joe Anderson of "Copying Beethoven") recovers it, and the group embraces him as the best new friend. These people live to celebrate and have already made friends with a trio of Greek tourists. Mathias tells them about his rebellious brother who accompanied an adorable female archaeologist to a remote Mayan pyramid that is not listed in any guide. He offers to take them with them and they accept. <br /> <br /> First rule of horror movies: if nobody knows where you are going, we advise you to avoid it. Since only one day remained, and they did nothing adventurous, our two couples and their Greek-speaking Greek friend Dimtri (newcomer Dimitri Baveas) decided to follow Mathias and check the pyramid. They take a bus to the interior of Mexico and look for a taxi to take them to the next leg of their journey. A taxi driver glances at their map and warns them to stay away. Second rule of horror films: when the natives warn you to stay away, stay away. A twenty-five dollar bill helps him change his mind, and drags them to their destination and then slips off in the blink of an eye. <br /> <br /> As soon as our heroes found the mysterious Mayan-covered forest pyramid that seems suspiciously similar to a variation of the Mississippi kudzu in the jungle than the superstitious natives appear. They know the pyramid is infested and they kill Dimtri without problems when trying to dispel their fears. The remaining protagonists climb up the security at the top of the pyramid while the paranoid natives surround them to prevent them from escaping. In the end, the vines turn away to greet our heroes and eat them. At this point, "The Ruins" becomes "Bug", Ashley Judd's recent and ridiculous schizoid film about insects crawling under the skin. In a short time our heroes are making each other in a useless effort to pull the screws out from under their skin. A particularly gruesome scene shows that the Americans leave the German boy's legs behind to save his life. In comparison, it makes the tortures of the Spanish Inquisition a domesticated aspect. <br /> <br /> "The Ruins" ranks as another casino with nothing to redeem.
