Oh my god ... where to start? "Chupacabra Terror" is one of the worst B-Horror movies ever made. This crap makes the exorcist look like "Demon Slayer". Special note: a Horror B movie must have at least one sex scene. Don't expect even a sexy girl in this. With this unforgivable mistake, I should start with the complete bash. <br /> <br /> First of all, if you're planning on making a Horror monster movie, you should spend most of your budget to create a "cool" monster outfit. The monster in this movie looks like a costume of $ 10 Halloween. There is no way that Chupacabras (yes, that's the way it is written) looks threatening in the movie. He's an actor in a Halloween suit, please! It looks so cheap that it drives me crazy. /> <br /> Secondly, the effects of blood are the spinal cord of any horror film directed at the monster video. Once again, the producers have decided not to spend on decent gore effects. Please take a look at the guy being torn apart in two. This is probably the best scene in the film and takes about ten seconds. The ending is a very poor scene that will not leave you satisfied. <br /> <br /> Acting is the last thing you should expect to have quality in this kind of movie; but in this film it's beyond terrible. A cast of people who have no acting experience make the fool alone for about 85 minutes. A special mention deserves a blond boy with curly hair who tries to convince SWAT members that he is sick. The cough he does is extremely ridiculous. He's probably the worst actor ever in a B-Horror movie, I'm not kidding. Furthermore, Captain Pe√±a offers a terrible performance in the first ten minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> The real story behind the Chupacabras is not even told. All you know is that the monster sucks goat's blood. Why worry about this piece of shit? Plesae, don't even look at it if you have the chance. Not even if it goes on cable. I usually support low-budget horror films because the people involved in them at least try to do something "different" from Hollywood, but that doesn't mean horror fans like me should accept this kind of junk.
