The basic plot is good and can be engaging. The music is so big that it has become the theme music for the IRON CHEF TV show (even though it's too used and too intrusive in the film). So how did this movie end up so poor?!?! Well, the plot was 95% predictable and the characters were as much as possible three-dimensional. And the dialogue ?! What person would actually allow himself to receive credit for having invented the crap of the STUPID macho that claims to be a dialogue? Get a lot more realism from most cartoons! The bottom line is that this film has some positive points, but it is so marked by trite clich√©s and corrupt dialogues that it quickly becomes boring. And this is a pity, because firefighters deserve a better tribute than this mess! If you don't believe me, look at the number of goofs listed on IMDb for this movie - WAY more than you'd expect to find. They didn't care enough to solve all the knots and problems. As a result, the film seems rushed and needs a rewrite and a new modification.
