J Carol Nash and Ralph Morgan act in a film about a mad scientist in love with a pianist's daughter. When his advances are rejected, he injects his father with a disfiguring illness, so he will be forced to come to him for a cure. <br /> <br /> God is terrible. It's boring and boring and you nod before the pianist comes to the surface, I was at the limit. It recovers once things are set in motion, but this is one of those old films better remembered and then seen again. <br /> <br /> If you need to see it, come late <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
