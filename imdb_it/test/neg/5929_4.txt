Presumably this is the final film of the Left Behind series which is the idea of ​​the fundamentalist and novelist preacher Tim LaHaye of what we can expect in our future in the last days of Planet Earth. If this is the case, we can expect an activist presidency in every sense if Barack Obama becomes president next year. <br /> <br /> The Fantastic Four of Revelation will all come back with a cast change, Arnold Pinnock who Know as guidance counselor in Life With Derek, is now the minister who replaces Clarence Gilyard. Brad Johnson as the anti-Christ pilot by day and Christian by night is there as his daughter Janaya Stephens and investigative detective Kirk Cameron. These are the only four people on Earth who have guessed the true nature of the UN Secretary General, Nicolai Karpathy, and once again they are throwing sand into his machinery. <br /> <br /> This time they are allied with the President of the United States who are played by Louis Gossett, Jr. He is experiencing a difficult period, in particular the launch of the guerrillas on an RPG attack on a killing presidential procession Vice President Charles Martin Smith. Exactly, the toad is the vice president. Someone really messed up here because everyone, including those who would harm them, knows that a President and a Vice President NEVER travel together. <br /> <br /> It takes all of them the whole movie to convince Gossett exactly who Karpathy really is. Once again, the best in the film is Gordon Currie as Karpathy. <br /> <br /> We could still see another Left Behind movie again, the door was left open even though people assured me that they ran out of original material from Tim LeHaye. I suppose as long as they earn and these players can't find work in the traditional film industry. And there are some unresolved plot issues involving Brad Johnson and Chelsea Noble which is Mrs. Kirk Cameron in real life. <br /> <br /> One of the Fantastic Four dies in this film, so they will be the Fantastic Three or they will receive another quarter. Stay tuned.
