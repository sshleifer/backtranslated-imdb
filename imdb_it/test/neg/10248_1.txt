For connoisseurs of bad films, Galaxina is a real gem. With really horrendous dialogue, acting and direction, it's not a choice for those looking for a suitable film. But as one of the most unwittingly entertaining films of its kind, it's priceless for a good laugh. In particular, the scenes involving the motorcycle worship cult of Harley Davidson are particularly good, and many other scenes represent an opportunity for an economic laugh. <br /> <br /> Sadly, the scenes with Dorothy Stratten fail to deliver, but since he plays an android, I suppose you can apologize for the wooden acting. <br /> <br /> Lovers of bad movies, don't pass this up!
