I love exotic science fiction / fantasy movies, but this was very unpleasant to watch. Suggestions and images of child abuse, mutilated bodies (dead or alive), other gruesome scenes, plot holes, boring recitation have made this experience unpleasant, The basic idea of ​​entering another person's mind is not even new for movies or TV (An Outer The limits episode was better in exploring this idea). I gave it 4/10 since some special effects were nice.
