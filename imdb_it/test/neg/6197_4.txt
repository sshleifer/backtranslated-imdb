A boring walk through the banalities of Mormon who prostitutes herself. Absolutely not fun. A testament to the widely held theory, that to make the bathroom humor fun, it must necessarily be vulgar; it also reinforces the statement that a close relationship with Jesus does not make you fun. More propaganda than movies, don't worry about any touching social issues that arise at the table after this. The saving grace of this film is his careful portrayal of particularly attractive Mormon young women. Oh well, it's your $ 7.50.
