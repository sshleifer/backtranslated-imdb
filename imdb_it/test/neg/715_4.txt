"People stuck in a country house during a storm find that the house was the sight of an unsolved murder years ago. During a dinner discussion of the incident, the lights go out and, when they come back, they discover that one of the guests have been killed. Fearing for their lives, guests try to discover the secrets behind death before others can happen, "according to the synopsis of the DVD cover. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of clever twists in this murder in the "Old Dark House" story, with "Play within a Play" being its most interesting feature. However, the direction is quite ordinary, which serves to emphasize a certain cheapness of production. Like most films of this type, there is (or should be) a collection of intriguing characters. Here, only the longtime Broadway producer Richard Carle (like Herman Wood) and his fey secretary Johnny Arthur (as Homer Erskine) hold the interest. <br /> <br /> **** The Ghost Walks (1/12/34) Frank R.
