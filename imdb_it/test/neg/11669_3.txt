Even taking into account my unfortunate love for the first two films in the series, wiping out every type of inclination on the part of the character of Max, I really can't manage to claim on average this waste of space that almost everything that happened before. <br /> <br /> Gone is the hard strip that made Mad Max Rockatansky try, the impact of desolation has gone into an apocalyptic world, and more crucial, gone is the passion of director George Miller for the franchise. The terrible score corresponds to the heart of the film's cartoon, it seems that the producers didn't really know what to do with the amount of money paid to make this third (and fortunately last) bet. Of course, the stunts are well-chosen {to be expected by now}, and of course Miller manages to paint an arid desert landscape raising from what he has done before. Yet he clearly fought for new ideas with the action since the crowning of The Road Warrior in the Petrol Tanker research is replicated here, only that he uses a train instead !!. <br /> <br /> It's just a very poor show that could have seemed like an ambitious tour of events in the mid-80s; but when you watch the three films together, Thunderdome runs into a director who loses his angular approach while being swept away by the mix of comedy and fantasy action. And the truth is that none of these gender slants would work individually, in the context of this series, however. I give the 3/10 movie just for a really good Thunderdome fight sequence, while the stuntmen here deserve at least some credit. But this is the third time I have tried to appreciate this film, and as much as it is greedy for punishment, as undoubtedly I am, I will never try again.
