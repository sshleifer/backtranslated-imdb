Based on an Edgar Rice Burroughs novel, AT THE EARTH'S CORE provides little more than a means to escape and give the brain a break. A Victorian scientist, Dr. Abner Perry (Peter Cushing) invents a giant digging machine, which he and his American partner (Doug McClure) use to dig deep into the earth to explore what mysteries it may contain. They soon discover a lost world of subhuman creatures that have conflicts with prehistoric monsters. Cushing presents himself as a distracted professor to the point of being boring. Instead of being a daring adventurer, he comes across an effeminate. On the other hand, McClure is worried enough to make a fool of himself. Caroline Munro plays the beautiful princess Dia who refuses to leave her world near the center of the earth. The cast also includes: Godfrey James, Cy Grant and Michael Crane.
