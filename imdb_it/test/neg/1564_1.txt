Cultural vandalism Is the new production of Hallmark by Gulliver's Travel an act of cultural vandalism? Not literally. After all, not a single copy of the book was burned. But if this is the only one to which Gulliver is exposed, and for many it will be? Those people won't get anything like what Jonathan Swift meant. If Jonathan Swift were alive, Hallmark could be sued for violating moral rights and losing. It's a good way to think before starting a project using someone else's ideas. <br /> <br /> Swift's masterpiece is an extraordinary vision of humanity. Through his hero, Gulliver, he travels to places that make him feel great, small, shat on and ?? human. The small inhabitants of Lilleput are small in every way. Insignificant and stupid, the big supporters and the small supporters are fighting, endless wars of annihilation on which the end of their boiled eggs is opened at the breakfast table. Seems a bit like us. <br /> <br /> I have forgotten most of the rest: it's been years since I read it. The TV show reminded me of some things and, on the positive side, it made me want to read it again. <br /> <br /> This gift to humanity has been shat on, like Gulligan under the branches under the vulgar yahoos and Danson, Steenbergen and above all two great actors, Peter O'Toole and Edward Fox, should be ashamed thoroughly. Some "Creative Person" had the brilliant idea to focus on "the star:" Gulliver, played by Ted Danson, whose acting is simply bad. Describes Gulliver as crazy. All his travels were made. Weeeeel. Yeeeaaah! Obviously Swift invented Gulliver! Of course, the lands he visited were imaginary: it's called fiction. Its purpose was to talk about humanity and our often terrible relationships with one another. His imaginary character's journey to imaginary lands is his method. But these people treat the imagination as a disease and anyone with a moment when the Hallmark cannot turn into one of its anodine cards is suspect. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I'll understand why Hallmark would have produced this shit. It's so ugly that O'Toole, always deep, looks as small as his Lilliputian character. He is in the character, of course, while simultaneously commenting on the character, as many, if not all, of the great actors do. Informing the character sheds light on it. Our light completes the character. It becomes three-dimensional through this act of psychic triangulation. Most actors do it very subtly, like Hopkins in "The Remains of the Day". Others, like Nicholson, in most things over the past twenty years, play the two parts quite broadly. Nicholson actually plays on the relationship between his two points and also with us: with him is the whole cradle of the cat and he, giggling, holds all the ropes. Very funny, as O'Toole is. But something is missing here. He's screaming in a megaphone (fantastic as always) and all the senses are an empty shell under him. <br /> <br /> That's why it is. Look for "anodino" and there should be the word "Hallmark" as a synonym. Inoffensive, bland, inoffensive: Hallmark is the doll that cannot pee because it has no genitals: it is the norm, the average, the person without distinction. Hallmark's hallmark is that it has no distinctive sign. I never suspected that these people despise those who have so much imagination. Suddenly, Pound's "Disney against the meta-physicals" stands out in bold. Or "The men of Einstein's genius will always be violently opposed by mediocre minds". Indeed, anyone, at this mediocre type, who has an answer to any question other than "a)" or "b)" is suspect. Who is more distinctive than a man who travels to the darkest places of the human soul and shines his little torch to illuminate what can be found there? Hence the act of vandalism. The Taliban destroyed the Buddhas in Afghanistan, the Palestinians the oldest synagogue in the world in Jericho, the barbarians the great statuary of the classical age and these things are obviously vandalism. Hallmark strives to protect us from foreign enemies by undermining our culture; what feeds them and supports them And us. <br /> <br /> Please purchase a copy of Gulliver's Travels wherever you live and read it. Or order it online. I like using ABE Books.
