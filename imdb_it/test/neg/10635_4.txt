How can a movie dealing with illegal illegal immigrants be robbed and beaten over the border be boring? Well, "Border Incident" is. <br /> <br /> No wonder that the career of George Murphy, singer and dancer, ended shortly after the release of this terrible film. Politics was certainly a way out for this future senator who dies in a horrible death in this slow film. The film stereotypes the typical Mexican peasant immigrant as dull and terribly boring. <br /> <br /> The film resumes only intensely when the identities of Murphy and Ricardo Montalban were discovered as federal agents for the United States and Mexico respectively. <br /> <br /> Disappointing at its best, we are seeing similar problems in our own society today.
