I rented this movie because I noticed the cover in the video rental store. I saw Nolte, Connely, Madsen, the 1940s time and I thought "hmm, it can't be too bad." Unfortunately, after looking at it, my impression was "not too good". <br /> <br /> It's kind of a repudiation of Chinatown, but the worst part is that, apart from Nolte, the other members of the team haven't gotten enough time on the screen. And Melanie's role was small enough that she hadn't had the chance to be a nuisance.
