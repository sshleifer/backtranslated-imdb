This must be the worst piece of shit I've ever seen. Randy Quaid is fun as a supporting actor in the original, but not as a protagonist. Too much Eddie. The original is a classic. Like the original, the supporting actor brought the show. And Asner was a lot of fun. It's the Eddie of Christmas Vaction 2! Why Snots still looks the same after all those years and all the others in the original look are 14 years older. After 15 minutes of watching this film I don't think I even laughed yet. The island thing didn't work. Had it not been for the beautiful South Pacific female guide on the island, the film would have been a total loss. I sat on this review for a week and yes, I still think the film should never have been made. We hope there is not a THIRD! <br /> <br /> Shawn Gearin
