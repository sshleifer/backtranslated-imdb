Disney Studios' "Snowball Express" is not dated as some of their achievements of this era. There are no hippies or hot-rodders, only Dull-as-dishwater Dean Jones who inherits a run-down hotel / ski resort from a deceased relative. When Jones and his family move to a sleepy Colorado town, the people who give them directions - they look extra from "Deliverance" - are curiously vague about the hotel (we expect it to look like a one-room shack), but actually the accommodations are very nice. Jones's teenage daughter looks harsh all over her face (which doesn't stop one of the local yahoos from looking at her), and obviously the awkward pop Dean Jones is a normal stumbling block, which leads to many pratfalls in the mud. Perhaps this square scenario may have benefited from some magical extravagance, because this script is rigid. * from ****
