Okay wait let me take this route, there are actually some idiots on this site who think this is one of the best if not the best Halloween sequel. I even read someone who said it was as good as the original. Pah what a nonsense don't believe him, I watched every Halloween and clearly unlike some people he knows what makes at least a good horror movie and this S shower is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen in my life. Frankly, if I were John Carpenter, I would sue the person who wrote this or that in his place with a shotgun. Seriously the Halloween sequels in general are almost all crappy, two are crap, three are stupid, four are good, five are five, H20 is good, Resurrection is painful. Yet in many ways, I find this to be the worst of a bad group of sequels. Why? Well, let me embark on a sort of rant, not so much a review, as an irrational rant about why Michael Myers' Halloween 6 is one of the most abysmal films I've seen in a long time. OK, I should start, ah yes, the plot oh boy the plot. Basically the plot is a casino full of cults, signs of Thor and other crap. It's just stupid, the film tries to be flashy and smart again, piled up in such a horribly done way. Why did Michael Myers have a reason to kill people? Simple explanation to which Micahel loves to kill his relatives that would be sufficient, but we must not have a man in black and mysterious cults and signs of Thor and charlatan. God is so bad that it made me want to really cry, the writers tried to add to the character of Myers but they managed to do the opposite. In addition to wearing a mask and a swimsuit <which is a completely different color, Myers is not the same type as the original or even two, maybe even four. Here's another thing, why did Myers become a parody of Jason Voorhes? I thought it was meant to be the opposite, yet Myers is so similar to Jason, all he does is endlessly kill people in bloody ways. In the original he made fun of his victims he took his time and, consequently, the whole thing was much more suspense. In this he simply walks around hacking people to death. I mean that in the space of half an hour we had equaled the amount of kills in the original, it was simply ridiculous. Oh and Myers in this seems to have a very big head, I mean his huge and hes put on a lot of weight. What else is crap, oh yes, the return of Tommy Jarvis is pretty bad, in fact all the characters in this movie are the crap bar Doctor Loomis, of course. I can't stand the boy, I wish he had caught it. He's really irritating. Our eroin is boring and uninteresting. And his whole family is a terrible group of actors. The mother is garbage, the brother is bad and the Father I mean was his first part or something? He was like an evil cartoon for the gods, he was actually more evil than Myers. <Between his death is one of the most abysmal I've ever seen, I think even 13 would not come out with something so utterly ridiculous. What else is rubbish oh yeah Tommy Jarvis, I don't know the boy's name but he can't act, he does his best to be serious and all that but I just wanted to laugh at him. I wish he was dead, in fact, if everyone were dead, it would have been good enough. There is Dr. Loomis, a horribly aged and dying man, Donald Pleasence. Despite being at his last legs, Pleasance is still the protagonist in the short period of time in which he performs. It is a pity that such a cornerstone of this franchise had to say goodbye to garbage like this. What else is rubbish, oh yes the piece where the DJ radio gets it. First of all, how the hell did Michael get into that van when he was at his house five minutes ago? Secondly, it was just a useless killing that could increase the number of people, but it is just another trap of absurdity, which adds this movie to madness. It is death that says this to me, as it was useless, very similar to this film.
