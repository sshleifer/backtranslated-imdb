Forget what I said about Emeril. Rachael Ray is the most irritating personality on the food web and all television. If you've never seen 30 Minutes Meals, then you absolutely can't begin to understand how annoyingly annoyed it is. Actually, I really meant that you can't even begin to get bogged down by yourself until you've seen the show once or twice, and even then all the clever words and thoughts you'll miss. The problem is largely with its mannerisms as you might have guessed. Ray has a stupid mouth and often imitates the parrot. If you love something or think it's "fantastic" (a word you use around 87 times for TV broadcast), just say it. And he constantly uses horrible and not funny phrases like "EVOO" (extra virgin olive oil!). SHUT UP! What's worse is that Ray has TWO other programs on the net! I think this is a conspiracy drawn up by terrorists to drive us crazy. Give me more Tyler Florence! Ray is lame.
