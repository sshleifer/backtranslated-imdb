Fans of horror comedy will appreciate this. Others may be quickly annoyed and turn it off. It's a kind of friendly film, with extravagant violence and gore, deliberately stereotyped characters and a lot of madness. <br /> <br /> It appears to have been made with a budget of around $ 100, from a group of fraternity boys after a big beer party. There is a protagonist who is a frustrated nerd, and his playful friend who plays jokes to those who drink about 30 times a second. There is a nice monster truck that chases them for hundreds of miles, which is the highlight of the movie. Whenever this thing and its indiscreet mask appears, it's a great scene. There is a mysterious girl who appears by chance in the back seat, and a lot of giant boys in overalls who sit in red bars on their necks. The nerd's friend never closes his yap and puts them in trouble after another. Their arguments have given me nerve, but other aspects of the film are compensated. <br /> <br /> The gags of sight that make fun of each other in "psychopathic and trying to croak someone" films are everywhere. Choose the one that is more blurry: Hills Have Eyes, Saw, and Jeepers Creepers were some I recognized. <br /> <br /> It is pleasant madness, if you are in the right frame of mind. Sensory animation breweries with your friends can make viewing more fun; it's a good bet that it's the condition of the filmmakers when they put this together.
