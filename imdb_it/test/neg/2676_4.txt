"The curse of Michael Myers" is a very frustrating piece to deal with for a fan of the Halloween series. After a very disappointing disappointment on Halloween 5, the series reached a near ebb in the plot lines, with a stupid devolution in witchcraft and a teenage cult dedicated to the cult of Michael Myers. "The curse of Michael Myers" increases the stakes in blood and blood, but it really represents a decay of the integrity of the series. It's a shame, as this is Donald Pleasance's last film as a Dr. Loomis character. Pleasance has some good moments on screen (precious if you are a fan of the series) like the now very old and as "retired doctor" says. Unfortunately he died before the film was completed, and it is very clear, at the conclusion of the film, that the original stories of the climatic scene were never realized. From the beginning, Halloween 6 feels more like a TV movie, then the horror block-buster movie that started in 1978. Any faithful Halloween student should have asked more from this movie, ... dr. Loomis and Donald Pleasance deserved more.
