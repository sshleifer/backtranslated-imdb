All I can do is echo the sentiment already expressed by some of the other commentators. This is CITY OF GOD meets HAPPY DAYS. The bipolarity of the ruthless criminal (one minute a ruthless killer, the minute after a commercial for Luv's diapers) is not entirely convincing. You can face it in two ways: (1) A gritty and realistic film made mawkish; or (2) a sappy, ABC-afterschool-special with swear words, violence and animal cruelty. In any case, just don't fly, do it? Why did he receive so much praise? As others have implied, he gets the "conscience vote" from the west. Show us the images of poverty in contrast to our soft double-wide theater seats and 44-ounce coca-colas, and we will be applauding in the blink of an eye. But - oh - don't forget to dress him in candy, because the bitter pill of reality (as tempting as it is) is hard to digest. <br /> <br /> I am terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are much more deserving film works out there. All I can say is: watch out for any film that receives awards (Hollywood Oscars = triple junk, syrupy, Cannes Film Festival = stroking your beard, propaganda without art). To find the real gems, you will have to work hard on them.
