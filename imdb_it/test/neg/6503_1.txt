The ABC prepares its repertory company for another unrealistic representation of rural Australia. Yes folks, it's all there Baca Bourke (Jeremy Sims, a small talent actor) Fire hero, Lill (Libby Tanner plays Bronwyn Craig in the bush), Fifi (Nadia Townsend) slutty town, preggers from Baca's brother Joe (I think). Then there's Uncle Geoff the, Big Daddy of Lost Springs. Uncle Geoff's scenes are as fast as Tennessee Williams. The only Russian actress is Natalia Novikova, the Russian actress, like Baca's madness. She is great. I can't understand why John Waters played the role of Lilly's psychologist husband. I need the money I expect! Still, it won't last long, while Lill and Baca will make him wear a suit. Look at this lemon to see how ugly an Australian show can be. Frankly, I'm ashamed.
