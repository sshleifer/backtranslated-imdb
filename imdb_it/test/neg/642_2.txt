Alien Express is one of the worst films I've ever bothered to experiment with. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable. The aliens look like rubber stocking puppets. The effects would have been mediocre in the 1970s, but they are simply atrocious by today's standards. Couldn't they make a real train roll instead of using an obvious model? <br /> <br /> Acting is not exceptional but, in reality, dialogue is the worst part. It makes its way into your mind. "Don't die with me, not now." If you ever manage to suspend disbelief for enough time to be absorbed into the film, you will quickly be brought back to reality by the aliens, the model train or the clich√© dialogue. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't give this film a "1" is that it doesn't deserve to be evaluated so badly that some poor suckers could watch it for the pleasure of a really bad movie.
