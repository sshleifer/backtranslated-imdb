STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Danny (Mel Raido) is a lone worker who tries to get by his job is to be a good dad for his two daughters after a messy divorce from their mother (Maxine Peake.) But after a fight with his daughters attending a Working Men's Club, he uses a trip to their dance class to take take a look at Louis (Colin Salmon) and his band of tough men who train in the boxing gym / free weights section there and train in a harder, more assertive person. In a short time he took Louis's philosophies to heart and joined him as a nightclub porter while the 80s skate party starts playing ... but when Sparky (Scott Williams) tries to deal with drug dealing, everything it becomes pear shaped. <br /> <br /> As Robert De Niro once stated in the film A Bronx Tale, "there is no tragedy greater than the wasted talent". The Clubbed writer had a good idea and a talent to turn it into a sort of movie ... but without the ability, it seems, to put it all together into a kind of coherent movie. <br /> <br /> Like a brummie, some of the filming locations (especially a scene at the end outside the Ring O 'Bells in Moseley pub!) They were easy enough and fun to spot ... but the dark aspect of cinematography is really a negative aspect of things. Some really poor acting, for example the main actor Raido with an indecipherable accent that is everywhere, and a hammam script with unsuitable dialogues, however, are major problems for the film. More established actors like Peake and even Neil Morressey's favorite are sidelined by very small support parts, while Raido and Ronnie Fox's disastrous villain is the center of attention. Williams is the bewitching Sick Boy of a poor man, leaving Salmon and Shaun Parkes to appear the only artists that have remained whole as a whole, as the excessive violent violence of blood takes over (which becomes a common tendency for the films of British animation!). Really a missed opportunity. **
