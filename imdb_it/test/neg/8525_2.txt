I almost laughed out loud when during the comment the director said that this film is original with a very strong plot. There isn't one ... repeat an original storyline or special effect in this blah movie. <br /> <br /> The Crows .... Hitchcock has done a great deal of feedback before CGI and even with CGI this movie is not up to a well done attack scene. The creeping crawling boy ... The Grudge did it and he did it better. The psychopath ... made at Cold Creek Manor recently, however it was done to death. No pun intended. Disconnected / rebellious teenager that nobody listens to ... about a dozen films have used this movie in Beetlejuice. The dull basement stuff ... can you say Amnityville Horror? The doors opened so ... not what Lies Sotto did with much more talent. Creepy farm ... too numerous to mention. <br /> <br /> The background of metaphysics, which should have been the main objective, is lost when one discovers what is happening, which by the way is quite early. <br /> <br /> One thing (of many in reality) that they never even tried to explain in the film is how they explain to the police that their attacker was sucked into slime in the basement, so they don't actually have a body. <br /> <br /> Overall ... NOT BISHER
