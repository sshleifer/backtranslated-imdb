I hope this is not a harbinger of things to come. High-definition video cameras are becoming cheaper (although I wouldn't say that's what was used here), so it's an open season for all aspiring Scorseses and Tarantinos. <br /> <br /> The convenience of this stinker is not hidden, and calling it a "movie" would make the industry very uncomfortable. Photography is a standard you would expect on a family outing to the zoo. I could build a new house with all the wooden acting. What is remarkable is that nobody stands out as the worst. They are all equally terrible. Like a bag of Ben Afflecks. O Steven Seagals. <br /> <br /> What fascinated me was the title. I suck at this kind of thing, like Frankenhooker or Monsturd. Frankenhooker was also very bad, but at least I got some laughs, and the acting was just bad, not terrible. I can't comment on Monsturd because I haven't got a copy of it yet. <br /> <br /> However, I hope the people who did this didn't make any money. Otherwise they could be encouraged to try it again. Please, boys, engage the camera and return to your normal work.
