I had to rent a couple of movies for my New Year's cousin and chose Swan Princess: Mystery of the Enchanted Kingdom and Little Mermaid 2 and we just watched both movies while she is sleeping, I thought I could get a couple of comments in. :) Although this is a very poor cartoon, it wasn't so bad. You have to admit that for children these plots are new to them and could be a great introduction to these stories. <br /> <br /> Odette discovers that Derek has secretly guarded Rosthoe's magical secrets and she tells Derek to destroy them immediately, but he is a boy, he usually doesn't and tells her he can't reach magic without his help. When a witch named Zelda puts her hands on them, she discovers that Derek has torn the last words of a spell he wants to use to destroy everything, and kidnaps Odette to retrieve this information. <br /> <br /> The Swan Princess: The Mystery of the Enchanted Kingdom is foolish and predictable, but for children I would honestly say it's an attempt. It's so rare that now we have these clean cartons one day, so I'm going to cut the film some time. It was weird to see all the rumors change suddenly, I grew up with the first one, so I guess it was just stuck in my head. <br /> <br /> 4/10
