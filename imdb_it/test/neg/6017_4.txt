Christopher Guest is the master of the mockumentary. Werner Herzog is one of the many great documentarians out there. Zak Penn is not good at either, but he could certainly take a lesson from the other two. The guest often plays with reality and fiction, but the line between the two is always clear in his films, a kind of essential with a mockumentary. Penn could also take a lesson from The Blair Witch Project. Even if you knew it was a fake documentary that came into your world, the whole world created by the filmmakers. It seems to the public as if everything were real even if you know, after all, you are looking at fiction. In other words, fiction was successfully masked as a truth. In fact, many of the first viewers to watch it, at Sundance and other premieres, thought it was real. Penn, whose fort, by his own admission, is the script, should probably stick to that. The documentary or the mockumentary film (and it's hard to say where it starts and the other ends with this film) is obviously not. <br /> <br /> Penn sets the stage for what he tries to sell as a legitimate documentary on the filming of a documentary, a kind of meta-documentary. Penn, however, confuses the public, and loses confidence, from the start when he enters Herzog's home before filming Herzog's "Enigma of Loch Ness" on the myth of the Loch Ness monster (a film that apparently was never ended up probably due to Penn's interference). Although Penn is apparently the director of the movie we're watching, he starts it by looking at the cameras and saying "What is the film crew doing here?" and starts to move away from them. He does it on another couple of occasions. He will stop and tell the cameras to stop shooting, thus forcing the camera guy to hide in the shadows to collect fragments of dialogue between Herzog and Penn. It seems to be a gimmick, but it has never been clarified, and Penn seems to be intentionally keeping us in the dark. This leaves the audience scratching their heads wondering "Who's the boss here?" If Penn is working against his film crew what kind of world are we part of? This is just one of many examples of how it confuses the boundary between reality and fiction. <br /> <br /> Penn seems to enter completely into the world of fiction (I think) when the crew has sightings of what appears to be the Loch Ness monster. But when the monster makes its first appearance, we are completely out of the imaginary world that Penn tried to create, so everything seems silly and useless. <br /> <br /> This is a potentially fascinating film and a real missed opportunity as Penn has the opportunity to document a master at work, but completely loses his focus and becomes a film about Penn and his antics instead of documentary footage. Penn's presence begins to pervade and obscure the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> The interviews on Herzog are convincing and we believe that he is not acting. We even begin to wonder if he and the other members of his crew are tricked by Penn, as is the public, but you're never sure. Penn, in his camera interviews, tries to be bizarre and unintentionally funny, like the characters interviewed in a guest mockumentary, but only manages to be boring. In a film for Guest this effect is exhilarating, while here it falls empty because you're never sure what Penn is. As a result we, the public, begin to hate him as much as the crew seems. Apart from the beautiful scenery and the superfluous appearance, from nothing, of a beautiful model, thrown to give the spice of the film, there is little to recommend here. Perhaps its only redeeming (unintentional) quality is that it is an excellent example of why the public is important; and by completely ignoring the conventions of the narrative, you make them become a disservice. Only for this reason I think this would be a good movie to show to film students ?? a kind of "what not to do" type of film. I have nothing against a film told in an unconventional way, as long as it is done with skill, with a thematic basis for giving substance. This film is completely missing. <br /> <br /> I'd like to call it a valiant effort for something, but I'm not sure what it is, apart from a complete mess and, ultimately, a waste of time. <br /> <br /> (As a side note: it seems that bad art is always a positive reminder. This film made me think of the book "Picture" by Lillian Ross. Ross followed John Huston around during filming of "The Red Badge of Courage" and brilliantly documented it for the New Yorker: it would really be a great movie. If you want a great example of meta-art, read it.)
