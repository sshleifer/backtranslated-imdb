Italians are indisputable masters in the questionable "art" of tearing and imitating films. What they do is take an innovative concept, which makes money and foreigners, keep the basic plot and add just a lot of actions, sleaze and political misconduct. But what to do when the non-Italian original is already a film known as known and quite difficult to overcome in terms of slop and controversy? Well, I guess, you simply have to ignore everything in terms of story building or style and concentrate completely on creating something that is practically a porn movie! This Italian turkey was inspired by Richard Fleischer's successful "Mandingo" slavery saga, published a year earlier, but since the producers were even too lazy to think of a different title, you should not expect anything remotely resembling a narrative depth, drawings of characters, upsetting atmospheres or statements that stimulate reflection on intercultural relations. "MandingA" is pure and simply a sexploitation effort in which the plot develops only in the last ten minutes, in other words when you stopped worrying long ago. The characters in this film are a collection of despicable bastards, which is obviously to be expected when you're dealing with rich and hateful white people who run a plantation in South America. The elder and extremely shabby owner of the place is a widower (who probably also won a couple of "Mustache-of-the-year" awards) that exploits and endures slaves who work for him for a long time. His lover, who if I understand correctly, is also his cousin (?), Is a real whore of a woman who enjoys provoking arguments and sneaking out of the house during the night to copulate with crucified slaves. When the son of the plantation owner returns from Europe, after about 25 minutes of purely wasted execution time, the plot begins to develop eventually. The handsome young man has sex with the shrewish woman a couple of times (even in front of slaves, presumably to "prove" how their masters do it?) But eventually falls in love with the cherub preacher's daughter. His romantic preference obviously angers the bitch woman with anger, and she traces a horrible cruel act of revenge that will forever change life on the plantation. Hey ?? I just realized that this brief description of the plot actually makes "Mandinga" an interesting movie! Well, it is NOT and I apologize if I raised anyone's anticipations. It is an incredibly boring and horrible film to fight on, but if the themes attract you, definitely check the aforementioned "Mandingo". Much more than a sick exploitation, that film is a truly insightful portrait of one of the darkest pages in the history of mankind and it was also a film produced correctly, with real actors, fantastic music and impressive film settings. "Mandinga" has nothing, absolutely nothing to offer.
