Talk about acting ... !!!! not only from Govinda, but also from Salman and Lara .... The direction was terrible. The first half hour you would almost like to turn off the movie ... because this movie is a real stinker (mark my words. <br /> <br /> I liked Govinda in some of his comedic roles like Haseena Maan Jaayegi, Jodi No. 1, Akhiyon if Goli Maare and Jis Desh Mein Ganga Rehta Hai and this is not comparable to any of them and Salman Khan should definitely not make comical roles !! It sucks, he doesn't know how to make comedy. of comedy he had was in Andaz Apna Apna, which was brilliant next to Amir Khan. <br /> <br /> There were so many "too stupidly stupid" scenes in this film that make you want to shoot out the DVD and burn it so no one else in your house ever looks at it again.
