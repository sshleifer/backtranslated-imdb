This is really a two-half movie. The first describes in detail the lives and friendship of two boys (one a privileged Pashtun and the other trampled Hazara) in the 1970s in Afghanistan, before the invasion of the USSR works very well. The young actors turn into convincing performances and see Afghanistan as it once threw the current situation there in clear relief. <br /> <br /> The real problem comes when we enter the next phase of the story where we join the Pashtun as a man living in America. Ancient debts to his young friend lead him to return to his homeland and it is at this point that things break. The central adult character is clearly supposed to be understanding, but in reality he comes across a state of disgust and self-satisfaction. It's hard to really take care of him and you can't help but feel that the really interesting story is the one we don't see - that of his childhood friend. <br /> <br /> Once he returns to Afghanistan, the narrative gets bogged down in a series of very elaborate coincidences. The most surprisingly he manages to meet his childhood enemy after all these years almost immediately (even if he is not looking for it), despite the chaos that has since consumed the country. This allows him to face the demons of the past in a way that is simply too convenient to be credible. The resolution of the narration is also accompanied by a terrible and mushy sentimentality that undermines any really serious point that the film might want to try. <br /> <br /> Although it is possible to start seeing the characters and abuses of their lives as symbols of a state that has been torn apart by world politics, it is difficult to see it as a film that engages in political discussion wider. Instead narration is reduced to the emotional journey of a character of self-discovery and healing. Unfortunately this character is so boring and wrapped up in himself that it's hard to really engage in his story, while the opportunities to make a really interesting film about Afghanistan itself are wasted.
