This film can have a certain historical importance, and certainly it seems surprising how the facts are together, the setting, the rocket, the space suits, the surface of the moon, everyone shouts "a classic" - but in the end, the result makes a film rather boring to the eyes of today, and the 50s technological scenes you could hope for in a film like this are not enough to reward the chance to sit through all the bad dialogue and predictable developments of the plot. The characters and the plot can reward a sociological scientific analysis, but they bring too little entertainment value many times. <br /> <br /> Much of this film looks like a good movie for nine-year-olds. Mature themes, human drama and violence are maintained at a child's level of happiness. <br /> <br /> Images of the earth and the moon seen from space could actually be more accurate than those in "2001", but what if their use were dramatically inefficient. Especially 2001 may seem like a prolonged meditation on the themes of this film, and hasn't Star Wars in any way modeled the opening titles with spatial scrolling on the opening titles of this film? But then again - inheritance is marginal. <br /> <br /> If it's a classic 1950s sci-fi revolutionary and mega-influential looking for you, check out "Forbidden Planet".
