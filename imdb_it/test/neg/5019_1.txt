This film is absolutely incredible. The only way a girl would do this with a dog is if she had severe mental health problems or had a long history of sexual abuse or was under duress. Yet we are asked to believe that an otherwise normal healthy female is just bored and has "made a small mistake" and oops had a sexual encounter with a dog. He also never had any negative effects on her, except when he tells someone. <br /> <br /> She wasn't raped by a dog or the dog did something she couldn't resist - she actively started oral sex and completed this activity with a pet dog of her choice. He was not under the influence of drugs or anything, simply "he felt like it". <br /> <br /> The rest of the film tries to put this action in a light of "hey could happen to anyone who is just honest". <br /> <br /> But we really believe that we must believe that this is a woman who is able to do absolutely SOMETHING if she simply feels that way. Think about it - could you have considered the rights and errors of this action before completing it? If he did, he would stop at his tracks. Human beings have instinctive boundaries for reasons. If we were to start considering bestiality as a small "pretty" aberration, what will be next? Child abuse? Yet the heroine is interpreted as a good girl who had a moment of aberration. If she had been forced to do this by a rapist - the story could have made more sense and I would have been able to accept the plot. But there is no way for someone to carry out the prolonged activity required and even reported once - if there is not some deep disorder that requires a great deal of psychiatric help. This is absolutely not a success in an otherwise perfect life. <br /> <br /> I know this is just a movie, but it is through the normalization of behavior like this through the media that society becomes desensitized and increasingly become horrible realities. <br /> <br /> I could imagine a rapist showing this to a child to convince them that it's not a big deal and then move on to their agenda. It could also be used by a rapist to point out a child not talking about the abuse - because he looks at how people will react if you do. <br /> <br /> It is not a question of truth. The director wants people to think it's true. This is about the degradation and ease with which people (the viewing public) can be manipulated to accept the most terrifying concepts if wrapped in the right way. The watching audience is manipulated, degraded and derided. <br /> <br /> This is a film in which actors and spectators are humiliated and made ridiculous in a very sophisticated way by an intelligent but extremely disturbed writer. <br /> <br /> This film seems to have been used as a vehicle for the creator of the film to get down to the excitement of playing with the mind in an offensive way. I don't know if he's conscious of them - but it's the most classic example of Mind F *** k I've ever met. <br /> <br /> I hope this doesn't offend anyone too much. But if you've watched this movie, I don't think there's room to take offense at anything.
