I just saw this movie and all I can say is, where are the drives these days. It looks like it would have been a second feature on a record in 1977 (maybe playing with one of those Joan Collins films), but it's worth looking at now if you feel nostalgic for the 70s. A silly plot that is full of holes, but remembers one of the era in which it was created. Interesting to see Melanie Griffith so young and Anne Lockhart is quite attractive, though not very actress. In reality, there is not much acting in this film. It's kind of an adventure by Dukes of Hazzard without a twang or a 1969 Dodge loader that jumps over stuff in the woods. But there is a Mecrury Comet that jumps over a dump in this one!
