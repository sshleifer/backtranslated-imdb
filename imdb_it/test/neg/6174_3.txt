Ugh. Even the ever-popular Diane Lane couldn't save this movie, and the most exciting thing about the movie was seeing if Rourke's face would move. One heard so many "gossip" about his botched face-lift, etc., as well as a roadside accident, we just had to slow down and see the wreck. The plot was thin. Here we have a very professional hit man who somehow clings to a wild and uncontrollable punk / crook, and in this whole movie we're wondering why this guy stays with this idiot, not to mention he gets together with the guy in the first place. So the crime that was not even committed has the professional going after the witnesses. He would have snapped them immediately. But then, we wouldn't have had a movie then, would we? And why did the real estate agent even agree to extortion? There were more holes in this film than in my colander. The acting was horrible, the whole film predictable until the last minute and even the ending. And so much could have been done to make this movie much better. But if you have about 90 minutes to kill and you don't have to use any brain cells in the process, then this movie is just what the doctor ordered.
