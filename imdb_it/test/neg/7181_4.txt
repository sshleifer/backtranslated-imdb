If this is Commander Hamilton's best film, I have no curiosity for others. <br /> <br /> The greatest instruments of a film actor are his eyes, but when Peter Stormare wants to show great emotions, he closes his, so for five or six seconds we come to admire his eyelids while his feelings they remain unknown behind them. Unpleasant acting technique. <br /> <br /> Stormare also winces when he shoots with a gun, turning his head and closing his eyes. Look carefully. James Bond can feel comfortable with a competition like this. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting supporting performances by other actors, but not enough to hang an entire movie. The cinematography is good-looking, doing a great job in capturing the Nordic cold. Even the Sahara seems cold. Perhaps Hamilton brings his own climate with him. <br /> <br /> There are some good individual action sequences here. Unfortunately, the only sense of humor on the screen belongs to the villain, who turns the hero into a big pill. James Bond's lines may not be particularly good, but at least he doesn't always seem constipated. <br /> <br /> A positive point in favor of the film is that Israel's psychotic, twisted and vicious hatred of Guillou's books has been excluded. What has been maintained is the worship of a noble and heroic PLO, who shows us that it works in Libya without the knowledge or supervision of the dictator Gaddafi. This fantasy is hard to believe, since Gaddafi actually threw the PLO out of Libya for four years at a time. And at the end of the film, Hamilton gives the PLO a very disturbing gift. Where will they use that gift? Hamilton doesn't care. <br /> <br /> We are very, very far from "For whom the bell tolls" here. <br /> <br /> Captain Hamilton will remain a local phenomenon. While Henning Mankell's books sell well all over the world, Jan Guillou will never have the same success. <br /> <br /> Regarding this film, bleeeeaaahhhhh.
