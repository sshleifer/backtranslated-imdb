Stupid horror film about five twenties (3 boys, 2 girls) who go to this place in the middle of nowhere. What they don't know is that Dr. Chopper and his female assistants attack and kill anyone who ventures into their woods. They use their body parts for some experiments ... or something like that. Five college girls and two lesbians are also killed and show some cracks. <br /> <br /> Rather desperate. The story is confusing and boring; the blood is ridiculously false; Dr. Chopper and his assistants exceed TERRIBLY; there is a terrible black "humor" in here and people just stand while their friends are attacked or stand there and let people kill them. <br /> <br /> This was rather offensive. There are some advantages. A one-hour turnaround was quite good and the five young actors are actually good! Chase Hoyt is as big as Reese; Butch Hansen is OK as Jimmy; Ashley McCarthy is also as good as Tamara and Robert Adamson has his moments with Nicholas. The best of all is Chesley Crisp like Jessica - it was excellent! Some of the dramatic scenes between these five were well acted and interesting. Unfortunately the dialogue was not really there for them. I'm giving a 4 for their performances - but it's not worth mentioning here. I hope these actors will get roles worthy of them.
