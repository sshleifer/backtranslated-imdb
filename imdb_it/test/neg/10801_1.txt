It's the Sooooouullltakaaaa! <br /> <br /> Wow. What a skin that peels bad film. Honestly, this is one of my favorite episodes of MST3K .... Just a few things to point out ... <br /> <br /> 1) The incestuous lesbian mother-daughter exchange was strange. I need advice now. <br /> <br /> 2) There is no God, there is only Friend. I love that quote by Crow. <br /> <br /> 3) Whatever happened to the Sisters who took the bus home, will we ever know? I have a horrible vacuum in my stomach. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, don't watch this non-MSTied movie ... It has Joe Estevez as the main star .. Yikes .. <br /> <br /> 1/10 for MSTied 8/10 for MSTied.
