Look, this film is terrible ... the "plot" involves two twins who are neglected by their self-absorbing parents, and left to the care of a series of baby-sitters and baby-sitters, which all children drive away being completely unpleasant. In the end, the engineer boys condemn Beverly D'Angelo to be their new nanny, why are you interested? And D'Angelo watches a TV talk show about selling kids and decides he'll try to sell the twins ... and, well, you don't want to know. It's all very unpleasant, and not at all funny. In fact, the announcer put this film on before it arrived on the TV channel I was watching! Don't worry about wasting a single moment of your life in this pile of complete garbage, right?
