To begin with, I love Steven Seagal, the man is a genius. But recent films leave me speechless, are you still trying? His latest films show almost no effort on the part of Seagal. In Out of Reach, it's too obvious that his lines are dubbed. . What Seagal does in this film is not just a slap in the face to his fans, but even more to Jean-Claude Van Damme and his fans. In the second scene or so, when he prepares to make brass knuckles in the attic of drug dealers to steal jewels and money, he shows them to fix the gun and hook it to a neon sign. You could say to yourself, "Yah, so what does this have to do with Van Damme?" Well, that scene was stolen from a film by Jean-Claude Van Damme called the Order. Rent both, look at both, compare both and you will lose respect for Seagal. Not only was today the garbage of Die You, but it was, I dare say, an insult. Seagal's Aikido moves are still good, but because he's not making great films like Marked for Death or Above the law, hes still got the moves and the attitude, I just wonder 'Why Seagal, Why?' There are such idiotic scenes in his most recent films that have nothing to do with the plot, and such idiotic stories on top of that. I hope the upcoming Black Dawn movie will be another Exit Wounds or Beyond Justice, because the last chain of films he made, in particular Today You Die, really made me wonder if he had things to do more action movies as big as Double Team. Please don't watch this movie unless you hate Seagal, if you love your movies don't watch it, it will make you question its future in the action film genre.
