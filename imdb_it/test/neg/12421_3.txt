Wild Rebels is funny in a bad way, but also frustrating because of the real, or at least feasible, elements of the story. This is a race car driver (Steve Alaimo) who gets confused with a group of bikers called Satan's Angels, who wanders a lot until they decide to rob a bank. Meanwhile, Alaimo is also recruited by the police to tell them what the Angels are doing and where they will be robbed. It is not even true that the film is really too "dated", although it obviously bears the rough and stupid music in the film (from the band on stage in a scene, to Alaimo "performing" if you can call that drek that, to the generic score regular). <br /> <br /> Only the director no longer cares about putting in a little more logic, direction and better actors for the parts. Just as I did not dislike the film, as I did with the Hellcats, but it also left me a little indifferent to all this. What may seem unpredictable comes only with stupid things like the name of the city of Florida ("Citrusville" ho-ho). So it's not entirely worthy of its Mystery Science Theater 3000 status recently. The comment is good on the film, even if once or twice I almost wanted to know what the characters were saying on the screen in case it could be worth anything. Wild Rebels could be more than a good time if you have a six pack and low expectations, but since I wouldn't watch it anymore.
