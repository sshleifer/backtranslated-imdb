This program would be useful for training the basic human emotions of hardened criminals. Beyond this purpose, the show has no other value than to fill the bandwidth that otherwise would not be used in the electromagnetic spectrum. I feel a greater sense of suspense and expectation by listening to a computerized voice chip that continuously buzzes the products of a random number generator. Fortunately, useful and frequent musical cues will tell viewers how they should feel, if they are not able to completely internalize the predictable and superficial plot. I found Amy as a superficially positive character, as she is a model for young women who can serve in traditionally male fields. Unfortunately, his totally subjective approach to the law is driven solely by the whimsical personal guidelines that Amy chooses to employ, which has led Amy's evidence to more closely resemble the appeals to the personal mercy of a tribal despot than to a true administration of justice. This show is unpleasant in any quantity, even if this is to some extent mitigated after two episodes from the filtering processes given by the god, thanks to which the show will fortunately leave the same imprint in the spectator's memory as a television tuned to a dead channel at maximum volume
