I had never heard of "budget" author Neil Johnson before seeing "Battlespace" on DVD on Hollywood Video. A few minutes from the movie I realize that this is not a bad thing. Like many sci-fi films directed at video, this is a film largely dominated by bad special effects and a constant parade of pretentious science fiction concepts that fail to create a story. <br /> <br /> Spectators are tortured with an introduction to the religious sounding text, then an oral introduction followed by a narration of the protagonist's daughter. For me this seemed like a smoke screen to mask a film with brutally militant images and an emphasis of zero character. Some people here all seem too ready to take this movie seriously and swallowed its seemingly new line of hooking for age messages and sinkers. These favorable reviews must come from the same kind of people who can fool themselves into thinking that things like "Battlefield Earth" were a brilliant film, or that Shasta is as good as Coca-Cola. <br /> <br /> Those who were attracted by the cover of confectionery art, can't wait for a bad performance (in small doses, interspersed with long blocks of people who don't speak), computerized animated effects (in doses too large) and irritating talking computers. What you will not get is excitement, emotional stimulation, memorable dialogue or a good story. <br /> <br /> "Battlespace" is an impenetrable bull and the constant irritating narrative proves it. True science fiction, hell, real cinema, it's about characters and their dialogue, not special effects and boring predictions. This is right there with similar science-fiction videos like "Cl.One" and "Recon 2022". If the boredom of "Strange Horizons" and "Alien Visitor" is something you are looking for, for all intents and purposes, to look at you in these parts. If you like fascinating stories and hate the fake lens flares, you're better off with a real movie.
