I wanted to see this film because I liked "Kavkazskij Plennik" ("Prisoner of the mountains") and "Brat" ("Brother") with Sergey Bodrov, Jr. and "Vor" ("The thief") with Vladimir Mashkov. Well, unlike the other films, "The Quickie" was a complete waste of time. The story that makes little sense, very irregular acting (Lesley Ann Warren was particularly bad), really horrible dialogues, poor cinematography, what else could go wrong? I find it amusing that in practically all films made by Americans, when foreigners who speak the same language (in this case the Russians) are left alone, they prefer to communicate with each other mostly in English (and when they speak Russian , for some reason the translators feel obliged to add a lot of "f ** ks" in the sentences, which have no swearing, literal or non-literal). At the same time, native English speakers choose to speak in broken Russian. Why? Returning to the story, most of the subplots of the film (eg. Betting the house, inviting Latin American paramilitaries, etc.) makes no sense or does nothing but confuse the spectators. Too bad Bodrov, Mashkov and Leigh (all good actors in my humble opinion) got involved in this disaster.
