Oh boy. Movies like this really bother me. If this film should approach the truth, then I assume that Rommel knew Hitler for a while before the start of World War II. In the film, Rommel mentions how Hitler has changed from before. Well, I can't imagine that Rommel wouldn't know anything about Hitler's government policies, so Rommel has to share a sense of guilt for German atrocities. With that in mind, I have a problem with a movie that makes Rommel's life tragic in the end. Did you make your choices and feel bad for him? I can't do it. Also, I can't buy the theory that if the most competent generals were allowed to fight the war, the allies would have had more trouble winning it. If more competent people were in charge, World War II may never have started in the first place. From a cinematic aspect, the film jumps from one place to another and most of the time it seems a special story with famous actors playing historical roles. Leo G. Carroll has a couple of good scenes with James Mason and I liked the fact that everyone spoke English without the ridiculous accents. But apart from that it's not very essential.
