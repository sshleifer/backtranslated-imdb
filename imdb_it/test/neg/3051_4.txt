One of Stan Laurel's many silent comedies before collaborating with Oliver Hardy, 'Mud and Sand' is a ho-hum hokum. The story is disjointed - although this may be due to modern modification - and the humor itself is not at all inventive. <br /> <br /> Potential plots are started and ignored; for example, Stan's promise to pay Fillet de Sole for what he did to him never comes to fruition. Even the character of Stan does not seem very centered, but this is a common criticism of his work before he developed the fame of "Stanley" of Laurel & Hardy, so it could be that I only expected to see this lack. <br /> <br /> I firmly believe that all silent films should be kept and seen, and I'm glad this is still available. It's not a great movie.
