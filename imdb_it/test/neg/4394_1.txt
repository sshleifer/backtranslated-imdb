When I went to the video rental store to get a movie I saw this and immediately thought it would be fun. The image made it look like a classic kind of comedy involving teenagers (like a road trip) that I thought was worth watching. When I changed my mind I was disappointed that the jokes were horrible and cheap. The only piece the director could have thought would have been fun if someone slipped on the wet floor. This is not a joke and would not make people laugh. Actually, I thought of turning this film off halfway. I was annoyed by this film because it was just a waste of time and money that rented it. Not enough attention has been paid to the making of this film and there is not enough time and work to devote to this film. I have found that acting is also quite bad. The only time I laughed was at the bad "jokes" or actions done that weren't funny at all !!! I consider this a 1/10 film. I hope you found this comment useful.
