It's not a bad concept. I just wish they had taken him in another direction. It's a film that tries to be interesting by shocking you with bestiality to begin with, which works for most people (prudes with a weak stomach). But apart from that there isn't much in this film. It's not funny, it's not romantic, so please someone changes that label, and since I already knew that bestiality is actually more legal and a sector of a million dollars, I wasn't really shocked. But most people don't know it and I thought that the way the movie evolved after the secret came out was disappointing because it could have been one of those shocking eye-opening films to teach the ignorant a fetish which is a reality for (yes, I did my homework) hundreds of thousands of people. So, if you like watching bad movies you can fantasize about how you could make them better while watching them that surely, enjoy doing it.
