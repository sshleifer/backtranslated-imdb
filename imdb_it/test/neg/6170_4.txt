Mickey Rourke chases Diane Lane in Elmore Leonard's Killshot It's not as if Mickey Rourke had really disappeared. He had a constant series of appearances before returning to the scene. It was memorable in: Dominoes, Sin City, Man on Fire, Once Upon a Time in Mexico and Get Carter. But in his powerful dramatic performance in The Wrestler (2008), we see a complete presentation of the only mentioned character in Get Carter. Whenever we know it, Rourke remains a beautiful, but unbalanced, thin ball tied to the muscles. <br /> <br /> This is a story and production of Elmore Leonard. Leonard has written noteworthy films such as the western taunt thriller 3:10 with Yuma, Be Cool, Jackie Brown, Get Shorty, 52 Pick-Up and Joe Kidd. This means that we become tough boys, some good, others less good. <br /> <br /> It also means that we get tight and realistic plots with characters who do what is best for them in every situation, weaving complications into violent conclusions. Killshot is no different. The tough and slim ball killer Rourke chases unhappy witness married Lane. Think that History of Violence meets No Country for Old Men. It's not as intense, bloody or bloody as those two, but it's almost as good. If you like these two, including David Croneberg's wonderful Eastern Promises, you'll also like Killshot. <br /> <br /> Director John Madden has not made many films. His last few were fun, if you can't: Proof, Captain Corelli's Mandolin and Shakespeare in Love. Diana Lane hasn't had a powerful film role since she and Richard Gere gave incredible performances in Unfaithful. Lately he is charming and attractive in romantic stories like Rodanthe Nights, Must Love Dogs and Under the Tuscan Sun. Here she is in the right sign, balancing her sexy charm with a reserved tension. <br /> <br /> This is a small part for Rosario Dawson. Yet Dawson does a good job with it. See much more of Lane, including an intimate scene to rival Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut. <br /> <br /> While you are in the crime drama section, take also Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang and Gone Baby Gone, and Before the Devil knows your dead. The latter has some wonderful performances by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney. <br /> <br /> Killshot is finished at the box office. More is our luck. It is definitely worth a rental of 3-4 dollars if you like this genre. 06/20/2009
