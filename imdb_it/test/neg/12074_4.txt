This film follows the life of a great guitarist, who wants to grow up but acts irresponsibly almost to self-destruction. <br /> <br /> I was expecting the usual witty dialogues, sarcasm and Woody Allen humor, but "Sweet and Lowdown" failed to provide any. The main character, Emmet Ray, is an egocentric, rude, irresponsible and painful man. It's so unlikely, that I don't want it on him now, or that I care about him. I wonder why a film should be made about him. The pace of the story is slow, making the film bored. Even the great acting of Sean Penn fails to bring the film back to a watchable level. <br /> <br /> I really like Woody Allen's movies, but "Sweet and Lowdown" is a big disappointment.
