I just saw this at the cinema. I haven't read the books. There is nothing new in this film. <br /> <br /> the bad guys seem to die with a couple of shots, no matter how many times our hero has been stabbed with a big sword that continues to appear the same (ish)! There are several action scenes but they are very false. the directors seem to have the impression that, whenever they don't bother choreograph a fight scene, they just move the camera up close, move fast and turn up the music ......... This makes me feel once again scolded. <br /> <br /> I admire them for trying to tackle a dark plot without the normal Hollywood cheese, but I'm sorry to say that the filmmakers have failed miserably. The characters are two-dimensional. We hardly know them or feel for them. The protagonist has a charming accent on the part of the peasants ... even if it seems he doesn't have much to say ... <br /> <br /> Don't worry about watching it unless you're bored and you take it for half price from blockbuster ...
