It will really be a blue Christmas if you submit your family to this. I loved the original film and this was not worthy of being its sequel. In reality, in effect, it is not his sequel. Only one character from the original cast returns. Of course, that character was the hilarious cousin Eddie, but it's simply not exhilarating to be the protagonist of a movie. His niche is that of the weird relative who performs bizarre antics - along with Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase was needed in this film to be a success, and it certainly wasn't there. As for me, a movie is not a "Vacation" movie unless good old Clark Griswold is at the helm.
