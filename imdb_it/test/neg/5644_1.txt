The riddle as a concept is an interesting idea, but I'm afraid it's a mixture, if Vinnie is given the role of a hard man it's his element like in Lock Stock and Snatch. In this film, Vinnie plays a newspaper writer (greyhounds to be precise), who during the course of the film is easily beaten up and packed on a balcony by a 10-15 year old man. I'm sorry, Vinnie is a tough tough look and he has to do it so silly. Trying to investigate the double murders of a friend and a drug addict found near the Thames. He takes on the role of a policeman, while the real policemen are a bit of a protagonist, overcoming the flashbacks of Charles Dickens. <br /> <br /> When Vinnie is on the screen his reputation precedes him looks tough but he doesn't in part need to act hard, growling at the camera in some parts. If you look at the Mean Machine, it is perfectly launched, credible and performs very well. <br /> <br /> Going back to the film, what confuses the question a bit is the flashback of Charles Dickens who is narrating a different story with characters that also appear in our days, these two stories seem to be extraneous to each other they are used the same actors. <br /> <br /> The sound of the film, especially from Julie Cox, is sometimes imperceptible, and it's not really what her role in the film is short of interest for Vinnies Love, but starts the film as Detecive, but quickly becomes his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The death of the prostitute is a sort of answer, but still / no answer. Get rid of Charles Dickens' stuff and you could have a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Vinnie, is slowly becoming the British Steven Segal, stick to the role of secondary actor, you're pretty good at it.
