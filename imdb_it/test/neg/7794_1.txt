Do writers who evoke this kind of "comedies" have lives so empty as to embody them in tragic shows like this? <br /> <br /> Because the talented and gorgeous Busy Phillips is in the midst of this garbage is beyond me, I can't stand the Hispanic girl whose accent seems very fake and is so unattractive and annoying as the other girl African American with a shrill voice. <br /> <br /> The jokes are often stupid, the Jewish guy shouts a lot and the show never goes anywhere, an episode in particular with the soldier in search of love was simply terrible. <br /> <br /> I don't think there would be many who work in search of a love office and only one man? Obviously the whole woman is in tight-fitting shirts and lots of makeup to make up for the lack of talent. <br /> <br /> I found Holly amusing in her older shows and I always admired Busy but this show is silent, empty and had nothing to do for it.
