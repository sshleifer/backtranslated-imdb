As for Asian horror, I saw my share of disappointments along with some of the scariest ones you can imagine ... "Acacia" doesn't really qualify for any of these categories. He had some moments of tension and it was interesting to watch, but I couldn't help but think that there should have been a little more in this story. The film is about a childless couple who decides to adopt a child who seems to have a fascination with trees. He develops a bond with the acacia tree in their backyard and seems to communicate with it. Then, during a fight with his mother involving their new baby, he goes wild after threatening to find the dead mother who is now a tree. When he does not return, the parents send a report and wait, while the neighbor girl believes that somehow lives the acacia tree. The pace is quite slow and the ending gets a little weird, but I have to recommend it as a slightly pleasant effort, even if the story seems a bit flat. Hell, I can't really decide on this ...
