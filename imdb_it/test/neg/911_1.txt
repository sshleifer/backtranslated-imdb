Rob Lowe must have eaten the whole budget, but I can't fault him for running with the money. He also should have agreed, there was nothing good about this film. Shooting, editing, directing, dialogues, sets, tricks, scripts, casting (in particular the girl and the child psychiatrist impostor), and the story was only the worst. I've never seen such a horrible film. Pass this for any other rental selection, or find yourself screaming vile comments on the TV. Dead Silent should be silenced forever.
