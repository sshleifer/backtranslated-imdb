This short was the last and only short film by director Del Lord. The problem: it was rather weak and the coffee scene was practically a carbon copy of a short "Busy Buddies" (1944). The interrogation scene was pretty funny, and the beginning of the coffee part. But there are many voids in this short. For example, why do the henchmen hide in the garbage bin when the police arrive? In the remake, "Of Cash And Hash" (1955), the director Jules White fixes it and the reason why the henchmen hide in the garbage can is because there is a firefight between the police and the armored car thieves. The scene in which Moe is having problems with the oyster has already been done with Curly in "Dutiful But Dumb" (1941). The part of the spooky house wasn't all that great except for the hilarious scene outside the ghostly house. Finally, the ending had no sign. Evaluation: C-
