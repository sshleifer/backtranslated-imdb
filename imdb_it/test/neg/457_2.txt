Universal Pictures' poor second feature film about a young girl who carries out criminal investigations for the army, rejecting the progress of the brash young woman who has been given romance. Robert Montgomery directed and starred in this adaptation of the story "Come Be My Love", and his recitations of this era are incredibly lazy. The plot is mushy, predictable, and writer Robert Carson has given all the really funny lines (as usual for the films of this period) to the gritty black maid. It's always nice to see Ann Blyth and Jane Cowl in support, but they can't do much with this hockey material. * from ****
