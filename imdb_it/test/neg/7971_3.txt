First of all I must say that I have read everything about this topic and I know it thoroughly, and I was excited to finally see it. But you only have to read the book on which this miniseries is based to realize that it is not the true story of what really happened almost 90 years ago. It is freely based on facts, the rest is taken from the screenwriter's imagination. And unfortunately these changes are anything but successful and mostly totally useless. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? Vita and Violet did not use the names Mitya and Lushka until their relationship began, and during this Violet also called Vita Dmitri and Julian. It was Viola chasing Vita with a dagger when they were teenagers. The "seduction" scene when their relationship began, Violet was much more passive than depicted here and certainly did not kiss Vita first. I could go on and on, these examples were all included when the series had just begun. In addition to all these alterations from the facts, even the characterizations are all wrong. Sometimes Vita behaves like crazy. Especially the scene in which he saw the announcement of the engagement of the newspaper Violet is simply ridiculous. Vita kept feeling her emotions lift. It was Viola who was capricious and showed her feelings (good or bad). All that Vita did when she read is that she almost fainted, that's all. Being a gentle nature, Harold avoided clashes in real life, but here he is sometimes rather severe and accusing. Harold and Vita have always discussed their intimate things in letters, not words. And Violet ... I know this series has deliberately focused on Vita and Harold, but that doesn't mean that all the other characters have to be just marginal puppets. Here it is totally a one-dimensional character, and the lines that have given it are mostly embarrassing. In reality she was intelligent, gifted, an extraordinary woman who rarely gave the credit she deserves. I always thought he was a much more interesting person than Vita. In this series his unhappiness, loneliness and his problems with his mother are totally ignored. The viewer also has a minimal idea of ​​his background and his family, what kind of relationship (and marriage) he had with Denys Trefusis or how hard he fought on Vita. Life was the only love of his life, his reason for being, and if Harold had suffered during the relationship, so did Violet. After his life was in ruins, and it took some time for her to recover. Statue could have played the role of Denys, that depth of his character. Lady Sackville-West is just a badly drawn caricature; an annoying chatterbox with an exaggerated French accent. <br /> <br /> The series concludes with Amiens' totally ill-written scene, and this was the end of this affair, according to the screenwriter. No, he continued a whole year later, and the ending was much more persistent and sad than what was presented here. But what does the stupid ending matter if the whole series was stupid from the start. I have to give some credit to the actors, they tried to get the best out of those roles given to them, even if Janet McTeer saw that Vita is the only one that can really shine. Not one can complain about the settings. All complaints go to the director and above all, screenwriter. Instead of in-depth character studies, there are too many sex scenes and bland conversations. Many scenes are too long, some are useless and bring nothing to the plot. On the other hand, many details are abbreviated or omitted altogether. Above all, there had to be more information about the youth of Vita and Violet and how their friendship developed. This is a fascinating story that would have deserved a better adaptation. Maybe one day someone will do it. At the moment we can do much more than this story by reading the real book or the letters of Violet to Vita, which are brilliant things.
