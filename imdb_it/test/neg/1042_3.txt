Rented this by mistake thinking it was another movie with the same title, and realizing that I had rented it some time before. <br /> <br /> Rapid plot line. A couple made up of an artist and a photographer rent a studio apartment in Los Angeles from Joe Estevez, continuing to curse the fact that his brother Martin Sheen could actually act! They find a bed in a forgotten room, but the bed is infested with an ugly 1930s serial killer and his latest victim. Their ghosts inhabit the couple, improving their sex life first, but eventually they become more threatening. <br /> <br /> What ensues is low-cost R-rated sex scenes, cheaper emotions and a kind of waste of time.
