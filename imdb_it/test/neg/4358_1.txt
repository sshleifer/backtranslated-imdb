I really hope the producers of these "films" read these reviews so they know that people don't just want their movies. I'm just rubbish and embarrassed about the horror clown killer genre. whether it was better or not than the first does not matter because they are both simply terrible. I'm surprised they didn't learn their lesson from the first movie. Stop now !! Beware of horror movie watchers, DON'T LOOK, RENT OR WATCH HORROR "URBAN" FILM BOXES, AND ESPECIALLY, DON'T BUY THEM !!!!
