Recently I saw for the first time the autobiographical film by Ed Wood Jr., Glen or Glenda, after hearing about it for so many years. Nothing I had read or heard about this film could have prepared me for what I saw. This must be the most bizarre film ever made. Exhausted buffaloes, women in slavery, Satan who wanders around and Bela Lugosi, wanders only as he can, "Drink, Drink ... pull the rope, pull the rope ...", he was completely mad. The acting was atrocious and the dialogue was unintentionally exhilarating, exactly what one would expect from an Ed Wood movie. Having said all this, as horrible as this film was, I have to give Wood a credit ... it was way ahead of his time. You must remember that when this film was made transvestites were not even discussed in public, nor the subject for a film. I read that Wood was a transvestite in real life, and I'm sure this film was based on his experiences. It was sad to see Bela Lugosi having to say the ridiculous phrases he had to say for this film, but it was kind of Ed Wood Jr. at least giving Mr. Lugosi an actor's job at a time in Bela's life when he was penniless and addicted and no more in Hollywood would take it. If you've never seen this movie, you have to see it, especially if you're a fan of Ed Wood Jr.
