No matter what you heard, "Fame" is not a good movie. It is not worth investing more than two hours to watch stereotypical teenagers who dance, sing, study and watch girls in the locker room. <br /> <br /> Every clich√© finds a small cozy home in this film. There is a gay teenager looking for acceptance. It would have been great if it had been treated as something more than a secondary plot point. There is a ghetto guy who has too much aptitude-- what, I was surprised? And guess what? Everyone wants to be a big star, find fame and fortune, and they would all be willing to crawl on the smoking corpses of their mothers to get it. <br /> <br /> Strangely, this film is remembered for its music. But in reality, the only moderately good song is "Hot Lunch Jam", which is still too poor to be of any real quality. The two most popular songs are nothing, either. "Fame" is an insignificant thing stifled by the pure spectacle of a massive street dance scene. And "I Sing the Body Electric" (what in the name of Bubba also means?!?!?!?!?) Is just an incomprehensible joke. <br /> <br /> Bad effect, insipid dialogue and hacker direction (after all, is the director of "Evita") are only marginally aided by the appropriately ordinary work of Michael Seresin. But cinematography alone cannot bring a movie, especially one as uninteresting and useless as this.
