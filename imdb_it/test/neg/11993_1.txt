I was a "chosen" to see this movie in preview. <br /> <br /> first you should know that this movie is based on the video game "Far Cry", a really delicious game (2004)). secondly you should know that the director of this film is the great Uwe stamp. this is a man who takes video games (dungeon siege, bloodrayne, postal, etc.) and makes films (VERY horrible ...). <br /> <br /> I still remember when I saw boll "the swords of the king: a siege tail of the underground". there have been such horrible mistakes in this movie (like 3 scenes playing at the same time, 2 a day, and somehow somehow at night .....) <br /> <br /> so let's cry " ". if you expect fresh action, forget it. really cheap tricks and a plastic helicopter are far from real action. if you expect an interesting story, forget it. geared by the not-so-bad story of the game, this film is a laugh. the acting of the actors makes the film very funny, but in a bad way. <br /> <br /> I had the chance to watch this movie for free. so don't make the mistake and pay for this junk. is one of my favorite films for the 100 fund !!!!
