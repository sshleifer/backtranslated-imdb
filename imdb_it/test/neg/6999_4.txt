Dare Rudd (John Wayne) and partner Dink Hooley (Syd Saylor) are itinerant cowboys who can't stay in a very long place. In "Helltown", the boys are headed to Montana, where they meet with Rudd Tom Fillmore's cousin (Johnny Mack Brown), who offers them a job. It's a real treat to see the boys wearing aprons as they start cooking with the herd, even though Dare becomes conscious when Miss Judith (Marsha Hunt) arrives at the camp. Judy is Tom's girlfriend, but the attraction between her and Dare is evident from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Fillmore has a herd of cattle to move, and promotes giving to drive the unit, partly to prove to Judy that it may not be up to the task. Meanwhile, the bad Bart Hammond (Mount Blue) has his eyes focused on Fillmore's cattle, but when his henchmen can't rustle the pack, he thinks it's easier to win the money that Dare was paid at the end of the course. Conning Give in a card game rigged with his man Brady (James Craig), Dare's money starts to evaporate hand after hand. It's only when Dare doesn't show up at the Fillmore ranch that Tom goes out to find his cousin. By exposing the cheats, Tom, Dare and Dink line up before the villains can take revenge. <br /> <br /> "Helltown", also known as "Born to the West", was published in 1937 by Favorite Films Corporation, a couple of years after Wayne's western series for Lone Star Productions. Only modifies the Lone Star formula only slightly; Wayne takes the girl at the end of the film, but he was trying here. There is a great escape scene where Wayne saves Marsha Hunt, where Johnny Mack Brown's horse does a complete somersault. Syd Saylor does a good job as a friend of the comics, doing his best to sell lightning rods to unsuspecting victims. Replaces the familiar faces of George "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt here, highlights of the Lone Star films. John Wayne's charisma is starting to develop here, preparing him for the super-star state jump that he eventually achieved. <br /> <br /> "Helltown" was based on a novel by the legendary western author Zane Gray. If you're looking for more films based on the stories of Gray, try "Fighting Caravans" with Gary Cooper, "The Light of Western Stars" with Victor Jory, "Drift Fence" with Buster Crabbe and "Heritage of the Desert" with Randolph Scott.
