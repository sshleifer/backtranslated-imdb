<br /> <br /> This film is incredibly fun to make any man cry, the clich√© is put on more than 5 years of peanut butter and in a way that sucks the humor out of your heart, every single joke was badly timed and would not have been fun if it had expired properly. <br /> <br /> Not seeing this movie, there is a real possibility that you will never be able to enjoy comedies again ... ever.
