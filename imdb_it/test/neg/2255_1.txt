This usually sounds much better in my head (so forgive me for wandering) I'm certainly not the biggest fan of Tarantino (and I'll try * not to bend down to call him "hack" .... which is pretty hard) I don't like it tease or criticize a movie before seeing it. So, with cautious hesitation, today I went to the cinema to watch "Bastardi senza gloria" <br /> <br /> Now, calling it a "rip-off cheat" would be unfair here. Tarantino is happy enough to take the title from Enzo Castellari's clone of Dirty Dozen (less than spectacular), but not the points of the plot (which he takes from all other genres of films) "Inglorious" opens with a Nazi officer and his long interrogation against a farmer who hides the Jews in his basement. This is an anti-climax, as the dialogue is stale and the result is reported a mile away. Of course, one of the hidden Jews makes her escape (but later). We (the public, of course, with pleasure) are treated to the introduction of Lieutenant Aldo Raine (ha-ha, that name sounds almost like B-movie king ALDO RAY .... ha-ha Quentin ... keep on coming these " tributes "and this character is played by none other than Brad (DALLAS) Pitt (sorry, DALLAS was the only good thing I have ever played in) and with a cracked mouth, Mr. Jolie treats us of a nosy killer with a frowning nose with a nimble nose, meanwhile Mr. Tarantino forgets that real adults might be present, so he assumes that the teenagers have not heard of the "dirty dozen"? <br /> <br /> Raines' platoon is composed of (John Cassavettes in search of bloodthirsty Jewish soldiers, all looking for a big revenge on Adolf Hitler Tarantino in all his superior knowledge, pays particular attention to two of these men, throwing his longtime best friend (and murderous companion -sicofante) Eli Ro th (like the baseball bat wielding 'Jewish bear') The other man's name is Hugo Stiglitz (and I bet more than half of the QT fans have never heard this name before this film) Keep it up, Tarantino, you have managed about 6 or 7 "hommages" so far (in the first 15 minutes) continue to add them, and could diminish the plot (or lack of?) <br /> <br /> In any case, cutting a long (and extremely boring and long protracted) story, both Raine and his men (the Glorious Bastards) and the only survivor of the first chapter, both have separate plots to kill Hitler at the screening of a Nazi propaganda film, in a French cinema (owned by the survivor, now grown up) <br /> <br /> Other boring (and useless) conversations follow two or four, while Pitt scolds the audience after treating it. And every genuine suspense, which leads to the murder of the deadliest tyrant of all time, is thrown away by the directors' insistence on putting a 1980s David Bowie song into a WWII movie. <br /> <br /> My problems (and there are many) with this film, is the problem that occurs again with most Tarantino products ..... rarely know when to start or stop. I don't need "tribute" after "tribute" to get the * joke * (whatever it is) I met Bastardi senza gloria, Enzo Castellari, Aldo Ray, Hugo Stiglitz (and the last crime of the entire film) by Ennio Morricone score compelling by REVOLVER. I go to the cinema to see the stars ... if the best you can do is the terrible Barad Pitt, I assume that you (Mr Tarantino) are the main attraction here? I don't want the audience to direct the film. I pay to see YOUR vision, your ideas, your creativity ... NOT how you can reconcile (over and over) endless scenes from endless movies. The time has come for the fan-boys (on IMDb) to have a bit of "hard love" on your 'idol' (god knows, if you don't ... the studios should?) <br /> <br /> old discussion with the faithful of Tarantino is "well, if you can do better ... do it". Let me tell you, if I were a 46-year-old director with the (unfortunate) QT roll ..... I want to offer you much more than a heated hash-re of the best WWII movies of this tripe. The directors he tries to emulate, have made the films so ugly by mistake or because of budget constraints. It is a policeman going out, from time to time, to hear his fans challenge his lack of imagination as "art". I'm sure he is able to improve (but after giving him the benefit of the doubt, again ... and not to mention 2 hours and half of my life .....) maybe he isn't?
