Uhhh ... so, did they even have writers for this? Maybe I'm fussy, but I like a bit of dialogue with my films. And, as far as slasher films are concerned, a fragment of character development will suffice. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, The Prey does not provide either? And if you think I am hyperbolic, you will only have to look at it yourself Scene by scene, we only have actors standing looking desperate and awkward, abandoned by the meaning of the script. Outside of calling the names of others when they are separated in the woods (natch), the only cases where these people say something substantial is when a character explains the constellation of Orion (clearly plagiarized by Funk & Wagnalls; and another it chimes an old field story that has nothing to do with the plot (wait, what's the plot?) other times, The Prey really has the courage to film its characters with the boom microphone far enough so that we can't "To hear exactly what they are saying. So we get whole scenes in which the actors are muttering! Deliberately! Seriously, I saw more dialogues in a silent film. It is as if the directors sat in a bar somewhere in Rancho Cucamonga in the period d Gold of the 80's slasher craze and one looked at the other and said, "Hey, I really have a good idea for a beheading gag. whole feature around it." And ... well, they did.<br /> <br /> To be honest, The Prey probably had some sort of writer on board. I mean, someone had to write down the sequence of the scene and label the newspapers. However, I am fully convinced that this film did not have an editor of any kind. There are dazzling pauses, boring tableaux and zero feelings of rhythm. The filmmakers have nothing else in the "screenplay" to be filmed, so they fill the playing time with exhaustive taxonomies of the flora and fauna that populate the forest in which our crazy and savage boys are cut and cut into cubes. These creatures are all filmed in a simple way, at noon, in a completely private way and without any attempt at atmospheric photography. If it looks like a science film, it's because it is. I'm pretty sure this is a whole series of nature footage. All that is missing is a suffocating narrative from some councilor of the National Geographic. <br /> <br /> Most exciting film that was kindly spared by the cutting plan: a scene in which two men discuss cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches and another scene in which a supporting character runs off on a banjo for what seems like a full minute and a half! A minute and a half! It's a lot of banjoing to engage in celluloid to begin with, let alone put it in the final cut of the movie! Way to go, guys! Brevity and conciseness are the real victims of this massacre. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film takes some steam (comparatively) in the last 25 minutes, in which most of the carnage is condensed and where the music of "Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta" by Béla Bartók has been cut. Vaudeville's great Jackie Coogan looks as funny as a tubby, bumbly park ranger (this was his last role, if you believe it). And there are some gory moments, including a tear in the collar and the aforementioned beheading. Even the makeup used for the killer (Carel Struycken, aka "Lurch" from the Addams family films) is quite effective and makes it look like a strange hybrid between the young Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. Also, if you like crazy and direct endings, you have to check how they wrap this puppy. I'll make you a spit, I promise. <br /> <br /> Usually, I love movies that are on this level of ineptitude, but the first three quarters of The Prey are so interminably boring that they are more or less ruining the rest. Overall, this is a largely pale and boring affair, and, although it is not entirely negative, it should only be seen by prominent slasher filmmakers. Why do we do it ourselves, anyway?
