Finally, I can link the points between Return of the Jedi and Phantom Menace. Here we see where Lucas has lost touch with what made the original Star Wars films great and started to go down in the plot less tripe that ruined episodes 1-3. This movie looks more like one of those contemptuous 1980s swordsmen and witch movies than anything worthy of being associated with the Star Wars saga. As for the Jar-Jar character, this seems to be aimed at children (and the toy market). The battle scenes are particularly bad. It was depressing to see Sian Phillips' incredible talent go broke after his classic performance in I, Claudius.
