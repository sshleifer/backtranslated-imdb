I'm usually a fan of "art" and "foreign" films, but when I saw this, my reaction was "it must be called experimental because it doesn't make sense". "Action" is static, while at the same time it bounces from one position to another. There are not enough titles to clarify who is who and what their relationships are. Apparently the main point was to show that in the face of murder, adultery and generally strange and dissolute behavior, the care offered by the powers is to banish a totally innocent black man.
