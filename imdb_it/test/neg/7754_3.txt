This story of Ted Brice, an American pilot who is the only survivor of the collapse of a reconnaissance aircraft allied in Belgium in January 1944, is practically a disaster. The title would lead you to think that it is mainly a story about armed groups of the Belgian resistance, but it seems to be just a background to support a silly love story between Ted and Claire, the woman who takes Ted. Claire's husband Henri is a committed member of the resistance, but it is Claire who decides, in Henri's absence and against his wishes, to give Ted shelter. <br /> <br /> The details of the crucial plot make no sense. The central point of the plot is the recovery of the recorder on the demolished floor that contains the navigation codes and the positions of the objectives. But in the opening scene we see that the Belgians sack the plane, members of the resistance between them. Why didn't they recover valuables at that time instead of waiting for the Nazis to come watch over the plane? And the whole business of transferring Ted out of the area was conducted using secret instructions and code words when the transaction could have been just a simple exchange. The ponderous music tries, but fails, to give a little weight to this lukewarm undertaking. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous part of the film is how the love story between Ted and Claire develops. At first Claire devoted herself to Ted nursing care from the moment she died and, when Ted starts to recover, they become physically involved (while Henri is conveniently away to conduct resistance affairs). Julie Ormond does an acceptable job like Claire, but has a French accent that I often find impossible to understand. Her answers sometimes seemed a little weak - when she is informed of the pending deaths of several members of the city, she reacts as if she had just been told that the local grocery store was without peaches. Like Ted, Bill Paxton seems to be playing his lines; his performance is so uninspired that it is embarrassing. A true American pilot could demonstrate such a flat personality, but it is not a convincing cinema. I did not perceive any chemistry between these alleged lovers. <br /> <br /> The most idiotic thing is the way Ted and Claire behave like lovers on vacation. Perhaps sexual liberation from such heavy situations is understandable, but to seem completely unaware of the gravity of the situation is difficult to understand. At first Ted is delivered in an attic and Claire worries about her entering the house. But as things develop, not only does he enter the house, he dances with Claire with loud music, he enters the adjacent barn to play baseball with a local boy and eventually travels by car with Claire to a nearby city . br /> <br /> The boy seems to be very busy with his role, but he was put at risk by the script. He has an extraordinary ability to be in crucial events without being noticed. And when it provides lines like: <br /> <br /> "Have you ever seen anyone hanged, they seem to be dancing, but can't find the word". <br /> <br /> feel that the writer is talking and not a boy of thirteen. <br /> <br /> And by the way, there are scenes to show that the Nazis are pretty bad boys. <br /> <br /> Comparing this film with the brilliant "Ashes and Diamonds" on the Polish resistance, or with the equally amazing "Lacombe, Lucien" on the French resistance, one realizes what is really sad.
