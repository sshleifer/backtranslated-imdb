Give me a break. How can you say that this is a "good hockey movie"? I know that movies tend to do quite a bit of hard work to portray hockey to the general public. And yes, this was made back when the United States did not embrace our sport to the extent that it is today, but really. I played hockey all my life and watched even more, and this friend of mine is madness. The ice scenes were amazingly bizarre ... the particular example I'm referring to is "sword fighting", I mean "stick fighting" at the end of the movie ... during which everyone is standing around and looking, not with fascination, that this is really happening, but amazed by who will win the duel between Youngblood and his nemesis Rakkie. Yes, the ice story is a little better, I emphasize LITTLE. <br /> <br /> I don't know, maybe it makes no sense to go on ... I mean, let's face it: the film is right. Hockey is just a big battle on the ice ... oh yes, with a small piece of vulcanized rubber that bounces from time to time in what is generically called an "objective". Youngblood is horrible or hysterical, I can't figure out which ... maybe someone else will have better luck.
