The only good of the Problem Child films was to bring together Amy Yasbeck and the late John Ritter. Apart from that, the gestures are as demonic as their hero. In this fundamentally useless sequel, Ben (Ritter) just separated and his little Hellraiser Junior (Michael Oliver, who never needs screen-time again) move to a new city infested with licentious bachelorette parties. In the end he chooses Lawanda (played by Laraine Newman, the most abused SNL-er original), whose Blanche DuBois tendencies do not suit Junior in any way. To add to the torture of Junior, it seems that this city already has some fire in the younger girl with Trixie, who coincidentally has a sweet single mother played by Yasbeck, the same actress who played the first horrible mother-adoption of Junior. You can see where the plot comes from. Searching for my favorite scene is like pulling teeth, so I suppose I will go with the "cherry bomb in the toilet" gag that makes Back to the Future's James Tolkan one of the many victims grown (that boy always plays the school authority figures) . Jack Warden and Gilbert Gottfried return as parts from the first film, but unfortunately there is no Bow-tie Klansman appearance, I mean Killer (Michael Richards) who made the Problem Child even more fun. Honestly, I'm sure these films, whether the abusive parents saw them or not, have done wonders for red-headed American children. We also thank these proud American films for their formidable promotion of adoption. Oh, and poop dog poop - I have to do dog poo jokes .... Shmucks.
