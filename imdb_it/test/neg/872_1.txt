We thought it was one of the worst movies ever. I had to volunteer to see the end. The love story was not credible; the characters were not developed; the love story has almost no meaning; it was a mixture; and the view was absolutely stupid because it was or (my opinion) how the ADAMS FAMILY GOES ON HOLIDAY ... just creepy, gypsy and cheese; and the OUTERBANKS does not seem typically like those surf houses; and who would spend the night in one during a hurricane if it were not theirs. Furthermore..it was not realistic. hurricanes give you plenty of warning to close the hatches. <br /> <br /> Even the friend was superfluous; and did not correspond to history What has civil war with the saviors to do? I must also mention the wardrobe ... Q. Did Lane have to have a scarf / pashmina / shawl in every scene? It was exaggerated. He seemed good enough not to have to hide things; without making them as obvious as light pants. <br /> <br /> Finally I'm worried about the impact on our landfills when everyone has to dispose of this stupid, and I mean STUPID movie !!!! Don't fall for the hype on this !!!!!! We did. Not even watchable.
