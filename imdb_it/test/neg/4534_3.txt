This film has had some funny moments. Louie, the main character was well played along with other decent supporting characters. The film's opening film set the tone, but the direction and the story went down from there. Apart from a turning point in the end (interesting and fun too), I wish this film had a better direction and a more developed story. Without giving anything away to the plot, the idea is better! I just hope it was done better in this short film. The potential was there but did not deliver the goods.
