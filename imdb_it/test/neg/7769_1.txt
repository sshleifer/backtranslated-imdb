I really despair for the woman when she discusses this line of a program as if it were intellectually engaging and promotes women's liberation and independence. This show is the biggest insult to women next to all those libidinous hip-hop videos. If talking like a group of daring kids over $ 100 lunches at snobbish restaurants, indiscriminately shopping for unnecessary fashion and jumping into bed with the nearest male at the site is considered power, the fate of Western women can be condemned as we speak. > <br /> Apart from the damage it inflicts on the female gender, Sex and the City IS NOT FUN. Not once was it fun, engaging, exciting or original. The episodes take place in a monotonous way. Each character is a factory-produced mannequin that behaves in the same way in each episode. Not once have none of these superficial and unattractive women evolved. Perhaps the worst is the main character Carrie Bradshaw. Regardless of the horrible aspect, his predilection for excessive analysis of relationships is worthwhile. In addition to all this, the show portrays men as a group of empty-headed deceives who are unable to engage in healthy relationships. Even when there is a decent man, he is somehow depicted as a villain. The absolute lack of empathy for men is clearly the work of some pseudo "progressive" feminist. <br /> <br /> The saddest part of the whole show is that these women live miserable miserable lives. Any intelligent woman will never envy them. It's a trivial show with even more banal characters. The New York Tourist Committee must hate the way this trash is showing their otherwise beautiful city! Fortunately this shipwreck is over! Desperate Housewives is considered a suitable replacement for SATC. While DH can be quite unbelievable, at least it explores women in more multifaceted ways. It also treats men more respectfully and is actually fun!
