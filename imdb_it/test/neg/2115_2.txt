Will Spanner (David Byrnes, the fifth actor who plays the role in the series) runs into another bizarre case, this time involving vampires rather than the usual witches, warlocks and demons (he's in the hospital checking out his friend's son he hurt himself in a hit and run when they turn a girl who was attacked by a vampire). He introduces Detectve Lutz to help with the case that revolves around a clandestine vampire organization that seeks to achieve a business merger to enable them to legally own all the blood banks in the world or some nonsense. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film takes on a secondary role in the nude and simulated sex scenes. (As can be expected from this series, I think). We suspect that complaining about the lack of good acting or a convincing plot, or even convincing characters, would fall on deaf ears. If you're watching this movie, you don't mind these "frivolities" and you just want a little "action". Unfortunately, the film also fails on that front. All women are quite attractive but the way the scenes are shot are simply atrocious. Making this more or less an exercise in futility in every way imaginable. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Both Kimberly Blair and April Breneman show everything; Ashlie Rhey shows full-frontal; Aline Kassman and Mai-Lis Holmes only show their breasts <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
