This is the epitome of the bad film production of the 80s, unless you are a pre-pubescent girl. Riding a big name like madonna, a plot that physically assails the intelligence and humor best suited to a nursery school. If there is any doubt, I think this film of a movie clearly shows the absolute lack of acting talent of Madonna and made me feel very embarrassed for her. The only thing I can't believe is that they ever left the director close to another movie. Madonna spends most of the film getting agitated like a childish doll and talking like a child. It is painfully obvious that the only reason this film was ever made is due to the fact that Madonna was a great name in pop music at the time. DO NOT HAVE TO SEEK THIS ATTEMPT ATTEMPT TO CONTAIN IN POP STARDOM. Stay away at all costs!
