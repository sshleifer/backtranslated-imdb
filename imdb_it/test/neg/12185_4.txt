This was the penultimate film appearance of Jill Ireland, who died of cancer in 1990 after four decades as a famous actress and producer. Ireland made waves of press when she left her husband David McCallum in 1967, beginning her long relationship with Charles Bronson. It is a great irony that Bronson, probably the all-time leader in the number of deaths made on the screen, has had one of the most enduring marriages in film history. <br /> <br /> "Assassination" seems to be a movie this was included in Cannon's production program for the good of Bronson and Ireland. Ireland was already suffering from cancer-related diseases in 1987 and you can almost imagine the two actors who want to do "just one, for the old days". 'Assassination' is carelessly done as a whole, showing the lack of shine and diminishing funds that would have set Cannon on fire by 1990. But there is a sort of nostalgia value in seeing the couple together one last time and the movie it makes you wonder what exactly helps a relationship to survive in the chaos that is Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Bronson plays Jay Killian, a high-ranking secret service agent who is assigned to protect the First Lady, Lara Craig (Ireland). The President's wife has a reputation for being a tough and prominent service agent and wanting to do things her way. Everything changes, however, when attempts are made on her life and she has to travel with Killian by car, train, motorcycle, and believe it or not, dune buggy to escape potential killers. There is little surprise here, since Killian believes that the killers are part of an internal work, perhaps organized by the President himself. On the road, Killian and Mrs. Craig develop sincere affection for one another in scenes between Bronson and Ireland that are actually very funny. <br /> <br /> What it really gives me is how this film was promoted to its release and how it's still made to look like a DVD. The original trailer gives you the feeling that "Assassination" is another bronson shooter. But a lot of this film - which was rated PG-13, by the way - is in a comic vein, putting it along the lines of a romantic thriller like Bronson and the Irish western "From Noon Till Three". The case of the DVD also shows Bronson with a rocket launcher, ready to blow things up. Which he does, but to a lesser extent than his other Potboilers of the 80s. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Assassination" is late with Cannon's work and doesn't really know what kind of film he wants to be. Besides going from the shareholder to the romantic thriller and vice versa, there are serious errors in continuity, property values ​​are cheap inexpensive, and the effects are terrible; many of the explosions look like a dull job rather than being done on the spot. Robert Ragland, who had shown good compositional skills in previous films, joined Valentine McCallum in a score that is mostly synthesized and best suited for television. <br /> <br /> The screenplay by Richard Sale has a real dialogue, with the conversations between Bronson and Ireland the only bright spot. There is no explanation as to why the First Lady is called 'One Momma' suddenly, nor why Ireland remained with her British accent when the character is a native of Wyoming. Jan Gan Boyd, who plays Killian's principal assistant, has a cat personality and is discontented as a federal agent. Stephen Elliott (former Tony Award nominee who died in May 2005), Randy Brooks, Erik Stern (as murderer Bracken) and Michael Ansara (Senator Bunsen) are acceptable in their supporting roles. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, this was the last film that directed the concert for Peter Hunt, which came on the scene with "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" in 1969 and collaborated with Bronson and Lee Marvin in "Death Hunt" in 1981. "Assassination" is available on DVD through MGM Home Entertainment; is presented in dual widescreen format and standard with subtitles in three languages ​​and theatrical trailer. <br /> <br /> ** out of 4
