Demi and Woody are married, but they are poor. They meet Robert Redford, and it is REALLY rich. He has fun with Demi, and since he is a gambler, he makes the couple an "indecent proposal:" a million dollars for a night with the little woman. <br /> <br /> At this point you don't need to watch a movie anymore because you can put together the details in your sleep. Obviously Demi will accept the offer. If it does not, there is no first half of the film. Obviously it will influence the marriage of Demi and Woody. If not, there is no second half of the film. And of course everything will go by the time the credits arrive. Otherwise, there is no happy ending for the taste of the box office. <br /> <br /> The best thing that can be said about INDECENT PROPOSAL is that Demi Moore is well with a black dress. For the rest ... The script is incompetent, the amateur direction, negligible performances. I suspect Redford, Moore and Harrelson blush and change the subject whenever the film is mentioned. Do them - and above all yourself - a favor. Unless someone offers you a million ... Miss It! <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
