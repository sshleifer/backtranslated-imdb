A previous IMDb reviewer stated that "Rafter Romance" is a "rip-off" (it is the term of the other reviewer) of a German musical called "Me By Day, You By Night". Apparently that reviewer does not know that * both * these films have borrowed their premise from 'Box and Cox', an English comedy written by John Maddison Morton in 1847. This comedy treats two traders who rent the same room from a mistress without scruples, every man believing he is the only tenant. Since the two men have different working hours, the stratagem is not immediately discovered. At one time this game was so popular in Britain that "Box and Cox it" became a common term for an agreement in which two people willingly shared accommodations for one person. <br /> <br /> The innovation of "Rafter Romance" '(and its predecessor) is that the two tenants are now a man and a woman, who inevitably develop a love story. As usual in these cornball movies, the boy and girl hate each other until they fall into each other's arms. Hoo boy. <br /> <br /> The owner of this film is played by George Sidney, a character actor who specializes in playing Jewish stereotypes that had to be comprehensive. George Sidney has never been as annoying as the hateful Harry Green (the Jewish equivalent of Stepin Fetchit) but the depictions of Sidney's Jewish characters are still exaggerated and embarrassing to watch. <br /> <br /> The most remarkable thing about "Rafter Romance" 'this is, as far as I know, this is the first Hollywood movie to refer to Hitler and the rise of Nazism. At one point in this film, the landlord Eckbaum (Sidney) discovers his teenage son, Giulio, engaged in swastikas marked on the walls. Eckbaum and his son are clearly destined to be Jews. Of course, no one in Hollywood in 1933 had a real idea of ​​what Hitler was planning for Jews in Europe ... however, it is surprising to see a film that describes a Jewish teenager who thinks swastikas are a joke. His father is, quite correctly, irritated by this exhibition of the Nazi symbol. <br /> <br /> A very shameful aspect of Hollywood history is the documented fact that all major Hollywood studios continued to do business with the Third Reich until 1939. The main Hollywood women were clinically documented as "Ariane "so that their films could be distributed in Nazi Germany and Austria. For the same reason, Hollywood's leading men have been documented as "Aryans and uncircumcised". With the exception of Darryl Zanuck at Twentieth Century-Fox, all the Hollywood studio managers who were part of this policy were Jews ... but clearly they had no objection to doing business with Hitler. I'm surprised that "Rafter Romance" contains a scene that portrays the swastikas in an unfavorable way, as this sequence would have made the film Verboten in Germany and Austria. (Maybe the scene was cut for the German release: it's not crucial for the film's plot.) Apart from that, the film contains nothing remarkable. Robert Benchley makes his usual confused characterization dazed: I never understood the charm of this man. I will evaluate "Rafter Romance" 4 out of 10.
