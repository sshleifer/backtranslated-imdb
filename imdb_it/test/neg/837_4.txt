The film begins with a dandy shooter, in which three bandits are quickly killed by a bounty hunter - a bounty hunter who brings more than a superficial to the nameless man in the Clint Eastwood trilogy (DOLLAR FISTULAR, FOR SOME DOLLARS MORE and THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE BRUTY). <br /> <br /> Soon after, see this man in a gold train full of Union soldiers. Naturally, the expedition is attacked and all the soldiers fight like blinds, so they are quickly neutralized. However, at a turning point, one of the bandits cheats the band leader (Gilbert Roland) and rides with gold. Soon, Roland reaches and is about to find out where the gold is hidden. But, at that very moment, the army stands up and kills the traitor .... worse. However, the unnamed man wannabe thinks Roland knows about the treasure and maybe a medallion given to Roland by the traitor holds the key. A strange banker is also thrown into the mix. All three want gold and all three look pretty macho. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is not a particularly distinguished western. Much of the plot is the plot, in part George Hilton (a Uruguayan, despite the American name) is not as interesting as Eastwood or some of the early Spaghetti Western stars, but most is due to the fact that the soundtrack simply sucks . So often the music doesn't even come close to the correspondence with the acting and seems to be added almost by chance. Besides, it's not very good stuff. This is clearly not the work of Ennio Morricone - musical master of the Spaghetti genre. <br /> <br /> Overall, only a passer-by of the time - and not particularly suitable for booting.
