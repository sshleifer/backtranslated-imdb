This film was horrible, it was like looking at a gay porn waiting for the girls, but they don't come .... I waited almost 2 hours for the damn scarecrows ... they don't come just .. "Instead it's just a idiot who runs around a dead cornfield with a camera, it's a mix of Blaire witches and some nasty twilight episode, and the best part is that since October 23rd 2005 they started shooting a sequel please don't be fooled by the box even if it looks exactly the same as the first dark harvest that is not the lion gate bought the rights on the Maize: the film and had the brilliant idea of ​​publishing it as a sequel to the original dark harvest, which I thought was fun. ....... the only thing they had in common were both filmed in a wheat field .... WILLLLLL movie doesn't scare you the crop like the first, so stay away !!!!!
