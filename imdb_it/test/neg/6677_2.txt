After having consumed "Human Pork Chop" and digested it correctly, I felt encouraged and obliged to inform potential spectators that chewing this product IS NOT FUN and its substance is LOW nutritional value. <br /> <br /> According to the boring nature of this film, the following will be a WARNING more than a REVIEW. This is the first time I want to have an "I-don't-to-rate-this-movie" button on IMDB, because the only reaction to this boring piece of TRASH is stasis and indifference. Every possible vote would do injustice to all the other articles listed here, a "10" is still out of the question, "1" could convince some readers, that this is one of those cases in which "it is so serious that it is really REALLY bad and it's kewl! ", and" 5 "is unsatisfactory, people might think, that's an OK movie and it's okay if you want to have some cheesy fun, which isn't ... Honest with God, it's neither a "10", a zero or a 5, is nothing, a black hole, A FUTILE WORK CONCEIVED BY AN EMBRYO. I bought the DVD of region 3, which was cheap (at least $ 7 !!!) and of good photographic quality, I bought it especially for the positive and promising reviews published under my voice. Oh boy, I had to be disappointed. This film is neither shocking nor disgusting nor unnerving nor ... not even ridiculous, it doesn't take itself too seriously to be mocked, but still serious enough not to be comic. A truly dishonored, amateur effort. The only sequence I found VERY GREETING is when two giggling thugs put a bad dog in a bag and hit it against a brick wall ... but even such a cruel premise leads to a bad execution. The further down mentioned TOILET SCENE is unrealistic and limpid without any sense of suspense, suffering or humiliation - the feces look like paintings of marsh !!! There is a butcher scene at the end of thirty-five minutes in which three men dressed in plastic raincoats (a configuration that is also found on the cover of the DVD) begin to dispose of the female body. It reminded me of "American Psycho" and "Shallow Grave", now it's worth watching these fantastic and true masterpieces. <br /> <br /> We are once REALISTIC and do not rush to create a myth from every aspiring ghost movie, as it seems to happen lately ... <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an oriental horror, try Danny Lee's masterpiece of the same title (English) "Ba Xian fan dian zhi ren rou cha shao bao" (Human Pork Chop) is from 1992 and, not without reason, I might add, has been compared to "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer ". There is also a similar film that tells the same story of a different film crew called "Ren tou dou fu shang" ("There is a secret in my soup") of the same year, a sort of rival production. It is available as a region 3 DVD and, for the most part, is considered superior to "Peng shi zhi sang jin tian liang". I could add a few more words about special effects ... what special effects?!? ... there are some limbs cut, they look horrible - in the wrong sense - probably "Made in Hong Kong". <Br /> <br /> It is all the information I can share on this topic, hopefully it will be useful ... ENJOY YOUR MEAL!
