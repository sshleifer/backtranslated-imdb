I can't think of a single point in this film. The story is absolutely terrible. The acting is as sharp as a carrot, and the script is so bad that you want to kill yourself. Ok, if you love (and you must love it to understand) you will like the snowboard microscopically better, since it has big mountains and interesting moves, but other than that it's terrible. He has some absolutely stupid ideas and is racist with both whites and whites who insult each other. The only time you laugh is when you laugh at stupidity or feel embarrassed about the movie. I've seen a lot of movies and I have to say this is the worst movie I've ever seen. If you have this movie I would suggest you take it back where you bought it and get your money back.
