This show is fantastic and we had a lot of fun. Set in Alaska, I disagree with the homosexual content of the show tonight. I feel you are pushing too hard to bring New York to Alaska. His only thing is having a New Yorker struggling with wild Alaska, but trying to turn the city of Alaska into New York? This is a good show about delicate women and the real men of Alaska and bringing a homosexual couple into the mix is ​​throwing the balance away. Alaska should be interpreted as a man and New York as a woman. I think the first 9 shows have the perfect balance with what you're all doing. We cannot have a good show without the imbalance of nature.
