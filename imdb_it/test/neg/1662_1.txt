I couldn't watch more than 10 minutes of this movie. He set the standard. I will never assign a film to 1 again, unless it's as horrible as this. I fully agree with the other comments on this film. But since I'm Dutch, I looked at it with the Dutch translation. Apparently, they had no money for an adequate translation, so they decided to talk about it. With sometimes hilarious results. <br /> <br /> Don't smoke, don't drink, don't do drugs, don't watch Demon Summer. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that the actors (Wow, I can't believe I just said that). I didn't keep the script (was there?) In their hands during the shoot. I think they did a good job too ... Well ... Uhmm ... No, they didn't do a good job.
