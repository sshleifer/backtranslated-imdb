This movie was completely painful for me to watch. I understand that independent films do not have the same resources as other traditional films. But there are basic elements of film production that you generally want to respect. First of all, jump. There are numerous in the 15 minutes of opening the film. There are some shots in which it seems that two separate takes of the same shot have been modified together. What I mean is that a character will say half a line from a grip and the rest of the line comes from a different grip. Secondly, dialogue. I understand that many writers are fighting for a very realistic and true dialogue for their films. Since this film is very specific due to its location, the dialogue must also be pronounced in a specific tone (example: setting up a film in Boston, but people use west coast slang with a Chicago accent). Even with an understanding of this, it is still difficult to follow some of the lines that these actors present. These are just the two most vivid problems I have encountered with this film. There were some others. I do not mean to look like a harsh critic who knows nothing. I have years of experience in the film industry (especially the low-budget indie film). I also understand that with many directors there is often a method for their madness. I have not been able to discover this method used in this film. This makes it difficult when trying to decide whether to see this film as an example of a unique style in the making of a film, or just another low budget, a film put together badly. I sincerely hope that it is not the latter. If anyone has any idea why things were done in a certain way, or have some thoughts / views on this film, I'd like to hear them. I hope I can understand this movie more and my current opinion can be changed.
