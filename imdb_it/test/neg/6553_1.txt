Sherman Hemsley was great in Jefferson and above all in the whole family. He was also very good at Amen, why on earth would he make this film? This film has a terrible script and is a waste of a very funny man. Luis Avalos does the best he can, but it's terrible. This film was the beginning of the bankruptcy of Sherman Hemsley. I think it's very funny but this is a terrible story of useless ghosts. Attack with Ghostbusters.
