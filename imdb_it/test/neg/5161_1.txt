This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Thank God I saw it for free. I hated wasting my money on it. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is no character in the film that is in any way funny. Michael Caine approaches, but he too is quite imperfect. The rest of the "commandos" are made of disgusting ex-cons. There are two gay Arabs and three who are trying to rape a Red Cross nurse and the "leader" who has no problem sending his men to be killed in order to escape. <br /> <br /> mission "is something from suspense. They have to blow up a fuel dump. It sounds exciting, right? Well, the movie follows them through endless sandstorms and repairing the tires on the ground. Yes, "The suspense is if you run out of spare tires. In fact, we look at them changing something like 12 apartments on the road. It's so incredibly exciting this movie. <br /> <br /> It reaches the fuel dump to find out that it's bait, so nothing to blow up, and right now, for a very convoluted reason, the British army decides they don't need these guys anymore, and the radios stop at the Germans to kill them . <br /> <br /> So, now at least we'll have an exciting ride to freedom? No, instead, they decide to blow up a different landfill, to create a diversion, but when they enter the place, they start a journey cable. , and the Germans come to get them - calling their names on a speaker. <br /> <br /> Really weird. If the Germans knew where they were and where they were going, why did they let them into the landfill before bursting the "trap?" Instead, they wait until they enter the fuel depot, and set up all their charges. Yes. Right. This would happen. <br /> <br /> So, they blow up the dump, the leader sells all his men - except Michael Caine, since he was offered $ 2000 to bring him back alive. <br /> OK ... so, the men are all betrayed and killed, and Michael Caine and Nigel Davenport survive. British troops enter with tanks and decide to go and save themselves. Since they are wearing German uniforms (they were wearing them to blow up the landfill) they tie a white flag around a stick and go out into the street. <br /> <br /> An English guy walks behind them and machine guns to death. Credit performance. <br /> <br /> Yes. The two "Heroes" of the film die due to an act of casual violence. <br /> <br /> It's almost as if the movie was suddenly short on budget and decided: "It's a conclusion. Kill them and we'll go home." I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this tired, unimaginative and totally unrealistic movie that ended with the grace of a bomb.
