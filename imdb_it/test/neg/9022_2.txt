This is probably Wayne's poorest film; at least the poorest in which he played a leading role. It's simply incredibly bad. The assembly is particularly terrible; it really seems that the publisher (if there was one) literally took pieces of film from the floor and glued them together. Openness must be seen to be believed. John Wayne must have made people shudder every time he was mentioned! I know there are "B" movies - but are there "H" movies? If so, this is an example. And I say this as a devoted JW fan.
