Nothing more than a knock-off kick from The Mighty Ducks, this film has proved annoying in many respects. This was one of those times when parents ask you to bring your younger siblings just to avoid having to face them for a few hours. To say the least, my younger sisters liked it, but it turned out to be too much like the far superior Mighty Ducks. Oh well, at least Olivia d'Abo was sexy and Steve Guttenberg still had a job at the time.
