This film seriously doubted me yet that Armando de Ossorio was a good filmmaker or not ... His films BLIND DEAD are praised by many fans. This I can understand. But you want to be a gothic vampire like MALENKA shows no sign of gifted director. And this also applies to SERPIENTE DE MAR. It features horrible acting, stupid plot, stupid events, many other things you can expect from a bad monster movie, and even veteran actor Ray Milland, who does his best to make his way through this movie despite not having much clue about what he's doing to us. Apparently Milland was already very sick while filming SERPIENTE DE MAR (his last film) and coming out with a ridiculous smelly like this, makes it even sadder. A final appearance alongside Peter Cushing in a TV movie directed by Roy Ward Baker (also in 1984) does not change much. <br /> <br /> But the puppet / sea snake is a scream to observe. Watch him swirl a lighthouse and crush it. Watch it destroy a port with miniature boats. Watch it demolish bridges and munch fascinating miniature trains. <br /> <br /> Good wickedness? Yes. 3/10 and 7/10
