The unthinkable happened. Having witnessed for the first time a few years ago, I had a film that was my point of reference for the horrible and that film was called "McCinsey's Island". An adventurous film for families with Hulk Hogan and Grace Jones (I'm not making this up), has fallen into new depths in the making of the film and is still the only film I saw that made me ask what else could the budget of the movies spent for. Like new schools or drugs to treat cancer. However, for levels of pure and pure suffering, each film will have to lower its standards even lower if they want to defeat "Guest House Paradiso" with the honor of being one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Based roughly on the unfortunate but fun television program "Bottom", this film presents us with two of the greatest losers imaginable. Richard (Rik Mayall) is a hotel owner, as rude as anyone can imagine and so contorted lustful that he almost oozes with every action. His friend Eddie (director Adrian Edmondson) is an alcohol waste of human life and together they try to manage Britain's worst cliff-side hotel near a nuclear power plant. Among them, they dedicate themselves to the violence of cartoons (with sound effects) at regular intervals, they steal something remotely precious or interesting from the fools who stay there and stare nostalgically at any woman. The plot, as it is, involves the arrival of the legendary Italian goddess of the screen Gina Carbonara (Vincent Cassel) who flees her marriage and tries to stay on the ground at the Guest House Paradiso, to the astonishment of Richie and Eddie. And ... here it is. <br /> <br /> I used to think that the Carry On films represented all the evil of the UK film industry and God knows, we spent so much time and money trying to escape that terrible heritage god. We had films like "Trainspotting", "28 Days Later", "Four Weddings And A Funeral" and the brilliant "Shaun Of The Dead" (also played by Simon Pegg) but this ... this drags those screaming and kicking movies back to the days when Sid James and Barbara Windsor climb up with the help of a bicycle whistle. "Guest House Paradiso" is so low in its ambition that it insults you the moment you look at it. I kept looking, waiting in advance for the lines to begin, but they never came. Only an endless stream of trapped gags, non-imaginative scenarios that defy explanations, a slightly amusing violence with frying pans and fridge doors and almost nothing that raises a little smile. Come to the first commercial break (he was on TV, see) and I was ready to switch off but my faithful duties towards you, my readers, made me move forward. "I'm watching this so they don't have to" it became my mantra, so you guys remember better how much you owe me for this, because this was as much fun as having the sand that hit me in the eye and be fed with the strength of food for dogs . <br /> <br /> Believe me, I loved the "Bottom" TV show. Mayall and Edmondson's suitably dirty acting combination with OTT youthful humor worked ... for half an hour each week. Certainly not for an hour and a half, while Edmondson and Mayall give themselves their little private joke and bore and depress the rest of the audience. Honestly, this makes Mayall's "Drop Dead Fred" like "The Godfather" and if you were to meet one of these two people (who are practically the only one responsible for the chaos on the screen pretending to be a movie), feel free to do it quickly deliver a boot to their testicle region. They will probably have fun. Pegg and Bill Nighy (both as hotel guests) are dragged down by this sinking ship but at least they survived. Mayall and Edmondson shouldn't be so lucky. The cinematic equivalent of Chernobyl and should be avoided as such.
