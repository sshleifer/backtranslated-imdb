There is nothing I hate most in a pretentious film, and this is one of the most pretentious films ever made. Self-awareness is obvious in every context: "look at what a film we are making, profound and sophisticated", the director and screenwriters seem to tell us, and say to themselves, "let's see how we can bore and confuse audiences even more." I'd rather watch the worst film by Ed Wood or Edgar G. Ulmer of something like that. At least they gave us honest rejections, and at least their films, in their atrocious way, were funny. This film is fun as a radical channel without anesthesia, and therefore equivalent to torture. <br /> <br /> Have these writers ever heard the word "story"? It doesn't look like this. They have a concept, they are able to create an atmosphere, and they were able to assemble an excellent cast and arouse good performances from them. For what? To get bored for an hour and 45 minutes? Nothing really happens in this movie. The only exciting part, and this lasts only about two minutes, occurs when one of the homeowners who must be evicted starts shooting at state employees who come to tell him he has to leave. But nothing comes out. Too bad he didn't keep shooting until he hit the writers. The only saving features of this film are acting and some beautifully photographed scenarios towards the end. 3/10
