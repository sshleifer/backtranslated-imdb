this film, although it could be considered an excellent comedy attempt, is not what the previews made possible. the first half is composed of a typical Williams robin standing, but he didn't make many voices; he has always been good with one liners and beat the final lines ... somewhere during the elections there is a problem with the computer program that is used in the elections. this is where network 3 comes in ... a woman who helped with this program wants the truth to be told and the evil corporation wants to have her spoiled ** spoiler ** her boyfriend also helps them, even if this isn't even enriched ... this film could have been one of political genius (perhaps with sorken to the kingdoms) but it is not a stew made by too many chefs
