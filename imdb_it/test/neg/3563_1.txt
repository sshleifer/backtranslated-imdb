Conclusion: very, very, very boring, yet I looked up to the end, hoping for some upside down effect, but the end was worse, because it was nothing. The old black and white game didn't help at all, it usually helps psychological films, but it wasn't. The script, the plot, etc. They were linear, had no substance, nothing in progress. When it comes to psychology, the analysis is dealt with, then with the details, that formula of unity-diversity .... there was no essence, no detail. Just a story, there are many stories to tell, but something makes them unique and difficult to forgive with the tools and creativity of filmmakers ... well, that's not it.
