I have to agree with the previous review. Although Kristin Erikson did a great job playing the possessed girl, I don't seriously think that Isabelle, the character she was playing, was possessed. I saw people who had psychotic breaks due to sexual abuse, and they never made it clear if the father had actually abused her or not. I also had to review some parts of it, to clarify what the letter said, what the characters' names were, and I'm still not clear about some things that happened, whether they were real or not. I'm trying to find the "original" story it was based on, to compare the facts, but I can't find anything online about it. <br /> <br /> It wasn't a bad movie, but some of the dialogues were incredibly cheap. As for the special effects, the film was not bad for a B grade, practically, and those scenes of possession have been worth it ... that is, if you have nothing better to do. LOL
