The film tells you to be aware and conscientious. It also destroys everything, the Bible claims to be true. For people like me the first episode was interesting and the second one was disastrous. It has been called "blasphemy", and it is, if you are a believer. It is sad to hear that many people think it is a good sequel to the Bible. However, the film shows many things and topics, which can be interpreted as a film version of "Revelation". Some of us think that these things should not be abused. One good thing about the film is that it strongly encourages ethical awareness and makes you consider your actions twice. The director simply seems to forget that some people act that way just on the basis of the fact, that they believe and love as prescribed in the Bible ... Why try to change it, unless you're the Devil yourself?
