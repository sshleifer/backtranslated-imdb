Police officer Michael (Tomas Arana, "The Church") has his hands full while investigating a serial killer who has left parts of the bodies of people he is killing in the home of one of the last widows, Tracy (Joanna Pacula). Mike must find a way to prevent bodies from accumulating, while perhaps finding love in the process. <br /> <br /> A feeling of the "yellow" films of the past pervades this film, even though we know who the killer is from the beginning and the film contains some beautiful pieces (a scene later in the film set in a school for the blind that is particularly memorable), but it doesn't make much sense when everything is said and done both. All in all, not quite as good as the previous "Macabre" by Bava, nor his first two films "Demons", but quite funny if you can forgive the rather outrageous twists towards the end of the film. Too bad the Image Entertainment DVD lacked extras of any kind, as I would have been interested in some. <br /> <br /> My Grade: C-
