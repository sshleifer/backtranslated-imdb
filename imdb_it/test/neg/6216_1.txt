I don't remember, at least in the last ten years, a film that I liked less than Mama Mia. From the non-existent acting to the atrocious song, I was shivering at least once a minute. I don't think I could even remember a short segment that I tolerated. I know I will never look at this disaster again. I can't believe that with such high expectations due to talent - Colin Firth, Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, that a film could be such a flop. But to see the lack of acting skills shown, the seemingly drugged dances, and then the horrors of horrors, to hear the song of Pierce Brosnan (!), I don't see how this movie will fail to enter the shame room. Surely, a film that should never have been made, and if I had missed it the first time, one that I will never watch again.
