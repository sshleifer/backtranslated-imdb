This theatrical and dramatic adaptation is incessantly stirred through the plot of Dickens' wonderful book, replacing the emotional impact with hasty transitions and possible external positions with drawings. It is not the fault of the actors and the production team that the budget is so low, of course, but we must question the point of doing this in the first place when there is neither time nor money to make it justice. Michael Hordern's Scrooge is too kind at first, making his transformation powerless, and this is not helped by a lack of reaction from him as he watches the visions. The other actors range from acceptable (Clive Merrison, Paul Copley), to non-committal (Bernard Lee) to seeming like they were about to forget their lines (John Le Mesurier). He doesn't even make points for the effort, to be honest.
