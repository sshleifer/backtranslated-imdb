Even though I'm not a very religious person, I still have relatively high hopes for this film, since it has the extraordinary Steve Carrell, and his prequel, Bruce Almighty, was actually a creative and intelligent comedy with a Christian theme. However, Evan Almighty does not come close to this originality and freshness that the original has, and cannot decide whether it is a comedy or a sentimental film about faith and family values. If he had chosen a clear path on which of these themes to focus on, he could have lived up to its potential, but instead the result of mixing the two is a film that has a very flat and dry sense of humor, style dialogues and motives that try to give depth to the film, but on the contrary insults practically the intelligence of the public, and also a very confused and blurred presentation of the opaque message of the film. It was obvious that Evan Almighty was written very badly, there are numerous holes in the plot and elements in the film that make absolutely no sense. For example, although a large variety of exotic animals from all over the planet ski in Evan as he builds the ark for their salvation from the flood, their inclusion is really necessary when the only "flood" that occurs in the film is in downtown Washington DC and a suburban neighborhood, meaning they don't run the risk of being wiped out? Filmmakers seem to lack the originality of modernizing the history of the Bible, and instead it has just happened in a present time without changing anything in the plot, leaving many elements that simply do not add up like this and make the idiotic motifs and writing all obvious. inside the film. Overall, this work is tragic in the fact that the acting talent of Steve Carrell and Wanda Sykes is not exposed because of the bland characters they portray, and that it was written so badly that it swings and rips off many of the film's tempting themes, and does a mockery of the first film. Finally, Evan Almighty is also an insult to the brilliant actors in it and to every intelligent viewer halfway, in the sense that he both fails miserably.
