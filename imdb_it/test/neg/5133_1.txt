I loved Heavenly Creatures and made it a point to capture whenever it's active. <br /> <br /> So imagine my joy when I discovered Love & Suicide while browsing NetFlix. Echoing Heavenly Creatures, an easy choice, on top of my tail is gone. <br /> <br /> I watched it for the last time, I made myself comfortable and waited. What I thought was a lousy preview of a joke student's project of a high school student (I laughed out loud once or twice, thinking "that he just turned down the bar on the video") turned out to be the movie. Horrible acting, amateur management, weak dialogue. I usually like low-budget films, there's something tangible and real about them because they can't afford superficial things to distract the acting, the direction, the plot, the plot from the "flesh". I would compare it to a student who didn't study for an exam, knowing that it's going to fail and just put his head on the desk and sleep. <br /> <br /> In the hands of someone else the plot would have serious potential. <br /> <br /> Don't expect the magic or even the classics of a sect such as, for example, Divine's Polyester or Showgirls, at least there you learn to expect bad acting. <br /> <br /> Love & Suicide has gone from bad to worse to the worst movie I've ever seen.
