I will no longer comment on this film. Instead I will make a recommendation for all you horror fans in Europe: if you want to watch a fun low-budget vampire movie, take a look at Nattens engel (1998). It has everything Razor Blade Smile misses: acting, beautiful places, terrifying score and few hissing vampires ...
