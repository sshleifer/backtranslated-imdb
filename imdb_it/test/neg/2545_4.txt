This film has some special effects, breaking the Japanese archipelago to such an extent as to humiliate Godzilla. The two leads also highlighted superior performance. Apart from that, it's all a bit ropey in this minimized catastrophic movie. Inconsistencies in rhythm are bizarre. At one point we have the Hokkaido sinking into the sea and the pyroclastic snow falling on the rest of Japan, while Osaka is buried by a huge tsunami. Yet, in other parts of the country, people still wander around the city and lick their ice cream when another tsunami arrives ... Kusanagi also manages to travel great distances without any hindrance, or even a crease in his cream-colored shirt . Other people show up with burns, torn clothes and strips of mud on their faces. <br /> <br /> The originality of the film is both touching and repulsive. Kusanagi's sacrifice in his last evening with Shibasaki is a touch of chivalry rarely seen in this genre these days. However, the PM's unfortunate reflections on the Japanese psyche and the seduction of death, and the fact that Japan is abandoned by all and has no friends as a last resort, suggest a dark paranoia that infects Japanese concerns about their status in the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the final sequence is a copy of Armaggedon, edited with a cookie-cutter. <br /> <br /> Finally, my particular bug-bear - the heavy positioning of the cigarette product. This time, he's a mad scientist (-o-is-he?) Toyokawa who becomes Japan Tobacco's poster boy. At one point, he manages to illuminate 5,000 meters below the surface of the ocean, in a miniature submarine the size of a telephone box. Give me a break.
