The first twenty-five minutes are the worst of the modern British film. The director / adapter William Cartlidge treated Wilde's original with such reverence that he seems to have completely ignored the needs of a film audience. Fortunately, the quality of the direction and assembly is significantly improved after the first half hour, but at that point the damage has been done. Among the actors, Prunella Scales and Robert Hardy clean the floor with the rest of the cast whenever they are on the screen. The other exceptions are Arthur and Karen Hayley's Mabel by Jonathan Firth, which is given enough space to express their lines with the true comic sense that Wilde meant. The apparent leaders, James Wilby and Trevyn McDowell, are unpleasant and wooden in comparison. In an obvious attempt to get a hundredth of the budget, the comedy was nominally updated to the 90s, but in conjunction with the original script the effect is more of a dramatic TV drama of the 70s. The real comedy moments are few and far between, but when they arrive they are very funny - a sign, perhaps, that a more judicious pruning of the rest of the show could have led to a better, more balanced film.
