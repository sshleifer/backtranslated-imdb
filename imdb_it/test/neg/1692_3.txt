I was 12 when this movie was released and I love it. The song was inspiring and made me feel good, watching it several times in the cinema. Actually I had the soundtrack album and I played the song over and over again. <br /> <br /> 26 years later ... I'm ashamed. I sat down and watched him with my two daughters who had a lot of fun, but my cynical grown-up eyes hated him. He's very badly directed in many places and considering that it was Lionel Jeffries who directed that I really wanted to enjoy it. The character animation was so hard yet the backgrounds were pretty good. I remember the critics of the time who said it was a poor film and was horrified but now I agree. <br /> <br /> It's an old movie, yes, compared to what you can get now, maybe that's why I thought it was fine then. But this does not excuse him for his poor acting, directing and sloppiness. It seems that the main voice of the child actor is nicknamed, which is very distracting. It is not possible to see what they were trying to achieve when it was realized, all that became was a weak film.
