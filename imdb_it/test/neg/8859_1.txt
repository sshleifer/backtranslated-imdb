This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. It's been a few years since I saw it and since then nothing has come close and I doubt that there will ever be such a bad film. Try to make fun of a variety of different films, such as "Nell" (!) And instead of fun it's just pathetic. Whatever you do, don't rent or with this garbage and if someone throws it against you ... turn around and run away on the other side !!
