Combining serious drama with proper comedy is touchy at best. SEARCHING FOR THE COMEDY IN THE WORLD MUSLIMS did it thanks to a topical subject and a fantastic script; not to mention the excellent interpretation of the character of Albert Brooks. But the MAN OF THE YEAR cannot come close to confrontation. He has a messy message with forced jokes and a distorted love story that is absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> The premise initially seemed very promising. Put a comedian like Jon Stewart for the President of the United States and see what happens. This independent runner is Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams, RV), a successful TV personality who is pushed to run by his audience. With him comes his manager Jack (Christopher Walken, CLICK), and his writer Eddie (Lewis Black). Seems to have little chance of a successful run, Tom Dobbs incredibly wins the election. <br /> <br /> But did he? Eleanor Green (Laura Linney, THE EXORCIST OF EMILY ROSE) is a computer wizard who designed the new software for electronic voting at polling stations. Find a fault in the system that is quickly swept under the carpet by the company owner and his dark lawyer Alan (Jeff Goldblum, INDEPENDENCE DAY). Poised to lose billions of dollars if a news came out, the evil men of the company have decided to discredit and / or kill Eleanor to make sure he never tells anyone. But Eleanor is able to reach President-elect Dobbs and finally pour the beans (this is where the incredible love story begins to flourish). Dobbs goes on Saturday Night Live and explains everything to the world, removing himself as well as the newly elected president and ending the careers of those of the computer company ... oh, and saving Mrs. Green's life. <br /> <br /> Any of this sounds weird? Comedy is forced into history and is often embarrassing. Robin Williams intrigues for a few moments during a debate, but is quickly suffocated by the gravity of how he became president. The message of the film is interesting and questionable: that special interest has presidential candidates. I'm sure there is a substantial truth to this, and if you wanted to make a film about this, you could do it. If you wanted to make a comedy about you, you could. But Man of the Year is not like that.
