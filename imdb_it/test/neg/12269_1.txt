I love watching Australian movies but this stack of steaming shit was just embarrassing. The DVD cover looked promising, but you know what they say, don't judge a DVD by its cover. <br /> <br /> I also noticed that he won the award for best actor for an award, but the competition must have been really bad because the acting in this film is pathetic. It just seemed like the director thought he had enough talent to direct and act when he should have focused on a part of the film and understood it well before he got too far. The music was pretty ordinary. The story did not go anywhere. It was just a sequence of struggles related to poor scripts and dialogues. <br /> <br /> I will tell all aspiring directors. Watch this movie. It will give you hope that your film will win something at some festival. <br /> <br /> However, it is good for them to come and try. I hope they learned some lessons and that their next adventure is a little better.
