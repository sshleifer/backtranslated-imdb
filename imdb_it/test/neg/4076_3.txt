If you are not a fan of the 80s, and you have to be a particularly strong fan, or one of the two protagonists, there is nothing to recommend in this film. <br /> <br /> History, as others have said, is boring, almost an afterthought for the basic notion of characters and the idea of ​​making a slightly manic comedy. I watched it for about an hour, hoping it would turn a corner, there would be a turning point or it would somehow start the march but no ... It's not unwatchable, it's just boring. Passa. He passes with running pieces around crazy and persistent blows of feet at strange angles, madly screaming pieces but I didn't have a real feeling of energy or manic fun, but I ran into something forced. Needless to say, there was nothing to laugh about in particular. A little light fun here and there but nothing more. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the mention of feminism by the way, this means in this case that almost all the main cast is female. If nothing else, it's really cloying ... Two female conductors, excellent, excellent, the drug dealer is female, okay, the landlord is a landlady, okay, their friends are women, okay, the only other person we see in particular those who live in the same building, oh female ... I was not looking for this, but after a while it seemed to me that a conscious decision had been made to make the film turn in that way and still felt a little forced and sickly. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, if you're a fan of 80s fashion and culture, there's a lot to see and if you're a Helen Slater fan, it's fun and fun to watch. There is also some screen-time for Carol Kane, which is great, but not enough ... <br /> <br /> Overall: 3/10. If you are a big fan of the 80s, Helen Slater and Carol Kane, you could extend it to 5 because of them, although there is still the fact that it is a comedy that is not fun, which substantially hinders it. If you are not a fan of these things, you could also do it 0 because there is nothing else to enjoy here.
