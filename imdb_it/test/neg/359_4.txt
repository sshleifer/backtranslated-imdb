The man with the golden arm (the film) is a decent career vehicle for Frank Sinatra, but he abysmally fails as a good adaptation of a fantastic book. You have always heard of how books are "changed" when they are turned into films - things are cut off, speechless, etc. Well, you can't even say that they "changed" something with the movie - they just said something completely different story. The characters and the setting are the same, but not the ambiguous characterization, the depth of the men and women of Polish Chicago in the book. As for the setting, it has simply become a gaming stage, complete with the useless "supporting role," players who walk too much busilly along the claustrophobic inner streets. The film is a completely ridiculous and completely different take on Frankie Machine and drug addiction. When this happens, Zosh, Frankie, Sparrow, all lose their psychological advantage. Frankie's drums, a modest dream in the book, become his full passion in the film (probably because Sinatra is a musician). And drug addiction is treated as a shlock, in an instrumental way. The acting is decent, especially the snake Louie, which in the film is more threatening than the book. But it's just a pity that this type of film can be announced as a classic next to the book it is based on, "the real story of Frankie Machine. The film only goes to show that Hollywood can have everything in place without sweetening and adding "A happy ending. In this case, they simply changed it completely, making an important and realistic story in a Hollywood movie less interesting. I'm sure I'm biased because I read the book first, so I can't really handle the film." honestly knowing how good the book is. I actually thought of turning the film off (and I never do), just so I wouldn't have his stupid plot confused with the beauty of the book, but this is an overrated film, and even if it's not so bad, the book should come first, as it was the first, and it should have been the only story of Division Street and Frankie Machine.
