I had high hopes for this until they changed the name to "The Shepherd: Border Patrol, the most anonymous film of all time, what was wrong with" The Shepherd ". This is an action movie of numbers that He puts his hat on in many classic Van Damme movies, there is a lot of action in a bar that reminded me of a difficult target and a universal soldier, but directed without intensity or talent, which is a real shame. a big joke about "being drunk and carrying a rabbit" and some disappointing OK action scenes. Many times the dialogue does not match the characters' mouths and the stunts fall dead a second before being hit. The final fight is one of the Van Damme's best fights, except that the director tries to go a little too much John Woo and fails even by introducing flashbacks that nobody really cares about just to hinder the action that is the point of a van Damme film. <br /> <br /> Not good, not bad, just u n 'generic media action.
