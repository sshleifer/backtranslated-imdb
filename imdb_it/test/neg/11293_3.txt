Well, I haven't seen "Silence of the Lambs" before ... but, I think I'd get sick if I saw it before this piece. Not from the gruesome violence but from the lack of everything else. Anthony Hopkins was as good as Hannibal and I really thought he was psychotic as he behaved by himself but, from the reaction of the audience around me, the film was full of "Silence" clich√©s that left me lost where others laughed of what was on the screen. <br /> <br /> Now, I felt that the film would be very creepy and if the director wanted to get people out ... he did ... but, only in 2 sequences? I mean, if you want it to be creepy and I mean, so creepy that you're going to play the movie outside of this ... you need more than 2 sequences .. I always see it as a movie that has to become that cinematic jewel that it will end up taking you to another place and time or going over the top (most of the time it's bad taste). But, this movie left me sitting in my chair and falling asleep sometimes. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore are the stars of the film, right? Well, with the exception of Hopkins, I didn't feel that way. Who cared about the stupid Italian cop? I did not. So actually the movie is left with a big hole about a guy who dies anyway. I mean, come on ... who cares? <br /> <br /> Simply put, the movie is good if you want to see Lector and Starling again, but if you want a really good thriller .. you will jump once and be disgusted maybe twice. It depends on your level. <br /> <br /> Thinking about how much money this film will bring ... there will probably be another "Hannibal" made and this film will probably not be on video until autumn. If you need to see it ... wait and save $ 3.50 - $ 4.00 and do it on the video. Don't spend the money on this movie.
