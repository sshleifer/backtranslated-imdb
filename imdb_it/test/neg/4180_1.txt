This must be one of those times when you meet a film with a beautiful cover, my first impression, sweet, full moon, crows, a scarecrow holding a scythe. OK my impression (I had watched Scarecrow on TV a week ago) perfect, a nice slasher movie to start the evening with. ................... wrong, absolutely wrong I think that 5 minutes I was about to take it out, but I thought I had wasted 3 $ in this so badly to finish it where the scarecrow, Well, I suppose he has the fisherman's legs wearing heavy rain boots. you see it every now and then. I was looking at this thought ... OK, when those brats run into this guy, at one point I thought they were dead. but no ... I mean frig, they are still alive. I just chuckled to a few parts because of how badly they were staged. one was the zoom in part at the beginning. the director / actor / writer says "remember that I had that feeling, well, I have it again" and it was both a zoom and a zoom out, to hell I'm going back. but I suppose the scene was supposedly shocking, I mean what is more shocking that his wife looked the same shocked ... OK ... did she believe him ??? I'm sorry but YEAH ... I didn't know it was psychic until I read the movie box to make sense of what I saw. not only that, they used images to make you think this film is at least clear. <br /> <br /> the other thing that made me laugh a little was the, scream in the camera, to make it scary ....... OK ........... .. .. filming a girl up close screaming in the camera for 5 minutes ....... right ..... I laughed because of how pathetic it was that these guys couldn't behave like the rest of the people in the movie. <br /> <br /> to complete things off the scythe must have been lost or something ... because it seems that the villain only had a stick. not even an ax, someone should cut the dam production film <br /> <br /> Don't fall for the image, this film is a piece of sh * t. I watched the trailer and guess what it has <br /> <br /> GIRLS WHERE YOU'RE SPEAKING WITH ME and CORN
