There have been some great television movies in the past. Poems like "Roots" and "Lonesome Dove" come to mind. Category 6: Day of Destruction will not be remembered to advance the cause of films made for TV. A ridiculously ugly story, surpassed only by the horrible script, Cat6DD, as I like to call it, inspires more sympathy for the actors involved than the terror in nature that the film should have brought out. That sound you hear during the film should be the sound of the wind, but instead the careers of Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy and Thomas Gibson (Greg, of the Dharma & Greg duo) are actually falling faster than houses, trucks and cows can fly away from one of the 15 tornadoes we see in the first 5 minutes of the movie. The film was advertised as "crazy nature", instead we have a lame story about how 15 different weather systems conspire to produce 150 degrees in Chicago, then a storm the next day by a hurricane that was in the Gulf of Mexico that it combined with a storm system from Canada but actually had its origins in a jet stream changed by global warming .... ENOUGH !! No matter the story, the acting was terrible, the actors' words were stupid and 13 scientists all over the country had coronaries after hearing the dribble coming out of the movie. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters, the special effects were sub-par, even by TV standards, and the narrative lines were useless. All in all, I really don't like this "television event".
