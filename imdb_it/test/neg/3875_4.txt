"Return of the Seven" has some good action scenes, and Elmer Bernstein's soundtrack is always more challenging. However, it is a boring film, because it simply does not involve us emotionally. The absence of Mcqueen really makes a bad impression, and the fact that his character here is played by a different actor (little known) is strange - in a wrong way. The characters are not developed, so we don't connect with them - and we don't care when some of them die. This sequel is a passable but poor imitation of the original.
