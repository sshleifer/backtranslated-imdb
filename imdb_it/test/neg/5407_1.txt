This ranks there as the worst movies of all time. No research or thought went into this film. Action scenes were launched at random intervals that didn't make sense in the context of the film. The objects appeared and disappeared at random, etc. It is obvious that this was directed by a "stunt coordinator", who should return to his old job. The Skeleton Man rode a horse throughout the film, which could incredibly change color at will. Or that, or someone thought the audience would be color blind and wouldn't notice. The blood would be on the actors in a scene and the next moment it will miraculously disappear and then reappear. It seems that everyone who has connected to this film has forgotten to check for inconsistencies.
