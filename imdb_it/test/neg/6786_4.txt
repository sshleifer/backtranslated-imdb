* SPOILERS! * When I saw the preview for the first time, it looked like a good old reference movie. I love bluegrass music, so I couldn't wait to see it. When we rented the movie, we read the back and it looked even better. The film was rather boring for the first time, sometimes a song was played. Then (I'm embarrassed to write it) a lesbian love has arrived. That there was more than friendship between teachers, but I certainly didn't expect nudity and prolonged make-up sessions. I was watching this with my mother and I was pretty embarrassed, because I chose this movie. But besides that, it was an okay movie. The acting was fine, the actress who played Deladis was great. To be honest, the soundtrack was the best part of the film. I don't care to see the movie again, but I bought the soundtrack the day after seeing the movie. And there are continuation records that follow. If I were you, I will skip the movie and take only the music.
