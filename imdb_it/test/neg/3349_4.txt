I saw it on a cheap DVD with the title "The Entity Force". Since I like 80's horror movies, I thought I had a real surprise. Unfortunately the film is mostly boring and you're constantly waiting for something to happen. In the end it becomes quite interesting, but this is in the last quarter of the film. It's a case of too little too late. When the action happens, it is not so big, what we get are dead corpses that "float" on the ground and chase the girls in the mausoleum. Not the absolute worst I've ever seen, but you can do much better. I would recommend it only to collectors of eternal 80s horrors.
