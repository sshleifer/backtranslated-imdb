... "Flight of the Living Dead" sports production values ​​that contradict director Scott's poor script "I'm a producer, can't I say?" Thomas and two hacks that will remain nameless because I'm sorry for them having to attach those no-names to this turkey. Apparently filmed on film, this direct-to-DVD version has almost nothing for which it hasn't been seen or heard hundreds of times. <br /> <br /> Despite the presence of a number of recognizable actors such as Richard "Three O'Clock High" Tyson, Erick "Stargate" Avari and Raymond J. "Little Children" Barry, and a string of others not so recognizable, "FoLD" is populated mainly of cardboard, most of which ends up imbued with unconvincing fake blood.
