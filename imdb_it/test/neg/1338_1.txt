No! no - no - NO! My whole being is revolting against this terrible remake of a classic movie. I knew we'd be in trouble from the moment Meg Ryan appeared on the screen with her ridiculous hair and clothes - which literally looked like a scarecrow in that digging garden. Meg Ryan plays Meg Ryan - how hard is it ?! And it got worse ... much worse. The horrible clich√© lines, the standard characters, the growing sense that I was watching a spin-off of "The First Wives Club" and the last trivial crap in the delivery room. How many times have I seen this movie? Only once, but it seems like a dozen times - nothing original or fresh. For shame!
