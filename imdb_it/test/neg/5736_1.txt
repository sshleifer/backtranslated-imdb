I know a lot of people would say certain films as "the worst of all time", but I think Redneck claims this award. A combination of rather terrifying acting by Mark Lester and Telly Savales and a storyline that defies belief. <br /> <br /> About Telly Saveles: Was he drunk when he acted in this? Seems to be playing a crazy, laughing crazy without any sense of conviction. Maybe he mixed his medicines with his whiskey, I don't know. <br /> <br /> On Mark Lester: A more wooden performance than a carpenter. His truncated English tones do not belong to this film; and his transformation from a protected teenager into a gangster apprentice in 24 hours is insane. And the strip scene with Mosquito has no relevance to the plot; maybe the director likes this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Logic of the plot: when Memphis and Mosquito laid an ambush at the beginning, because Mark Lester's mother doesn't do or says anything to get her son out of the car, before the madmen take him away ? Let them all go without saying a word !! On the other hand, Redneck must be seen - you won't believe how bad it is otherwise!
