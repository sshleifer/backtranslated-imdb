My housemate and I foolishly bought the "The Roller Blade Seven" video from our second-hand video store in hopes of finding a bad movie to laugh at. This film is not even ridiculous, it is pathetically poor, even worse than Jack Frost 2 - and this is saying something. The script, acting, production, acrobatics, sounds, sets, everything is absolutely terrible. In some parts the actors have not even learned their lines and are openly ad-libbing or, in one case, actually have the lines read on the set and simply repeating them. Set in the post-apocalyptic "Wheel Zone", the film obviously consists of about 45 minutes of films, many of which have been poorly modified or repeated to nausea from different camera angles to lengthen the film. This gets boring very quickly. The plot makes absolutely no sense (it is apparently an amalgamation of two books written by Scott Shaw), there are not even seven, most of them are not on blades, they wear sneakers and it seems to me that mostly the film it has been completely sold on the fact that there are about 3 minutes of female semi-nudity. The writer and star Scott Shaw obviously imagines himself a bit like a samurai and throughout the film he performs some very poor stunts and composes sword fighting moves that seem very amateurish. Despite this, his website states that the film should never be compared to a traditional film because it really pushes the boundaries of modern film production. My home companion and I were speechless for the whole ordeal, and despite my frequent attempts to burn the videotape, decided that it could be some sort of Ring-esquire video curse that needs to be transmitted. If you see the video in the shops, take it from me! Let yourself be well!
