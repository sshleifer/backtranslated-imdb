This movie sucks. The acting is worse than that of the films we made when we were 10 with a video camera, the effects look like a computer game from the 80s and the plot is worse than terrible. Even the worst Van Damme movies make this look lousy. The accent and the rhythm of the "bad" discourse is so bad that it's fun .. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend watching it unless you're a big fan of the actors. 1 in 10.
