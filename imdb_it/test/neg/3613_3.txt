I will not vote for this film as a terrible film, mainly because I like it, I was one of those summer days when I was so lame to do anything and I decided to rent a movie in the stupid section of the video store. Moreover I didn't sleep almost before and the film woke me up ... Let's start the autopsy, OK, the film has a strange plot, first it's isolation, there is an expedition, they isolate themselves on an island because they don't 'it's gasoline on the boat, something like that, there's not a single convincing performance on the part of the actors (so far), the main problem starts after the idea of ​​isolation, the POV of a snake, then another, .. then another, then the snakes that change, then the false ghosts, many of them, and when we believe that the film is going well for the fake shot keeping the suspense that fails, because after ten or eleven ghosts we don't get carried away by distance, the only scene that makes everything invisible is the scene when we witness a drunken lesbian show observed by snakes that seem to dance, after this it is not becoming a horror adventure but a comedy film, even the adventure part is discarded. <br /> <br /> For me the problem in a film is the third act, it is the only section that guides the film to an already successful conclusion, or if it succeeds we have not noticed it, like a ninja smoke in the our eyes, well .... The island of snakes has a bad conclusion, everything comes to a "from the book". Finishing, with a comparison, persecution and escape sequence, it was foreseeable when I rented the copy of the dam . The other real problem is the concept, the concept is very important, it is the reason why you believe in dinosaurs that come to life or a corpse full of points that only wants to live, the main concept of snakes that want revenge after decades of torture from part of the civilization man, well ... hmmm, don't make the hill on the wall. One thing you'll like (if you look at it with an open mind) are the bz sequences, the naked lesbian girls, some amateur shots, the braindead tribute to the lawn mower, the black guy doesn't die first, and that's all ... if you want to see snakes, black dudes and comedies and you prefer to have higher budgets go see "snakes on a plane". <br /> <br /> Hasta spectators
