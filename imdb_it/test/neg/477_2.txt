My brain screamed "why do you keep watching! Turn off and go to bed!" But the potential of the sofa won, and I looked up to the foreseeable end. I imagine that when he is Bruce Campbell I need to give him a chance. <br /> <br /> I find it hard to complain about a low budget movie just because of the low budget ... over and over again we see a low budget movie showing that a good story, good writing and good acting are enough to make a good movie. Ted and Bruce started their careers on a film like that, but they don't seem to learn from Sam that it takes a little longer than beating the movie to make a movie. <br /> <br /> It's sad, too, because Bruce has always been a favorite. After the 70s and 80s, I can't believe that such films are still made. Bruce, I'm really disappointed.
