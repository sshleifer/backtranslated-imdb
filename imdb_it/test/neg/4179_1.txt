If you want to enjoy the money you would spend to rent this money, go and buy an ice bag and watch it melt. It's more fun than this movie. <br /> <br /> Bill Cowell, shame on you. <br /> <br /> Or if you want to see this plot of the movie, go to a cornfield, bring two of the most annoying girls you can find, run for a couple of hours with the girls screaming as loud as possible. Then send me the business cards you would have spent. <br /> <br /> I liked the first Dark Harvest, after seeing the sequel, I will cry myself to sleep.
