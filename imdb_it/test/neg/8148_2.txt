This film is a laugh and a half. From the first scene, where we have an appearance of Mel Torme in the role of a great and bad Jaguar drivin 'stud muffin gang leader (and this is a feast of laughter in itself), up to the final image of Mamie Van Doren, now a 'angelic teenager rehabilitated walking outside the prison (errr .. loving home of the girl driven by iron fisted nuns), you can't stop shaking your head. The cast of this film is a poor list of Mel and Mamie for the naive Paul Anka (all I wanted through most of this film was for him just to stop singing!) And the king of forty years, Dick Contino . Gloria Talbot, who plays a humorous teenage girl with more than a few crumbs (judo, not acting) last time I saw Leech Woman in the horrible misogynistic 1950s, with such an ugly hairstyle that looked like a dead marmot that was been crushed by a Mac truck. <br /> <br /> Mamie is a bad girl, bad, smokes, curses, runs wild, hits teachers and runs around with group leaders. He downloaded his idiot Jaguar, the driving boyfriend Chip (which we see in the first scene trying to rape a blonde girl, before he falls to a handsome boy), and instead continues with Dick Contino. If this is a step forward for her, nobody knows. Mel shows up at a party with her new boyfriend and accuses her of pushing the bad Chip off the cliff. While I'm sure she wanted to, she wasn't there. A stupid fight scene between Contino and his band and Mel and his jazz freaks ensues, with some hilarious moves on both sides. <br /> <br /> Mamie ends up being sent to the city of girls, a school of reform. ..loving family for the girls who make mistakes .. from Sister Iron Pants and his correction sisters. It annoys the nuns (and us) by popping, throwing away monkeys, and only generally showing how bad it is. She quickly encounters Gloria Talbot, playing one of the misbehaving girls, who gives her a cut ball so that she knows her place. Meet a soft noodle of a girl obsessed with the character of Paul Anka (why?). This little drip becomes his "henchman". <br /> <br /> There is a long film in which not much happens, except that St. Paul of Anka continues to show itself and shows how holy it is. Sing too much in this interval, until you want to hit him in his huge sneaky to shut him up! And Mamie's little sister, played by the best-known Princess of Father Know, calls her to tell her he's in trouble. Turns out it was her sister who came out with low-waisted pants, and now Mel is blackmailing her because she found out. The girls go out to save her, with a scene of hysterical struggle between the girls and Mel and her boys. this is after a competition between Mel and Dick who is so stupid as to scare the mind. The overage teenagers in this brave movie have a fabulous time flipping through what is fundamentally a stupid, poorly written and morally preaching movie that achieves none except its purposes, unless its purpose is to make you laugh out loud.
