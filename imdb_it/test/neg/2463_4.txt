"Once again, we have a film that includes about 20 minutes of entertainment - mostly involving the occasionally funny band lyrics - in a 90-minute package". For anyone old enough to remember, this is one of the lines of the first "Bill and Ted" WITHOUT the plot. If this does not tell you enough how this film is brainless, think of Jack Black singing for about 20 minutes of the film and that is his strong point. If you really like listening to Tenacious D because of their musical prowess, then throw yourself out and buy the soundtrack. Don't waste time with this though. If you're a bully looking for a good bad movie full of laughter, you're still barking from the wrong tree. Regardless of the power of your buds, you will still be eager to have escaped back to Grandpa.
