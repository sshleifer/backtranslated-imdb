I rented this movie because the DVD's cover looked like a ridiculous college comedy like van wilder or animal house. I took him to my friends' house to watch the movie night. We ended up stopping it for 15 minutes in the movie, and instead we looked at Copper Mountain. I don't know if any of you have seen Copper Mountain, but it's not even nice. However, I should say that the Alan Thick Jim Carrey Duo has made a watch more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I then finished Puddle Cruiser. This film was slow and the humor was forced. This film reminded me of some stinkers I saw in some of my first college production classes. I was asked "was this the movie that allowed Broken Lizard to create Supertroopers?" Also, how could this movie suck so badly? The Supertroopers were good and the Club Dread was decent. Don't see this movie!
