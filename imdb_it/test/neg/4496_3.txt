I saw The Greek Tycoon when it first came out in 1978. I found it extremely boring. I thought it wasn't better than a travelogue if not for one thing: for the first time in my life I understood why it would be nice to be rich. I saw the landscapes descend from the yacht of Aristotle Onassis and have opened my first look at the lifestyle of the rich and famous. To paraphrase Martha Stewart: it was a good thing. Funny, I don't remember the sex scene. I hadn't seen the movie since it was on the big screen and this time I found the love session with the memorable beloved. Maybe because I was younger and single then, it wasn't a big deal.
