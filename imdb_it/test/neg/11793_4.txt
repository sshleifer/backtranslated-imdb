I understand why people hate this movie. And, I hated the Blair Witch Project, so go figure it out? This is how staged how you do it and yes insults your intelligence trying to make it look real. I really liked the plot of Madame Lalaurie even though it is more than likely made-up. But, the main reason why I like this film, it's false or not when the ghosts start attacking them and kidnap them, every time I get the chills and I have to look behind me because it seems like there's something in there. I know it's my imagination, but hey more than half of the drivel that is horror in theaters and DVDs today doesn't give me goose bumps, so this makes this creepy delight. Not for everyone, as the skeptics will hate it and not for the cheetahs as with a PG-13 evaluation there is no blood. And the females are very annoying! I hope that the ghosts can take them off and experience them before it is all said and done. ** outside *****.
