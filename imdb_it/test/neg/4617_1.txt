One of the scariest movies I've ever seen was Carrie (the first one!). Now, as with other films, they completely ruined the Carrie franchise with The Rage: Carrie 2. From the beginning, the film limps like a geriatic in a run-down van. There are almost no scares and this film is chock-full of all the various high school stereotypes (namely football jock, melancholy gym leader, followers and, of course, the black nailpolish he wears) Another sad thing about this show is that you know what will happen when you see the headlines. Of course, of course, the girl gets humiliated and then turns into a crazy psychic killer ... yawn ... <br /> <br /> I've been there. Done. <br /> <br /> Even the actors seem forced to make this film. Emily Bergl is as scary as a cabbage doll while Jack London ... let's say I didn't pay to see the wooden deed. Apart from the actors, flasbacks are more to irritate than to connect with the first film. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, If you can convey objects like Carrie, then God's love will shine out of yourself that theater ......
