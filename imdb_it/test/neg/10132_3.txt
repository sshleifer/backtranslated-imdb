Natalie Wood plays Courtney Patterson, a disabled singer-songwriter who tries to avoid being a victim due to involvement in her first love story, with her partner Marcus Simon, played tepidly by Wood's husband, Robert Wagner. The film is heavily cut, but most of the remaining scenes show a very weak hand of the director that allows Wagner to consistently somnambulate, devastating a solid and nuanced performance by Wood, which among other things offers a nice soprano. The script is a bit trivial but the persistent nature of Wagner's dramatic lack is unfortunately in place, given that he was given a free hand to impose his desperate gaze on Wood, which must be discouraging for an actress. The progression of their relationship is presented incorrectly and this, together with an uncertain editing, leads the viewer to be less sure of what is transpiring, the motivation is almost completely ignored in writing. Although largely not indifferent, cinematography shines during a brief scene in which Wood is placed in a patio and, following the sound of a closing door, remains in the center while the camera's eye constantly moves away demonstrating its impotence and fragility. A more controlled direction would have allowed the artists, even Wagner, to limp, to climb their acting following the lines of an involving relationship; as has been released, there is, for the most part, an immense lack of commitment.
