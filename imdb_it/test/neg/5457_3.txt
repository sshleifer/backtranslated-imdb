The television director uses astral projection to kill people who take the form of the blue man. <br /> <br /> A little engaging and shocking horror movie that just stands there before your eyes and makes you wonder why you're looking at it. I sat down until the end of the film and I can't really give you more than a superficial account of what the movie was, because I kept finding my attention diverted from other things. <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend it. I think my feelings are best summarized by the fact that I paid a dollar for the DVD as a double feature and I feel a bit robbed.
