I want so much to believe that the quoted quotation (in particular, the translation of the subtitle in English), which was actually written, not pronounced, in a refusal letter sent by a publisher to the protagonist, was intended as self-referential in a language-in - gentle manner. But if so, the director Leos Carax apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film. They are all so terribly serious in their portraits that I have to conclude that Carax actually takes itself seriously here, or has so much disdain for everyone, especially the public, that they can't be bothered by anyone making the joke. <br /> <br /> Some authors are able to get away with producing oblique and bizarre films because they do so with the personal slender and unique style (for example, David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky). Others use a more subtle approach while continuing to weave surreal elements into the plot of the story (for example, Krzysztof Kieslowski and later more bizarre works by David Cronenberg). In Pola X, Carax throws a disjointed mess to the viewer and then dares to find fault. Well, here it is: the rhythm is irregular and unstable, in particular, continuity often fails; superfluous characters abound (eg, the mother and gypsy child); most performances are exaggerated; lighting is often poor, particularly in the often discussed sex scene; unrelated scenes are inserted into the film without a visible reason; and the list goes on. <br /> <br /> To be completely negative, it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions. I liked the musical score, even the cacophonous industrial-techno music played in the sprawling, abandoned complex, in which the main characters retire in the second part of the film (perhaps a reference to Andy Warhol's "factory" of the 1960s ?). Much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful, an obvious attempt to contrast the dirty settings of the city. And, even in the Middle Ages, Cathering Deneuve shows that he still has "it". His performance was also the only one among the main characters not to sink into the bathos. <br /> <br /> There was a time before when I consider more charitable films like "Pola X". Experimentation is admirable, even when the experiment does not work. But Carax feels nothing new here; the film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from countless previous films, and after several decades of watching the film and literally thousands of films later, I simply don't have the patience for this type of tripe, not original, poorly modeled. At this early moment in the 21st century, he asked himself: With the exception of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, are there * any * director in France who knows how to make a film that can be seen? Rating: 3/10.
