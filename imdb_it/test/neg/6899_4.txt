This film seemed to have been assembled very quickly both in the plot and in the graphics. My two daughters were ready to go 30 minutes before the end of the film, which rarely happens when we go to the movies. This was a Nickelodeon production and it would have been better if they had published it on t.v. railway station. The animation itself in some parts was o.k. but the plot was horrible. A classic story about a child trying to meet a father's expectations is used in many children's films, but animation or graphics must be really good to attract children's attention. This was not the case with this film. There were also uncomfortable elements between the male protagonist and the female protagonist that the plot could have done without.
