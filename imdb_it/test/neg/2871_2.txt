I didn't think Haggard was the funniest movie of all time, I really like CKY and Viva La Bam. I think a lot of things were really stupid and had no plot to be a movie. I highly recommend not paying a lot of money for this movie, but everyone who likes the bam alive, CKY or Jack Ass should see it. I loved many parts of the film and then there were parts that should have been cut. I think Jonny Knoxville should have acted in the film because he's a much better actor than most of Haggard's people and he could probably have made this movie a lot more fun. I think Ryan Dunn was probably the best actor and he should have done more bam skating.
