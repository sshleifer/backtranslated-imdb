There is no doubt that the Kokoda Trail portrays a truly exceptional event in Australian military history, the brave defense of Australia against the cruel Japanese barbarian army. This film does not take into account the history of the "Fuzzy Wuzzy's" natives or of New Guinea that the Australians used to help them carry out military operations. The film also fails to provide a credible account of the Australian soldier and his behavior in this event. It's more like a misinformed contemporary vision of how it was. <br /> <br /> Once again the Australian film industry has failed to give this important chapter in the history of Australia the film it deserved. This is the worst film with arbitrary cinematography, bad script and dialogue, without character development and jungle war scenes. <br /> <br /> It fails to instill in the public in any meaningful perspective except that the Japanese Army was ruthless and cruel murderers of a poorly equipped and ill-trained group of Australians fighting in a jungle. <br /> <br /> The film failed as most Australian films do to attract a significant Australian audience, in fact they remained in droves. <br /> <br /> I have no intention of joining the usual parochial garbage to say its great because it is an Australian film. I say or do a great job or leave it to someone who knows how. This government-funded film is just another failure of rich and wealthy Australian children. <br /> <br /> I'm giving him zero stars because it's an insult to the descendants of these truly great Australians and their enormous sacrifice. What a shame to waste and disrespect and I know this review will cause more negativity from the Movie Show crew and most reviewers, but I have the right to my opinion and that's what Australians fought for OUR FREEDOM and which includes freedom of speech and the right to express an opinion.
