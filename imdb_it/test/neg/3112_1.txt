The story as a whole, although quite graphic, is actually decent and reasonably interesting to readers. However, the film was absolutely terrible. The story was good, but the acting was terrible. I was crying all the time because I knew I could never recover my time. Don't see this movie. If you do, bring a gun with a bullet and some bullets if you go with friends. I am sorry for all those who have had something to do with this movie. I am also sorry for all those who have had to watch the film. Avoid this movie at all costs and if your mother forces you to watch, kill her. Ha ha ha ha ha! To see! I'm a psychopath now !!!! IKWTCBS has turned me into a psychopath !!!!
