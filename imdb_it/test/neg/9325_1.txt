Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen! "The Beginning" was not the best, but better than this. This is not a good way to bring the original film. It is simply simply terrible! The CGI hyenas were so fake in both films! Why not use real animals? I liked the old Sinbad movies better than that. I was really disappointed! The only positive thing I can say about this film waste is the cinematography and the clothes that really captured that era well. I understand why this film was redone as "The Beginning". It's just so bad, in my opinion. where does the money to be wasted in this way come from? Give me a multi-million dollar budget and I'll show you how it should be done!
