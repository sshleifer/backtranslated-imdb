Following his role in the good captain SEVEN THIEVES (1960) - which I saw several years ago - Edward G. Robinson seemed to be stuck playing old sorts of criminal minds (apart from the strange juicy role of THE CINCINNATI KID [1965]) . Previously I had witnessed the "Euro-Cult" effort GRAND SLAM (1967) and, apart from that, I still have two similar titles from Italy to check - one of which was directed by the future goremeister Lucio Fulci! However, this is the type of international production - with American and Italian actors and a British director - that was prevalent in the 1960s; it's harmless and casual in itself, but hardly memorable and far too long - especially because to get funding for the heavy equipment needed for robbery (like a tank and an airplane!), the gang involved must pull a variety first. <br /> <br /> The band, of course, is an incompetent lot led by an American (Robert Wagner) and his little girl (Raquel Welch) - the others are a "pacifist" black man, a perpetually hungry Italian and a tiny English. They try to persuade an ex-gangster (Vittorio De Sica) to hand over his fortune to them, except that he is destitute ... but, under the auspices of "Professor" Robinson, he proposes instead a platinum 5 million dollar caper! Needless to say, the gang members do not trust each other (Wagner orders Welch to seduce De Sica in order to get the name of their fence in Morocco - where they must retire after the robbery), or not to do the work (commissioned to hold a restaurant, the Italian cannot resist sitting down at the table and ordering a multi-course meal for himself!). Funny, in the face of such failures, De Sica tries to show them how they did it in the old days - however, apparently holding a gas station, it turns out that the owner is a grandson of his and simply asked to borrow some money! <br /> <br /> The central robbery sequence is typically elaborate: while the band, including Welch, "takes" the train carrying the platinum, Wagner kidnaps the pilot Victor Spinetti and his plane. When the work is finished, he intends to completely double De Sica - but neither his partners nor Welch herself are willing to go ahead with this, so he is forced to give up. Coming from the moment the crime didn't pay, the band tries to lose all their storage in mid-air when the doors of the plane's anus bomb are accidentally opened ...
