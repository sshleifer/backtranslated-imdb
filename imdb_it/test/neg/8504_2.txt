I give this 2-star movie purely because of its slightly liberal plot. Without going into too much detail. <br /> <br /> The acting in this film is terrible. Really terrible - wooden, shallow. <br /> <br /> Graffiti on display are weak, so damn weak that I can only wonder why they took the trouble to use graffiti artists. It was evident in the spraying scenes that other people had gotten to do the "work". They could also let the actors paint the picture and save a few cents. <br /> <br /> I would avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the children's film was something I heard on my iPod, it will take some time before I can go back there for fear that this movie will come back to my mind. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. Unless you think of yourself "Wow, I haven't seen a really great movie for a while ..."
