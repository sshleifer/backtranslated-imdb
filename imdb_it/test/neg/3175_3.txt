for me, this is not a good television program, animated or not. However, it is annoying to the nth degree. There are some reasons for this, in a non-particular order. First, the introduction of one of the most useless and annoying characters of all time, Batmite. This character has no purpose for the show, whatever may be considered as a comic relief, but it does not work that way. Above, the Joker.i thought that it was really ridiculous to have his character unleashed with that ridiculous laugh after almost every sentence. It allows for repetition. This gets old really fast ... I don't think he had the right actor to give the voice to the character.it simply doesn't sound at all like the joker should very well, they made Robin look like a real idiot. In addition to these problems, the show is not so bad. but these are problems big enough to drastically lower the probability factor. For me, "The new adventures of Batman" is a 3/10, at the most.
