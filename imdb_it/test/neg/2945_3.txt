TWINS EFFECT is a poor film in many respects. The only positive element is that it is not taken seriously. In addition to this, this is not really a movie, but rather a merchandising tool for the two movie stars, popular pop stars in their native Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> The film itself is poorly constructed and played. The director offers some silly martial arts, which is strange since the action director (and presumed co-director) is Donnie Yen. Like many Hong Kong films aimed at teen audiences, most "actor" fans like twins (the two main characters in this movie) and Ekin Cheng, there's so much bad music to push the public to believe that certain scenes are funny, smart, etc. <br /> <br /> The final conclusion: it's all for nothing. Even as a fan of Hong Kong films, this is a poor film. Not funny enough, not serious enough, and just generally too much "bubble gum fake" for his own good. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> (Go to http://www.nixflix.com for a more in-depth review of this film and other foreign films)
