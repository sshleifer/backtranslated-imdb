I love B movies, but I like to be aware from the start that I'm looking at one. I can't believe anyone could ruin a movie about aliens and such bad predators. <br /> <br /> Aliens and Predator are fantastic. This movie made a great joke. The creators did not take this film seriously. I am deeply disappointed with the way Strauss jerk handled this movie. They made a joke of fantastic characters. It is as if they were trying to be serious in the beginning, then their writers got tall and gave up. Almost nothing was continuous, the main characters were horrible and NOT Aliens or Predators. I'm so ridiculously sad that nobody takes Alien and Predators seriously. These characters are icons of American pop culture and the creators of this film showed no respect for the original films. They should not be allowed to collect the names of previous films and should be ashamed of themselves
