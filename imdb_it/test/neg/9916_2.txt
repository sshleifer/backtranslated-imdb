I hope Matt Dorff's original script for this has been much better (there are signs of it - a dialogue that should happen well before the big f / x scenes (introducing the characters) that would have made a lot of sense before, are blocked later in time-line, perhaps the original script was for a longer execution time, but maybe not - in any case, this stinks. Each character is not interesting, and * everyone * talks about exposing passages as if they were speaking the word of god. characters that are entirely exposed - Dianne Wiest's "Secretary Abbot" is simply horrible, explaining things to his assistant (and incidentally us), in endless speeches that no one would ever tell anyone, ever, in real life (when she is not explaining things to her assistant that she already knows, her assistant explains things to her that you already know. There are characters that are completely one-dimensional: the bad man of her electric company, the pilot who will NEVER share her life with her staff and focus on her work. The superhero-power super-strategist "super-strategist" who can crash <br /> <br /> * in Chicago (including telephones) - and then gives the oh-no-that-I-did-speech (but not do you leave a back door?). The crusader journalist who abandons his principles at the drop of a hat? The supervisor of the power company shift who abdicates his post in the midst of the worst Chicago crisis after the fire - without consequences? Hospitals abandoned by doctors and nurses during the crisis (I'm not kidding, it's in the film). <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and it is full of clich√©s on the morality of Hollywood - generally women are good, men are evil, unless it is influenced by a woman (the last one is punk with the gun - deprived of the influence of a woman, literally goes crazy); a devilish and stupid act (like what the reporter did with hacker-bozo) is fine, as long as you mean "good". The wicked die, the evil capitalists die as horribly as possible, all the others live (well, except for Randy Quaid). And did I hear someone say that nuclear power plants had to shut down because there was no electricity to run security systems (think about that)? <br /> <br /> There is a ray of sunshine (if you forgive the expression) - Randy Quaid basically plays his "Independence Day" character (you know - "Hi guys - I'm baaaack!") - this time as a storm hunter with an infinite range SUV batteries and superdooper for his video cameras. However, they kill him - mostly, it seems, so the public will appreciate that tornadoes are pretty dangerous things (a bit superficial, that.) <br /> <br /> Give this a ride.
