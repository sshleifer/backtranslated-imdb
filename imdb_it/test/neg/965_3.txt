Sometimes Hallmark can do it well - like the 10th kingdom - but many of their fancy films lurch, and this falls into the latter category. The version I saw may have been cut (a demon [?] Shown in the trailer and the advertising stills did not appear), but everything that made the film shorter can only be a blessing. <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILERS IF YOU ARE NOT UNFORGETTABLE WITH THE ORIGINAL FAIRY TALE: <br /> <br /> However, the film updates the story at the beginning of the 20th century (?), and makes it Gerda and Kay (here called Kai - being a Lexx fan, I kept expecting her to say "The dead don't solve puzzles") of 18 years. Following is the basic story of Hans Christian Andersen: the boy takes a piece of ice in his eyes, gets annoyed, is taken away by the Snow Queen to solve a riddle in his palace and Gerda goes looking for him, having various adventures coming. <br /> <br /> Since the two main characters are older than the original, a lot of time is spent putting them together and "in love". Unfortunately, I was never convinced that they were particularly in love, and certainly not in love enough to make sense of Gerda's search. When the main plot begins, the rhythm of the film is slowed down. Alas, when Gerda starts her search for Kai, she only manages to take the pace for a pleasant walk. <br /> <br /> There are some strange additions to the story that seem to go nowhere. At the beginning of the film the Snow Queen kills Gerda's mother, but no explanation is given. A polar bear that lives in the building of the Snow Queen is more than it seems (although this is probably because the producers realized that the bear's feelings towards the Snow Queen would be OK in a Fairy tale, but not in a modern film). Again, this is never explained. Furthermore, it suggests that the Snow Queen has an erotic desire for Kai, but she never followed it. The script is also full of anachronisms that distract you from the mood of fairy tales. <br /> <br /> The production seems good, even if there are penny-penny proofs: the building of the Queen of the Snows is the hotel where Gerda and Kai lived covered in ice. The three main characters are interpreted with varying degrees of success: Kai blandly comes across as Gerda at the beginning, but once she goes in search of Kai, she meets her with her. Bridget Fonda looks as big as the Snow Queen, but appears to be in a movie unlike any other. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the film is unsatisfactory. It looks good, but drags and lacks magic.
