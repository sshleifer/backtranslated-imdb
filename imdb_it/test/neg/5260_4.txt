Drug racer Archie Moses introduces his friend Rock Keats to his boss, drug boss Frank Colton. Unknown to Moses, Keats is actually an undercover police officer. During the bust of Colton's factory, Moses accidentally shoots Keats to the head. He survives the wound and then arrests Moses. By dodging the murderers hired by Colton, the duo must overcome their mutual hatred to survive. Adam Sandler's films are usually a bargain not to be missed, with his comedies beloved by his fans or hated by everyone. This is not as stupid as his other films, but he cannot yet overcome a lazy script. The direction is incredibly irregular, with fast-paced action sequences that leave room for slow comic exchanges between Sandler and Damon Wayans. Some of the action scenes ?? fly a plane without engines, a car chase at night through a forest ?? they are quite absurdly invented. Acting is the standard for this genre, with Sandler and Wayans making a good match. In short, the film is stupid but fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Rating: C + Review by M. K. Geist
