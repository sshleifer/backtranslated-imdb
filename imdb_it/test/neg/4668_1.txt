First of all. I don't look down on Americans. I know many people who are smart people from the United States. But this movie is so terrible, that I just had to comment on it. <br /> <br /> First of all ... The films are mostly far from the truth. This film is no exception. Many scenes are so incredibly false. For example the departure of the 2 space ships. You see them falling from full tanks in space. A short distance from each other. Do you remember what caused the space shuttle explosion in the past? Just a showy part that came out. Here it is common to abandon fuel tanks that are large if not larger than the entire ship. Which idiot would let two spaceships lift and do it at the same time ??? The second is that the Russian station is a piece of (s) shit. I hate to bring you this, but today the astronauts go to Russia. Since their equipment is much more reliable than NASA. The Space Shuttle is retired. And NASA only uses it to pay the bills. And there is no better alternative for this. And the list of whoppers goes on forever. This is truly an insult to people who take space travel seriously. And I know half of these guys. But the most annoying part (read: the whole film) is the shit of propaganda and patriot with whom you suffer. MY GOD !!!! I thought I was watching a CNN business ad for an hour. The actors solve their small problems by shooting each other, giving the middle finger to everyone they come face to face with, starting fights, ignoring the police, etc. Etc. But when it comes to their love for their country and sacrificing their lives, does everyone suddenly line up to commit suicide for this (bomb detonator) ?? Perhaps I lack the feeling of being a true "patriot", who can sing the national anthem backwards in Swahili. While running with George Bush behind the wheel of a golf cart, driving in a circle until the battery is empty. But this film was too much for me for me too. And when I finally got the flag pole and the fabric of the American flag out of my hiney. I realized that I was happy that this film was finally finished. I don't know why so many good actors participated in this narrow, stereotyped propaganda film. But I pity them. This is a country where you can get away with money or power. Until "Uncle Sam" thinks you're a good patriot. Where everyone is happy until another country has been devastated, nobody cares.
