weird.this is a TV movie, but the evaluation on the box says it is rated R. There is nothing in the film that would qualify remotely for an R rating apart from that, however, the film is very slow and useless. the idea was good, but nothing was done with the plot. It was not developed. It's a bit creepy, and acting is actually pretty good, better than the movie deserves. I don't see myself looking at it again any time soon, if there have been other films dealing with the same concept that are made better than this. I haven't seen too many Wes Craven Films, so I can't really compare it to any of his others. Like this movie itself however, I think it's poorly designed and poorly executed. For me, I can't give Chiller a rating above 3/10
