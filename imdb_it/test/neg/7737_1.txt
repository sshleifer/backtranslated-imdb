As a native Chinese, I cannot accept this kind of idea that some people have to die for a "better world". I said "better world" because it is a lie that the Chinese have been indoctrinated for thousands of years! <br /> <br /> I believe that most Westerners may not know Qin Shihuang (meaning the first emperor), the king in this film is the most famous tyrant in ancient China. The Tianxia (the Chinese word was pronounced by the king, means "the earth and the people") pronounced by its mouth is totally false. Since then, one by one, all the kings of ancient China spoke the same thing, but very few have done what they said. <br /> <br /> Another fact is that the empire of Qin Shihuang lasted only about twenty years before it was destroyed by the people. <br /> <br /> Well, I like the beautiful scenes in this movie, but it can't make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant.
