THE QUICKIE (1 outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> A rather poor movie ... a hill-old story about a high-ranking gangster who wants to quit, passing his empire to his incapacitated son. Of course, it will not be easy for someone in that line or for work to simply stop ... so a contract is put out in his life. After organizing a big party an exterminator (Jennifer Jason Leigh, which I imagine is * ever * going to act in anything other than TV movies or low-budget direct-to-video junk ever) is called on stage. Our "hero" takes a step towards her ... offering his big money for a "quickie" ... he refuses his offer, even if he needs money ... but ends up spending the night anyway ... also after brutally harassed by the overzealous son who thinks she was sent to kill her father. Ugh. The story continues and continues ... you can see every "turn" and "turn" coming a mile away. The strange soundtrack of a band called "The Tiger Lillies" will drive most people crazy ... but I thought there was a kind of cool track towards the end. Or maybe I was just excited because I could say that the film was almost finished? Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer ... what the hell happened to you?
