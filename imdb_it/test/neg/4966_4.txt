I was only cautiously enthusiastic when I rented "All the boys love Mandy Lane", how did I immediately remember to have listened and read a wide variety of opinions ?? both positive and negative ?? in the short period of time between his short film release and the distribution to the video store shelves. Presumably this was the most brilliant and refreshing new horror film of recent years, with non-stereotyped teenage characters and unpredictable twists and turns for a change. Okay, the basic concept may perhaps seem quite innovative, but inevitably the script quickly returns to the same old and irritating slasher clich√©s, and once that point is passed even the elegant stylistic brands cannot save the film from terrible mediocrity. The opening sequences are truly terrifying and literally bathe in a melancholy and melancholic environment, which makes it even more painful to watch the film plunge into the "ordinary" level of a rudimentary film. After the sublime introduction, show a drunk guy a mistake in treading his leap from a roof to impress titled beauty, "All the Boys Love Mandy Lane" turns out to be just another textbook and an uninspired horror on a group of idiotic boys stoned and horny on a secluded ranch before being killed by an unidentified maniac. The whole pretentious set-up of the film collapses faster than a ramshackle house of cards: we never have an adequate explanation why Mandy herself behaves so frigid and haughty towards all her admirers (why has she grown an orphan, perhaps? Oh, boo-hoo), do the boys show soon enough that they would be satisfied with sex with any casual child and not exclusively with the "divine" Mandy and the final twist? even if undeniably unconventional ?? it is simply senseless. The central part of it is rather boring and doesn't even offer any really horrible excitement (pump-shot killings? Please!) Or genuine rancid friability. My generous 4 out of 10 rating goes entirely to the gritty and disturbing cinematic style of the 70s (with faded colors, bizarre but beautiful photographic images ??) and the surprisingly wonderful soundtrack. Director Jonathan Levine opted for Bobby Vinton's classic song "Sealed with a Kiss" to play during the trailer and the end credits, while initially I was convinced that the film would inevitably present Barry Manilow's famous love song "Mandy ".
