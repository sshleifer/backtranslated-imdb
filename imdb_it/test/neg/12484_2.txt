Yes, what did I expect? I thought this would be a film about young adults at their turning point in life, something like "Sonnenallee" or "American Pie", which I liked very much. I wanted to see a funny film, perhaps with an ironic look at the idyllic city of Wuerzburg. And what did I get? <br /> <br /> Attention, spoilers ahead! <br /> <br /> This film begins with a long dialogue that gives you a good hint about what will inevitably follow: longer dialogues. Sometimes I thought that Moritz Bleibtreu could forget his text and try to hide that fact by improvising and simply repeating what he was saying earlier. But since I think of Bleibtreu as one of the best German actors, I think this effect was really wanted. I think the author wanted to show how boring it can be to talk to close friends, especially when they are stoned. But really, I don't need cinema to get bored by the chatter of stone friends. Boring dialogues are most of this film. <br /> <br /> But that's OK, that's one thing. I can do it, I've seen good films with abominable dialogues, just think of Schwarzenegger's life work. But the next thing is that the characters are cheap and flat and that the plot is as predictable as nothing. Just an example (SPOILER !!): Why, do you think, does someone take a garden hose from his hemp plants deep in the forest? To water them? Of course not, you don't usually find water pipes in the forests, do you? The only reason there is this water pipe is that a hunter who comes to see me while the two protagonists are collecting their drug can be drugged, abused and finally filled with three bottles of Jaegermeister. I really hated this scene because it's really violent. Usually, I don't care about violence in movies - slapstick comedies are full of them. But in that kind of comedy there's a silent agreement between the film and you that people don't get hurt if they fall into their faces or are beaten up with chairs or something. But if this happens in a film that is otherwise quite realistic, even slapstick scenes seem real. In this particular scene in "Lammbock" I really thought that this hunter should be seriously injured, if not dead - the final scene really invoked the impression that he is left to die there, totally filled with more alcohol than anyone could handle. And the protagonists go away. It would have been otherwise if the author had consistently followed a style; the scene could have been pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Talking about being consistent - that's what I missed most about this movie. The entire film seems to be a list of small episodes that came to the author's mind. Things happen for no apparent reason - yes, I know, it's life, but it's not cinema, because cinema is destined to tell a story, not to show boring episodes without any meaning. I found myself asking "Where is the point?" all time. The characters in addition to the main ones are not elaborate, you never know why the protagonist's sister wants to sleep with her best friend Kai, in fact, she tells you but I could not buy it, for nothing. I think she was there to give Kai the opportunity to play this childish AIDS test design, which you've surely seen thousands of times before, and especially better. The girlfriend of the protagonist you meet once, then leaves Germany (the one you don't even see and the boy doesn't seem to care) and in the end he is mentioned in a sentence that he met someone else in America and shares with the protagonist. It seemed to me that the author wanted to tie up a few things. Actually no, you never really understood what's wrong with studying law, being Dad's son (Dad fixes everything in the end and serves coffee in the middle of the night, which I think made him one of the characters nicer throughout the film) and in the beautiful city of Wuerzburg. Even dinner with Daddy's friend, who perhaps wanted to show how horrible it was to meet dad's expectations, seemed flat, just another nice dinner with family friends (except for the boy's trip later, but I think showing that eating drugs before dining with parents is not healthy was not the point of this scene, if there was anyone. I have experienced much worse dinners in my life than this and I have still finished my exams. I could not understand a single character in the whole film, it seemed simply flat and implausible. <br /> <br /> All this has made it a film not really good, but not one of those that I wouldn't watch on television anymore. He really had some good scenes (most of them weren't new, though, like the one with nice cops), some were really funny, some dialogues were good, and I like Bleibtreu's work, even though he repeated his well known stereotypes again this time. Not good, not abominable, that's what I thought after the film was finished. <br /> <br /> But then this incest scene came and I found it really repulsive. Incest is simply not fun. I don't even know if this was meant to be fun, some people in the audience laughed, so it could have been understood that way. This scene ruined the whole film for me, I could no longer feel sympathy for the protagonist - I can't feel sympathy for anyone who is a helpless person, for me, this is rape and rape is not fun. So it could have been a hint of drama or so, but incest is never mentioned again (although we thought this might have been one of the reasons why the protagonist would have left Germany in the end, but as never mentioned by new, we don't do it "I know.), it's even completely useless. I almost expected the sister to get pregnant in the end, which would only add the final touch to this story without taste, but not even this final clichÃ© came true "As in this film, nothing has really been solved or thought out. It's not very funny, it's not really a drama, it's not a road movie to La Tarantino in spite of desperate evidence of violence, it's definitely not fun. br /> <br /> Skip this movie, look at "Final Fantasy", this is also bad, but at least with beautiful images and not so tasteless.
