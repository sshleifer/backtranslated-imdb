I just lost my Saturday night watching this shit! I saw the names of Chris Noth (Mr. Big, of "Sex & the City"), Robert Patrick (of "X-Files"), the decadent Elliot Gould, Colm Meaney and Mercedes Ruehl on the merit; a very reasonable nominal vote (5.6); and many good reviews in IMDb. To my total surprise, the film is horrible: the characters are poorly constructed; the story tries to be fun, but it's totally silly; the character of Mercedes Ruehl is incredibly stupid for a Princeton professor. So, I decided to investigate the credibility of good reviews, and found that most of them are done by IMDb Users with only reviews, then relatives or friends of the cast and crew, or people hired to promote this junk. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sem Retorno" ("Without Return")
