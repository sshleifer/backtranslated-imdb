Although sometimes it can be VERY boring, this film is not so bad. The acting is pretty well done, if stereotyped, and the production values ​​are quite high considering some of the science fiction films that would come later in the decade. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem with this film are some of the very obsolete features in it. There is the boy from Texas, the "professional" scientist, and the worst of all the women scientists who finally realize his femininity. For a film that tries to make a statement about humanity, it loses some of its impact by reducing its characters through sexist stereotypes.
