I'm still trying to figure out what the goal of this film is: 1) If you show how stupid, disorganized, unprofessional and arrogant the police are (I could certainly add various adjectives here, but I think my point about this is clear). 2) If you show how a twisted scammer who doesn't know what he wants from himself can create chaos. 3) Does it show if a persistent detective will solve a case simply by asking the criminal the same stupid question over and over again until the criminal answers? 4) Or was it just to show that every 90 minutes of filmed material can still be called a movie ?? <br /> <br /> This was one of those films, which in a sense - didn't disappoint me. From the first 10 minutes I realized that this film will not be nominated for the best prize film, and surprisingly ?? this has been constant all the time. Was it stupid enough to be worth the wait to see how stupidly it will continue and end? and I wasn't disappointed there either. <br /> <br /> Was it a lifetime? YUP. What raises your question ?? WHY I WATCHED IT FOR EVERYTHING? Well, I was trying to fall asleep, and I thought this was a great candidate for this, but unfortunately I drank too much coffee before ??
