The trailer for this film promised a new twist to the zombie genre: set in the Old West. Except it's not the real old West, of course. It is a kind of Future West, in a world in which some apocalypse has, as is known, the apocalypse, killed people and subsequently transformed into zombies. It's zombie virus time again, folks, and you know what that means? Get bitten and become one of them. <br /> <br /> So, in this dusty and deadly world comes a hero. He is a bounty hunter, he is paid to take care of the zombies. It is not exactly clear who is providing the funds, but it appears that a small zombie hunting industry has emerged. But, as the trailer tells us, there is a problem. The zombies are running out. The only way to continue making money is to infect new cities and cities with the virus. <br /> <br /> I think it's not a bad idea for a movie. But unfortunately it takes a lot more than a good idea and a crowd of people prancing windows to make a good zombie movie. What we actually get is a Clint Eastwood clone (the actor is also called Clint, for shouting at the top of his lungs) and his "hilarious" helper, who tries to catch the zombies while following some still living villains to get a big reward. The entire subplot on the infection of other cities is mentioned only in passing, in the middle of the film. Instead, there are a lot of clichés about Western movies, a terrible zombie trick and some bad world-class acting. Really bad. The guy who wouldn't even be able to go to Hollyoaks. Both the hero and the villain tread the cigars, the jokes are thrown, people are bitten. While the film comes to a conclusion, the only thing worth wondering is whether it will end up with the cliché of the hero of being the only man alive, having killed what he loves, or the cliché of him turning into one zombies in the final frame. (It's the first one, anyway) This film was written and directed by Gerald Nott. It's the only thing he did and hopefully his last. At the beginning of the film there is a caption which reads "Nott Entertainment". At least they had a right thing.
