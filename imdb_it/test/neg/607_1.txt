I can't help but be completely annoyed by this sitcom. It is as if they hadn't even bothered to try good comedy, just take back third-level jokes and hope that it remains. The worst of all this is that it's all so uninteresting and meaningless. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the man Kevin James has a smile "I'm so funny" that smiles on his face that would be tolerable if only he had once been delivered into the comedy department, which he didn't ago, he just stands there doing nothing like a big child not funny. Which brings me to the relationship between the Heffernans - easily the most insincere and poor representation of a married couple in any TV program, the really annoying headache Remini spends the entire show as if it were a violent task to even be close to her husband . Jerry Stiller, who jerks the few laughs of the show, is doing a 100% repetition of his role as Frank Costanza to Seinfeld only this time his suggestions especially trample the water due to the central duo's inability to recognize a joke even though he was flying from them. The episodes drift into a stream of nothing, their jobs add nothing and their interaction is even worse. <br /> <br /> This is not even a waste of talent, there is no talent here, this is a creative without laughing desert.
