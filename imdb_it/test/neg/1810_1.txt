Taylor Deemer Mrs. Drake 10 PIB B4 English 31 March 2010 <br /> <br /> A Shot in the Dark <br /> <br /> It's hard to get past the movie Heart of Darkness because it's incredibly exciting. The book on which this film is based has little action to do. So the thought of turning it into a movie still seems like a totally out of the way idea, basically guaranteeing failure. <br /> <br /> Much of the book is the mental journey of a young sailor named Marlow in a job through the many darkness of the Congo and the people as a whole ?? I feel like the writer massively failed to capture the essence of Marlow's travels. He has totally lost the biggest problem of light against darkness. This is the main point of the book and when that does not translate into the film, all that remains is 100 minutes of boredom and monotony. <br /> <br /> That being the case, the question arises, why would anyone make a movie of it? You could therefore ask an even better question, who would want to watch it? It is absolutely a task to look at. If he hadn't contributed to a vote in my English course, I never thought I'd watch the movie. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Heart of Darkness is stripped of all its insights and meanings when taken from the pages of the book. The novel is a torture to read up to the last twenty pages or so, but the second thought is that it is a fairly decent book. The film is like a shot in the dark with no chance of hitting the target. <br /> <br /> How can a book about mental processes and the realizations of darkness be portrayed in a physical and visual sense? It seems to me impossible to show thoughts precisely. Furthermore, it seems to me that the time difference between the book and the film creates important points that do not seem to add up at all. The novel Heart of Darkness was published in 1902, while the film version of Heart of Darkness is from 1993. The 91 years between the two could be a reason behind the apparently different terrains. The novel seems to have much harsher conditions, and the film does not represent the prehistoric feeling of the Congo. The Congo, in the film, seems just another place, not the dark and inhuman place that the book paints of this setting. It seems to me that this removes another important element that really contributes to the story. <br /> <br /> With two of the greatest aspects of the plot missing in the film, the little of decency that is in the book Heart of Darkness is gone. When the controversy between light and darkness is the biggest theme, not including it in the film, does it seem that the whole film will be incredibly useless ?? and so it is. It's boring, not very exciting and a big waste of time. There is no reason to look at it. The book is deprived of any meaning it has. If necessary, for some reason, read the book. Avoid the movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> Cast and Marlow credits: Tim Roth Kurtz: John Malkovich Russian: Morten Faldaas The Intended: Phoebe Nicholls <br /> <br /> Directed by: Nicolas Roeg Written by Benedict Fitzgerald, based on the novel by Joseph Conrad Duration: 100 minutes Vote PG 13 (a bit of sexuality and language)
