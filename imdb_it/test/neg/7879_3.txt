Another French film with absurdity. Baise-Moi (F * ck Me) tells the story of two young women coming together to kill and f * ck. One of them is a porn star who runs away from her community after being raped and killed by her boyfriend. The second is a prostitute who kills her roommate and sees her boyfriend being killed to death. After those incidents that occur in a subway station (both missing the last train), then it all starts. They find a limit and get very close. They abuse men sexually, take drugs, drive around the country and have sex. This is all about Baise-Moi. We can see that they have no mercy for their victims. They also killed a woman for her money. Both actresses are real pornstars in France who influence the film in two different ways. They seem so at ease in the sex scenes, however, they can't make the whole movie worthy of attention since, for me, the film doesn't require any further acting skills. It's a version of Thelma and Louise on another level. I could advise you on a lot of things to do instead of looking at Baise-Moi. So, worry about watching if you want to see a useless and perverse movie. * outside *****
