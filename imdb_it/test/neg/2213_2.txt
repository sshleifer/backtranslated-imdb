It's amazing to think that this film came out just a year before Star Wars, but it looks like a million years behind it with sophistication and special effects. In reality, the art direction and set design (beautiful Victorian spaceship) are not bad; are the monsters costumes that are the most laughable, similar to the monsters of the "boy in a rubber suit" of the TV show of LOST IN SPACE. The evil caveman trick reminded me of some of the TWILIGHT ZONE replicas. <br /> <br /> The script is written and, outside of the comic relief of Peter Cushing, the acting is also quite miserable. This film is only recommended if you really like the kitschy bad guys. And the music ... hey! A horrible 70s experiment with synthesizers that doesn't fit the time period of the film and that sounds like someone wandering around with a Minimoog and a 2-track tape machine.
