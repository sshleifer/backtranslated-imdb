Everyone knows that late-night movies are not contenders for the Oscar. Beautiful. I mean, I'll admit that I was a bit tipsy and bored and thought I'd get some skin-a-max. It's pretty ugly when TV channel information teases the movie in the description. He even gave him half a star. To be honest, I sat down to throw everything because the man was awful. I couldn't stop laughing. I mean the words that come out of these people's mouths and how they were trying to be serious. Most of the time I think people on the screen are trying to do their best not to laugh. In fact, I think they made people laugh in a scene. However the film made no sense. It was like that episode of Sopranos with the fat gay man. Only the sopranos is a great show. But it was terrible, I mean, no nudity, just sex scenes from the 90s. You know the type who uses shadows and silhouettes instead of meat. I gave him two reasons why this movie is a good drinking game. I mean with all the cheese, it helps to bring out the wine. If it's late at night, and all that's on TV is this and that Tony Little guy and his exercise bike, then I suggest Tony Little.
