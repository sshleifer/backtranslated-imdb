One of the first things I noticed that allowed this culture to stand out from the rest was the Sun trail. An aerial shot is used to show Sun that has bloomed with kisses from a sea of ​​women. I believed that this was a comment on the closeness that women had between them of this culture that they joined together through generations, separations and misunderstandings, and that they are still able to bind and rely on each other. Furthermore, the film seemed to glorify women as almost impeccable individuals. What I mean by impeccable is that they have not suffered the consequences for their actions and have been treated as if they had no imperfections. An example of this is shortly after Paula accidentally killed her father. His mother immediately comes to his rescue and takes full responsibility for the act while Paula seems to suffer almost no remorse for what he did. Again, another example of this is when each daughter (or grandchild) had the opportunity to reunite with their alleged "dead" mother (grandmother). Knowing the stress that this has probably caused in their family, each of them still embraces the mother regardless of what she did, that is, killing her husband and her lover. In this light, women are portrayed as people who not only love each other regardless of the character's actions, but also those who do not seem minimally disturbed by the actions in which their friends / family perform. <br /> <br /> Another idea that I thought was intriguing about this culture was about their idea of ​​the supernatural. With the death of Raimunda, the mother of the Sun and her inexplicable return, the director builds the emotions of the public to believe that this film will embody the supernatural. The people represented in this culture seem very supernatural, that is, very eager to believe that life exists beyond the grave. Their aunt, longtime friend Augustina, the prostitute and other people living in the city of La Mancha all believe the voices of the dead returning to family members to finish the "unfinished business". I believed that this was a mixed reflection of the religious faith of the (mostly Catholic) culture and their need to make amends with those who had no chance of being forgiven during mortality. The belief that they maintained that the dead were "alive" was also to give hope to the indigent circumstances that had suffered in mortality. When the viewer is exposed to the fact that this film is not at all supernatural, it is interesting to observe the role that the mother continues to play. It is treated as if it were still a ghost (ie hidden in small cracks (under the bed or inside the trunk of a car)). I believe the director described his mother in this way to increase the already existing supernatural beliefs that the city had adopted. The mother's character seemed to be a metaphor for the city's longstanding belief in life after death.
