Why was this film ever made? They have tarnished the original Caddyshack with this shit. I was able to look at only half of them and didn't laugh once. At least I didn't pay to see him because he was on t.v. but I will not return to that hour of my life that I spent watching this terrible mess. There was no original star from the first one except Chevy Chase and he probably regrets making this movie. Jackie Mason should have been the outrageous, funny buffoon like Rodney Dangerfield was in the first, but Jackie Mason wasn't funny at all. Jackie Mason is not Rodney Dangerfield. If you want to laugh, look at the first Caddyshack. If you like terrible movies, then this is a movie. This film smells like a courtyard in July. Avoid at all costs.
