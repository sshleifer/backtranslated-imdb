One night on an independent channel famous for showing off-the-wall films, this monstrosity was aired. Even if we are tempted to turn it off, we looked at it until the end, hoping to see some semblance of redeeming value. Alas, nobody was there. Absolutely nothing. The quality of the film was economic; the soundtrack was muddy; the assembly was ridiculous. Then again, there was very little to save. After a few minutes of the character of the doctor of Cameron Mitchell who tells of one of his patients, the viewer is tortured by no plot, pathetic writing, abysmally terrible action and a total lack of cohesion and continuity. The rotting cherry on top of this fetid mess was the most horrible "special effects" and "trick" to dishonor the screen, even for television. The main character stumbles into his role in a rubber mask of a dweller and in a pair of dishware gloves that seem to have been dipped in glue and rolled into beads. Perhaps the poor lighting and cinematic quality of the gag were trying to mask how bad the tenth power was. One can only hope that at least one deliberate decision was taken during this hopelessly amateur video. Seriously, a handful of three-year-olds could have produced a better project. In the end, poor Mr. Mitchell returns (how desperate it must have been for money!) And banishes the nonsense that should connect this pile of shit with the AIDS epidemic. Please spare yourself and your loved ones the inhuman cruelty of sitting through this. It was so bad, even the Mystery Science Theater 3000 could not have saved it.
