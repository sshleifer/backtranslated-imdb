The sequel that nobody asked the film that nobody wanted. There are obviously too many flaws with this film to name here, so I'll just focus on acting. Miles O'Keefe would have been more apt to play Thong's spasmodically Asian role, especially since he would have no dialogue. Lisa Foster shows her lines showing an emotion, dullness. Charles Borremel brings life to his part by pausing every five words. And finally the flamboyant John Saxon type ... no comment is needed. <br /> <br /> See "Conan the Barbarian" if you need it, but don't waste your time with this low-losing match.
