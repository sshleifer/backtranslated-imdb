If you can watch a movie without worrying about the plot or acting, then Backdraft is definitely the one. <br /> <br /> However, if, like me, you like watching movies you can believe, then Backdraft has some serious flaws. It offers nothing new, and there are hundreds of action films from the 1990s that follow identical formulas, although they are not as clumsy. <br /> <br /> After two firefights, I'm thinking, this has to go somewhere else, I mean, how many big fires are there in a city? Surely the firemen do other things, how to get the cats out of the trees? Well, I was wrong, and the repetition continues again and again, until the end. <br /> <br /> A good aspect of the film is the fire itself, well turned, and I must say that I felt rather hot while watching it, which suggests that two hours of watching the fire without a plot or an acting would be been more suited to my tastes.
