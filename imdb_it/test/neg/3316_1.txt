This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Not only that, it is a comedy, which is not funny, but it is also very badly done with a top direction full of unnecessary split screens and other effects. <br /> <br /> The two "heroes" with their fancy language is just annoying and confused me a lot, always touching the genitals. But the worst thing about all this nonsense is the economic attempt to give that film a certain charm, referring to German history and showing sensitive aspects of the "heroes", which finds its culmination in showing how Erkan and Stefan treat a sick woman by mind with their "joyful" lifestyle (!). But I didn't expect anything better from director Michael "Bully" Herbig, who also did two non-entertaining TV shows, a non-entertaining western movie and an almost non-entertaining SF comedy movie. But Erkan and Stefan had been - just a little better - in some of their stand-up programs. For me the only good thing about the film is Alexandra Neldel, which is very beautiful for me.
