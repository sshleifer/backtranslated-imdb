I'm a big fan of zombie movies and this is just a pathetic attempt by one. I find the best features of zombie movies are the sense of solidarity and the need to survive. This film focused more on a "let it show" view. <br /> <br /> The film was full of bad acting and even worse special effects. When the zombies come out of the floor and bring the man down, there's only blood spilling out of the hole. I was not aware of the fact that the holes in the aircraft floors bleed so extensively. And the original zombie lady, Kelly or something like that, showed the worst acting I've ever seen when she woke up and started feeling sick. I laughed hard enough when she died. I deserved it in every way. <br /> <br /> I was a little confused as to why Dr. Kelly could speak after he became a zombie, but then there was nothing pronounced by another zombie because he was screaming and shouting annoyingly. And they seemed to kill the zombies quite efficiently by shooting them in the abdomen, yet when Dr. Bennett is ejected from the plane and in the engine, removing most of his lower half, he is still able to live at the end. br /> <br /> I heard they altered things to make a "good" scene. When one of the bitchy girls (I didn't have time to learn their names. They played a useless role) was in the bathroom, she was attacked by a zombie behind the mirror. Was it a two-way mirror to watch Mile-High Clubbers? I have never broken a mirror on an airplane (bad luck and everything else) but I doubt that there is much space behind, with the insanely narrow space of the bathroom and of all. <br /> <br /> The few qualities of redemption were too little too late, unfortunately. One thing the film had in mind were the fiery flight attendants, but they felt the need to kill all but one. And I admit I laughed pretty damn when the old lady crushes Frank's arm and he says "He's setting me up for death" or something of that degree. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I'm sad I wasted my nine dollars on this movie. The fact that I bought it as a minor redeems it, but still ... It has failed on so many levels. Attacked with Dawn of the Dead and 28 days later.
