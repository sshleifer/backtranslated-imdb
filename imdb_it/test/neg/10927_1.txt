This conglomerate fails so miserably at every level that it is difficult to decide what to say. It does not deserve a line, much less ten, but to respect the rules of IMDb, here it is and I probably will not succeed the first time and I will have to write more to remedy this request to be accepted. LOL <br /> <br /> If I had seen this schlock during the '70s while I was going through my mushroom phase, I would still have considered it unimaginative and superficial. The most exciting shot for me was the long shot when the elevator door opened and closed. I was on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> A person here wrote that he met the creator of this mess, as if that was a red letter day in his life. One can only pray that something much more exciting will manifest itself in the life of that poster. Take a vise, amigo.
