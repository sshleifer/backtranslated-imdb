Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) travels to Tokyo to investigate the mysterious disappearance of her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and is captured in the same mysterious curse that killed so many people. With a group of others, try to solve and end the curse forever. <br /> <br /> The Grudge 2 repairs everything from the first and produces only a couple of scares. The first Grudge was at best an average film. The premise was decent but the acting was in wood and some scenes were really ridiculous. The Grudge 2 is even more foolish and less scary than the original. Furthermore, Scary Movie 4 made it almost impossible to take these films seriously and I had trouble keeping a straight face during the "scary scenes" that should encourage laughter more than fear. How Takashi Shimizu messed up his franchise is inexplicable yet he managed to create a decent atmosphere. Unfortunately, he kept the film at a slow pace with a group of obtuse characters and intimidating tactics. Clearly, he made this film for money and I'm glad he failed. <br /> <br /> The script was pretty bad, especially because it made no sense and didn't develop characters at all. In the film there were three different stories and each of them was somehow linked to "rancor". The connections were weak and a lot of people were killed without a real reason. They don't explain the rules of the curse very well and end up being a bit of a bloodbath because of everyone's death, even if the PG-13 prevented things from getting interesting, so even some death scenes were rather lame. The dialogue was weak and none of the characters was nice or developed well enough to really care. <br /> <br /> The acting was on par with everything else and was much worse than the first. Amber Tamblyn was annoyingly made of wood. She moved to the screen very slowly and all her emotions seemed false. Sarah Michelle Gellar was fine even though she had just made a cameo. Jennifer Beals gave the best performance, had some good scenes and was pretty effective. Arielle Kebbel was okay, a little insipid. The rest was horrible or just too forgettable to say. Overall, The Grudge 2 was a disappointing sequel. Lots of things were missing and not worth looking at. Evaluation 4/10
