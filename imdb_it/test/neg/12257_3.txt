A really strange, surreal mixture of visual ideas that probably seemed extremely disconcerting on the printed page; what drove Robert Redford into the project, one can never know. Sidney J. Furie directs this surprise journey of an egocentric motorcyclist by taking a young millionaire under his wing; the child looks at this anti-hero, and eventually begins to ape his amorality. Disconnected and disheartening - though for some, the sight of Redford undressing, being stripped or stripped may be enough to deserve attention. Lauren Hutton also remains naked, but all the sexy flashes are just teasers for the carefree; there is simply no story. Perhaps Furie was making an esoteric comment on unscrupulous vagabonds and their flock around 1970. If true, then this pre-Blank Generation approach failed, as the film was not a success. * 1/2 from ****
