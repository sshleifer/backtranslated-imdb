Zeoy101 ?? In reality, this must be one of the most stupid attempts to attract the attention of people in my age group. This is a preppy girl named Zeoy and her friends who attend the college. BORING!!! All he does is complain and complain and behaves like a spoiled idiot. I remember that this show was released in 2005, I was 13, and even then I thought it was useless. The only episode I ever liked was when the guys hid a camera in the girls' dorm. THAT'S ALL. Anyway, I don't understand why Nickel-Oh, my bad-Nick feels the need to syndicate this poor excuse excuse for "entertainment". Seriously this decade is becoming a joke every year and gets worse and worse. What is it with this generation ?? <br /> <br /> However, R.I.P. Nickelodeon 1979-1998? / 2005?
