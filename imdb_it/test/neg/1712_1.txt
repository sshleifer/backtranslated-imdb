First of all, I would like to apologize for my rating of "1" ... The only reason I give this film such a high score is that I can't go into negative integers. All the reflections "This is a parody" apart, and while I certainly tried to give due consideration, they left me with a certain notion, namely; "This is probably the worst movie ever made." At any level and in any plausible quantification of qualitative measurements ... Seriously, I tried, I'm just like any indie video distribution film born for worship as the next buff, but seriously, this movie sucked the rhino balls ... <br /> <br /> Honestly, if I had directed this "film" I would have seen it as a legitimate cause of suicide.
