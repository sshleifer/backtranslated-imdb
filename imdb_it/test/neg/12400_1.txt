Say beyond imagination. Obviously set in the Isle of Man disguised as Americans - very bad - and full of British actors who can't make American accents. A monster that looks like an untraditional promotional promotion for Alien from a movie store, with the most inflexible feet ever seen. Girls in the shower, undressing, catfight, blah, blah, blah. You have an idea. Don't watch it, run away, hide, AVOID.
