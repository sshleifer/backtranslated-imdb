It is extremely rare to see a 1955 film that I don't like. Noir, JDs, Sci-Fi, Drive-In; I like everything. Robert Aldrich is a director who has done a great job, and most of this cast has excellent performances. So what went wrong? <br /> <br /> When I worked in the Independent Film world, we used to talk about something called "movie for actors". The actors' films are films that are unwatchable for anyone but other actors. Actors like the "actors' films" because they see ACTing - which means a completely exaggerated melodrama. Actors like to give the chance to totally unleash "Give all they have" and get great satisfaction watching the other actors do it. In many interviews with actors they say "he was a great director, he never interfered with me in any way". In reality this is the opposite of good direction, because the whole POINT of having a director on the set is to prevent the actors from making fun of themselves (which, given the possibility, they will always do). <br /> <br /> Apparently Robert Aldrich has forgotten that in this project. Or maybe he was sick. Or maybe he thought there was no hope of saving the script in the first place, so what the hell? In any case, here is an example of a lesser-known film that is best forgotten. The characters gesticulate, pontificate and generally hinder him to the end. One thing I can say is realistic: it's set in Hollywood and everyone behaves like their little problems are the most important thing in the world. It's not fun to watch, but it's realistic. What is unrealistic is that a producer so desperate to keep his star in check is going to try to hinder him in almost every way possible, including including engaging in illegal activities. But this and other contradictions of the plot merely carry on the melodrama, increasing the opportunity to twist hands and shout accusations. <br /> <br /> I managed to get to the end of this film, which is no worse than a "3" out of 10 in my book. But why test your endurance when there is so much more to rent?
