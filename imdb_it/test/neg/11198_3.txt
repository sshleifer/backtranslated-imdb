I went to Crooked Earth to see a piece of New Zealand. What I found was a poorly interpreted and misinterpreted echo of the people I know. <br /> <br /> Great moments between the characters ?? including many scenes of Temuera Morrison and Lawrence Makoares together ?? they were often ruined by long and lengthy monologues that the actors were forced to stumble. Beautiful and inadequate phrases shook from Lawrence in particular as if he were the new Maori Messiah at his beer-box pulpit. <br /> <br /> When I watch a movie with Maori actors, I discovered that I can always choose half a dozen characters that remind me of someone in my life. With Crooked Earth I struggled to find a key character that sounded real for all the two hours. Most ?? including Wiremu and Peka ?? liquidated by saying or doing things I did not understand and could not connect. At the end of the film the writer had succeeded in alienating the public in which the Maori were unable to relate to it and Pakeha was then given the license to fire him. My feeling is that the message of the movie ?? or at least the main one of many that was launched to the public ?? it is important enough to avoid the use of character ends. Unfortunately, no one who read the script before it was filmed thought it would pass this advice. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was invasive and, as irritating as that horrible "bing-bong" sound that interlaced through `Eyes Wide Shut '. The public has not been so subtly self-educated to laugh, cry or be angry when the music has changed. It reminded me of Darth Vader's entry music in Star Wars: obvious and slightly funny. <br /> <br /> I think there are some people out there who might like this movie. It's fun in part, has a good deal of action and has some really powerful scenes. Calvin Tuteao and Quentin Hita have also slammed the jobs. Overall though, I didn't like the experience as much as I know I should have. Barb Wire, Speed ​​2, The Island of Dr Moreau and Crooked Earth seem to be Tem's shit quartet.
