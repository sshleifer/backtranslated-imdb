Thomas Hardy is one of my favorite authors. Some truly wonderful films were made with his novels ("Far from the madding crowd", "Tess of the D'Urbervilles", "The Mayor of Casterbridge"), and I had high hopes for this. The Hallmark-Hall-of-Fame-ification of "Return of the Native" completely destroyed it. The cast was exceptional, the photography excellent, but the script was dismal and the direction decidedly ruinous. People approached people, the lines said, walked away. A meager excitement developed when Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta Jones (very young, very beautiful) exchanged some squeezed meat, but even Clive, who is a superb actor, could not save him. It was flooded with the usual "romantic" background music of Hallmark strings and fake pastries that offered a display of the plot, and what might have been dynamite turned out to be terrible. The wealth of the three films above was completely absent.
