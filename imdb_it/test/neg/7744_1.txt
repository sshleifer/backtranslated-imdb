Kathy Ireland: the body of a goddess, the face of an angel, the voice of a Smurf. <br /> <br /> And the acting talent of a shovel full of calcite. If you don't believe me, look at this: "Alien from L.A." actually it depends on you to act during the 9/10 of the movie! Sure, it ends with a nice red bikini and a wraparound skirt near the end, but it's too little (so to speak) too late. <br /> <br /> It seems that Ireland plays the daughter of a famous scientist who falls into the center of the earth to find him. Along the way, he falls in love with a boy named Charmin (yes, like toilet paper - make your jokes) and discovers how "Mad Max" refuses live. Did you know that people who live in the depths of the earth have Austrailian accents? Me neither. <br /> <br /> It's ugly (it was MST, after all) and also a Golan-Globus production, but after all is said and done, Ireland simply seems lost, as if it were trying to find where the photographers are , so you can do a photo shoot. <br /> <br /> And I don't blame her. <br /> <br /> A star. And if you insist on looking at this, do it with the sound off - save the eardrums.
