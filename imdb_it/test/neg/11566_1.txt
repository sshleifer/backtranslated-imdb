In fact it was terrible. The main chick who is topless was obviously sleeping with the director at that time. It was shot in a warehouse most probably owned by family or friends. They also chose not to worry about inventing a story. Of course, these are ways to reduce costs, but are they smart ways to keep costs down? No, I'm not. At least they could have found a middle school student in a "creative writing" course. Those kids might have had at least one lesson on the structure of history. At the very least, they could have read about a structure of 3 actors, but acting was obviously not a priority. Watching these jerks run in funny clothes that was stupid by 1980 standards was an embarrassment. The fact that none of these actors committed suicide due to humiliation is probably a testament to the limited distribution received from this film. If the actors had actually seen the end result of their hard work, there would have been a line of people waiting to jump off the Brooklyn bridge. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie a 10/10 star but it only deserves 1 for being released. This film should be shown to film students around the world. It's better than 90% of the student films I've seen and wow is a piece of this movie.
