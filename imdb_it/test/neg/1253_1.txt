This film is a shameful result of what happens when: <br /> <br /> A) It is written, directed and produced by an idiot. and / or B) He was rushed into production to satiate the poker / Stu Ungar craze. <br /> <br /> The story from the beginning is not uniform. Vidmer spends too much time in Ungar's childhood and not enough on some of the legendary tales - how to count cards, his blackjack escapades, the roll of money as an id. Also leave mentions of other poker greats such as chips reese, brunson etc. The film is a complete mess from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> If you want a more complete and accurate account, read the book One of a Kind. If you thought the film was good, read the book and change your mind.
