Northanger Abbey is not my favorite novel by Jane Austen, but it has its charm. This movie no. It has some of the same names as the characters in the book, but the story is drastically altered, and the sweetest man in Austen's entire canon (unless Mr. Knightley of Emma has a place of honor) is meant to be an insensitive and insinuating mercenary. One or two totally unrelated characters are introduced and on it hangs a palpable air of perversion perversion. I was so disappointed when I first saw it in 1986; even today it is at the top of the list of films that dishonor the books on which they are based. Even Robert Hardy fans should give this off. He has nothing, and I mean N-O-T-H-I-N-G, to recommend it.
