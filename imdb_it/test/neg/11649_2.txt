This film has worked with some of the most predictable and superficial characters ever seen. The writer obviously bought the notebook "How to write a film about space disaster" and followed it by play. In particular, the stereo use typical of astronauts who talk to their loved ones from outer space - staging a brave show in the face of disaster - has been done over and over again. <br /> <br /> Max Q seems to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw $ 50 million into the project. But, judging from the second half of the film, which contained numerous lame special effect attempts, the producers could only raise $ 50,000. To know that the film was nominated for "Visual Special Effects", Emmy absolutely sucked me. <br /> <br /> I think a handful of high school students with a vote in Media Studies could have created more credible effects! <br /> <br /> And the holes in the plot are too numerous to mention. But I will choose one as an example. Now, I'm not a NASA expert, but it's certainly highly implausible that a worker connected to the shuttle simulator suddenly holds a position of power in the control room when things start to get pear-shaped with the program. Surely there is someone more experienced in Mission Control than the program director would call rather than a 29-year-old who has never been in the control room. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves is that this film is the work of Bill Campbell. He manages to make a good attempt to save something from the wreckage of the train which is this script. <br /> <br /> I give this film 2 out of 10, with Bill Campbell's above-average work in the lead role saving it from a lower mark.
