I grew up watching the "Bowery Boys" on weekends and even at a young age I could tell that it was low rented stuff as the name suggests. However it was fun to see Satch (Hall) get the better of Muggs (Gorcey) after Muggs beat him. The East Side Kids stuff was never shown, even if it was public domain material and probably cheap to manage, it was just a low standard for the kids to tune in even though we only had 5 channels to watch. He entered in 2005 and I think back to my childhood. I can't find Bowery Boys on DVD but I found The East Side Kids on disk and also on a public domain website. Fortunately I saved my pasta and saw Bowery Blitz on the web for free, and it really blows. Now I can see that there are some Bowery Boys and maybe the bad Monogram movie lovers here who gave this melodrama 7 out of 10 crap but there are people, this one isn't even trying to be funny. It's a drama on East Side Kids, not a comedy, so it's not good. The best part was seeing the Muggs arguing in the end, it reminded me that my elementary school days ran away like a girl when I fought, it was a bit of poop. Leonard Maltin said in his mini-biography that this film is one of the best, so you can only imagine the rest. If you want to see some decent East Side action see Ghosts on The Loose maybe, but the bottom line is usually a comic team starts strong in their careers and thins out, these cups blew spindles soon then slowly picked it up until the antics of Hall dominated than they were at their best. Still second tier stuff under the 3 minions that they imitate but fun for those who grew up with them. This function will not return pleasant memories of "Bowery Boys" and it is better to leave it to fanatical monograms.
