The Second Woman tells the story of a mysterious man who lost his wife in an accident and now believes that someone wants to hurt him. A girl who likes it wants to help but is inclined to believe that her fears are caused by a mental illness ... <br /> <br /> Interesting plot, very good acting, but the result as a whole is poor in many ways. The story is too simplistic, or rather simplistically presented (even if there are a couple of interesting twists). For example, people say they love each other after only two meetings. I don't want to reveal anything else, but you'll see what I mean if you watch the movie. "Come on, it was the fifties!", You might think. Yet I have seen quite a few films of that era and I know that some do not seem so dated these days. <br /> <br /> Something that bothered me is that some scenes were shot in the dark, making it almost impossible to see what was happening. Ok, it's a film noir but this is too noir at some point ...: o) <br /> <br /> Overall, the Second Woman is not a masterpiece of that era, but neither is the garbage. Watch it if you have nothing else to do ...
