Part of the film's low rating is the emphasis on unemployment and the suffering we have to endure. While this is good for drama, in comedy, we know that pains should not be emphasized. As a result, the fun with Dick and Jane is not an appropriate title and I was simply disappointed that I could not see any fun with Dick and Jane. It is true that this is a copy of the film of the same name, but fails in execution and the title was not appropriate for the plot. <br /> <br /> However, if the film was punctuated to be "The Art of the Steal" and the emphasis on slapstick bizzling comedy take more theft and plans to steal (foolishly of course) would have given the film a great boost. While at the same time the film should show at least at the beginning that the CEO is a scammer, so it will be easier to project pains to someone responsible at the beginning and leave it at that point. The film suffers from a point of view problem and with this in mind, a comedy cannot work if the point of view is not done correctly. An intriguing character of the husband who is that of a Wile E. Coyote on the Road Runner would be more fun, including the slapstick comedy. But in this case, a theft instead of capturing the bird with complicated gadgets would be extremely fun here. I mean you can do many of these and put them in the movie. But since the point of view was made incorrectly, the part of the robbery had to be limited. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy the film the first 15 minutes (during Jim Carrey's big rise), but to tackle the problems they faced being more comical since it's a comedy, that's the part that needs a thorough review. It may be more fun if the problems were dealt with more like John Travolta's civil action during the fall. That film was a serious film but the problems they faced were quite comical.
