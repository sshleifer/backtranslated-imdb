I'm a big fan of ugly horrors, inexpensive horrors, movies and all those 100 background movies, and I don't deny that those are the worst things that ever came on the big screen, or even your home video for that matter. Some of them, eg the infamous Manos The Hands of Fate, are really bad, and watching them, especially alone without friends and beer around, is a torture for a good cinematic taste. <br /> <br /> Momia Azteca Contra El Roboto Humano, however, was not so bad. Well, of course it's BAD - it's silly, old-fashioned, trivial, cheap, etc., There's an Aztec mummy, a tin robot, a bad masked criminal, a mad scientist, Mexican mobsters, etc. The assembly is poor, the lines, well, let's say that the lines are not theatrical, FX and SFX are the best that Mexican low-budget production could offer, etc. etc. The film is still FUN. it's so ugly that it makes you laugh happily for an hour. Of course it depends on the sense of humor, but I'm sure La Momia should teach all newbies of this kind of cinema to enjoy it. Note: the film lasts about an hour and I think it is only the stupidity that can be easily digested. <br /> <br /> There is also another thing: watching La Momia can give you an idea of ​​what the whole concept of the SF / Horror genre was in the fifties, when compared to the era of the Matrix of today's cinemas. I think it also shows how both the industry and the public have evolved, because watches like La Momia continue to attract full-house theaters for some special shows (films like this are special), and very often receive a standing ovation.
