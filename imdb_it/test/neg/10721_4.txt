As a big Jim Carey fan, I sat at the cinema with optimism. After all, Fun With Dick and Jane seemed to have all the raw materials to make this another Carey success. After five minutes of good humor it seemed that this film would provide, but it went wrong as soon as the plot began. The idea that a charming, charismatic, high-profile VIP employee could suddenly find himself working in his nearest supermarket is so hard to believe and therefore to understand how this guy has also become a criminal master is practically impossible. Even the actors seem confused with the situation. Of course, the stereotypical, rich and indifferent leader of the operation does not struggle a little to bring out his one-dimensional character, but for Carey and the others around him the work is much more difficult. One minute, Dick is seen as an arrogant pro-man, obsessed with goods, the next moment is a disaster that manages to put together two words, and eventually he becomes a thief who is able, happily enough, to put a gun another the man's head Jane is equally confused with her role and her character never really starts. <br /> <br /> The idea behind the story is so beautiful and it's a shame that this movie failed to make it work. You may find the strange moment of the laughter of a high-volume comedy, but it is usually more physical humor than anything witty or intelligent. Carey does his best in parts to save a sinking ship but his comic talent will never prosper in a character that has so many holes in his personality. Carey shines when presented with a strong and bold character (Man on the Moon, The Truman Show, Ace Ventura) that this film never presented to him, despite his best efforts.
