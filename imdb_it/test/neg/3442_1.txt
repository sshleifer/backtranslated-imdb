Tim Taylor is an abusive alcoholic drug addict. He is a coward and a child and has absolutely no redeeming qualities as an actor or person. The only movie with him that is funny is "Galaxy Quest" and just because his character - an actor stunned out of a previous successful TV show - was so close to real life for him. The rest of the cast is equally bad. I hate her mother and the actress who played her Patricia Richardson, she sucks! There is always cliché, the stupid woman who is fat and loves opera and cares only for her children, while in real life she proclaims family values ​​and divorces after having twins. And the child actors were as interesting as a root canal.
