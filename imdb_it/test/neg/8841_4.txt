Obabakoak is a group of stories with a single point in common: the small Vasque town of Obaba. In this film, the director tries to explain some of these stories using a young reporter as a continuum. The result is a strange film, as it has a main character (the film takes about 20 minutes for each fairy tale) other than the city of Obaba. Every story is really well explained and the fact is that they are very boring. It was by far the best film of the year in Spain, but, well, it's not saying too much. The only good thing about the film are the precious scenarios. It is filmed in a very precious valley and it is more pleasant to spend time looking at the scenery than being aware of the story.
