I was really disappointed with this film of which I had high hopes. It seems that he was quick to exploit the success of screwball comedies (including the "Libeled Lady" by MGM, which featured two of the same stars) and the success of William Powell and Myrna Loy. Three years after their mating, they were still attractive to watch and full of fire in their scenes together, but a weak script and hasty premises destroy any chance of being a great sequel to the previous year's "Libeled Lady" and the two "Thin "Man" films they had made before this. "Double Wedding" tells the story of a clothing store producer, Myrna Loy, who is intent on dominating the life of her sister (Florence Rice), future brother-in-law (John Beal) and his servants (which include Sidney Toler and Mary Gordon). When independent William Powell enters his life, after distracting Rice and Beal from Loy's constant control, Loy meets his game. Looks good so far, right? , an interesting premise is not up to par, sad to say, because the character of Loy is so one-dimensional that it is difficult even to like him, let alone if Powell falls in love with her, and we know that soon it will happen. another attempt to put a career woman in her place by changing her opinions about her on the kind of life she led, something that Hollywood has often done during her golden age. When Loy says he doesn't have the time to handle both his business and have a man in his life, he is a genius. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, in addition to Powell, Jessie Ralph is free-spirited on board. A rich and salty elderly woman who helped Loy start her business, has a acquaintance with Powell and can immediately see through Loy's cold statements that she hates him. Rice and Beal are a boring couple, and Powell's whole premise that stands between them is senseless. Then, a former wife of Powell's is shown, which is actually not needed at that time in history, and the final wedding scene (where a crowd of people tries to get into Powell's little trailer) is a weak attempt to bring some farce. (It is amusing, though, that Powell continues to be struck by objects Loy wanted to hit Edgar Kennedy with, Those giggle are welcome, since there are so few.) Powell and Loy would do better in two more compelling comedies, "I love you again" and "love crazy", which are sophisticated, witty and fun. This film tries to be all three, but ends up with a sophisticated boredom.
