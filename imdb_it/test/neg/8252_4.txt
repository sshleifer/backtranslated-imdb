What about the mathematical genes that make the juices of criticism flow? A BEAUTIFUL MIND was not very much in my opinion (FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING deserved the Oscar that year) while GOOD WILL HUNTING had many prizes awarded to it undeservedly <br /> <br /> First of all it is the script. When I attended film school I was told that GOOD WILL HUNTING is a great example of how not to start a script and the tutor was right. This film lacks any kind of opening hook and is mostly very slow. If you wrote an unsolicited script like this the script reader would have given up this on page 15 <br /> <br /> Structure apart from the idea of ​​a member of the American subclass who is a sort of intellectual god who doesn't play really true. Ask yourself this: if he is the key character in the film, why did he spend his short life without anyone noticing his abilities? Hasn't a single teacher from his childhood noticed his gift? Highly unlikely as it is the fact that he has read so much desire to expand the litratura. And if Will is so smart to come, is he so oblivious to what happens to good-looking young boys in American prisons? <br /> <br /> But it is the casting that has dropped most of the film. Do you want to convince a couple of actors to be part of the tough members of the Irish gang? Let's give Matt Damon and Ben Affleck who is like convincing Russell Crowe to play a pacifist or Charles Bronson to play a liberal do good. I couldn't convince myself of the bogus Damon and Affleck while strutting to slap people in the ribs and couldn't help thinking that, even though they wrote the script, the parts should have been assigned to different actors, after all Billy Bob Thornton it has screenplays written for films in which it has not been inserted and the same criteria should have been applied here <br /> <br /> There are some positive aspects of the film. Robin Williams is excellent as the man who tries to show Will his potential and also very good is Stellan Skarsgard who is simply one of the greatest actors of characters walking outside Europe and despite my previous criticisms of the script, it is rather moving piece of dialogue at the park as the character of Williams explains to Will what he saw in life <br /> <br /> But I have to repeat that there are no less points than the negatives of this film and I have to be agreement with the people who said that GOOD HUNT is boring and unconvincing
