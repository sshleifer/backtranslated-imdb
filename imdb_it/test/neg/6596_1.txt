Ok, first of all, I missed the first 15 minutes of the movie, so I lost credits and stuff like that. SO, when I finally got there, I was like, "Who the hell is this guy?" I found out it was Flex like hours after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Flex didn't look like Michael Jackson. Not even a little. He couldn't dance like him, or move like him, the only thing he almost had was the voice. People have commented on Elizabeth Taylor, but I can't really comment on it because I don't know much about her. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was like a simple wack. The dialogue sucked. Cinematography, if one can call it that, is sucked up. The soundtrack was sucked. The acting has sucked. Yes, even Flex ... I'm so angry about this though. I didn't want it to suck. I'm so sad that Flex was told he can get away with it. But the whole thing looked like a dress. You know? It's like no one looks like they should have been, except Joseph Jackson. <br /> <br /> The concert sequences are barely sucked. I'm sorry, but Flex can't dance like Michael. I mean, how the hell was VH1 thinking? The trick wasn't even like Michael's. For example, in the film it was still dark when Neverland was raided the first time. In real life, MJ was white as hell. There was a sort of stupid delay in his discolored skin. <br /> <br /> The film wasn't boring, well, for me it wasn't. It was really nothing. I was so angry about everything that was wrong. I wanted to see how it turned out and if Flex could redeem itself. He didn't, really. The only part that I found interesting was the whole Lisa Marie thing. When they fell in love. It was nice. But I had to turn my face when they kissed. Eh. And only two parts made me collapse with laughter. The first time was when they cut Michael with short hair, you know the Thriller era, to Michael with the long and flowing hair of the Dangerous era AND HE WAS STILL BLACK! This was good. The second time I laughed was when they showed all of Michael's posters and memorabilia, but instead they had the face of Flex! It was so funny. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film was cheap junk. They were only two hours of dress-up and could have been much better. But no, VH1 is cheap. See if you want. But this movie is not funny, considering its ridiculousness. I got angry. And when I found out it was Flex, I started feeling so bad. So ... look if you want.
