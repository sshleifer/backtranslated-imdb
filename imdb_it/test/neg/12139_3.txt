Let me be clear. I hate this kind of movie. I don't like anything where the protagonists are all English bourgeois. I find this type of literature and film terribly pretentious. You will never let me read a book by Jane Austen gladly. That being said, the only reason I read W. Somerset Maugham's book and saw the next film was for a lesson. <br /> <br /> Mary Panton (Kristin Scott Thomas) is a beautiful English woman who lives in a villa on loan in Florence before the Second World War. One evening, after having dinner with some of his rich friends related to royalty, he gladly gathers an Austrian refugee, has sex with him and with ditches, and then kills himself. As the film goes further, you really don't want to love Mary. <br /> <br /> What a crap this movie has been. First of all, there were many subplots and characters invented in the film that weren't even in the book. I very much doubt that the late Mr. Maugham appreciated them. The characters, even if rich, were some of the most superficial and self-centered people I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave him nothing less than three stars was because acting was the only redeemable thing. The always talented Kristin Scott Thomas is perfect for the role of Mary. In fact, I couldn't imagine anyone else filling her shoes. Sean Penn and Anne Bancroft also played secondary roles, which were just as good as before. <br /> <br /> Save yourself the pain of watching this movie.
