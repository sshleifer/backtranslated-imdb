Lois Weber's film "Hypocrites" was and still is a very bold and daring film. I liked it and I was very impressed with the shooting and its history. The priest sees the hypocrisy of the people in his church and tries to show them the "naked" truth. People are horrified when he reveals the naked statue depicting the truth, having failed to lead them to it and to the few who helped her along the way. People do not want to face the truth that they are doing something wrong, but show them that they put things before God, that they go to beach parties that behave inappropriately, their materialistic ways and other things in which people of the Our world tends not to be morally correct. Eventually, failing to get followers, he must enter the gates of paradise alone. This film seems very bold to me, in the sense that a naked woman is shown in all this, especially considering the time period in which this film was made. The imagery and symbolism portrayed in this film I found incredible. The way they made the naked woman translucent and the use of a naked woman to symbolize naked truth shows a lot of creativity and art. Showing the different sins of people as they walked down the street and refused to follow the path, each with different excuses, setbacks and / or higher priorities, was a great way to represent people today. This film does a great job of bringing the moral message to its audience. Lois Weber has a fantastic way of capturing the attention of her viewers with her creativity, symbolism, images and through hearing. Even the piano music throughout this film is very beautiful and suitable for the whole theme.
