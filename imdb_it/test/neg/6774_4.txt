Fortunately, it is a brief mystery about a telephone operator who is discovered to be the kidnapped daughter of a railroad magnate. The discovery provokes an attempt on his life that is thwarted by Charlie Ruggles as a "deflector of crime". Things take a turn for the dangerous when everyone ends up in the title position and another attempt is made on the girls' lives. Your enjoyment of this movie will depend on your tolerance for Rugggles and his nonsense. I normally like Ruggles, but there was something in this role that rubbed me the wrong way. Actually, I don't think the mystery was very good, so there was nothing beyond the characters to make you look. yes, the final on the train was exciting but it didn't compensate for everything that happened before. Not worth looking for but if you stumble over try it.
