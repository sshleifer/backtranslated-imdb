This film and the first AvP movie are featured throughout the Aliens and Predator franchise. <br /> <br /> They are terrible movies, misinterpreted, badly scripted and terribly direct. They seem to be just some desperate attempts to make money with the good name of the original aliens and the predatory films, but instead of producing a production of well thought out quality, they invented the predaturd. <br /> <br /> The original films Alien / Aliens / Predator / Predator 2 were great, they redefined the horror / thriller genre by inventing these crazy (yet still credible) creatures who took the role of "serial killer" , unlike a human. <br /> <br /> These films are just the milking of the franchise and do nothing but darken his name. <br /> <br /> The Aliens vs Predator comics have been brilliant and have had a great story. They were loyal to Alien / Predator mythology, they didn't suck in all the original stories, etc ... Why didn't they turn the comic into a great movie? Because Hollywood is an idiot, that's why.
