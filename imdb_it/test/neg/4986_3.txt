I didn't like Underdog! I mean it was really useless and needed a great facelift and so it probably would have been passable but I didn't like it for the main part. This was not like any other children's movie from those movies that wanted parents (who grew up watching the cartoon) to come there with the kids to come and see this, they are none of them so I didn't like the movie in the least. I had some problems with it I don't think Jason Lee was the right voice for Underdog, it made him a sloppy and not very intelligent sound. Then it was really predictable, which makes you feel tired and angry. The humor was really what drove me crazy, it was just a little fun and a little bit. The only thing that bothered me most was the fact that almost everything that came out of Underdog's mouth was sarcastic or rude. Acting was acceptable, but needed a little improvement. If I had children, they could have fun, but if you're not a kid of all means they see it you might like it differently than I do. 3.4 stars out of 10
