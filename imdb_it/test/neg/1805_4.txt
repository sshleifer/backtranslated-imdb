In a sense, this film is not even comparable to the novel. However, it was nice to have a vision of what the Congo looked like and also of the natives, if you are not good at visualizing while reading. I would never recommend watching the movie rather than reading the book. I almost don't even suggest watching this film, let alone other films based on this literary work. This film; and many others, has not fulfilled this book. An important part missing in the film is the sense of MArlow of how the government of the lack of there in Africa was forming an early genocide. Also in the film, MArlow and his companions did not stop to take the note and the wood. Likewise, Kurtz's African lover pushes Marlow towards the end of the story that has a great influence in history but is not in the book. In the novel, Kurtz died on the ship, yet he died in his hut in the film. Even the boyfriend's reaction to Marlow's interpretation of Kurtz's last words differed. This film is effective only if you want to see the novel more clearly.
