I'm a movie collector with Mrs. Weaver, so I bought it just because it was there. I find it really strange that his career is full of horrible films. He started with an incredible promise in Alien, but then he had a large number of bombs. These bombs include this movie, The Deal of the Century, One Woman or Two and Half Moon Street. She also appeared in The Year Of Living Dangerously, which was not a bomb, but her performance was less than remarkable. In the period between Alien and the 1986 sequel, Aliens, the only film that claimed anything was Ghostbusters. before the release of Aliens, I'm sure everyone thought this woman was about to leave. Fortunately it was not. <br /> <br /> But going back to Eyewitness, the film is boring. It does not create any suspense. William Hurt looks like a cardboard backing and the atmosphere is just dry. Sigourney is decent, but it's not worth remembering. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you have to, but don't go with the expectations of a decent movie. Watch best movies with these two stars like Accidental Tourist and Working Girl.
