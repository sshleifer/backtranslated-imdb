I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many films since its heyday in the 1980s as an established young actor. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD because it was cheap and partly for the plot and to see how much older it is C. Thomas Howell; I don't remember seeing him in any film since the 80s. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: what a disappointment. I give the low-budget films some chances, but this started limping. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman is chatting with an Asian guy in a chat. Basically they stimulate their chat, so he insists on meeting the participant in person. She meets him, has sex, binds him and then kills him in cold blood. The plot then deteriorates further. <br /> <br /> The plot is thin and fragile and the acting is very rigid. Don't worry about renting it much less by buying it, even if it's in the $ 1 DVD bin. I'm planning to bring my copy of the DVD to Goodwill. I'm really surprised that any of the previous reviewers gave this movie a bad evaluation.
