Uggh! Hanna-Barbera from the 60s and 70s! What disgusting and unwatchable cartoons have been pushed by these hacks! It's a real shame, as in the 40s and 50s "Hanna-Barbera" meant quality - because they produced so many fantastic cartoons by Tom and Jerry. However, with the main cost-cutting efforts of the late 1950s, cartoons in general began to look rather poor and budgets were cut. In fact, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera were fired from MGM and replaced by a team of Czech animators who had never seen the original cartoons! So, in the late 1950s, the team was out of work and decided "if you can't beat them, join them" - and started producing horrible little cartoons - with horrible animations, backgrounds and writings. /> <br /> It is unfortunate, but the production of the disgusting cardboard team worked too well - making them rich and the most successful comics producers of the 60s and 70s. During this time, again and again, bad production values ​​were their norm and a long list of VERY forgettable cartoons were created. IN THIS CASE, THE HIGH PRIVATE EYE UNUSALLY ugly INCH - an absolutely unpleasant and stupid idea. If you want to know what the show is about, the title says it all. <br /> <br /> Rotten to the core and the strong proof that the production team had total disregard for us children!
