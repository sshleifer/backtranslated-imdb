I should have gone without seeing the movie after reading the review here. I saw the whole movie through fast forwarding and finished in 25 minutes. although it is a low budget film, it could have been improved. <br /> <br /> The film starts more like a thriller and in a few minutes tells you that you should turn it off immediately. And because the film was called "emergency landing" when it was landed so well in such a bad climate. <br /> <br /> Without acting, all the characters in which they move or behave like children. <br /> <br /> And don't forget to comment on the joker - the main hijacker that would have been more suitable if this film were a full-time comedy.
