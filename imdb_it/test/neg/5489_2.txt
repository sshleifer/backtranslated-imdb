'Illuminata' has widened the limits of the mediocrity of John Turturro from the second-level actor to the third-level director, writer and producer. This film was terrible. It is disjoint and passes from one scene to another with an insignificant flow or meaning relevant to the main plot. <br /> <br /> We are served with a buffet of fragmented scenes, each not sequitur to all the others. The only thread that seems to cross them is that they occur in the lives of members of the same theater repertoire company. The few scenes that are important to the plot are so twisted that we often can't tell if the dialogue comes from the story or the actors who manage their lines for the game within the story. <br /> <br /> If this story were a person it would be a schizophrenic with a very varied personality disorder. He couldn't decide if it was a drama, a love story, a comedy, a tragedy, a sexual farce or a theater parody. It was closer to being bearable as a sexual farce. <br /> <br /> Turturro was as lifeless and impassive as Tuccio, apparently a complex and passionate writer whose show has its great occasion when the current show has to be canceled due to the main actor's illness. Susan Sarandon gave a good performance as an actress trying to seduce Tuccio for a role. Unfortunately, he found it necessary to go topless, which only serves to illustrate that the hardware of old sexual symbols is much better left to the imagination. Christoher Walkin gave a delightful performance as a prominent theater critic who makes passionate adventures to a cast member. Beverly D'Angelo and Ben Gazzara also had minor roles. <br /> <br /> I gave this film a 2. Apart from Walken's script, there's really not much to recommend it except that the puppets used in the opening and closing credits were incredibly realistic and beautiful. Avoid this movie like the plague it is. <br /> <br />
