I started watching this movie on t.v. a few weeks ago, but gave up after the first 10 minutes or so. At first, the person on the witness protection scheme who is on an isolated farm becomes nervous about his external guards, then asks the guard inside the house if he can make a phone call - only to find out that the line was cut. <br /> <br /> Shortly thereafter, Roy Scheider as one of the witness killers shows up and duly executes the baton and his wife - on which the character of Roy Scheider duly picks up the wall telephone in the kitchen, dials a number and then he speaks: it's done !!!! This was for me!
