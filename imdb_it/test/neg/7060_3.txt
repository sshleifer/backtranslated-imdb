I like many Myrna Loy movies. This film was produced before his acting personality was developed. It would be an okay short film but it seems to go on forever in its complete form. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy seems to be told what to do with her acting and does the job. That's all you can say about her. <br /> <br /> His gypsy character is poor and the film has many flaws, like the jewelry scene. <br /> <br /> This film will probably be interesting for Myrna Loy fans but also as such is something of a disappointment.
