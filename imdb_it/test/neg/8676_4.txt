Well, this latest version of Mansfield Park seemed to try to take the business of the 1999 theatrical version (completely copied some of the ideas from it actually), but to soften things up a bit to make it more in line with the original story. Unfortunately, the result is a rather dull and schizophrenic production. And, like all the other versions of Mansfield Park, the character of Fanny Price is not the place to be found. Instead there is a woman strangely similar to a bleached child who runs around who never develops completely as a character. At least in the 1999 movie the character they call "Fanny Price" is firmly established as a rebellious male who is too clever for his own good. This "Fanny price" is a complete enigma. One day, I would really like to see a Mansfield Park drama that actually includes a representation of Fanny's character as written by Jane Austen. A sweet, kind, compassionate girl with a shy personality and fragile constitution. It is reserved in the ways and painfully honest, but also strong in its convictions, invariably loyal, extremely intelligent and extraordinarily astute. A little late, it is not until his eighteenth year that he finally starts making the transition from the clumsy teenager to the self-proclaimed young woman. And he wants nothing in life but to be of real use to the people he loves most. He is an extraordinarily complex character that I can't wait to see faithfully portrayed one day.
