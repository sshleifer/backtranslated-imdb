It was something I couldn't wait to see. The Ultimate Avengers films had both exceeded my expectations and since Iron Man was one of my favorite Marvel characters I thought that this same production team would be able to do something truly exceptional with an Iron Man solo title. But the final film was unsatisfactory. I didn't expect most of the film to go by paying tribute to Iron Man's gray armor. The red and golden armor is seen for about ten minutes at once. Not a big deal but not what I expected from the ads and the box. The worst thing was the story, the acting and the CGI animation for the monsters and the Iron Man armor that was unconvincing. It did not mix well with the animation of the cell. Even alone it looks just like a stick and without life. The character of Tony Stark, incredibly slow as he is, is so forced and unconvincing. I wanted to see this movie because I love Iron Man, but after I forced myself into the movie I wondered if they couldn't come up with something that was as good as the Ultimate Avengers movies.
