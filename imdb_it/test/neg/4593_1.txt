"Speck" was apparently intended to be a biographical film related to the serial killer Richard Speck. However, there is not much to kill in this film, and none of these is explicitly shown. The most disturbing scene of the entire film is perhaps when the Speck tramples on one of the eight unfortunate nurses dead in his bathtub, but even this is merely implicit, and not shown, apart from some unconvincing downward thrusts of Mr. Speck . The funniest part of this film is most likely the voice over, which should be a testament to the boring and disturbing nature of this film. Every aspect of this film is horrible. Unless you have a passion for boredom, don't worry. This film is in just 72 minutes, but it seems like an eternity.
