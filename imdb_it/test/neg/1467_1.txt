If you want to see the worst movie ever made, look no further. Some miserable films are watchable because they are unintentionally funny. Alas, the American film has no humor at all, there is no involuntary humor, only obscenities thought by its director to be ridiculous. <br /> <br /> For those who liked this film, I suggest you watch Kevin Smith's "Clerks", similar in tone. In Clerks you will find creativity, ingenuity and fun - all on a reduced budget. You should make yourself forget this horrible effort.
