Well, this movie wasn't as horrible as I thought it would be. I expected to give him a star. I chose to give him three. Why? Well, for a horror / science fiction movie, it's not so bad. Of course the characters are flashy (like their acting - including a young Leonardo DiCaprio), the low-cost effects and the monsters ... well let's just say that I've seen some more effective Halloween costumes in elementary schools ... But there it was something in this film that showed me until the end. I imagine a bit of humor. And if you ever want to see an alien gas, this movie will make you live your dreams. 3/10
