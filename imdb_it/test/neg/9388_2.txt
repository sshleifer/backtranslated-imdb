On the positive side, I will say that it is nice enough to be watchable. Negatively, it is insipid enough to cause regrets for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen. Long, plaintive and meaningless. And I'm not saying this is mean, I really wanted to like this movie, it looked like it had everything in place, it had the so-called "buzz", and it was a nuisance to track down. I had a little more effort on the side of the story, I think it would have been great. And I expect the team behind it to produce a wonderful job in the future, they clearly have the skills. But I advise waiting for their future efforts, let this go.
