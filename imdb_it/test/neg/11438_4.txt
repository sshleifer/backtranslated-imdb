This film was bad and the film about how some college students stay in a house to get money by renovating it and then they find out that the house has a Deamon woman and that there is a portal to hell. In this film there are a lot of silly scenes like at the beginning of the film how they are cleaning the house and starting to dance on a good song and some of the Demons at the end of the movie are just some guys in bad ways trying to do sounds scary and there are some good gore scenes like when the Professor gets his face torn off. I took this film just because I'm a big fan of horror movies and it's worth watching if you're a fan of horror movies. The acting in this film is really bad the only good actor is Roy Scheider of the great film Jaws and on this whole film he has a lot of flaws and my score is 4 out of 10.
