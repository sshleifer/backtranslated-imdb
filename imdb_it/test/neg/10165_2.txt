Watching this movie today I had the feeling that this thing was missing from about 10 to 15 minutes from the beginning of the story. John Wayne rides this trading / salon spot in the middle of nowhere to meet the owner of some robberies. All he sees are the signs of a massacre, some corpses, signs of a fight and no one alive in sight. This is because the owner's daughter is hidden in a secret room, the type you find in the old mysteries of English murder. <br /> <br /> The reason you find those hidden rooms in that kind of story is that in the past they were offspring. Catholic families clinging to the old faith in the 16th century in England built these things to hide those fleeing royal authority because of their faith. It's not something you see in westerns, but a good device. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately due to poor assembly or writing or both we don't know exactly what led Wayne to this place exactly. But this was a western B and not even a good one. <br /> <br /> Gabby Hayes is in this and is shaved and plays a dumb part of the time. An unusual circumstance for the Gabby garrule. <br /> <br /> If you want to worry about finding out what happens and seeing Gabby Hayes without a mustache, watch this movie.
