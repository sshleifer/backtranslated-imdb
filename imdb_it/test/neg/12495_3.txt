CyberTracker is set in Los Angeles in the near future, where bodyguard Eric Phillips (co-producer Don 'The Dragon' Wilson) saves Senator Robert Dilly (John Aprea) from an assassination attempt on a group known as UHR, the Union of Human Rights, which are angry with Dilly for leading the computerized judicial system in which robots called CyberTracker are sent to determine and dispense justice on the perpetrators. Anyway, Eric saves Dilly who is very impressed and decides to see if he can trust Eric in his shady activities like a traitor's cold-blooded murder, being the good honest guy that is Eric isn't hit when Dilly kills a woman is asked to keep him quiet. Eric escapes and leaves to bring Dilly back down, however Dilly has many powerful friends and uses his influence to frame Eric and have his CyberTrackers sent to him to chase him ... <br /> <br /> Co-produced & directed by Richard Pepin I think that movies like CyberTracker give the movies a bad name, I didn't like it very much. Jacobsen Hart's script is quite predictable, does not excite, steals most of his ideas and themes from other top science fiction films and the heady mix of martial arts and sci-fi action does not gel so well. There are some fights, some car chases and a couple of shootings but it's all rather bland and forgettable. The film lacks imagination considering that the film is set in the future and deals with robots, technology and the way in which society is managed and in particular the judicial system. Speaking of which the fantastic Robocop (1987) has blended his violent action and intelligent social commentary brilliantly, but CyberTracker does not even attempt to make any relevant social statements or attempt to portray any significant moral messages about law enforcement, the script basically uses the concept for having robots and shootings that Robocop did, but they also managed to include a good story. There is very little in CyberTracker that I can say was fun and is that what the movies are going well for? <br /> <br /> Director Pepin does OK, but nothing stands out, it's all rather forgettable and it's not particularly exciting. The science fiction elements are nothing but the robotic side of things and, overall, the film does not seem so futuristic. The action scenes are in place, there are some exploding machines and some shoot outs but nothing spectacular. <br /> <br /> Technically CyberTracker is average, because a seemingly set movie in the future seems outdated and the special effects are mediocre. The acting was bad, I wonder if Don 'The Dragon' Wilson signs checks with that name? <br /> <br /> CyberTracker was a waste of my time, there is nothing original or exciting and the action is immediately forgettable. Poor and that's all that needs to be said, not recommended.
