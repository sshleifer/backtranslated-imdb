I swore long ago that I never had another Joe Castro movie (maybe after "Near Death"), but I found myself by chance, since it was a Troma release and I didn't read the cover carefully. Ops. Well, I looked at it, and it's not good at all, but it's, I imagine, a kind of "tongue in the mouth" .... if it isn't, it just seemed like that. Some intrepid people at the University of Rio Grande have tried to find out if Chupacabra exists, due to the surveillance camera being shot by someone who has discovered that this strange thing is hopping through the field of vision. And also because the person this thing supposedly killed was the uncle of the expedition leader. There are a couple of cameras, one of which is whining all the time, and there's an ex marine called "Army" (?!), Which is kind of an ammunition expert or something. However, the do find Chupacabra on a boy's ranch and sets off to find him, involving him with two alleged witches. The creature itself is quite ridiculous, with thorns on its back and a large long tongue that would have died for Gene Simmons. In the end, after a lot of people were killed, Chupacabra does too, and they take him back to the university for an autopsy. So, does it come from another planet? Is it a genetic creation of a laboratory in Puerto Rico? Uh, they don't really tell us. Not really intriguing but not even terrible enough. Definitely not a large audience for this. 4 out of 10.
