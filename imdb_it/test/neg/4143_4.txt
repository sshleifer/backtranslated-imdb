I wanted to push this film, but somehow I can't find it in myself. <br /> <br /> Exhibiting a duality of fighting styles, is Li versus Li in a rather decent battle for supremacy. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films where the story brings the performances. Li's acting is extremely amateur, hesitant and rigid for most of this movie ... until the end. At first I was mistaken in believing that he was doing it only for one of his two characters. You know, to show a difference in personalities. But it seemed to be inexperience or lack of talent. He became a little better, more relaxed, towards the end. But it wasn't enough to save his performance. Jet Li's acting improves as her career goes on. I don't hate his acting. I hated it only in this. <br /> <br /> I must also say that the effects were very "B" class effects. What effects are there. <br /> <br /> History itself has had great potential. He was uniquely creative, bold and fresh. Unfortunately, the budget wasn't large enough to contain lighting, effects, movie quality and some acting lessons, or the director didn't care enough to worry about these little details. He also didn't care about SCIENCE in science fiction. A fact that was a big detractor for this movie. <br /> <br /> The combat sequences were a little one-sided, as it seemed to give more to one character and little to the other. But all in all the storyline was made for a very pleasant attempt. <br /> <br /> As nice as it was, I couldn't help but think, to the end, that this was just one of those movies that you can't help but watch it for what it SHOULD have been, rather than for what it is. <br /> <br /> Evaluate a 6.0 / 10 on the "B" scale. <br /> <br /> This is a 4.2 / 10 (on the "A" scale) to have a good plot, from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
