What should I say? I saw this movie just out of curiosity, and this is really a pity ... I grew up in Brittany with stories of Celtic legends and spent 5 years in Rennes, the city where this film is said to take place ... that no actor or camera of this film has never arrived in Rennes. They could at least have chosen a probable city, or a probable forest, but nothing seems ALWAYS like Brittany or Rennes ... And to call it a movie about Celtic legends is really madness for the public. In addition to those details, it could have been a good movie, but it's crap. Silly scenario, silly characters and no originality. Definitely to be avoided.
