Edge Vs. Michaels-Boring in general (he loved the sweet music of the chin on the chair) 4/10 Taker vs. Heidenreich - One of the worst games I've seen, predictable as hell 1/10 Tripe Threat WWE match - Because I watch them, nobody ever wins a diamond championship, it's not the main event. I liked it when Show drove JBL through the wall. 3/10 World Heavyweight Championship - Fairly OK, a little more beaten by Tripe H than a game, but I was glad to see it after looking at the shit. 5/10 Royal Rumble-Good Rumble, I liked the brand's showdown, the Hassan thing and the end. 7/10 In general it still sucks. Why does anyone look at the roar ???
