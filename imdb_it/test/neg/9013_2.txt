For those viewers who thought that the 1979 movie "Alien" was the first to represent a terrestrial male impregnated with an evil extraterrestrial, "The Night of the Beast of Blood", made 21 years earlier, could be a surprise. In this film, America's first man in space crashes into the Earth and, after the exam, is thought to be dead. Later he arrives again, alone with half a dozen alien seahorse creatures growing in the abdomen. The mother (?) Aliena also opens to terrorize the small band of scientists who are watching our pregnant hero, and she (?) Seems to have the body of a bear and the head of Yarnek, the rock creature of a 1969 star Trek "episode. However, with its short running time of 62 minutes, a small group of scientists and an economic-looking monster, this film suggests nothing less than a Grade warm-up for" The Outer Limits "(which would premiere four years later), but without the beautiful writing that the show usually boasted Despite the obscure title, this film is definitely science fiction, not horror, and offers no fear, no laughter, little suspense and little food for thought later. It seems to cost around $ 100 (but probably costs twice as much) and his musical score seems to have no relation to the events (I won't use the word "action") on the screen. At the end of the film there are still many questions: why did our hero give birth to these creatures? Why does the alien need to behead people in order to learn our language? (To justify that title, no doubt!) Why can't space aliens land on our planet, rather than having to hitchhike on our ships? How was our hero impregnated to begin with? These are all issues that this small shop cannot be disturbed. It is really only for the science fiction finalists of the 50s.
