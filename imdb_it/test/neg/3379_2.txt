This episode had potential. The basic premise of a woman living next to an empty apartment (but a phone that rings constantly) is somehow interesting. And when it explores noise, there is real tension and fear. But the stupid script ruins every promise of the episode. <br /> <br /> First of all, the woman readily admits to seeing things that would send many of us running in the other direction (eg "It's funny that the door slams shut even if there's no wind;" "This door has serious damage that was not here a minute ago;" "The door opened by itself, without my touching it;" etc.). Given these supernatural phenomena, besides the fact that a woman committed suicide in the room, would she not have taken precautions before entering it? Perhaps you could investigate during the day. Or maybe he could investigate the apartment with someone else. Or maybe you could TURN THE LIGHTS ON !!! Also, while he is in the haunted apartment, he decides to make numerous phone calls to the operator and starts discussing who has the power to disconnect the phone, and then they start discussing the details of the suicide. ONLY DISCONNECT THE PHONE! The telephone company does not need to be involved. Go to the phone and disconnect it. Case closed. <br /> <br /> Finally, showing the phone scamper on the floor as if he were alive was simply comical. If the director wanted the woman to be strangled by the phone card, he could have done it in a way that didn't seem funny at all. Brave Little Toaster anyone?
