We saw this in a business basket at the local Asda: £ 1.50 for the DVD. reading all the clamor plastered throughout the cover that says how "hilly" it is, and it also has a well-established cast, we thought this should be a great movie. <br /> <br /> So we bought it, took it home, pushed it into the DVD player, sat down and waited for the funses to start ....... and waited ....... and waited .. ... and waited a little longer. > <br /> About 90 minutes later, although it seemed more than 3 hours, the credits turned, and that was the end of that. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment - even paying £ 1.50 seemed like a scam. God knows what Cain, Richardson and Gambon thought when they said "yes" to this tosh. And as for Moran: as much as I liked Black Books, Shaun of the dead and his comedies, I felt he was out of his depth in this film. He tried to play too much to laugh, probably thinking that if he kept the character of his Black Books character, it would work here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately he came back. The gags fell flat after a while, and then became only an irritation. Which is a shame because I believe that, given the right part, it could be a great movie / character actor. <br /> <br /> However, to summarize: the Actors actors failed to act !!! <br /> <br /> ** / *****
