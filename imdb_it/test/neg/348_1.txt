OK, when you read this, you MAY have stopped crying. This film was so horrible that it was rather irritating. The creatures are pretty nice, but the only really good thing about the movie was the growing attachment between the prisoners and their guards after being abandoned on this daffy island. Even seeing Barbara Bach with all-baked hair was not a reward for buying this sterling bit of poop. He goes around with a whisper that I never used, my voice, before a breath that does not wash when you scream a bloody murder. (Hey, the main character was nice, but I'm not disappointed yet.) This is a repugnant cry from Dr. Moreau's good island. Poor Richard Johnson, who surely was born for better things, is simply as bad as the villain. I mean, how bad can a BAD guy be? (Ask Richard Johnson). Joseph Cotten tries hard not to look embarrassed as he stumbles through his cameo appearance. In the name of all that is holy, do not rent this damn bomb.
