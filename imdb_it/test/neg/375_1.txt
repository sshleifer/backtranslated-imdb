This time The Beastmaster (Marc Singer) returns only to face a new enemy Arklon (Wings Hauser), but due to a troublesome teenager (Kari Wuher) they are transported to the future where they then hunt. The result is a lot of fish (lame) out of the water. Honestly you don't get sequel this rotten to the bone. Beastmaster 2 is a painful film to watch. References and "elegance" badly date the film (This was done in 1991) and who really wants to see The Beastmaster in current times? Also noteworthy is Wings Hauser, whose embarrassing performance is easily the best resource of the film. Singer seems embarrassing, Wuher is irritating and the entire 1991 jargon simply makes the film unwatchable. This is easily one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * out of 4 (Terrible)
