OK I saw this movie. Someone has to kick me. Why must the Olsen twins insist on subjecting the world to this rotten torture? This was another film to watch the Olsen twins travel to an exotic location, meet some nice guys, look good and everyone's drool. The direction, the development of the plot, the acting. I don't know about the United States, but in my country it is considered extremely stupid to jump on the bike of a boy you met 10 minutes earlier. although now I am convinced that these girls will never learn to act, I really hope that one day we will be able to see a film with an original plot, even if a little plausible.
