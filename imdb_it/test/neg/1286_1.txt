This film descends like a square peg into a square hole. A badly made peg. A piece so cheap that it could not even be produced in an assembly line of a brewery in Chinatown, Mexico. In fact, when you try to press the peg into the hole for which it is obviously designed, it crumbles into sticky and disgusting pieces that smell of rotten fruit and do not wash away. Quigly is such a peg. <br /> <br /> This film is so terribly shocking that it hasn't even been created. A film like this must have been the result of some accident in nature; a bizarre entity that wandered somewhere in a damp office somewhere and crept in and grew to become too big and terrifying to look at. Only science would be interested in such a thing; anyone who is not willing to study it would exhume it from this world. <br /> <br /> What comes to mind is this: if you're the type to enjoy first-year violin recitals, racism or Coca-Cola Zero, it might just be your birthday
