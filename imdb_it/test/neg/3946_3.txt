This film was not very good in my opinion. Although it's not a complete waste of an hour and a half (thankfully I didn't have to pay $ for it), it wasn't very scary. There were parts where I skipped and some minimally violent / bloody scenes, but overall only someone easily scared would have considered this scary movie. <br /> <br /> Writing and acting in general were very weak. The characters have never evolved or grown as people. Even at the end, the protagonist, regardless of his name, was not up to par and had to be saved from the fire at the last minute. The plot also had inconsistencies. The police officer who was killed was NOT killed in the same way he died in the game. The October girl said that to kill the evil lady demon you had to read something from the correct text. Strange how they never bothered to do it and still managed to escape. The child Malcolm-in-the-Middle died in the game but did not die "in real life". Also, playing the game alone was a very weak script. It would have been ok for his brother's death, just to get them to play again. But you should play a video game and stay alive and 3 people die before you play again ... why do you need the game? If you like movies like Ring and it's scary and fun, watch this movie. If you know someone like that you can look at him laughing, do it. If you like horror movies that make you laugh out loud and you have the opportunity to watch this movie for free, do it. Otherwise, stay away.
