Ugh. This film has so many incredible plot intrigues that made what could have been a good movie in a horrible mess. The plot is halfway decent, but the holes in the plot make the execution literally ridiculous. In reality we should believe that the secret services go against all common sense and allow the President of the United States to be put at an incredible risk. If this is an indication of the kind of thinking that passes for good judgment among the protectors of the President, then we are all in trouble. Roy Scheider turns into a good performance as President, but unfortunately he is compensated by the truly repugnant acting of Patrick Muldoon (who somehow continues to get jobs in Hollywood based solely on his good looks and his mysterious talent of grinning every opportunity, regardless of whether the script requires a little smile). Maybe someone will see it and will be inspired to make a good movie from the premise - or maybe someone will see it and say "Hey, if they can get such a bad movie, maybe I can do it too!"
