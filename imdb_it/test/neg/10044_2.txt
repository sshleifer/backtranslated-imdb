If you took all the spare parts of a Shrek movie (grumpy ogre, annoying donkey, cute kitten, mandatory dance number, etc.), put them in a blender and condense it for 20 minutes, you'd have this mess. Painful to watch; I may have laughed once. History and dialogue have fallen beyond comprehension, with the actors of the voice playing as they phoned in their lines. The final reworked version of the poem "The Christmas Story" seemed to have been written by a commission in five minutes. And boy, a little Eddie Murphy has a long way. With his desperate attempt to be fashionable and up-to-date, this show will be long outdated and forgotten while classics like "The Grinch ??" will remain timeless. A sad waste of efforts by all those involved, a real "shark jump" for the Shrek franchise.
