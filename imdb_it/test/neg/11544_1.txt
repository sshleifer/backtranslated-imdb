You don't have to spend much time looking at this fact for the TV movie or the series pilot or whatever it was designed to understand what is in store. The incredibly bad musical score makes its debut from the start. Seriously, if this isn't the worst theme I've ever heard, I certainly can't remember it. While acting talent is available here, from Jeff Bridges to Carl Betz, Vera Miles and Sal Mineo, the writing is atrocious and the story is artificial, full of insipid stereotypes and an obvious repugnance by Ken Kesey. Why does Hollywood always have to present stories from the Sixties as if the so-called hippies were all one-dimensional idiots? Too bad that an era so interesting in our exceptionally conformist social experience is generally represented by waste outside and outside, so that the slightest such offensive is now accepted as reasonably authentic, when almost none of them come close to the way things are they really were. The best I've seen so far is a memoir called Looking Back from a boy named Becker, but who ever heard of it? Nobody in Hollywood, that's for sure. They are too busy pushing the tripe like the groan of a movie to worry about reality.
