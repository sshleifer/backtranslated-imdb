I checked it out for free in the library and I still feel robbed. Yes, Sandra Bullock is actually present, but only in five scenes for a total of just 5 minutes, and even those are painful enough to watch. The rest of the film is so bad that you will spend most of the time hoping it will end soon, but only if you are one of those people who have to finish a movie after you start it. All others will turn it off. Don't worry, you won't miss anything. Bullock's lines (assuming you were tricked into looking at this because his name is plastered to the case) are essentially just a parrot of other character lines, like this dialog box: <br /> <br /> Lisa ( Bullock) - "Danny, please tell me what's going on." <br /> <br /> Danny - "I don't know." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "Whaddaya means you don't know?" <br /> <br /> Danny - "I don't know - it has something to do with my father." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "Whaddaya means your father?" <br /> <br /> Danny - "I don't know - he has **** up or something." <br /> <br /> Lisa - "Why am I here?" <br /> <br /> Danny - "I'm sorry, Lisa, I don't know." <br /> <br /> (moments later) Danny - "Some friends of my father's army ...". <br /> <br /> Lisa - "Whaddaya means comrades in arms?" <br /> <br /> Do you understand what I mean? <br /> <br /> Bottom line - Just say no.
