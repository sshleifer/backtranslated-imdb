I'm not a big fan of musicals, though technically this can't qualify as a musical. But I thought I'd give it a chance, because I love war movies. It was mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> Hudson seems totally crazy in this role. It just didn't work for me. Julie Andrews probably played her part in the best way possible, but I find it difficult to buy it as a conniving and deceptive spy. Sorry, I know they are classic stereotypes on my part. But I have to say that I think it is Julie in her most beautiful and feminine aspect. I've always thought of her as more matronly, but surely this is the result of her roles in Sound of Music and Mary Poppins. No doubt they were trying desperately to get her out of that typecasting in this role. She was pretty seductive in appearance here, but I haven't bought her as a spy yet. <br /> <br /> I couldn't concentrate on the whole film and found myself tuning in and out - and conversing with those in my room (which I usually never do - I'm always keeping everyone quiet). So that tells you how little has kept my attention. Do not waste time!
