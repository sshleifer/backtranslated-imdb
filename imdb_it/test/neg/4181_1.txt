The first DH wasn't great, but I didn't expect it to be. But this horrible movie was just beyond criticism. I really try to look on the bright side and give films like this an opportunity, but I couldn't find a real positive thing about it. I appreciate what Bill Cowell was trying to do, but this movie was really boring. The film's story is not so bad. In fact, it's somehow original. But the form of the film is really bad, as many people say. In my opinion, this is placed right there with "The Off Season" and "Dracula 3000". I know a lot of people ooze and put down movies like this, but I really can't think of other good things to say about it.
