I knew it would be terrible, but not so terrible !!, since it's one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, nothing happens! All the characters are boring and the story is stupid and incredibly boring! Furthermore, the finish is particularly lame! The only reason I rented this piece of shit because I'm a big fan of Michael Dudikoff, anyway he's wasted here, and he looks extremely bored and shows no emotions like ever, plus I cheered loudly when the movie was over !. It is as if the film had no plot and everything was about nothing, and Ice-T is a horrible god (although in certain things it is okay), besides Dudikoff and Yvette Nipar they have had no chemistry together. There is a scene that the director tried to do emotionally, but fails miserably, since Yvette Nipar didn't really show so much emotion, yet there is a chase scene in decent Car, but it's not enough for me to recommend this terrible movie ! moreover, the dialogue is atrocious. Avoid this movie like the plague, nothing happens, please avoid and trust me on this, you could thank me later. The management is horrible! Fred Olen Ray does a horrible job here, with a poor chamber work, stupidly flashy sets, terrible corners, ridiculous use of archive material and keeping the film at an incredibly boring pace. Acting is terrible! Michael Dudikoff is not even remotely at his usual amazing self, he looks extremely bored, and shows no emotion for how long it is, his character is also extremely boring, since I can't believe he signed for this piece of trash, too he had no chemistry with Yvette Nipar (Dudikoff still rules !!!). Ice-T has almost nothing to do and it also seems bored, and it didn't convince me a bit. Hannes Jaenicke is not very good here, he was a bit gaudy, I didn't like him. Yvette Nipar is pretty but she was really terrible here, she didn't show much emotion, and she didn't have any contact with Dudikoff, and consequently I don't give a damn about her character! Art Hindle, (Owen Marsh), Kathy Harren (Katharine Marsh) and the rest of the cast are also bad. Overall, please avoid the plague !, Fred Olen Ray and Steve Lathshaw should be ashamed of themselves! BOMB on 5
