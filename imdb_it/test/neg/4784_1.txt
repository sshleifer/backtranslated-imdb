I watched the first 10 minutes of this show, I think I'll do it now! A worse show on TV. It's not even funny. It's so lousy that it's disgusting. I gave him a second and a third change that failed to even exceed five minutes. Don't waste time This is one of the many shows that have to go bye By talking about normal night, show that you need to go. All shows on CBS. All shows on ABC. All the shows on FOX and Joe Buck. All shows on the new CW network. All shows on NBC. (Accept the Law and Order series). All morning and afternoon talk shows. All court TV shows. And every reality show out there !! Every stupid game. period at the end! All home improvement shows! And all the media news. all that is. It's a 24-hour cycle of bad news. Yes, I have Monk Favorites, Law and Orders is everything to me.
