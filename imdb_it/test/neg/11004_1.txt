Yes, it's a SBIF classic (So Bad It's Funny). With a budget limited to tens of dollars, one of the most abysmal performances you've ever seen, and absolutely NO time even remotely frightening - not even a nanosecond! The camera work was at the elementary school level - one still fired outside a house was obviously held in the hand and trembled madly. Blood resembled a watered-down Koolaid cherry, someone made a trip to the local butcher for "human" bones and Miss Witch had the cheapest mask that Wal-Mart could provide. <br /> at the final cut and understand what a mess it was? Most names in the headlines must be pseudonyms, it would be career suicide to have this in your resume. Do yourself a favor and watch Ebert's video of his colonoscopy!
