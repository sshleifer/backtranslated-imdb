I would like to know the real name of the Lodge where the scenes of the film were shot. It is really beautiful and recalls the architecture of the 20s and 30s as the Hotel Del Coronado. I know it was on Big Bear Lake or Lake Arrowhead and I would like to know if it still exists. As for the film itself, it's really surprising that Jane Wyman was also nominated for an Academy Award. This must have been a time when she was much loved by her colleagues at the Academy. It would have been really interesting to have a real impression on Wyman and the other actors in this film about the script. The script of this film, like Kevin Costner's recent film with a message in a bottle, is so incredible that it limits the credibility that actors can bring to their parts. Rock Hudson can be forgiven. He was never a great actor, he was able to get mainly from his looks and didn't get credible roles until later in his career (Pretty Maids is the exception). But Wyman must have been forced to take this film through the contractual requirements or the study system.
