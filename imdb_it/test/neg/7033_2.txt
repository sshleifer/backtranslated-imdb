This was a terribly bad film! Ashley Rose Orr was horrible, she had none of Shirley Temple charm AT ALL! Those scary smiles that he would do when she curled up her piggy eyes in a way that I think she was "had to be nice and make the public work -"! Must have simpered "oh my goodneth!" about a hundred times during the film. She too could barely pronounce a sentence without accompanying him with a false laugh. Horrible HORRIBLE film .. If I could give less 10, I would do it. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk, go out and buy a real Shirley Temple movie!
