No, no, no. This is my advice to you if you want to watch this movie. Anthony Perkins is the one and ONLY Norman Bates, as is Janet Leigh in the role of Marion Crane. It just looks like a colorful version of Psycho, with some slightly different touches for a more modern appeal. Vaughn is as boring as Norman, and Sam Loomis of Viggo Mortenson looks too much like the cowboy from the original. Please people, do yourself justice. Do not worry about it. One can only wonder what Mr. Alfred Hitchcock and Mr. Anthony Perkins think about it now ....... <br /> <br /> * of ****
