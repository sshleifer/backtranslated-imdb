The title basically lets you know what you're getting. It's a screamed C grade but not as shamelessly funny as I had hoped. Directed by the exploitation film specialist Eddie Romero from an originally original story by Jonathan Demme (long before he directed "Silence of the Lambs" and "Philadelphia"), this low-cost 1972 action film was obviously shot in the Philippines but set in some anonymous third world country. Playing the prostitute and the small drug dealer Lee Daniels, blaxploitation superstar Pam Grier plays the first half of the lead role, while Margaret Markov has long been forgotten, the other half, Karen Brent, an unlikely revolutionary Patty Hearst policy that tries to collaborate with his companions to overthrow the oppressive local government. Naturally antagonistic towards one another, they are in a female prison camp where they wear bright yellow miniskirts inexplicably as uniforms. Run by a closed guardian and a lascivious matron, the prison is just an excuse for a long shower scene and some deadly cat fights while Lee and Karen face off against each other. Of course, they escape but are chained together with "The Defiant Ones" and the cat fights continue until they attack a couple of nuns to steal their habits. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, several groups of unpleasant men are in pursuit - the damn drug lord looking for Lee who stole $ 40,000, rather passive revolutionaries looking for Karen, and the police incompetent (who suffers the humiliation of exposing his friends to the drug lord). Needless to say, everything eventually comes to the head, but not before a free nudity from a number of Filipino women, a dog is wearing Karen's panties and some of the worst men of the 70s (a revolutionary with a belly of beer wearing a leather top with a straight face). There is a rather sad ending, but what is really sad is how much of the potential black comedy has been completely missed in this hilarious absurd exercise. Unfortunately, Grier is disappointed in this release because his character is not allowed to do much more than treat all the "jive", while Markov is an Amazon blonde who I am convinced is desperately trying to be credible. Since no one shows any talent for acting, the rest of the cast is not worth being noticed, except Sid Haig, a bald-eyed, infected man who uses his standard psycho character as the drug lord. The 2003 DVD contains only the original trailer as an extra.
