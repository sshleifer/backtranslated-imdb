I didn't understand what the title chosen with the film has to do. This is another gathering of monsters just like FRANKENSTEIN'S HOUSE. Not exactly a masterful plot, but Universal needed to capitalize again. <br /> <br /> Dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens) is either very ambitious or exaggerated in the ego department. He is working on the cure to prevent Larry Talbot from turning into Wolf Man. Somehow, Count Dracula works hard to find a solution to his vampirism. And completing the good doctor's experiments is the restoration of the Frankenstein monster's energy. Along the way, the gentle-hearted doctor's blood is contaminated by Dracula's. <br /> <br /> John Carradine still plays Dracula. This time it is more convincing. Lon Chaney Jr. as usual is the soul wolf man. Glenn Strange is the monster of Frankenstein, who has very little to do in this release. Also with roles to mention Lionel Atwill and Martha O'Driscoll.
