Words almost fail me to describe how terrible this Irish vanity project (funded by Canadian taxpayers - both federal and Albertan) is. <br /> <br /> There is a sudden appearance of a beautiful Canadian woman (Kathy Ranheim) who in real life was an athlete star in Alberta, for no other reason to guarantee Canadian content. The credits also indicate that some Calgary pubs were of assistance. <br /> <br /> Everything here is poorly filmed and at least third hand (fragments of poorly digested Trainspotting, Lock Stock, Snatch and Reservoir Dogs are the most obvious thefts). Avoid the plague unless you like one of those "so bad is almost fun" campers in front of your television.
