Contain spoiler! These guys are totally fraudulent, they made the lost scrolls of Judas, saying that Judas was a great friend of Jesus ... And now this? This is clearly an attempt to destroy a religion and should be illegal. They have no proof, it could clearly be a setup. How can we know and trust these people? What would happen if they buried the grave and "said it"? And in the end they have SEAL the sepulcher forever so nobody can go there to investigate? How stupid do they think we are, really? Should we believe that they are reliable people? Who really found a tomb of Jesus? And how can you stab all Christians this way? I think this documentary should NEVER be made by a non-religious man. It can ONLY be done by a Christian and I mean DIRECTION AND SCRIPT. It should be illegal for Jews to film a Christian documentary, especially if the documentary accuses that Jesus is not a "son of God who has risen" (nothing against this, they could be Buddhists or atheists, anything but Catholic). /> <br /> For me this is a complete hoax, a pure scam documentary. They sealed the grave so that people "didn't" think they were controlling things. This documentary is a total failure, how stupid do they think Christian people are? And what about the lost pages of Judas ... it was a total scam, in the end they said seriously, something like: "We know a few people who could make a fake parchment just like these, and nobody would know it was a fake "... Oh my God, they just said it ..." Friend we could have done it "... This kind of documentary should be illegal, it's a stab at all Christians and Catholics who should be behind bars !!! I am not a fanatic, I am a former Jew, now an atheist, but I have values ​​and I will always respect the religion of others, The part where Israel orders the tomb to be sealed forever is PRECIOUS !! PRECIOUS!!
