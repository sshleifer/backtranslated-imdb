I found a terribly disappointing experience! But I added a better style option similar to the feet of this item. <br /> <br /> This "Felicia Journey" is intriguing. It has a drama. But it's full of stereo types! <br /> <br /> So it is ONLY necessary the judging temperaments without worrying about a more true justice and honesty and truth, beyond the black and white judgments that adapt to the 30 seconds announcements of "NEWS" that punctuate every day our multimedia experiences, especially the news bulletins, true or misleading in such portraits! <br /> <br /> IS SO FAST, reminds me of the fairy tale of "Little Red Ridinghood"! He considers the innocent girl without any identification crossing the borders questioned by a guard but freed without any evidence to venture in search of his 'Romeo' which did not give her a VERSUS address of the pathetically inept lack of substance in the hoarse voice of "helping the hand "to make friends with his unlikely story invented by the layer! <br /> <br /> It seems suitable for administrators and the management team that no one has faith or prays to God, even in his moments of despair! <br /> <br /> So, in these early settings, orchestrate and tell a lot about what's to come! A nightmare journey that betrays the essence of substance without a fairytale resolution, without truth, integrity or credibility! ... Then a turning point and everything is over. What a disappointment! If you want to see a VERY superior film that investigates similar themes with MUCH more credibility, with much more powerful insights, watch the movie "Man of Flowers" by Paul Cox / Norman Kaye from 1983 !!! <br /> <br /> Unlike here, you will NOT be disappointed!
