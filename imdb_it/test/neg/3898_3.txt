I consider myself a fan of Jess Franco and his trashy movies, but almost every time I see one, I only see opportunities and missed plots that don't go very well. Unfortunately, this film is no different. The film certainly has great potential, since Franco has fused the intriguing theme of the classic film "The Most Dangerous Game" with his usual Sleaze trash brand, but the plot here is lost too often, and it takes forever for Franco to get to the main point of the film. Since this is a later film by Franco, you could be forgiven for thinking that the director would have improved, but in reality I discovered that the opposite is true; like this and the terrible 'Killer Barbys' are two of his worst movies. The plot focuses on a stripper and her sleazy boyfriend. The couple is invited to a private island by a rich woman and her lover. However, they soon find out that they were not invited there for social reasons, since they are "released" on the island, so the rich woman and her friends can kick them out for sport! <br /> <br /> What attracted me to this film was the cover and the fact that it was directed by the king of sleaze movies. You would think, therefore, that I would be pleased that the film presents a plethora of scenes of sex and general disgust; but they are not. The reason for this is above all that sex and sleaze in the film are really boring and most of the time it has only served to give me the condition known as "finger fast forward itching". However, my inclination to see everything until the end ensured that I had to stack it. There was a time when I didn't think the girl on girl could be boring, but since then I have proved myself wrong. The only positive thing I can grasp is that the soundtrack is quite catchy, and despite being a silly foreign pop music; actually it blends pretty well with sex scenes. I enjoyed the last ten minutes; like when the plot finally arrived, but it was a case of too little too late and unfortunately, this is a decidedly lackluster film. Overall, I recommend this film only to those who feel they have to see all of Franco's 180 films ... everyone else should instead watch Vampyros Lesbos, Faceless or She Killed in Ecstasy.
