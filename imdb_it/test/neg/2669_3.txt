Normally I wouldn't bother to comment on a horror film sequel, because it is usually assumed to be BAD, and if you look at them with a healthy lack of respect, they can be very funny and fun to scoff / laugh. However, this chapter of the current Halloween saga came up with gumbing up everything the original was going to. In the very first film, Dr. Loomis said (very explicitly I might add), that Michael Myers was evil, and this tries to explain why (doing a bad job I can add). In my opinion, it was much scarier when he was just a blood hungry maniac. The whole goth / cult thing was not necessary and a desperate attempt to throw a new curve into the Halloween equation. The result was a boring and predictable movie that wasn't scary and not so bad as to be fun.
