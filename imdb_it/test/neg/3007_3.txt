This is one of the most beautiful films of recent years. The fact that it was done with a virtual penny (about 1.8 million dollars on the DVD: it can be deduced that they ended up with even less funding) makes it even more impressive. Not only photography, but design and in particular places (Eastern Montana) that are both authentically American and otherworldly. <br /> <br /> Too bad there isn't a coherent film to go with. An extremely promising asset of the last 48 hours of cleaning up a rural city in 1955 before being flooded by a dam is swept away with a pretentious jumbo mumbo that alludes to angels and a dying child. And what is presented as the "real world" is hopelessly arch. Note to the Polish brothers: the Coen brothers are funny - you are not. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly many filmmakers will find the abundance of symbolism and inscrutability of "Northfork" as signs of a kind of depth, the kind that sophisticated types fight at night with cafes while the masses of brothers watch Charlie's Angels "or something. (Sigh) If you insist .... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, recommended only as a case study for filmmakers for his' impeccable technical credits and photographic beauty.
