Seeing this film for the first time twenty years after its release, I don't understand it. Why was it such a big success in 1986? His dilettantism drips from every scene. The jokes are lame and predictable. The sex scenes are exploitative and over the top (not to say that Miss Rudnik doesn't have nice tits!). The song is "schrecklich". The only really funny scene is the great shooting when the gangsters die of break dance, a trait that dates back firmly to the mid-1980s. It is really strange for me how incapable of grasping what aroused the enthusiasm of the cheering audience in 1986 (and apparently still today, reading my IMDBers comments).
