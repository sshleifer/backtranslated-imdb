I don't like Cary Grant, but I found his annoying performance in enough films to notice; this, Arsenic and Old Lace and Bringing up Baby. I don't like him in North by Northwest, but I find the film unbearably stupid. Furthermore, I find the infinite luxury of Grant's class tiring. I have no idea what his class does for the spectators who announced it. It does nothing for me. <br /> <br /> In the backstage feature included on this DVD, Patrcia Hitchcock says that Grant was the favorite father of his fathers; I think he was wrong. Jimmy Stewart was a better protagonist in a series of Hitchcock's best films. <br /> <br /> With its ruined final, this is really half a movie and it doesn't bring any discussion, and it can't support the high judgments it's getting. Even if the film has had an intact ending, there is not much to do. Fontaine is a completely unpleasant sucker. He must remain numb, inactive and reluctant to contact anyone but Johnny for the entire film, in both endings, for his maneuvers to work. It's not much to work with. Cary Grant starts each line with "Monkeyface ..." until I wanted to strangle him. He says it sixty times. It is positively cross-linked. Hitch's technique here is incredibly superficial. An endless succession of rooms / sets has a fake skylight projected onto the back wall as a spider web effect. And a light bulb in a glass of milk can make fans excited, but it can't save a movie so badly made. <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovich should retire if he does another Hitchcock / Cary Grant imitation on a DVD. I think it's his whole career now. As soon as I saw it, I thought, oh shit, here comes an imitation that only he is struck. Instead there were two! oh joy!
