Words cannot express how scarce this film is. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, the acting is terrifying, after all the whole movie is a joke. <br /> <br /> With a duration of 97 minutes, it is about 96 minutes long. <br /> <br /> It may have been OK as a brief sketch on a comedy show, but the premise is too fragile to work for that time without the boredom quieting down. <br /> <br /> Avoid this, go instead to rent a good movie!
