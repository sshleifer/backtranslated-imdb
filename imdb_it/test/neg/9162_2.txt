Do you know the old saw on the wreckage of a train? What about how you can't look away? This film is not good. The only reason you are still there is because you brought your children and you can't leave them alone in the theater. You could take a nap. <br /> <br /> Tim Hill should never work in the cinema again after delivering this horrible piece of garbage. He manages to take a decent comedian in Jason Lee and turn it into a robotic and insecure actor in this production. <br /> <br /> I didn't have much hope for this film in the first place, I admit it. If it wasn't basically the only family movie in which I could take my son for Christmas, my wife and I wouldn't leave. God, I wish I could go back in time and stop. I approached my wife for about 10 minutes to tell her that I smelled I thought it was, but she beat me on the fist. <br /> <br /> I'm not kidding. It is putrid. David Cross's only outstanding work saves this review from being just a star. <br /> <br /> The plot is cloying, offensive and stupid, as one might expect from a film in this genre (although the recent "Curious George" was blissfully intelligent and pleasant). The acting is mostly poor. The decision to "update" the Chipmunks songs for today's audience was inadvisable at best and at worst. Does not work. <br /> <br /> The old chipmunks were smart, mischievous and clever. These squirrels are stupid, a bit mean, hateful, and in a surprise, needy to the point of being useless. <br /> <br /> Or as a retrospective, a tribute, or as a completely new production, this film totally fails. The final drop? My son couldn't wait to leave. Spend your money by renting Curious George instead.
