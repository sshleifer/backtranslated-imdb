As if the world needed another Seagal movie. Add a group of actors who, well ... they're not really actors, some heavy metal music to compliment rap and, of course, a crazy hot-looking girl with no hips, and we stop ourselves half budget. Why, oh, why do people sabotage themselves by participating in these films? <br /> <br /> The FBI captures two friends and sends them to "New Alcatraz", where the first prison inmate to be executed has unexpected guests. <Br /> <br /> First rate acting all around, especially any scene that involves tragedy for good guys. Seriously though, the director tried, and pulled a modern and hard side for the film the best he could. To have gone too often to the well and HALF PAST DEAD becomes boring too soon. What else can be done when inmates simply talk while hostages continually ask what makes the main villain motivated? An action film without a brain that amounts to little, if not "a-ight".
