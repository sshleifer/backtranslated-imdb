You have an hour and a half of braindead that I must save the action of the world to the end, a ship and a woman somewhere in the equation. This time he plays a guy who helps people in the witness protection program. to quote the cover of the film. Clear their past to save their future. Woppi, this must be nice :) I bet the younger ones will like it, but it's a bit exaggerated for my taste. And the interiors are really something else, and I don't say it in a positive sense. After killing a crocodile he manages to say. "you're a baggage" If you're in the mood, you could enjoy the movie. And as for the braindead action, this is not very bad. But almost before the movie starts, you know exactly what's going to happen. But if you like this kind of movie, you will probably like this. I consider this film 4
