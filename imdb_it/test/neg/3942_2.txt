Stay Alive, Stay Alive, Stay Alive, I'm called attention was the trailer and not the cartel. <br /> <br /> The film's focus on a video I play was created by a countess to kill people and to live eternally is acceptable. <br /> <br /> First of all that ugly horror movie, the blood sees more or less unleashed (spread gossip), these scenes are bleeding are the worst. /> <br /> But in reality (indeed) that film is ugly, very, very, bad, but bad in all aspects. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone, good at the trailer, bad film. <br /> <br /> I don't mind since (how, how) they spend (consume) money and time making these films senseless and too bad.
