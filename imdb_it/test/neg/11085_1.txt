My first post on IMDb must (unfortunately) be telling others not to waste time with The Cavern! There is no history, character development, no fear and no good lighting. It makes no sense. If you like recitatives, people running through small portions of caves, bouncing cameras placed at bad angles and people screaming while the screen is completely dark, you'll love this movie. I could turn off the lights in my house and scream too, and I wouldn't have to pay for the rental. The only thing that scared me is that someone actually made such a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> ... one of the worst movies I've ever rented.
