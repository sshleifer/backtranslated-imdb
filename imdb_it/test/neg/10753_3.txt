I found this film completely and utterly incomprehensible. I knew some facts about Caravagggio, but here they were twisted and disconcerting. The images were strangely interesting but I was looking for more biographical and / or critical accounts of Caravaggio's life and works, not a LSD-like drug trip. The dialogue was very confusing and jumping back and forth through the use of trains, calculators, typewriters and cigarettes was extremely annoying. If it had been labeled as an "artistic film", I would not have bought the DVD; now I have a DVD that I will never watch again and who would buy it? I prefer traditional films, not those that require translation or clarification. Thumbs down on this for me!
