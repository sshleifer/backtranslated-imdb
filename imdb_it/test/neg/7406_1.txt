I can't believe how bad this "movie" is. To begin with, the film is about the Big Foot legend and a group of people who have a close encounter with the creature. The premise is interesting and having Lance Henriksen in the cast (ALIENS) gave "The Untold" a promising prospect. Unfortunately it is as interesting as it gets. It looks like a direct edition on DVD ... or so I guess. This is basically a production-free affair with probably the worst editing (with a constant "fading in black" between each scene !!!) I've seen in my life and acting that will surely make you shudder. Because Lance Henriksen has chosen this is completely unfathomable. And the film takes its cue from any other genre film, from "Blair Witch Project" (The video scene) and "Predator", to "Alive". This is supposedly based on real events, but the only truth that can be found here is how BAD this film is. Usually I'm not a severe critic and believe me, I tried to enjoy this garbage but in the end I didn't. Do yourself a favor and avoid this DVD. <br /> <br /> I will try to say it gently: This film is PURE garbage and made me want to take my gun and shoot my neighbors ... or ask BLOCKBUSTER for a refund !!! <br /> <br /> And Lance, shame on you! 1 * out of 10 *
