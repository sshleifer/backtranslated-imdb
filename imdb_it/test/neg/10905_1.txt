I don't often write reviews here, but I can't stand and let other people suffer for this movie without trying to warn them. This film is horrible and it's not because "I don't know what the director was trying to convey" or "I'm too stupid to understand the plot"; this film is horrible due to bad direction, script and acting. This is the "triple" of the bad production of moves and the reason why the film was directed to the video. Try to be something like "High Tension", "Hostel" and "TCSM" by lifting some of those ideas but it just doesn't work. I didn't have high expectations or even medium ones that went into the film, but I was still very disappointed. He could be very good with a nice environment and a good idea for a movie, but it was wasted.
