1st watch 2/9/2008, 4 out of 10 (Dir-J.S. Cardone): a sexual political thriller that does not perform very well in any of these areas, except at the beginning where there are some interesting soft-core scenes. The film begins by depicting a couple exploring their sexual fantasies in the midst of their work environment or anywhere and in any way adapts to their fantasies. The couple goes on a hike to a shelter and public bath where they come across a woman who is willing to be part of a three-some and fulfill some of their fantasies. At this point, we only know that this couple is wealthy, but we don't know until they return that the boyfriend is part of a wealthy political family. The man hopes to be on the rise to the point of being able to get a seat at the congress after the marriage. Then they receive a package in the mail from an anonymous source with explicit images of their meeting at the bathroom and their qwest begins how and why they were filmed, who sent the package, what they want and how to delete their names before something comes out . This qwest becomes an obsession that takes them deeper into the most mushy worlds and takes a lot of their time, to the point that their friends and family wonder what they are doing all day and why they always seem to be in ruins. This film is interesting sometimes, but it becomes ridiculous as they personally search for the problem instead of soon involving the police because of their pride. This mistake obviously keeps the film going. The performances are fine despite the unnamed cast, but the madness of the situation overlaps and the film starts to become a ho-hum of about half a step. And, of course, they launch a turning point in the end that challenges and challenges everything that happened before (as is the norm these days when they don't know what else to do to make the movie more spicy). This however does not help this movie a bit.
