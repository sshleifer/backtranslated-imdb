"The Love Letter" is one of those movies that could have been really smart, but they wasted it. Focusing on a letter that wreaks havoc in a small town, the film has a cast of stars with nothing to do. Tom Selleck and Alice Drummond were so co-stars in the super-fun "In & Out" (also about a disturbance in a small town), where they were both fantastic, but here they seem like they're taking a drug everywhere. I can't say what the people behind the camera are trying to do (if nothing else), but they definitely haven't achieved anything. What a tragedy, that a potential brawl of laughter has been so sadly wasted.
