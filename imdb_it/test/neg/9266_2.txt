My grandfather gave me this DVD. With friends like these. The cover seemed rather terrifying, I thought I looked at it. What a blood error. <br /> <br /> Basically the film follows three people on a bus and what happens to them involving friends. <br /> <br /> The first concerns a guy who buys a car that talks to him. The second concerns a boy who wakes up to find a clone of cassarole in his fridge. And the third one is about a woman making appointments online but it turns out she has a robotic arm. <br /> <br /> The DVD case voted this film 18 but even a 5 year old child can watch it and not be scard or entertained. The film should have a score of 12 for a slight fear and a bloody dirty word. <br /> <br /> All in all this movie is crap don't get close.
