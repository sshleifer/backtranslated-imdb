I usually spend most of my time writing my reviews while watching the movie, but with Today You Die, I feel it would be a criminal waste of my time. <br /> <br /> So here's a five I don't know how bad this movie is. There was a time in the mid-1980s when one look at Steven Seagal was enough to break your ribs; a frown full of energy could make you lose your feet. If he had actually grabbed you, he would have popped you like a twig. <br /> <br /> These days, although it is still capable of doing considerable damage, it no longer seems the part. He went to sow and he just doesn't know when to call him quit. He walks like he's thrown in his pants but somehow still manages to look constipated, and he's put on weight. His long ponytail has disappeared, but his hair still looks stupid. The way this man continues to work in the film industry is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Today you die is Seagal's usual mix of bone-based fights, car accidents, firefights and pyrotechnics. Seagal mumbles the obtuse script, delivering his lines with zero enthusiasm or credibility. In this third-rate action movie, he plays Harlan Banks, a thief who tries to go straight, who is forced to take part in a $ 20,000,000 robbery. He is captured, goes to prison, flees and seeks revenge. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There are some car chases and rather good gunfights that intertwine with boring things (of which there is a lot), but reading other comments on IMDb revealed that these were actually taken borrowed from other top films. Seagal is also very much doubled in this game. <br /> <br /> Seagal turns into one of the most horrible performances of his career and this is saying something, considering the bad 'acting' in some of his recent efforts. The most exhilarating is Ebonics' embarrassing attempt (African American street slang). 'I da man, fo' sho '?? no, actually Steven, you look like a donkey! With a ridiculous script and plot lines that go nowhere, this film is a waste of time, money and effort. And the final moment, when Harlan Banks saves the kids' house from closing, is enough to blow you up. <br /> Damn it, I just looked at the clock. I was having fun ruining this steaming dreck pile so much, I went well beyond my five minutes. It's time to post this comment and get to look at something decent.
