First, the current description of the IMDb plot seems misleading, the film is about a group of girls picking up a misogynist hitchhiker, who intends to kill them all. They stop at a small motel, where he keeps them hostage, but develops an intense attraction for one of the girls. Violence follows. <br /> <br /> I took it by mistake thinking it was the other 2007 movie "The Hitcher". Not that The Hitcher is better, and I was still looking for a bad movie to watch, but sometimes this was almost unbearable. I think I could throw up on a piece of paper and come up with a better plot than this. <br /> <br /> I can't even count how many movies I've seen with pretty much the same storyline, so this was sometimes almost painfully predictable, but what made it really terrible were some scenes that ... well, let me do an example. At one point a door is covered (very clearly) with blood, and two policemen, on the scene due to a call to 911, look at it from 30 feet away, they see a man, also covered in blood, get out of the door, accept that it seems suspicious, but decide not to investigate further. <br /> <br /> But ridiculous as it may have been, the film was never boring, it was well produced, directed and performed, complete with good special effects, free nudity and violence. I probably wouldn't recommend spending 90 minutes of your life sitting around watching this movie, but it turned out to be perfect to wear while cleaning my basement. Also recommended for shitty movie fans, and it would be a good movie to watch with friends when planning on making more talk than watching.
