On paper this looks like a good movie. Michael Caine plays a strong and ruthless boxing promoter, whose son is ready for a title eliminator. The pity is that when the story is transferred from the card to my TV screen it loses a certain amount. I was hoping that we would see him emulate his definitive role in GET CARTER and as the film progresses it seems to take on the qualities of a tough and tough revenge thriller, but the whole tone of the movie jumps around so much that you'll be confused about the genre in he's trying to adapt to. For example Caine (who you can't believe like Billy "Shiner" Simpson, it's just Michael Caine) has a laugh while referring to someone as "Hattie Jacques", so in a seemingly humorous moment his henchmen break someone's arm. Oh how I laughed. I mean it should cause a laugh as it appears on the screen right? But these seem to conflict with the way the rest of the film takes place <br /> <br /> Obviously director John Irvin doesn't know what approach to take with Scott Cherry's script. Irvin is not a bad director and is well regarded for his war films such as THE DOGS OF WAR and HAMBURGER HILL, but he is not suited to this kind of violent drama and one cannot help but feel a little intimidated by a living legend like Caine. Caine gives the impression that he is doing it only for the money and the familiar faces in secondary roles like Landua and Cranham are basically just cameos that could be interpreted by anyone
