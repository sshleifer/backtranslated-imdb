To start this film he was sick. Here your wife is dying and you are strutting around the city with this chic blonde by your side. Then your wife dies and within 2 months you are together with this chic. Hank (James Brolin) is definitely moving fast throughout the film. I called him Fast Hank. Fast Hank marries this beautiful lady and before you know it she is having sex with her best friends. The part that strikes me is when she "does" in the barn with Kevin and is captured by another of Hanks's friends. Kevin gets up and leaves, she drops her dress and BAM !! Right in the arms of this other guy and they start "doing" it right there and there. I guess he's finishing what Kevin started. HOW BIG !!!! I'm like this is a movie of the time ??? It's a typical OLD MAN YOUNG WOMAN movie that says you can have my body if I get your money ...
