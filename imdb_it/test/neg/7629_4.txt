This erotic derivative thriller remains watchable for most of the way, mainly because a viewer is casually curious to know how it will end, and why the director, Peter Hall, manages to stage a rather hot (and rather bold ). But the ending, even if unexpected, is absurd, and the whole plot (complete with childhood traumas and multiple personality disorders) proves to be unbearable clich√©s, above all as regards motivation.
