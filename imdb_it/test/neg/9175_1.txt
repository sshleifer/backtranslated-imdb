What is night vision? Well, according to the star (Williamson) we see ... a package store owner tells him "it's getting dark out" to which he replies "it's better ........." night vision. "What the hell does that mean? In fact, what the hell is this movie trying to say? It has holes in the plot you can drive through the killer van. Not to mention a cop on duty, Robert Forster sleepwalking through this bizarre attempt to cashing the serial killer mania, and a killer who transmits his murders This is actually all I remember. <br /> <br /> The film took place in Texas, had some car chases and a final clich√©. Maybe if you watch this movie with your eyes closed, could it be good? After all, without being able to see it ... it would do better ..... night vision. Did it make sense? No. And not even this movie.
