when I saw this shit, it reminded me of the title of the movie FIRE, which is where this garbage belongs, in a fire. I don't even know what to say about acting, the fire looked really fake, Andy the chicks aren't exactly supermodels. And finally I don't know what you're complaining about the people who take care of this damn movie, yes happy birthday to me. Well, I guess it could be worse, I could just look behind. And to make it worse, I have the whole set on DVD. fire, volcano, earthquake, avalanche. All I miss is the awesome tornado movie I hear sucking. <br /> <br /> Well, until my next peace in the movie
