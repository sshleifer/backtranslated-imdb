Since this show was changed from TSS (screen savers) to AOTS (show attack) it went down the hill. TSS with Yoshi and Kevin Rose Alex ... etc They made the show fantastic, then they were fired from TSS for an unknown reason. When the show switched to AOTS, it became less important for computers and more for games and magazines. He also promoted bands that no one had ever heard of or cared about. Finally I could no longer see him once Kevin Rose left. He kept it interesting, but he went to do his thing, which is good. Kevin Rose now has several pod pods online and shows etc. On the REV 3 network. Check. REV3.com I think we can get there by going to www.systm.org. If you want a real tech show rather than aots, then go see Kevin Roses' shows or listen to the Wit podcast. <br /> <br /> J <
