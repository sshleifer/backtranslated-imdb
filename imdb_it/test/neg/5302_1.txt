Even though I think the critics who hated this movie have encapsulated exactly what they did wrong (everything!), I had to add my two cents. If you want a long version of how terrible this movie is, read the review of coinlightning. <br /> <br /> Here is the short version: shameless use of the NAMES of the actors to push the plot rather than use their talent (nobody brought their "A game" to this), obvious mercantilism (I imagine Pepsi can afford to stick an ad - or 40 - in a movie now), and a plot (???) so twisted with clich√©s of the "rock star" that it was absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Let me put it this way. . . I was thinking about "Wayne's World" for as long as I was watching this movie, but I wasn't laughing! Every time you try to launch Steven Tyler (Aerosmith) to help with the plot of your long movie you have had SERIOUS problems. <br /> <br /> PLEASE let your friends and family know - this movie sucks.
