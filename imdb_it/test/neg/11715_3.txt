A couple of friends and I visited the video store a few years ago and stayed in one of those moods to rent some unseen cheese films. My friend grabbed the head of the family and we were greeted by a head sitting in a wheelchair. Well, that made us laugh and we decided to make a bet to see who would be the one who had to go to the desk and pay for the movie. Well, you guessed it, it was me !!!!!!!! I've never been so embarrassed in my whole life. We arrived home and turned it on and we walked around the ground laughing for about 45 minutes because this was the funniest movie in the world. I don't remember much, but one thing I remember was the blonde girl dealing with a guy in the back of a store every 5 minutes. That head made me laugh and when I look at other people's comments on this film it makes me laugh even more. The head of the family is so good and the head is fun and I'm still laughing, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
