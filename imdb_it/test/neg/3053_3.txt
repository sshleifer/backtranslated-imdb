And do you know why? Why did they think (or at least make the horror fans think) that a bunch of hideous, raging screaming teenagers, some stupid demons (where do they come from? What is their purpose? Who knows?) And a dark mansion are all you need to make a horror movie. Needless to say, they were wrong. You also need a script, some logic, some rules and some invention. This film has a scene that lives up to its reputation (the lipstick scene, of course), and a couple of funny moments (the description of the younger brother of his mother's cookies, the "don't look at me" scene by Linnea Quigley ). It also has more swear words than any movie I've seen since I last saw "Reservoir Dogs". Literally every fourth or fifth word is an "f ***" or a "b ****". Then again, when a movie starts with FOUR false fears in its first 5 minutes, you know you don't expect anything that looks like good cinema. (* 1/2)
