First of all, I'm not at all a fussy observer of the film. I'm not one of those people who gets films just to distinguish flaws and criticize, I, like most other people, watch myself being entertained. I will practically watch every type of film, no matter how badly someone says it (sometimes a film is made so terribly and written that it invokes a kind of pity humor that kicks me off). Apart from that, the little pimp was simply pathetic. I saw it on TV and didn't know what I was looking at. It was too badly written and poor to be a movie for adults, and he had too much sex, insinuations and swear words to be a children's movie, in fact I doubt that even children would have fun. The humor (generous enough he even called it that) was so pretentious and captivating, I couldn't see how anyone with half a mind could even find it funny. The only thing that made me laugh is how ridiculous people like Bernie Mac can put their name and their time into something so fierce. Luda's character was such a cheap ploy for laughter that it was extremely short compared to his goal. The plot made no sense, the plot had to be the worst sequence of events ever put together on the screen. I could go on, but I want to see what people think of my reaction before I start talking about specific cases of pathetic scenes. All I have to say is that I really have to ask myself how long these writers have spent on their knees trying to make it. <br /> <br /> J
