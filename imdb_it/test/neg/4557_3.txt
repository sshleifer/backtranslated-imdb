Another stink of the PM Entertainment group, and fortunately one of their last. <br /> <br /> 'Firetrap' is indeed a very low budget remake of 'The Towering Inferno' I don't mind Low budget B Movies as long as an effort is put into them - there is no effort in 'Firetrap 'are the stars Dean'Superman'Cain, who is an absolutely terrible actor, seriously has all the acting skills of a porn star, but it turns out to be the best actor here and this is saying something, the rest are just a bunch of hopers given the boot from various daytime soaps. The special effects are just rubbish, the shots that show the burning building from the ground are among the worst I've ever seen, the fire looks like someone scribbled an orange pen in the front of the camera. Also, there is not a character that you are really root for - hate everyone and hope they all die well before the 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The script is embarrassing - the red herrings are well marked in advance, someone else mentioned this but 'The scene where the janitor fights a blazing fire that swallows the building with his broom ... funny, or the same janitor who enters a room marked 'Dangerous material', were these scenes had to be irony? somehow I doubt it <br /> <br /> The only good point and only one good point was that there was quite a bit of action in the daytime soap opera that caught my attention, but so little attention is paid to it been given a full movie, I can't recommend it - Watch 'The Towering Inferno' instead <br /> <br /> 3/10
