Occasionally I turn on the television accidentally after "South Park" and end up capturing part of the middle school humor train crash that is "Mind of Mencia". It's the only time I want my room to be cleaner because I could find the remote much faster. The truth is that Comedy Central needed a substitute "Chappelle's Show", and what they got was a show that appeals to idiots who either miss Dave so much that they cling to any minority variety, or are satisfied with the plain " The Mexicans love the tacos "jokes the blades of Carlos Mencia every week. I have to understand, though, that there are some people out there who actually find Mencia * a fun thrill. I firmly support my words when I say that I believe these people exist only in myth. However, if you're really out there, I just ask that you never enter my residential neighborhood, and read the main differences between Carlos and "Chappelle's Show": <br /> <br /> 1) Dave was fun. It is advisable to highlight this. <br /> <br /> 2) "Chappelle's Show" was FIVE TIMES more angular than Mencia could ever hope to be. Yet every time a promo is released for his little show, everything revolves around him, giving his horn about how it has never been seen before. You got it right, Carlos. And not in a positive sense. Chappelle didn't need to tell people that he was edgy and funny. We almost stopped to see the show to find out for ourselves. <br /> <br /> 3) Chappelle actually had pedigree remarks that plunged deep into different cultures - things that some people didn't know about. Like its game segment "I know blacks". The grand prize was a hair cream that black people use. It is deeper than Mencia would have ever dared to dive. So how dare you call yourself nervous? If Mencia was writing that sketch, the grand prize would be fried chicken and kool help. And my accusations have some merit. I saw a promo for his show (which I fondly called "My TV Monitor Taking A S - t For Thirty Minutes") a few days ago and it was a stereotype of Olympics sketches, which I admitted was a nice fun concept. Then I saw that the Mexican who won received a green card as a grand prize. That's all?! Is it so close to the fire you want to get? Who could NOT think of this - come back to 7th grade? For you fans of the show, if you are ever looking and you miss one of his lines, perhaps because you and your friends were discussing how "Duh-De-Durr" never gets old and is in no way the part of the joke where someone funny would have something clever to say - remember that there are only five possible choices for jokes anyway: green card, tacos, border jumpers, lawn mowers and, of course, duh-de-dur. Just remember - whatever it was, it was screamed. Have a good time! <br /> <br /> 4) Type of relationship with the number two. Whenever he says something that makes a laugh, he stops to tell people (as he laughs at his own joke) that he thinks he "went too far with it". So don't say it for God's sake. Or let people decide for themselves. He and Comedy Central continue to push this tripe down his throat which is such a tell-it-it-it show that it is more controversial than "The Da Vinci Code". You're not. You never will be. <br /> <br /> I was never offended by the content of the show. I would never give him that much credit. I am offended that Carlos Mencia is given thirty minutes to shout in vain. Yes ... I am literally offended by this fact.
