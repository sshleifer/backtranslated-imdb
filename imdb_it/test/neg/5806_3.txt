What could be expected from a play produced by Adam Sandler, Grandma's Boy is predictable and so stupid is nauseating. Allen Covert plays Alex in the film, a 35-year-old 35-year-old who works as a video game tester and has had to move in with his grandmother and his two roommates after losing his apartment. Some usual rounds of plot occur: he has difficulty adapting to his new life situation, which in turn causes him problems at work, which is particularly serious because he is trying to nail one of the new office consultants. He casts a strange boss, an almost alien company star, a real nerd best friend, some scenes in a burned tray shop, a really great party scene, and an original video game that Alex is trying to end up alone in the mix that you have of the grandmother Boy in its entirety. Allen Covert has a marginal advantage, Linda Cardellini is pretty enough for her role as a consultant for the nerd office, Samantha, and a few scenes manage to taunt a chuckle or two but none of them makes Grandma's boy worth much of the time of anyone. Most of the alleged funny "jokes" or "gags" or whatever you want to call them are nothing more than "humor" that would make anyone at National Lampoons embarrassed to look, Joel Moore is incredibly un-fun in his role as a JP video game wizard , and the whole movie actually manages to be boring in addition to not funny or substantial. Well, at least Grandma's Boy did something for someone: Adam Sandler managed to get some paychecks from his out-of-work friends, David Spade, Kevin Nealon and Rob Schneider.
