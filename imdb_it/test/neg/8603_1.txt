Christopher Tookey of the Daily Mail has had some things to say about this movie, including "watch it all the time with its miserable 82 minutes, and I guarantee you will shake your head and ask, 'Are we really down to this?' Yes, we have, because if ever a film testifies to the total cynicism, the blandness and the moral corruption of those who commission and make British films, it is this abomination ". Tookey continues "pointed directly at the clothes with unwashed underwear, dirty minds and knuckles brushing the pavement as they walk, this sexual comedy is so sordid, not very formal and smelly that it is enough to make you stop having sex, and indeed movies, for Life ", before concluding" Sex Lives of the Potato Men "is not just a truly vile film, it is symptomatic of a new national culture of instant self-gratification, humility and sadism that is now celebrated on the screen". Normally I don't listen too much critics closely, but in this case Tookey was stunned with the money. This film goes beyond evil, indeed, it goes beyond being simply not fun and enters a bizarre parallel universe where every painful minute drags on for a now and where the definition of 'hilarious' seems to be' to say 'in a Brummie accent.' It is depressing for anyone with half a brain who grew up with Goodies, Monty Python, Spitting Image, Not the Nine O'Clock News and Fawlty Towers. Ideally, Sex Lives Of the Potato Men would have disappeared silently after its release in the cinema and joined the thorny spin-off Vix The Fat Slags (2004) and the melancholy vehicle All Saints Honest (2000) in the celluloid cemetery, but it seems destined for the infinite filling program late at night projections and misleading "best film EVER!" delirium of people who should know better, so I must apologize in advance for trying to correct a wrong that the British film industry, in all its wisdom, has inflicted on an undeserving world. Yes, I'm really sorry to bring this dead celluloid film back, but I actually remember thinking "It can't be as bad as the critics said" ... but, since God is my witness, it was BAD. <br /> <br /> Acting: from beginning to end, special mention for Mackenzie's legs 'Albert Steptoe on the body of a young' Crook. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack - cut and paste 'ladrock', mostly ska-based lager-lout-friendly pub jukebox that has brought back horrible memories of seeing those chirping cockernee that make the Lambeth Walk to a watered-down imitation special dagger knobs on every single comedy / variety in the eighties ... and 'Ace Of Spades' by Motorhead as the music of the title? What the hell ... trying to conjure up memories of one of the most genuinely exciting scenes ever offered by The Young Ones, actually never offered by ANY comedy show ?! Economic shot, far below the belt. Script - written by a 12-year-old who has just read every single issue of Smut and Zit in a long session powered by Red Bull ... SURE? Come on, can't any real, correct, worldly and adult person possibly put this kind of delayed hogwash on paper? And Mark Gatiss was in ... Mark Gatiss ... the least annoying member of the fans of the League of Gentlemen and the Goodies who take part in this huge pile of flying movie droppings? "One of the most brilliant British comedy stars"? It is no longer not! Speaking of League Of Gentlemen, someone gives me a pair of lead-filled diving boots and Steve "looks like a collapsed rectum" Pemberton and a long weekend in a soundproof room before I die ... PLEASE ... < br /> <br /> Cinema, English or not, doesn't get much worse than that. The Headless Eyes (1971) by Kent Bateman is a new wave masterpiece compared to this hideous smog.
