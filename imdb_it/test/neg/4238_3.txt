Perhaps in his day this film was special. But five decades later it seems strange, just another film relic of the terrible 50s. Stereotypes abound in this soft story of three female gold diggers who opened shop in a Manhattan penthouse in an attempt to attract rich husbands. <br /> <br /> I don't care about the surface theme. But the premise of the film is lame. And the execution is worse. It's a romantic comedy, but I found little to laugh. The plot of an extremely short-sighted child is the only intelligent element in history. The general dialogue is flat, as is delivery. And the script structure is puzzling. The plot continues to jump back and forth between the three ladies. It is as if the writer could not blend the ensemble roles. The result is a plot that seems unstable. <br /> <br /> Marilyn Monroe was a good choice for her role. But Lauren Bacall was too old for the role she played. And Betty Grable, with her shrill voice and horrible hairstyle, was simply annoying. <br /> <br /> Color cinematography is conventional. But there have been many shots with the projection on the back of the screen, contributing to a dated look. The images are made even worse by the costumes that echo the "glamor" of 1950; they are simply horrible. Spectators have to endure a fashion show, a point in the plot that amplifies the way the film's director was struck by those ragged happy rags. <br /> <br /> And then there's that orchestra. In what is probably the worst film opening in film history, the first part of the film has an orchestra that plays an unpleasant sounding melody. At first I thought I was looking at the introduction to future attractions. But no, it's actually part of the movie. And the orchestra plays, and up, and up. It has nothing, absolutely nothing, whatever it has to do with history. What were they thinking? <br /> <br /> I liked Marilyn Monroe, with her breathless voice, as she makes her way through the plot. But the film would have been far better if they had downloaded the other two ensemble roles, downloaded that orchestra, improved the dialogue of the play and downplayed those garish and tasteful clothes.
