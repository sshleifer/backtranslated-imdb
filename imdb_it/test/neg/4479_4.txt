The only romantic thing about this film is the pain and anguish of romance. If you expect this film adaptation of another Nicholas Sparks novel to follow the infallible formula of previous films, such as "Message in a Bottle", "Nights at Rodanthe" and "A Walk to Remember", think again. No one dies from an accident trying to save someone else and romance here does not transform these characters. If anything, it makes them even more unhappy than they used to be. <br /> <br /> A sergeant in the special forces army, John Tyree (Channing Tatum of "GI Joe"), has a memorable two-week adventure while on leave from the army with an emotional college girl, Savannah Curtis (radiant Amanda Seyfriend of "Mamma Mia"), who is spending her spring break in South Carolina. Savannah doesn't drink, she smokes, but she tells John that her head is full of bad words. Inevitably, John and Savannah fall madly in love with love and send endless letters of exchange of love letters that induce them to sleep with any standard. Tyree is in the world at the service of the army in some corner of the world forgotten by God while he is away in college reading his letters in class. Just as they are becoming hot and heavy between them, suicide bombers bring down planes in the World Trade Center. John meets with his friends in a wave of patriotism without discussing the option with Savannah. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, another boy, the friendly but likeable family friend Tim (Henry Thomas of "ET: The Extra-Terrestrial") who has a motherless autistic son, named Alan, becomes the the object of Savannah's feeling. She is the kind of girl who helps build houses for the less fortunate and wants to start a summer ranch for autistic children. It delays what seems forever before finally contacting Tyree with the eponymous letter. In fact, she downloads it for a man with an illness! Later, he confesses to John that he knew that the sound of his voice would break his decision to marry Tim, so he didn't make that call fatal. Predictably, John is tormented by Savannah's lack of communication. During a routine mission, our hero takes a couple of terrorist bullets in the back and ends up in Germany. While all this is changing, Tyree is trying to come to terms with his coin-collecting father, Mr. Tyree (Richard Jenkins of "Step Brothers"), who suffers from Asperger's Syndrome. It seems that his father is at his last legs after John left the hospital. The female protagonist lacks respect and her betrayal of Tyree is a pretty low blow. Tyree, his father, and Tyree's commander, Keith Robinson, are the only characters in this long-term epistolary story. <br /> <br /> "Dear John" gives new meaning to lethargic love stories. How disgusting!
