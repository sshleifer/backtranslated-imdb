4 out of 10. <br /> <br /> This film was neither fun at all, nor was it worthy of investing any kind of emotion in the characters. Eugene Levy is probably the most fun ... The rest of the cast does its job, but the story never gets really deep and there are many holes in the plot that never fill up. This was not very funny, despite being fun at times. <br /> <br />
