"Destroy All Planets" ends up "destroying all of Tokyo" at the end of the film, while a space monster similar to a giant squid falls into the reptilian furnace known as Gamera. In fact, Gamera is saving the Earth from the beginning, eliminating Varian Space Ship # 1 even before the first set of credits for the film begins. The scene switches to a Japanese scout camp where we meet a pair of intriguing young heroes, Jim and Masao, who take part in Gamera's exploits after being abducted by aliens and teleported aboard their ship in an electrified bubble shield. <br /> <br /> It is rather surprising to see the boys convince a scientist to operate a newly invented submarine that may be faulty. Previously the boy Masao's genius had wired the unit to run in the reverse direction of his controls, but Dr. Dobie didn't think he could verify it as a possibility. At least this prepared the boys to interfere with the controls of the alien space ship by playing switcheroo with a group of triangular blocks. <br /> <br /> When the alien boss Viras says "Activate the Videotron", cling to your seats to reappear from previous Gamera movies in which he fights Barugon and Gyaos. These take quite a while to screen, but they don't match the fast forward button if you want to get on with it. For a long time Viras turned to an invisible crew, and when they finally appeared, they were Orientals who could fly - imagine that! <br /> <br /> Given how these films were made for a young audience, it is surprising to see how macabre some scenes are. It comes to mind that Gamera draws the blood, and how about the couple of headless space crew members. When the squid tentacles began to emerge from the headless bodies, I made a connection with the "Alien" movies; having the individual units come together to form the giant Viras was a clean device. <br /> <br /> I believe that the appeal for children could lie in identifying with the two young heroes who make friends with a giant monster, move quite freely on an alien space ship, and get everything they want with the help of the alien technology of telepathy. Given that the film was supposedly made by adults, it could have been a simple case of realization of desire.
