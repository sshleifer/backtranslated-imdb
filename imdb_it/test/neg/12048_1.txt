Who the hell is responsible for this terrible mutilation of one of my favorite books? This is simply terrible. terrible acting, terrible script. The story is not even close to his old self - and what were they thinking? Robin Williams, for God's sake! This really is not the description. Don't see it. Seriously, no. Not even for laughter. Especially if you are a fan of the book. This could be the worst film adaptation ever - everything is disjointed and scrambled - the characters that are important to understand the sequence of events are seriously marginalized and every potentially interesting position in the book has been changed (example: Vienna - New York) in something profoundly uninteresting. <br /> <br /> For those who haven't read the book - it's basically a fictitious biography about a growing writer, who explores his writing and so on. His mother writes an autobiography that is greeted (despite his protests) as a sort of feminist manifesto. The book is well written, engaging and long. His prose is simply beautiful. <br /> <br /> This film, on the other hand, speaks of Robin Williams telling us once again to seize the moment.
