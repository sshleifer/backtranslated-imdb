Please forget this. <br /> <br /> Kristy Swanson and the rest of the cast have made terrible shows. The show is flat, flat, flat. <br /> <br /> I don't know how Michael Madison could have allowed this on his plate. He almost seemed to know that it wouldn't work and his performance was rather bland, so all of you, Madison fans, got lost.
