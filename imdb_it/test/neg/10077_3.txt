(A possible minor spoiler) The first "Jurassic Park" was an effective but stupid film that did its job and was pretty good. The sequel "The Lost World" had some decent moments, but those were ruined by the part of the movie where the T-Rex was unleashed in San Diego. Now in "Jurassic Park III", the little story that was in the first and in the sequel, was thrown out of the window and replaced by just 90 minutes of basically non-stop action, which would have worked if the film hadn't been like that bad. <br /> <br /> Sam Neill is back as Dr. Grant, who is given a proposal by a couple (William H. Macy & Tea Leoni) to come with them to an island to help them find their son , which was lost for over 2 months. But obviously this island seems to be populated by dinosaurs and of course the plane on which it just happened crashes leaving them stranded with a lot of dinos after them. <br /> <br /> This was obviously intended as a thrilling journey, without a real story, but even at that level the film does not offer. Director Joe Johnston ("Jumanji") somehow managed to take the little magic left in the "Jurassic" movies and squeeze life out of it. <br /> <br /> Dinosaurs seem okay, even though they are all "just standard and not very scary. The bottom line is that it is not a very good film, not even a thrill. * on 4 stars .
