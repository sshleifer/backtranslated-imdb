I really don't understand who this film is for. Just because of the absurdity of it, not to mention the ridiculously bad acting, the cheese dialogue, and the fact that the villain is a child, I imagine this was meant to be a children's movie ... but I think there may be more dirty words than Pulp Fiction, not to mention the constant references to drugs and general chaos and killing, so what demographic is it trying to please? This film is too schizophrenic, like trying to combine country music with heavy metal, in the end no one will like it because it's a bloody paradox. I would recommend this film because it is so funny (in a negative sense) except that the actors are so obviously unbearable that I would not suggest otherwise. <br /> <br /> I am completely serious when I say that I could not watch more than 15 minutes of this. Terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiible
