This is the worst movie I've ever seen. If I wasn't looking at it for free, I would never have finished it. The creators of this film should be ashamed of themselves. It looks like this should be a movie in the wake of Scary Movie and Date Movie (a terrible movie, but 10 times better than this), but failed miserably. The only lines in this film seem to be based on slapstick. A guy falls, someone gets hit by a bus, etc. None of the ideas is smart, basically the worst premise for a movie ever. The plot (or lack thereof) is completely delayed. The plot seems to center around the coach and his family, however there are so many other things happening in the film that it's completely ridiculous. Terrible and terrible film.
