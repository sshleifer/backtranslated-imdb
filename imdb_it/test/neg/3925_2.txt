This film is poorly written, difficult to follow and presents bad performances and dialogues from the protagonists Jason Patric and Jennifer Jason Leigh. The credible but weak premise (the undercover narcotic agent succumbs to the drug underworld) deserved better than the flop of Lili Fini Zanuck. The competent support cast (Sam Elliott, William Sadler, others) was not enough to save this film. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, this film also contains the worst love scene in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the soundtrack is largely overrated; in particular the revolting, without substance "Tears in Heaven" of the legendary Eric Clapton. <br /> <br /> "Rush" is completely exhausting from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
