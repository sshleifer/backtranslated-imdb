This film takes a look at the suffering that a family experiences with the death of a child and the healing that can finally reach them. <br /> <br /> The family learns of their son's death on Christmas Eve, 1991, ruining the Christmas season for them. They don't celebrate it for many years yet. There is an interesting comment from her daughter that will remind viewers to consider the needs of surviving children in such a situation. <br /> <br /> The character of Matthew refers to Jesus, but I suspect that other comments he makes come from non-Christian sources. I wonder if any other viewers will recognize these comments. If so, it would be an interesting addition to the data in this film.
