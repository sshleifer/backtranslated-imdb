I think the film was one-sided I watched it recently and found the typical documentary of western movie producers that was biased without substance. The fact is that prostitution exists everywhere in the world, not only in Tanzania and not because of this fish trade, there the prostitutes were there before the Russian and other businessmen arrived in Mwanza. Poverty is truly endemic in Africa, not to mention Tanzania, and this is not due to the fish fillet business, in fact the fishing industry has helped millions of people support their families in their daily lives. This film tarnishes the beautiful image of this country that loves peace. As for the arms trade, the film cannot prove if there is any truth in that, looking critically at the films that cast doubt on the director's authenticity, it seems that they are trying to prove their point by using some characters that can be done for something really. Yes, Tanzania is a poor country, yes, there are prostitutes and street children, but they are not the product of this business, it is just a common scenario in most poor countries, indeed all over the world even in the western world. .. What a pile of garbage. <br /> <br /> The pilots themselves are talking about sending weapons to Angola, which is more than 2000 km south of Tanzania and the war was in DRC even miles away from Mwanza, the director could not demonstrate how these weapons were transported from Mwanza to the DRC! <br /> <br /> In short, the films lack concentration and respectability, it is easy enough to find the character anywhere in Africa and has nothing to do with the nightmare or the fish fillet of Darwin ... ! <br /> <br /> The truth is that the Nile perch has not decimated all the other species in the lake contrary to what the film portrays and even less than 25% of all catches from Lake Victoria are exported, the rest is consumed locally we make sure that it is correct.
