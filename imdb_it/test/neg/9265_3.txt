I acquired this film a couple of years ago and trying to find some information about it I discovered that even the powerful IMDb hadn't listed it. This should be all I needed to know. <br /> <br /> With Friends Like This is an anthology that sounds like a collection of episodes of second level Twilight Zone / Outer Limits all linked together by a bus journey that never really seems to tie in with the rest of the film. Of the three stories, the only one I got from any entertainment value was the second episode in which a man (of a certain kind) grows out of bacteria in a kid's refrigerator. This episode wins points for some points of humor and is a bizarre premise. Apart from this there is an episode with a talking car (bland and without direction) and an episode in which a girl visits a truly unique dating agency (my dog ​​guessed the ending of this). <br /> <br /> As mentioned in other comments, the score of 18 is completely unjustified. There is nothing to offend here. If you are looking for a good horror anthology, take a look at Asylum or the Creepshow movies.
