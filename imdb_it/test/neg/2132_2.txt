movie I've ever seen. Actually I find it one of the funniest episodes of MST 3000 I've seen. Not that it was nice, but for anyone who has seen Manos: the Hands of Fate knows that this was not bad. The monster of the movie looked terrible, everyone wore shocking swimsuits and the plot was ridiculous. I still have no idea why they created the monster, they never really gave a good reason. The female protagonist had to be the most gaunt girl I've ever seen. They would have done better if they threw the girl who had been killed at the beginning as a leader. On the plus side the dolphin recitation was exceptional !!!
