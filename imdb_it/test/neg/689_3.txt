This film is a cinematic collage of gangster clich√©s. The writing is level z and the plot and plot are built without care or logic. It's a mess of stereotypical gangster shepherds (think of the Bugs Bunny cartoons) and stupid supporting characters (the doctor and the writer). There are much better Bogart movies out there. In fact, Bogart seems to have slept during this performance. It puts very little effort into this character. I think the directing council he received is something like "He's a bad boy, you're doing wrong." This boy is the equivalent of the era of Darth Vader; obvious, bad and the anti-hero. Don't waste time with this.
