Piranha starts as planned, stupid whites going to discover new lands and exploit them. For a while I thought it could be a cannibal movie. It starts like so many others, showing nothing but shots from the pristine Amazon rainforest. As far as I know, it could be Florida. At this point you will understand that animal or native mutilations will appear. Instead you get the acting talent of William Smith, who starred in L.A. Vice and Angels Die Hard. Suona Caribe, an acclaimed hunter, whom I would like to describe as Jack Palance Light. He is bigger in stature, but not exactly the goodness of Jack Palance. As for the natives, you don't really have that many. Where is the piranha? Should I even ask that question? Caribe now hunts humans, I guess. He doesn't chase anyone until the end of the film, he stares at them. Caribe runs one of the tourists on a motorcycle in a too dramatic way by Smokey and Bandit. The challenge of the motorcycle takes place without a real reason other than an action sequence. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a tourist challenge a stranger to a jungle motorcycle race. Never really live, do they die? Are you interested? Does anyone want to run on motorcycles? Attention: this film has an extremely dry appearance. My advice is to rent a Jack Palance classic like Craze.
