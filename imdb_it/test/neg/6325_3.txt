If you read the "Mad Max" plot summary, you have just ruined the first 1 hour and 10 minutes of the movie. You also found out that "Mad Max" takes place in post-apocalyptic Australia, which will help you because otherwise you would have no idea what's going on. The film, made in 1979, really tries to be "A Clockwork Orange" (1971) by Stanley Kubrick, only that film, in all its strangeness, really makes sense and leaves an impact. This film does neither one nor the other and ends up being a joke full of car / bike stunts that crashes like any vehicle in the film. <br /> <br /> The first thing that goes wrong with "Mad Max" is that he tries to sell himself as a tale of revenge when no vigilante seems to take revenge until the last 20 minutes. If the first hour has been condensed to 20-30 minutes and then the last 20 added and then another hour added, "Mad Max would be an action movie with a great protagonist, but Mel Gibson has to wait and act like a sissy for 2/3 of the movie and then have a sudden epiphany to take revenge I still have to watch the sequel "Road Warrior" and I have to admit that I'm excited about it just because I want to know This first movie was mostly a waste of time. <br /> <br /> George Miller does great action things here, but his exaggerated symbolism is absurd and the unbearable cheesy reaction sequences every time a character discovers something horrible like a burned hand or the one he has completely ruined those moments. It is a technique of the film B terribly clich√©. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no thematic value or a subtle critique of the company in this film matters what you might think: a great science fiction film of az ion, at least, makes sense, but random violence is free, strange motorcyclists say nothing of value. Even the criminal Toecutter feels modeled by Alex of "Clockwork" only uglier and unimaginable. Violence against the PC does not allow the violence of this band to settle and get a reaction from the viewer, it only does so if it does. <br /> <br /> I will give credit for the amount of things that the film crew exploded and crashed into things and Miller does a great job making you feel the intensity of the collisions. Everything else is mediocre and after an hour of mediocrity, you get something good and the movie ends 20 minutes later. I'm just crossing my fingers "Road Warrior" will meet expectations on where this film ends, otherwise it's more time wasted. ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com
