"Menace" is not fun. He tries hard, too hard. but rarely brings a smile. There is no acting, only aggression. One of the main characters wears a silly face on his face for the entire movie. There is no doubt that the less talented Wayans brothers acted, wrote and produced the film, were completely blind to their lack of talent. <br /> <br /> Menace consists of a series of non-playful skits, with a joke. The final punch can be seen a mile away, but you have to wait for everything to take place. No zippy one-liner or a snappy dialogue here. Only one scene after another until the joke. The jokes themselves are youthful. Loc Dog (the one with the perma-grimace) talks to a beautiful woman - but then he has ... bad breath and then he takes his nose and then, he waits (remember you always have to w-a-i-t) flowing! How much fun is it? Ten-year-olds might find it funny because they would never have heard jokes like many other times before. Alternatively, if you like to watch movies that are completely drunk or drunk, you will be able to follow them and even find them funny. The challenge gets drunk enough to reduce your mental state to the level of the film without fainting.
