I speak ill of G.I.J.:T.M. especially because I think something was missing that G.I. Joe had. Yes, he had something that G.I. Joe had no famous cameos of Don Johnson and Burgess Meredith, but I think G.I. Joe: The film lacked the passion for the characters that the G.I. Joe TV series has had. Most of the artists with the ringing voice sounded really dead and were about to die at any time. It's a good movie, but I wouldn't say it was the biggest movie in the world. I.M.H.O. :) <br /> <br /> Although violence is what G.I. Joe was built to say that Serpentor hitting Duke in his chest is not the best way to get out of Charlie Adler's character. Neither of them saw Golobulus remind the commander of Cobra why he had been chosen to lead the Cobra forces and then be horribly mutilated after failing to deliver what Cobra-felt was rightfully them. <br /> <br /> It wasn't the best way for the GI Series Joe to go out but it's better than nothing. :)
