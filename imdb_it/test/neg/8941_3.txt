As much as I love trains, I couldn't stand this film. The premise that you can steal a locomotive and "drive" from Arkansas to Chicago without hitting another train along the way must be right up there, on the Plot lines. Imagine two disgruntled NASA employees stealing the "crawler" that transports the shuttles back and forth and driving it to New York and you get the idea. <br /> <br /> That said, it's a nice attempt. Wilford Brimely is at his best in his Quaker Oats, and Levon Helm performs well as his dull but well-intentioned partner. Bob Balaban is appropriately vicious as the corporate Guy, and the story of the "little boy takes Goliath" gets another airing.
