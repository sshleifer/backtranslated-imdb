The young and dreamy Ashton Kutcher (like Tom Stansfield) wants a date with the sexy blonde Tara Reid (like Lisa Taylor). Mrs. Reid thinks that Mr. Kutcher is gay. Kutcher works for Reid's father, a Terence Stamp anal retainer (like Jack Taylor). Kutcher agrees to "housit" for the boss, believing he will bring him closer to Reid. Mr. Stamp has an owl called "O.J." which becomes a cocacola. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to make sure your "G-rated" pre-teens are ready for the "R-rated" raunchier rate. It will help if they have never seen the plot before, and in particular how the potty's humor. Remember, people are paid to behave this way. <br /> <br /> ** My Boss's Daughter (2003) David Zucker ~ Ashton Kutcher, Tara Reid, Terence Stamp
