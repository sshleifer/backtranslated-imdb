When I voted I was going to give a 2, but seeing that 1 meant terrible he hit the nail on the head. The portrait of Native Americans as bloodthirsty savages disturbs me deeply. This is the third film I saw of D.w. griffiths in which the races of men are stereotyped in an ugly way. The man is unable to tell his version of the story, so I will try to stay away from personally attacking Mr. Griffith. In my opinion, the three films have probably influenced the thinking of millions of people and their children's children. Movies like these are probably made for many of the resentments that are still with us ... Some might say that the camera work was great, the action was the first time. the negatives, it is as if someone took $ 10 from you and returned a coin to remedy.
