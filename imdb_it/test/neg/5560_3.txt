This is a stupid movie. Like many of these karate films, it is poorly written, uncomfortable and sometimes simply stupid. The action is not really all there and the film in general leaves much to be desired. Everyone here talks about jive, they do bad karate and they do a bad job of acting. <br /> <br /> Watch for Scatman Crothers in a small role, he is too good for this film in general. Jim Kelly is good at karate, but he's a terrible actor. Gloria Hendry is really bad. All of them are, there are so many parts to this movie that they make absolutely no sense. The alleged love / run away with Hendry and Kelly, what the hell was it? They destroyed that man's guitar for no reason! <br /> <br /> And then there were the obligatory girls on the trampolines !!! What was it now? They were in the film for five seconds, so you never heard them again !!! Then there is all the racially charged element of the film, which is beautiful and everything, but in this film it is not going anywhere. As I said, this is good for laughing once but not looking at it anymore.
