Despite a totally misleading advertising campaign, this film turns out to be a clich√© of a home infested with annoyed discontent, with a totally unlikely ending. Clue # 1 for everyone considering seeing this turkey: Sam Raimi didn't direct it. Although the commercials for the film represent his involvement, he is actually one of the four producers. Too bad that someone as talented as Raimi allowed his name to be used in conjunction with such a poor film. I don't think he would have directed anything like this; this task was left to the Pang Brothers. <br /> <br /> The script of this film seems to have been put together by several other "horror" films, so in "The Messengers" you will find absolutely zero original content. "What we get is a scene here and there that has been torn directly from" Pulse ", a couple that could come from" The Birds ", one or two from" The Others ", etc. Almost every scene, almost every line of dialogue is one that has been removed from any number of other films, all making a film so predictable that almost anyone will be able to understand the "surprise ending" long before it arrives. <br /> <br /> Right here would be a good time to point out that campaign advertising, centered on the idea that only children can see ghosts, has nothing to do with this movie. In fact, everyone can see ghosts, teenage children and characters their mother certainly sees them, even very early in the film. I am sure that anyone involved in marketing invented this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have a box office, which otherwise would be completely absent. so don't get in Maybe the one who misses the most in this film is something that looks like chemistry between the actors. It's just not there. All interactions are embarrassed. Coupled with the trivial story and ridiculous story holes (just what is a guy who murdered his entire family still lurking around the small town where the murder took place, anyway? Has anyone ever thought of arresting him?), All in all a profoundly unsatisfactory ghost film that manages to surprise anyone over the age of ten with low-cost shots: loud noises, visual flashes and anything short of a covered figure that pops out of a closet and screams "Boo! " All we get for our money this time is another badly made movie about spirits trying to warn people from a home. If there is a message that "The Messengers" offers, it is "Don't waste your time with this movie".
