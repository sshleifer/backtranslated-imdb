Beware, My Lovely (1952) Dir: Harry Horner <br /> <br /> Production: The Filmmakers / RKO Radio Pictures <br /> <br /> Film thriller from the commitment of the pioneering producer of Collier Young and Ida Lupino, alias The Filmmakers (with Lupino launching in an unaccredited direction). <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan is the "danger" and Ida Lupino is the "woman" in this voice in the film "woman in danger". Ryan plays Howard Wilton, a wounded psychotic tramp (noooo, Ryan? I know, hard to believe). Lupine is the lonely war widow, Helen Gordon, who hires Howard to do some work at home. Things come down from there when Howard takes Helen prisoner in his own home. <br /> <br /> Howard has a bad secret, not that he could reveal it. See, conscience is a real challenge for him. Keep it, that is. He has an unfortunate habit of coming to see his dead employers. This is part of the film's problem. The nature of Howard's psychosis is so extreme that it is almost impossible to believe that he was free to wander from one city to another without obstacles, even in the year 1918 (when the film is set). He remembers nothing of what happened ten minutes ago. His violent, threatening and antisocial tendencies are triggered by the smallest and most common things (a young girl who flirts, inadequacies that lead to war, because of his refusal to serve). I don't know how he passed the interview with Helen. There are other implausibilities. If you were locked in the house with a madman, but you left yourself alone for periods of time, couldn't you find a way to escape? <br /> <br /> Ryan, I think, is defeated by the material. He seems to be exaggerating with his hand. His series of tics and spasms and tightly coiled dementia explosions have all been felt - and done - with that robotic feeling. At this point in his career he has probably played this character, to a certain extent, ten times and shows it. We are encouraged to empathize with Howard (I didn't) through the shown pieces of humanity, as if he were stopped in his tracks by a music box and his relationship with a group of children who won't judge him. Lupine only needs to behave in a frustrated and distressed way, which she is more than capable and capable of doing. <br /> <br /> The image has something going on; what would be the possible resolution of the conflict? So naturally, there was a disappointing ending that was abrupt and ineffective. <br /> <br /> Of minor interest was a recurring motif in which the camera would capture Howard's reflection (in mirrors, in water, in Christmas tree decorations). This indicated something that was happening, or was about to go on, in his head. Horner (Vicki 1953), who made his reputation in production design, does a good job of making the house feel like a prison. Also credit, the RKO art department always reliable for work at home. In the end, the sub-standard work by the principals, who all have much better films to their credit. <br /> <br /> * Â½ of 4
