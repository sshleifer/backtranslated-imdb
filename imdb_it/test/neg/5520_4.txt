Strangely, it's Fred MacMurray who plays the most "fucking" part in this broom comedy. Carole Lombard shows a beautiful performance that combines lighter moments with a background of drama and seriousness. <br /> <br /> As usual, Fred MacMurray remains a mystery to me. The camera is not his fan, he is not so attractive, and he does not have the style and the panache to pull off this role similar to Cary Grant. <br /> <br /> Ralph Bellamy is excellent as the kind friend get back to life through his relationship with the character of Lombard. One can only wonder why his character did not want his kind and reassuring love instead of the almost certain ruin of MacMurray's disability. But this is Hollywood! <br /> <br /> The image almost works but the sign is missing, mainly due to MacMurray's performance. It would have been nice to see Grant or even Clark Gable in his role. Lombardo and Bellamy are largely credible and likeable; MacMurray is stiff and makes you want to keep it at a safe distance.
