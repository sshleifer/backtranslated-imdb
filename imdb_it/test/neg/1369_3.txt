I was a teenager when he first appeared in theaters and I saw him in Japan. The plot of the film was not my cup of tea as in my second year of high school, but I went to see it for the 3-D trial. It had been advertised in the press so that even service personnel abroad had heard of it, even though it was never screened at the Post Theater. <br /> <br /> The film started the trend of launching objects to the public, which was taken at absurd levels with subsequent 3-D films. <br /> <br /> I don't know if this qualifies as a spoiler, but you have been warned if it is. In many films of the time, the actors often worked in front of a "rear projection screen", in which backgrounds could be projected to make it appear that they were in a different environment, like a jungle background when the actors were actually on a sound stage It works well with normal movies, but when viewed in 3-D, they look like a flat scene behind the actors. There were several scenes in the movie where the rear projection was used, and it didn't work well in theaters. If seen in 3-D, it will be another disappointment. <br /> <br /> The only importance of the film is historical, since it was the first of its kind.
