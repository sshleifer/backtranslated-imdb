Burt Reynolds plays Gator McKlusky, a sympathetic ex-prisoner who has just been released from prison who helps the feds catch a sheriff of a small corrupt town. Reynolds has often been accused by critics of merely calling these "good old boy" performances; true, it's in autopilot everywhere. But in his time, Reynolds knew how to make a low-key effort for himself. Energizing and beautiful, Reynolds approaches the public's wink without getting hurt; he seems to know these backwoods and any movie star, while director Joesph Sargent offers an easy pace and a sweaty environment that brings the South to life. Unfortunately, the story is not much, and supporting actors Ned Beatty and Bo Hopkins do the full (as usual). Diane Ladd is fine in a small part, and the daughter of real life Laura Dern can be glimpsed in the background. Reynolds is back in this character for "Gator" from 1976. * 1/2 from ****
