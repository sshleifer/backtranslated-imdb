Ghost Story has an interesting premise of feminist revenge, veteran A-series actors, colorful flashbacks with nice old-fashioned look-a-like counterparts. ghostly and detached music that announces the horrors coming, the New York winter climate and an excellent charismatic actress in the lead role. Ghost Story could have been much more effective in black and white and in eliminating some of the most unpleasant special effects and presenting a more convincing script (we shouldn't ask ourselves why the two parkish-trailer acolytes are in the script) Wassan (definitely separated at birth from Bill Maher) who, perhaps from editing or bad acting, is totally ineffective. He seems to "specialize" in reaction shots with wide eyes; not much personality here. The revelation, however, is Alice Krige, pale, enigmatic, terrifying under the placid exterior. However, her Eva Galli is fearful even before meeting her destiny; I mean, a young woman who says things like "I'd like to take a bite from you" or "Dance with me, little toad!" it is not already in the land of the living. Ghost Story would have been much better in a low-key mode, Val Lewton. Exaggerated special effects completely negate the cooling factor.
