This show lasted for most of the 1980s and had its moments, but the plots were usually flat and often painfully little amusing. <br /> <br /> Terry Scott and June Whitfield were wasted on this sitcom, both deserved better, but it does provide some good memories and I found myself smiling in some repeated scenes. June Whitfield's talent for comedy is sometimes allowed to shine (when it's not an obstacle for Terry) and she's really smart. <br /> <br /> The 80s are the last ten years in which you will find this kind of middle-class, middle-aged comedy, and many people remember it fondly, but I prefer to remember the decade for the alternative comedy and pungent satire of Spitting Image.
