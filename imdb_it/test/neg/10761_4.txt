It makes me beat how anyone can judge this movie very highly. It is not an understatement to define it as exaggerated. The way the guy managed to build a labyrinth of underground wooden rooms in a short space of time is pretty ridiculous or maybe he was the greatest carpenter since Jesus came. The obese sheriff played by Hoyt Axton looked like a refugee from the Jerry Springer show and I found the female lead Jennifer Jason Leigh rather simple. We have an expression here in the UK 'lamb made from lamb' that suits her perfectly. It wasn't that bad, I enjoyed it immensely when the end credits ended and "The End" was brilliant enough for this TV movie hot spot that if it was a movie it would have been put on video and in discount stores. in no time.
