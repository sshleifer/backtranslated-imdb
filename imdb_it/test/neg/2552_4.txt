First of all "the Mexican Werewolf in Texas" is not a werewolf movie. This title is a bullcrap. The story is about a Chupacabra who kills all the villagers in the small town of Furlough, Texas. I suppose the distributors renamed the original title in order to earn some extra money or something. And I guess it really works because that's why I bought this piece of shit, it looked so stupid. However, the film is not good. Actually it's damn terrible. But I didn't expect anything else when I bought it. It's a low-budget horror movie with a Chupacabra monster. If you like low-budget horror films with bad dialogues, actors and a little blood, then you should check out this movie. But I have to warn you, this movie is really baaaaaaad. <br /> <br /> This film has some of the worst performances I've ever seen. Actors strive and become completely ridiculous. They almost never say a joke in a normal way. They always have this completely wrong tone about everything they say. It's so stupid that it almost looks like a bizarre parody. It's like they shoot every scene just once and they were happy. The worst of all is the blonde girl who should play a baby. It is the worst of all. I've never seen a bad actor like her (and I saw Pteradactyl). Even when his boyfriend dies he can't stop being a child about it. I hate her. <br /> <br /> Some of the shots in this film were actually quite good. Those that were shot during the day are all pretty decent for a low-budget project. But most of the film is shot in the night when the Chupacabra hits and the lighting is too dark. The gore scenes are few and short, but really grizzly and violent. The effects are really fun, but that's how I like it. The Chupacabra looks pretty messy, and it's easy to see he's a complete guy. <br /> <br /> Overall this film should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget films and it is very important not to watch it alone as you will probably get bored to death. I recommend watching this movie with your friends and beer.
