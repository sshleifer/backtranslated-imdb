I give "Flashdance" a lower rating of 1 in 10 because it is nothing more than a series of music videos with a short film surrounding music videos, in order to time as a feature film. Since when does this count as a movie? Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens, an aspiring 18-year-old dancer who, incomprehensibly, has a job as a welder at a steel factory in Pittsburgh. It is not a line of work that most older women can find, much less an 18-year-old just out of high school. Meanwhile, at night he works like an exotic dancer, who never takes off his clothes, in a greasy bar with a spoon called Mawby's. Yet, looking at the well-organized and well-groomed choreographies that girls make every night at Mawby's, it looks like they worked in the best casino on the Las Vegas Strip. <br /> <br /> Alex ends up with a predictable novel with his boss, Nick Hurley (Michael Nouri), who is about twice his age. After resisting Nick's advances, going out with the boss is not a good idea, he doesn't waste time going all the way with him after their first date. Alex and Nick make no effort to hide their relationship at work, which makes no sense as you are likely to watch Alex's colleagues. <br /> <br /> When Beals is not doubled for the many dancing sequences in the film, his character spends most of his time getting angry. Alex's dream is to get an invitation just for an audition at the prestigious Pittsburgh Conservatory of Dance. Inexplicably, when her boss / boyfriend helps her take the audition he always dreamed of, she throws a burst of anger at her. He says angrily that Nick is not auditioning because of his speech, and then gets out of his car in the middle of a busy tunnel. This is just a scene that leaves you wondering what the creators were thinking when they were doing it. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Alex eventually gets his audition at the Conservatory. He starts to do a choreography before the advice of the Conservatory which is so ridiculous that one might think it was in a film marketed for the MTV generation. Oh yes, it's a dance routine in a movie marketed to the MTV generation. <br /> <br /> I don't think I can judge whether the Beals can actually do well based on what I saw in "Flash Dance". This is because the character who is forced to act is so badly written, that I don't think it's a clear litmus test of his acting skills. <br /> <br /> You must deliver it to the creators of "Flashdance" though. This film is proof that the poorest film production can be covered by a brilliant marketing campaign. In this case the best-selling soundtrack and music videos awarded for the heavy rotation soundtrack on MTV. If they had devoted more energy to writing the script, then they could have invented a plot and a story with characters I cared about. Instead, what we get are serial characters put on ridiculous scenes that any viewer with a functioning brain can't take seriously. A truly unforgettable "film".
