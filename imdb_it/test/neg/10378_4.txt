Is the Cannes controversy really esoteric, or is it that we Americans are so insensitive and cynical that we no longer have to worry about reading between the lines? However, with careful analysis, "Falscher Bekenner" never seems to live up to the controversial controversy that presumably led to Cannes in 2005, a bewildering and aimless film that lives up to its American glum -title (" Low profile"). <br /> <br /> Building on familiar themes of Bourgeoise's anxiety and subsequent sexual liberation (type of), let's face it is a film not devoid of superficial interests. It starts with the hoarder, while a haunting shot of a desolate off-road road focuses on a teenage tramp, who eventually walks on a total car, where presumably a brutal hit and run has left the driver dead a bloody mess. Stunned, he does nothing but collect a fragment of the remaining engine. <br /> <br /> Just out of school, the vagabond appears to be Armin Steebe, a product of the German suburbs with minimal ambition. Persistent pressed by his caring but somewhat annoying parents to find a good job, he endures an interview after the interview with every snooty interviewer with him, each with the same unsuccessful result. Becoming ill with this, his aforementioned meeting on the highway soon provokes his first act of rebellion: claiming responsibility for the crime he did not commit. Pretending to fill out more questions and to go more and more bizarre job interviews at sunrise, he takes part in sexual fantasies on the road and small acts of vandalism after dark. As the days get shorter and the nights get much hotter, he continues to live in his suburban neighborhood as if he were not doing anything extraordinary. <br /> <br /> If you seem confused about what exactly is happening, don't worry about being the only one: this is the most distant and coherent in history. The plot seems simple enough, and perhaps because of seemingly direct aims is why "Falscher Bekenner" becomes unnecessarily complicated, in love with endless false conclusions, dreamlike situations and graphic sex scenes to try to illuminate a story without logic clear to an already vague argument (presumably the supernatural effects of modern suburban heath, or something about the fascination of youth for crime.) Hey, it could also be an emerging film.) at hand. He spends a lot of time creating numerous symbols, both tangible and surrealistically allegorical, but it seems that they are not really symbolizing something interesting. <br /> <br /> The most fatal flaw, however, is the way in which filmmakers paint all of his characters in a crude vanilla shade. There is hardly any distinguishable trait to help understand their purpose, and how the secondary characters (in particular the confusing relationship between Armin and his rather normal - perhaps too normal) family catalyze the "situation" of the already underdeveloped protagonist, never focused. How should we identify with the rebellion of this young, almost adult, with little sense of the world in which he lives or the leading figures that surround him that help him to understand it? <br /> <br /> Many people come in and out of the movie (including Armin's girlfriend, Katja, and a strange and wealthy visitor who for some reason finds pleasure in seeing the protagonist eat brownies) and seem to exist for no reason. In the end they seem to be just a prolonged padding for an already thin story with useless subplots that continue to show that the film is drawing a total void on where to go next. <br /> <br /> And even a film that presumably plays with reality (especially with Armin's nocturnal exploits), ends with a literal, almost moralistic scratch that seems to stop the questions from a "story" that makes little but that puts its spectator in a state of perplexity without meaning. <br /> <br /> Without any color, it is impossible to blur something vital into
