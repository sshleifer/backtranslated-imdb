Good God. <br /> <br /> I will say right away, I only watched 20 minutes of this movie. Since I'm an avid fan of Eraserhead, the "what, can't you watch a black and white movie with anything from no dialogs?" the defense does not apply. I simply can't watch TERRIBLE bizarre black and white films with dialogues without dialogue. <br /> <br /> This film is what happens when you give a distressing gothic child with no talent and nothing to say about a camera and budget, and leave him / her to put on the screen all nonsensical offensive images. It was clear from the beginning that this film should have been 5 minutes long (assuming it should exist at all). Strokes that should last a few seconds drag them for minutes, because the director has the "I-Only-The-love-the-sound-of-my-own-voice" syndrome, and refuses to cut to another shot until whole movie was seen From the moment the girl in the mask started to masturbate the corpse of "Dio" (the opening scene of the movie! Gioia!), I knew it was only a matter of time before turning off the tape. After at least 10 minutes in which another corpse was being dragged around, shaking, on a rope, by a band of mysterious cloaked men, I realized that it was time to surrender. I rarely give up on a movie. I sat across the entire Blair Witch 2: Book Of Shadows, though not happily. This did not deserve the 20 minutes I gave him. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Eraserhead, DO NOT let the comparisons of this movie take you to rent this piece of amateur junk. Allow me to refer to Tetsuo: The Iron Man, for a watchable and amusing piece of inconsistent black and white oddity.
