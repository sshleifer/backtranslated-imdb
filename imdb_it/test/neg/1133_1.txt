I was out of town, visiting an old friend. After dinner, speaking, he expressed some reservations about his daughter's boyfriend. She is 15, she is beautiful, intelligent, athletic, and even the young man is of an excellent family, likeable, even athletic (if not equally intelligent). I told him he could simply feel the normal paternal concerns; however, a few minutes later, the young man arrived, with his DVD of this film, which had apparently been anxious for some time to share with others. <br /> <br /> These people have a real home theater set-up, with a screen that exceeds 4 feet, and the two young men preceded to see it, while the young swain proceeded to exalt his virtues almost frame-by -frame. <br /> <br /> I've seen enough in a few moments (and with a certain fascination in its awfulness) to approve all the most critical comments I've seen in the scan of some here. <br /> <br /> I have told my friend that I would not have come so far as to disqualify the young suitor only on the basis of his appreciation for this work, but it certainly seems to justify his strict supervision. <br /> <br /> Some gestures are so ugly as to be good: the classic "Plan 9 from Outer Space"; and, in my opinion, the wonderful Bruce Jenner / Village People works, "Can not Stop the Music." <br /> <br /> However, this simply remains firmly in the terrible category. <br /> Second / third / fourth "bananas" - even the best of these (eg, Tim Conway, Don Knotts, all with Seinfeld) have great difficulty carrying on a series starring (or, like here, film). And these were great supporting characters in their original situations. <br /> <br /> The character of "Eddie", actually at the 5th or 6th level of banana in Griswald's previous films, and he never added much to these, in my opinion. Randy Quaid is a capable actor who has performed well. His contribution to the previous "Vacation" photo was average, at best. Both he and the other cast members, many of whom have done a good job in the past, have done nothing for their efforts here, except to make some payments of a few years or some IRA contributions. <br /> <br /> This whole presentation --- story, performance (from lead to support) couldn't be worse.
