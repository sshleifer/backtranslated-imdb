I know that this show gave a lot of liberation to women in the late 90s and early 2000s, but come on! You have a whiner, a buzz kill and an over-analyzer. This show really made women look bad. I can't STAND Carrie's analyzing every little thing on this show and that's what really killed him for me. Moreover, Charlotte's complaint about her non-existent difficulties made me suffer ears and Miranda's cynicism was a complete buzz. I mean, can't he just be happy? Samantha was the only pussy on the show and the only one worth watching. There was also a good episode where Nathan Lane was on the show, but that was the only one worth watching - the rest of them was pretty much the same. The humor was drier than a bucket of sand, and the plot was not very interesting. All in all, it's not a very good show and I'm glad it's over.
