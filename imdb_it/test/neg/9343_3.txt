I do not understand the exaggerated good criticism of this film, except that many people from Venezuela are understandably very excited, based on the fact that Venezuelan cinema is really a bit behind those of other countries in the region. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film is too repetitive, many scenes are almost identical from both main roles, so you have the impression that it is a filler of time. A good time is also a good point, since this film is definitely too long with 105 minutes, you will start to tire yourself after a while and look at the watch. <br /> <br /> All the actors are pretty bad, except for the Venezuelan boy Edgar Ramirez, who brings some slapstick and plays the role of the Venezuelan recruiter "Pedro". <br /> <br /> By the way, this is not a representative film about the people of the region (Caribini area), it tends to ridicule them.
