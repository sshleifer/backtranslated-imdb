An airplane carrying some scientists and a prototype of a DNA machine, a powerful and revolutionary inventor, falls into a jungle in the Pacific. The insurance company sponsors a rescue expedition, commanded by Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), owner of a huge corporation, owner of the prototype and father of a scientist. There, the group finds the remains of the plane five miles away from the intended location and from the car and the remains of the people. Moreover, they realize that a Sasquatch, a kind of Big Foot, is chasing them. This movie is so ridiculous that I don't know what I'm doing, spending time in this junk. The director is horrible, the actors and the lines are horrible, copying parts of "The Predator" and even "The Blair Witch Project". To sum up how ugly this film is, his best scene is when Marla Lawson, the character of Andrea Roth, gets injured, and the expedition guide says she has to give an injection of tetanus vaccine. Andrea strips off his jeans and the guide says: "Beautiful butts, but the blow must be in your arm". Ridiculous! My vote is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Sasquatch, O Abomin√°vel '(` Sasquatch, The Abominable') <br /> <br />
