Many questions arise about the making of this film. The first of which is: Why make a film that develops as little more than an awkward feminine fantasy? It is one thing to leave an audience with problems to discuss about the intent of a film, it is something completely different in the process of writing a script that fails to adequately address the real human problems before they are rendered on screen. <br /> <br /> Why is the soundtrack scandalously melodramatic and often comical? Why is excessive and often clumsy dialogue? Why is the protagonist's girlfriend one of the hooded kidnappers? What purpose is to transform the freedom of the main character from kidnapping into a joke by making him complete his "mission"? (This is a classic moment of the Little Aussie Film. Appeal to the extravagant comedy in the most inappropriate moment.) Why so many scenes in which absolutely nothing happens? (This explains approximately 15 minutes of the film, which lasts at least 30 minutes.) Why, if a man is imprisoned for so many days, doesn't he try to make a serious escape attempt? <br /> <br /> The director, who co-wrote the script, failed in many ways to provide a satisfying story. <br /> <br /> Dave Garver, Australia.
