Pretty. <br /> <br /> Beautiful actresses and actors. Rather bad script. Rather frequent "let's crawl to our undies" scenes. Rather right F / X. Quite unsettling location decisions (the college dorm room looks like a luxury hotel room - probably because it was filmed in a hotel). Pretty simple plot. Quite horrible dialogue. Pretty places Pretty annoying editing, unless you like the flash-cut style of the music video. <br /> <br /> This is not a guilty pleasure - this is more embarrassing. If you have to watch this, choose a good dance / techno album and turn off the sound of the movie - you'll see pretty people in their beautiful black underwear and you'll probably follow the story without problems. <br /> <br /> The cast might be able to act - I doubt anyone could seem clever given the lines / plot they were dealing with.
