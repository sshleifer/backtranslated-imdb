I'm starting to wonder, after reading some of the opinions here, if I watched the same movie as the other reviewers but after checking my facts I am forced to the sad conclusion I have. <br /> <br /> This wannabee witless screwball comedy has to be one of the longest 94 minutes I've spent, and one of the dirtiest things I've seen in ages. Now don't get me wrong, I love screwball comedies, but this boring, set-bound drivel falls so far from the dizzying heights of Preston Sturges and Howards Hawks that it doesn't deserve (mix my metaphors) to be thought of in the same breath as those great ones. Screenwriter / director Charles Martin's dialogue is neither witty, subtle nor interesting - and there is much of this. He doesn't even know how to end a scene, with a ruthless cut, especially of people who come out of the rooms and greet each other, the rhythm of the film would have been revoked and the fact that the limited number of characters is making fools and things without motivation for any Another reason that this should be a comedy would have been a little less obvious. The characters in this film fall in love and love each other, and move in and out of the apartments, at a time just to move that little story that is forward. One moment people desperately search for one person, the other marry someone else - after courting and courting off the screen, so we don't know anything about it until one of the characters says, "Oh, get married!" (Usually after that someone has made a false step or jumped to the wrong conclusion). If we had known that these two characters were in love or had to be engaged in advance, we, the public, could have enjoyed the experience of seeing someone teasing in front of them. Since the characters present themselves as selfish and petulant idiots and we have no sympathy for any of them. <br /> <br /> The sets are limited and the action is limited to them in a way that makes it look like a badly turned theatrical game. The only moments of relief from boredom are Keenan Wynn who seems to have wandered from a different movie and decided to hang around and be a little more fun than all the fun little things that surround him. <br /> <br /> Highly avoidable.
