From 1936 to 1939, Peter Lorre made a series of successful films by Mr. Moto. While technically B-movies, they were much better made than the typical films of the genre. However, Lorre got tired of making these highly repetitive films and told friends that she wanted to get out of the series. When he was canceled in 1939, Lorre was thrilled, but his plans to get more complicated and satisfying roles didn't materialize when he moved to Columbia Pictures. ISLAND OF DOOMED MEN is one of these films and it's quite obvious that the studio isn't putting too much effort into the film, because I think the plot was written by penguins. Talented penguins, maybe ... but the film still has little meaning. <br /> <br /> Start with a guy who agrees to be an undercover agent for the government. He will have to infiltrate an island in the United States where something strange is wrong. Now they could easily have a search warrant to do so. But, since the penguins were writing the film, the agent takes the rap for a murder he didn't commit and spends a year in prison for it. Apparently he hopes to be released on this island, since many words are sent there when the term ends. <br /> <br /> There are some more serious problems with this idea. First, they only served him a year before he was released, but he was convicted of murder and refused to reveal who he really was. They would never have affected anyone in a case like this. Secondly, what happens if he has not been released on the island? He would have spent a whole year in prison for nothing! Third, why not just have divers or paratroopers or boat cops come to the island ?! Talk about a fictional plot! <br /> <br /> Once on the island, the agent discovers that the evil Peter Lorre created his private prison and employed him with the boys on probation as a slave. What about the men who have to report to their officers for probation? This was never explained, but Lorre was using them to extract diamonds and they were treated abominably. Now, another question I had was that if Lorre was discovering huge diamonds there, he was a very rich man. So why not pay people for my diamonds ?! Why create your own version of Devil's Island and beat and savagely kill men ?! <br /> <br /> In the end, Lorre gets what is his and the island's slaves are released. Unfortunately, at that point, I really didn't care. Overall, watchable but rather stupid. Lorre's career improved only when he moved to Warner Brothers the following year. With films like ISLAND OF DOOMED MEN, I could see why his stay at Columbia was short.
