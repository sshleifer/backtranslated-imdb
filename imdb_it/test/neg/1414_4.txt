I liked the discreet character played by Laura Linney in "Love Actually", and she's very good at "Man of the Year". <br /> <br /> But wow. Robin Williams is not giving much of a performance, with a couple of small exceptions this was weak. Laura Linney may not have been a mixed bag, but either editing violated her character, or this was just a sad performance by director Barry Levinson. <br /> <br /> And I think Barry Levinson has grown old. So many weak performances, these non-homogeneous results must be attributable to the management. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum are great in supporting roles. Goldblum plays a tasteful left side, and the combination of Walken with the manager and commentator of the film is wonderful. <br /> <br /> But the plot is a clich√©, the presentation looks like it should have (should be) a real good image and too many actions are uncertain. The rhythm, the story and the direction are all weak, compared to, say 'Head Office' (a parody of 'Secret of My Success').
