I like a good novelty song. No, I take it back. I love a good novelty song. I absolutely disdain GGROBAR on the other hand, and I have from the first note I've ever heard. When I found out that someone had made a comic based on it, my head almost exploded. Now that I saw him because my children begged me, I wish my head had exploded. He would have saved me from the heartbreaking misery that was this cr @ pfest. First of all, doing a one-hour show based on a three-minute song is a ridiculous idea. To lengthen a song like this, which had to sound like crazy just to be so long, in an entire hour, it's even more ridiculous. This was poorly written, cheaply animated, acted badly ... the list could go on and on. Dear God, it's always so bad.
