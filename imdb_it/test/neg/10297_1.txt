This must be the worst thriller I've seen in a long time. The direction, the acting and the adaptation of the plot leave what may have been a good plot in a waste of meaningless time. In a few minutes of watching the film it was easy to understand the whole plot and then there are more obvious clues very soon to leave no mystery. I imagined it in the first few minutes and kept hoping I was wrong and to my dismay I was not. <br /> <br /> The film begins with two FBI agents who drive to a remote city to investigate a murderous spree that left three witnesses, a young girl, an addict and a policeman. They are interviewed separately by surveillance cameras and each tells their own account of the day. Everyone has something to hide about themselves and the day unfolds as they tell their accounts. This part is probably the saving grace and if developed could have improved this movie. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: The whole story ends up being agents of the FBI agents and the girl is the only one who has understood this outside and so left unharmed by them. <br /> <br /> Why do they go through the whole trail of interviewing three witnesses and bonding with the girl if their idea was to kill them in the first place? How did they escape by pretending to be FBI agents (when you find out that the real FBI agents were killed and their badges were found on them)? How did they know how to install and use surveillance cameras? <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond are so unconvincing from beginning to end. Perhaps the idea is to develop their characters for revelation at the end. Come on, both look ridiculous, stupid and not minimal. Even the girl's character is a wasted potential. There is no meaning for his actions and no meaning to which he prefers to tie in his ordeal. It does not seem anguished, but rather detached that is not explained again. <br /> <br /> Terrible film overall.
