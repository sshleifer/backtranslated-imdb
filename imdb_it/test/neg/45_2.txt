This was a decent film for the first half. Too many cheap BOOs! moments but the tension builds up, the bad guys are disturbing and everything seems to settle down well. Children are not particularly deep but hey, which works for teenagers. <br /> <br /> So it becomes ridiculous and tries too hard - "why in the world would they do it?" moments overwhelm anyone's ability to suspend disbelief, the turning point involves too many ridiculous coincidences, and the title comes from a belated attempt to philosophize meaning in the film that goes nowhere and is quickly abandoned. There was a laugh in the theater at times that shouldn't have been funny at all. <br /> <br /> Excellent premise but only poorly written and does not hold. Some very beautiful shots but they are difficult to appreciate while you are rolling your eyes.
