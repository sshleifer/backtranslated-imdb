What can I say? This was a horrible movie to watch. I'm usually not very critical of gay cinema in general, since most of it is usually low budget, but that really pushed me to the wall. I mean, did it happen at gay cinema? Didn't gay producers and directors learn anything from the films of Gus Van Saints and Ang Lee? The mere fact of having to pass the entire film was like being in a dentist's chair and extracting my wisdom teeth. I kept praying for moments when I felt any connection with any of the characters, but it never happened. Most of the characters' performances were not very convincing. It was like watching one of those special movies made specifically for TV on a local access station. I can't tell you how disappointed I was. I was watching this movie after being a big fan of Tori Spellings in other works and the directors worked hard at "Latter day saints". It was definitely not worth the wait. Surely, a few hours of my life I will never come back and I certainly won't buy it on DVD.
