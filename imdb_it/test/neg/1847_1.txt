This must be one of the worst movies I've ever had the misfortune to see. The general idea of ​​a coronal mass ejection affecting planet Earth with an EM interruption is fairly fair, but where did they get the idea that humans could survive a sustained 155ºF? The acting was so terrible that I got the impression that the casting agents just grabbed a handful of people from Santa Monica Boulevard and threw them in front of the camera. In all honesty I saw less acting in wood from my ironing board. Sorry, but this film was poor, poor, poor.
