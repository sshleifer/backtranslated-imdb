The main word that comes to mind when considering this film is "doubtful". This is a low quality film biography of one of the most iconic artists of all time. The Gloved One deserved better. <br /> <br /> Before entering the flesh of my thoughts on this biographical film, I must say that there are two things that I found effective. The first was the use of movies and interviews with fans at certain points in the film, especially in the scenes that describe the first series of accusations of child molestation. I believe this has contributed to a certain authenticity that has * been severely * lacking in the rest of the film. The second was the sequence that describes the courtship of Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. I do not want to comment on whether I believe marriage was a forgery, but from many accounts, it was a relationship in which care and affection existed between the two parties involved. This one really came across this film; Flex Anderson and Krista Rae had a decent enough chemistry to do it. These success points are enough to keep Man in the Mirror far from the 1-star state. <br /> <br /> Having said that ... there wasn't much else here that worked. Very few actors looked like the people they were supposed to portray, the most egregious of those who played Elizabeth Taylor, Janet Jackson and Diana Ross. Furthermore, the absence of Jackson's music was a huge loss. How can you actually tell a story about him without his music ?? I understand that they have not been able to guarantee their rights as an unauthorized production at low cost; it seems, however, that if you can't have a man's music in a movie about him, you could also pack it and go home, because you're missing an extremely important part of his life story. /> <br /> The characterization of this Jackson film also bothered me a little. I do not mean that he was upset and that perhaps some chips were short of a valuable meal, but here he was portrayed as something that comes close to the mentally disabled. I don't think Jackson, known for being a clever businessman, would have been so naive about how the adult world works as it was meant to be in this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, the way this film was written was nothing short of shameful. Many lines or dialogue exchanges were extremely trivial, such as Michael and Janet's "Tinkerbell" exchange, or absurdly, like Michael's "Love Blanket" comments. Furthermore, the writers don't have exactly a talent for subtlety. There was a lot of telegrams about upcoming events ("What could go wrong?") Of lines and extremely obvious hammering of themes and motifs in the film (if I had heard the word "believe" again ...). This is what ultimately blocked the film as something that can be considered incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> Maybe when we have a few years, or even a decade or three, removed from Jackson's death, someone will be able to bring his story to life in a more deserving movie. At that point, we could have a better perspective on his life, and someone will be able to present a really thoughtful exam about who Michael Jackson really was and what it meant for the entertainment world. This very dubious biopic wasn't that movie.
