Last week, Friday, I went to see "Snakes on a Plane" with my friends. It was incredible compared to this horrible movie (however, many scenes were ridiculously hilarious). Basically, some women have a Mayan curse where they harm innocent garter snakes that, instead of sticking, crawl into them are victims. The girl with the coca bag is quite warm. The title screen says "100 passengers ... 3,000 poisonous vipers!" Scary, I know. There were not even 100 passengers on the train. Just a couple of stoners and other losers washed. It is worth spending five dollars to see the woman turn into a huge CG snake and devour the entire train and then get sucked into a huge vortex though. It's just sad that someone does everything to make a shit movie, just to earn some money because of the "Snakes on a Plane" craze.
