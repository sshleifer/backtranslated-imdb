That distinction must go to THE DUNGEON OF HARROW. At least Ed Wood's misleading attempt to make a quality science fiction film had the dubious "stellar" power of Bela Lugusi, Vampira, Tor Johnson, Criswell and Lyle Talbot. THE DUNGEON OF HARROW has no redeeming qualities. What could have been an interesting and suspenseful plot about an aristocrat abandoned in a colony of lepers, perhaps in the style of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU or MYSTERIOUS ISTERIA, is swept away by the heavy dialogue and the monotonous recitation of amateurs whose lines sink like lead weights into a sea of ​​stupidity. The "special effects" that took place in someone's bathtub further ruined this film in the dunghill. Even the treatment of leprosy is something that comes from a Victorian interpretation of the Bible. The fact that leprosy cannot be contracted by an individual in its final stages belies the plot that the aristocrat Fallon and his lady, Cassandra contract the disease and end up as the original occupants of Castello De Sade, condemned to madness and cruelty inhuman. Interestingly, no cast members made another film. No wonder, talent generates talent; the lack of talent generates oblivion, which is where this film should find its deplorable end.
