My wife and I never got into the movie. We thought it was the way of sloooowwww and many subtitles. I understood that they needed them for Vietnam, but it took a long time to get out of Asia. Wanting it away, I said it would come better. He never did yes, they had a hard time trying to get to America, but I wanted to see him watch and find his father. .I love watching a movie to feel good is not sad in the end. I know they don't make many good movies today. I think action movies are the only ones to watch. I rented a lot from netflix and now it's been the blockbuster, maybe 20% is worth seeing. Not kneeling realism or facts just a movie is fun and makes you feel good.
