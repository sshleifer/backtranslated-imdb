This film is everything but the true story of Phoolan Devi. Director Shekhar Kapoor's claims are counterbalanced by the fact that he made the entire film without once meeting with Phoolan Devi, whose life this film is supposed to be based on! The excuse was that meeting the woman would interfere with the director's conception of history! The film wastes the opportunity to raise awareness about the plight of low caste women in Indian society and ends up being a stereotype that portrays Phoolan Devi as an angry woman whose only motivation is revenge. No wonder, this Shekhar Kapoor film was successful in the west as it satisfied their non-Bollywood tastes!
