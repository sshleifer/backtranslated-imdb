Has anyone else noticed that this version is basically a remake scene for scene of the 1933 version, with some scenes removed? It makes me think less of a film that does it, showing a precise lack of creativity. In all honesty, I tend to be biased in favor of Katharine Hepburn, but this version of the film looks like cinematic plagiarism. The 1933 version was beautiful and sweet, although a little uncomfortable in the presentation and transition, sometimes, and then this version took the script, the music and even a good part of the scene that blocked the previous version. I don't understand the point of making the film once again when the method of redoing was fundamentally redoing the George Cukor film with all the same except the people who work there.
