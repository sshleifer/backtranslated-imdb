Is this "realism"? If Rivette was trying to give us a ground-level study of a woman in a certain place and at a certain time and how she was able to influence (and was influenced by) the world around her, she failed miserably . The most important because we never had the slightest idea why thousands of men would follow her in battle. Certainly there is not enough exposure of the cultural / historical context to define the country's need for such a savior and, God knows, there is nothing particularly charismatic in Joan as presented here. Unless Bonnaire's wooden readings and flat-line readings are not indicative of transcendent faith and determination. The use of the landscape is particularly uninspired - we never lose the feeling of watching the actors of the twentieth century wandering in an apparently medieval landscape. And as for the battle scenes (which, contrary to what some commentators claim, occupy a good 15% of the rates) - they seem to resemble some of the History Clubs of your local high school that recreates a medieval siege, even if children undoubtedly put more passion in it. I will give credit to Rivette, however, for imagining a side of Joan left out of other films: that of a petulant, naive, and narcissistic teenager (played by a woman all too clearly at least twice as much as the character he should portray) evidently incapable of to understand his place in the movement that is helping to create or the world existing outside of his own passions. Joan's indignation towards his own soldiers who blasphemy and amazement at the enemy for their lack of respect and obedience to her are notes spontaneously out of place and credible (suddenly you understand that such moments must naturally have occurred) in a "representation" historical otherwise not engaging. Unfortunately they also serve to indicate precisely what is not indicated on the screen: what made Joan special? I must say that I continued to be perplexed and frustrated by some lovers of foreign cinema who amount to boredom and lack of dramatic involvement with "artistic skill" and "seriousness". Does this film really increase our understanding or involvement with the topic? Or with anything for that matter? 4/10.
