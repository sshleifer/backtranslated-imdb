It's hard to imagine how the gripping Dan Brown novel "Angels and Demons" could burn as much as this film version. Here are ten reasons why the film was a failure. Because of the spoilers, please do not read unless you have already seen the movie. <br /> <br /> (1) In the film, there was no love relationship between Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra. Worse, there was not even the chemistry between the two main actors. <br /> <br /> (2) The breathtaking places of Rome, as described in the novel, were not visually realized in the film. I am aware that director Ron Howard has encountered difficulties in filming outdoors. But there are higher photographic representations of Rome on The History Channel than in this film in which the Eternal City was presented in an eternal movie. The great works of art described in the novel have only been briefly described in the film. The magnificent sculpture by Bernini of the "Ecstasy of Saint Teresa" was only momentarily glimpsed, and the western relief in Piazza del Vaticano was not visible at all. <br /> <br /> (3) The director's most insipid choice was in the depiction of the deceased pope who actually resembled the beloved John Paul II. In the novel, the Pope is clearly fictitious without any resemblance to any true Pope. <br /> <br /> (4) One of the most colorful (and important) characters in the novel, Maximilian Kohler, director of CERN, was cut off from the script. <br /> <br /> (5) There have been numerous cases where the lines of dialogue were incomprehensible due to extraneous background noise. <br /> <br /> (6) There were times when the faces of characters were not visible due to the shadows and illumination of the chiaroscuro film. This technique worked in the films "The Godfather", but Ron Howard is not Gordon Willis. <br /> <br /> (7) The College of Cardinals was a rather heterogeneous group with one of the voters speaking in a Southern accent. This guy would have been more at ease on a Texas ranch than in the Sistine Chapel. <br /> <br /> (8) The crucial relationship between the Camerlengo and the deceased Pope was not defined in the film. This relationship was central to the theme of science against religion and the Illuminati relevance to the plot against the church. <br /> <br /> (9) In the novel, the character of Hassassin was an unforgettable villain. In the film, the role of that killer character was a villain of the cartoon. <br /> <br /> (10) On the whole, the filmmakers did not trust the success of the novel. <br /> <br /> In the novel, Langdon makes an impossible fall from the sky and into the Tiber River. In the Ron Howard film, it was the same film that landed in the Tiber.
