I like Kevin Bacon and Cathy Moriarty, and I love Mary Stuart Masterson, but the film was not good at all. There wasn't a nice character in the picture, and the plot was almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> Ms. Masterson is a great actress, but she never brought out the "tough girl" character. (He had similar problems with his character in the SECOND DAY OF Christmas.) Maybe he should have avoided these characters, especially those with a hateful female daughter to play from. Evan Rachel Wood was not at all impressionable. His character was a brat, simple and simple, and no young actress could have given Harriet any positive feelings. <br /> <br /> In the interest of full disclosure, I couldn't even finish looking at this photo. Forty-five minutes of my time is enough to waste.
