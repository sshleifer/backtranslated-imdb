This film had the largest advertising campaign that no film has ever had in Russia. "Epic film on Russian culture", "Great saga of the Russian spirit", endless articles and interviews. For me, this film was the biggest disappointment. The main character played by Oleg Menshikov is a stupid immature boy ready to create his companions because of a woman who doesn't even look like a lady. What is there to admire? In the first part of the film the story does not develop at all. The scenes of the popular festival seem to boast of Russian audacity. <br /> <br /> I respect Mr. Mikhalkov for his previous work both as an actor and as a director, but this film demonstrates his ambitions of being considered the "Tsar" of Russian cinema.
