This was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the "Night Gallery" shows in 1971. The episode featured Sue Lyon (of Lolita's film fame) and Joseph Campanella playing a baby sitter and a vampire, respectively. The vampire hires a babysitter to watch his baby (which appears to be some sort of werewolf or monster) as he comes out at night for blood. The babysitter is totally unaware of the appearance of the vampire when she sees it for the first time and starts doing two and two when she realizes that she has no reflection in the mirror, she has a strange collection of books in the library about the occult, and she feels strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child. He realizes that the man who hired her may not be what he thought he was originally. Shoot out the door, the vampire comes out puzzled and the episode is over. I don't know what purpose it was to make an episode so short that it lasted only 5 minutes. They should have simply expanded the previous episode from those same 5 minutes and skipped this one. A total wasted effort.
