What a nuclear bomb of a movie. The story is not going anywhere and it is nowhere to be found. Leave the theater-goer with one arm and say "that's it". What happened to Redford. He was once a loyal actor. Now he thinks he can appear on the set and do some scenes and it's a take. Mistaken. What an unexciting film. I don't mean to be so cruel, but how disgusting a movie is. Incredible amateur shit. If I were in this movie I would be so embarrassed that I wouldn't show my face. I tell you what, if I have been associated with this film, I am in big trouble. This film will go down in the annals of making films like the king of bombs with which everyone else will be confronted.
