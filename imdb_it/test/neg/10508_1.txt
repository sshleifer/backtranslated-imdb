DO NOT avoid this movie. Simply because it's so ugly that it's absolutely fun. It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was so bad that my friends and I were able to laugh at every single moment of this movie. Sometimes we actually discussed whether it was so bad on purpose, but we're pretty sure it wasn't. The characters appear out of nowhere as if they had already been established, the scenery constantly changes in the middle of this warehouse, and the Vampire Assassin ends up having about 6 climatic fights with the enemies before finally reaching the vampire's head. You will also be able to enjoy the one and only face of Vampire Assassin as it never changes expression despite its obvious attempts to do so. So if you want to see a movie that will make you laugh hysterically then I suggest you do it until you come in with an open mind. Don't expect a good movie, wait for the worst ... and it will be even worse than that. I seriously want to buy this movie and put it on top of my selection of comedy films. Right next to Anchorman.
