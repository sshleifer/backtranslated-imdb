The director of this celluloid rejection specializes in terrible exploitative films in which the claim is everything; the previous year he did "Dangerously Close" whose good idea (on the gangs that gain too much power at school and the school editors against them) was plunged into a sea of ​​sloppiness, and would have continued to do "Cyborg", Jean Claude Van Damme's worst film ever (not a small feat). This aspiring comedy about a girl - Kathy Ireland in her film debut - who is a total girl whose inner creature is only awakened after she falls to the center of the Earth and has a series of abused adventures, impossible to follow (mainly involving a series of dwarves who want it because it has big bones - go figure it out!) before you go home for the better, it's not fun, addictive or fun. And everyone who looks to greet Miss Ireland will also be discouraged - not because of his voice, but because he spends most of the film buried under tons of loose clothes, with huge glasses to boot. No wonder Cannon, the producers, are out of business. Surprisingly, Kathy Ireland has made better films since then ... or maybe it's not that surprising. Next to this, "Barb Wire" is "Aliens".
