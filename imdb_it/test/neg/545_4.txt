The basic idea of ​​INCANTO D'APRILE is excellent: two very unhappy wives meet and decide to pool their funds to rent an Italian villa for a month. To further support the costs, they get two other strangers. What makes it interesting is the relationships both before and during this holiday - in particular, showing how this beautiful setting really changes their perspectives on life. Unfortunately, this good idea is totally ruined by two key performances in the ensemble cast that are so bad that they ruin the film. Ann Harding plays the most important role in the film in a way that makes her look ridiculous. Her "doe-eyes" expression and vacant looks really make you wonder if it's not a zombie movie or that she wants to be an idiot! And to make matters worse, Reginald Owen plays such a hateful and generous character that I've been very close to closing the film - it was so horrible and unbelievable. I noticed that at least one reviewer gave this film a 10 - which is very, very difficult to understand. Of course, the film has a great atmosphere and a good plot, but these two incredibly stupid performances cannot be overlooked while they undermine the rest of the image. Sorry, but this movie was painful for a re-make!
