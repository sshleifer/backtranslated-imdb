overrated, badly written, badly acted. Has the academy even looked at this? I do not believe. the political content guaranteed it an Oscar nomination - indo-pak border - a kid, terrorism. anything with the word "terrorist" gets attention in <br /> <br /> this post 9-11 world. It's like the Holocaust movies that are guaranteed an Oscar nomination, regardless of their merits. <br /> <br /> and, please, cinematography does not mean taking landscapes that are quite beautiful in the first place. you must be a rotten shooter to ruin the desert. at least this did not win the Oscar. they understood at least. it would have been a parody.
