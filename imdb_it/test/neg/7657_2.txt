This film has more goofs than any other movie I've seen in my life. The special effects are damn terrible. For example, towards the end, when the Concorde is falling after the cargo door is torn, the thing turns like a toy. The special effects of Airport (1970) are definitely better than this shit. Furthermore, the strength of a Concorde that opened at altitude and speed would have substantially transformed the thing inside and out. (Or if it opened for nothing) But the film has its good points. Especially when it ends. This is also poor. For example. The Thing lands on a snow-free snow bank, if that were the case, it would splinter into a million pieces. Overall, 2 out of 10. Instant flop. Great laugh.
