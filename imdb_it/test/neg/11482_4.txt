I was expecting a lot more from this movie. The preview seemed interesting, so I decided to try it. The conclusion is that "The Adventures of Sebastian Cole" had only one decent thing: Adrian Grenier. <br /> <br /> I really like Grenier and found his performance very pleasant. The character was designed well, but everything else is simply a drift throughout the duration of the film. Clark Gregg is really good, but I don't think his character has been explained too well. I mean, there's not much to explain; he wants to become a woman. Still, something was missing. <br /> <br /> The film's obvious low budget was good to see. I liked the fact that the film was only shot on a screenplay (a bad one) and only a few actors. It was a nice change. <br /> <br /> Although the main idea of ​​the film was actually acceptable, it was disappointing to see a lot of scenes that had nothing to do with what was thrown here and there. As I said, the script seemed promising and I have to say that I was interested to know where he directed the director Tod Williams, but it was basically a very slow film with a not too good dialogue. <br /> <br /> "Sebastian" started looking good towards the end, but again, he fell back into a hole. The acting was mostly good, the script needs some work, yet the film's budget helped him in the long run. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to someone if they wanted to watch a quiet film with a strong protagonist, but other than that I would like to stay away. Personally, I wouldn't look at it twice.
