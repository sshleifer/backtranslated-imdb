A few years ago I saw The Scent of Green Papaya by the same director. My feelings for both films are actually the same: beautifully shot, but terribly slow and boring. I saw this movie in a preview and left after half an hour. I could not do it anymore. How can you make an interesting film about people who constantly talk about how happy they are and how perfect their lives are .........? I had a fantasy about a G.I. American forgotten, still wandering in the Vietnamese jungle, who did not know that the war was over. How he would suddenly appear in the film, and he would start to empty his M16 from the characters in the film. The red of their blood would make a beautiful contrast to all the green plants in the film ........... So I wasn't really into this movie! Time to go!
