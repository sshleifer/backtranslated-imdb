I don't know, but the film was too similar to other films I've seen. The Ring, The Eye, Dark Water, are all the same for me. Don't get me wrong, it's done beautifully, a beautiful photographic work, fantastic graphics, but that story is too ... too common. In the end, it's the score that makes the suspense, you know: the screams, the grumblings. Even the characters in the film do not react very naturally, moving very slowly, surprised by everything they see. I know some people who love this kind of film, and if you do it, being a well made film, I guess it doesn't hurt to see it. But if you saw the movie I mentioned above and didn't like it, I'd suggest you don't bother.
