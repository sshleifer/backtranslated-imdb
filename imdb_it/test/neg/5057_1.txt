We apologize for any spoilers this contains. But if you want to read anyway: I really wonder why so many people are so tall on Kevin Williamson. Let's take a quick look at your work as a screenwriter, right? There's Scream 1 and 2 (plus the story for the next one), which I think are pretty funny but very overrated. Furthermore, by making Scream a franchise, it has stopped becoming a parody of horror films and has simply become another one. Then there is that I know what you did last summer, which is essentially the same movie again. He co-wrote Halloween: H20, but he too had the good sense not to take credit for what he did on that monstrosity. Then comes The Faculty, which I can only say was terrible. (Lots of fun to make fun of, though). I haven't even started talking about the ridiculous soap-operatic Dawson's Creek, I could think about how bad it is for hours. So we get to teach Mrs. Tingle. First of all, there are tons of little implausibility in this. For example: in most high schools I know, valedictorian is NOT the only one who can go to college! The idea that the character of Katie Holmes would never go anywhere had it not been valedictoriana was absurd. Never heard of financial assistance, dammit! Furthermore, I do not think you are expelled from high school or do not enroll in university due to the betrayal of a test. There are many others, but now I'll jump on the big one. The ending really bothered me: they committed a crime, but it was ok because the teacher was a bitch. Great. Do you know how many of my teachers I was able to kidnap based on that logic? I'm sure the police never made any statement to find out the whole story, either. This certainly would not be necessary. Helen Mirren was good, she added a certain charm to a character who (as one previous commentator noted) had no reason to do something. And did anyone else notice that Katie Holmes absolutely can't act? His hypocrisy became incredibly annoying. "You wanted me to fail Blah blah blah." His last two scenes with Mrs. Tingle were the worst. The only reason I don't regret losing $ 8.25 to this disaster is because she was beaten a little. No, wait, I regret losing the money: it wasn't real, and she survived. Mr. Williamson, if you are reading this, you made the same film (some scenes of violence and / or scary compensated by wise guys who make sarcastic jokes and references to other films) just a little too many times now (we count 6 of them, not including Scream 3 and whatever follows it), and I'd really appreciate it if I stopped. Otherwise, I could simply kidnap you and threaten you with a crossbow. Ok? :-)
