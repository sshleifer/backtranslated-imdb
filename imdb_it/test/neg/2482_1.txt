Wow ... not in a positive sense. <br /> <br /> I can't believe people write this junk. Most of the shows on television are pretty bad, and this has been an ongoing trend for some time - they keep getting worse, but Las Vegas certainly brings home. What a terrible sight ... <br /> <br /> The actors are a bunch of C + losers who never went anywhere (except James Caan ... who knows what he was thinking when he signed up for this role) So it's not their fault that this show sucks. They simply can't do anything about it. Blame the producers and writers. I can't believe they shot this and they were quite proud of their work to broadcast it.
