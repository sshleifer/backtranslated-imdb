Every movie I made PPV because Leonard Maltin praised him for the skies blew up pieces! Every single! When will I ever learn? <br /> <br /> Evie is a bizarre Old Bag that doesn't think anything of saying she's dying of breast cancer to get ahead! Laura is an unbearable Medusa full of the Holy Spirit (and the protege of her hubby)! Captured among these harpies is the stupid Medusa boy who was crushed by the weeds of The Old Bag! <br /> <br /> As I said, when will I learn? <br /> <br /> I was temporarily relieved of my malaise when The Old Bag put its head in a sink, but unfortunately, it didn't die. I was temporarily relieved of my discomfort again when Medusa was mowed, but unfortunately, she didn't die. It should be a capital offense to torture an audience like this! <br /> <br /> Without Harry Potter hitting him, Rupert Grint is just a pair of big blue eyes that practically swell from their sockets. Julie Walters' stage chewing (especially the scene where she "plays" God) is even more brazen than her character. <br /> <br /> At least this Harold slams some kids instead of Maude. For that, I am really grateful. And if you're reading this Mr. Maltin, you owe me $ 3.99!
