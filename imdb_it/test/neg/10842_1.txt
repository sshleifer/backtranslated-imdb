This film looks as if someone had a nice idea for a movie, thought of two or three funny possibilities, hired a good cast, then turned the whole thing into a really bad screenwriter and an even worse director. The director has filmed a romantic comedy to be fucked as if it were a dark and artistic film --- strange camera angles, filtered blue shots, linger, watch the raindrops closely. Steve Zahn was good, as always. Ben Affleck was charming, sweet, almost shy; it was perfect for a romantic comedy. Sandra Bullock fought valiantly with a character who should have been crazy, but whose strangeness consisted of things like madly kissing a hating husband, abandoning her son, going on carnival rides, offering to undress for money and take a ride connects airliner. The script had a few funny lines; there was no physical comedy; it was boring. It introduced potentially funny situations, so it interrupted them before they could develop. To top it off, the "twist" at the end was a slap in the face to anyone expecting a funny romantic comedy. If you've seen the movie trailer and liked it, like I did, my advice is: don't go to the movies. It will just ruin a nice trailer.
