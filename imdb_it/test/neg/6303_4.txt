The Shaggy movie, friendly but frustrating has the same old message: if you want to do it in this world, being imaginative is not enough, you have to live up to your place in society and this means living by the rules (heterosexual) that govern us. The drag queen dramatic comedy from Australia is a mostly optimistic journey of three male friends crossing the Outback with their pink bus, christened Priscilla. Although it is not a formula film in itself, there are the mandatory sequences of the "road movie" (bonding the bonfire, facing the rednecks, etc.). The director and screenwriter Stephan Elliott follows every potentially witty moment with a little humor and sympathy, but there are bewildering gaps in his story, a terrible subplot on a homosexual's relationship with his ex-wife and the extraneous pre-adolescent son (both of whom are at ease - and the wise child - with his lifestyle), and a third act with no energy whatsoever. He has a wicked transvestite humor and a fairly playable cast, but a script that seems to have been watered along the way. ** from ***
