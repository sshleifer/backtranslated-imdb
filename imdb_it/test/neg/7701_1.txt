Do you want an excellent recipe for failure? Take a bad political plot on the left, add some weak and completely underdeveloped characters and then launch the worst sequences a movie has ever known. Let it soak for a week (the amount of time you probably spent on making this basket). <br /> <br /> The result is "Steal this movie", a cinematic experience that brings bad movies to dangerous and exotic locations that were never conceived before. <br /> <br /> This film completely blew my face for the duration of the film. Words cannot convey how painful it was to watch. This is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit around and tease. This is not "Plan 9 From Outer Space". This is a long, boring and sad waste of time. 'Steal this movie' is the biggest waste of energy and talent I've ever seen. It depresses me when I realize that people * actually * took time out of their lives to act in this tripe, if you can call it "acting". But then again, when you have bad direction, bad writing, poor EVERYTHING - "acting" is the last thing to criticize. <br /> <br /> This film is like a huge, disgusting asshole who longs to discover existence, fearing that a friend or loved one could see it somehow. I really wish I could somehow destroy every copy of this film so as not to pollute the minds of aspiring directors. Thank you, Robert Greenwald, for giving me a new respect for every other film I've ever seen. You showed me what is really terrible and why I should appreciate all those movies that are simply crappy and / or boring.
