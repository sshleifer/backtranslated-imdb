I'm a big fan of Eric Roberts, I collect his films and so far I'm 60. But I'm honest in saying that sometimes he makes terrible movies. But hey that's why I like it - it's fun. <br /> <br /> But this must take the price, I can't stop wondering why. Somehow they managed to get Eric and even Corbin Bernsen to the picture. <br /> <br /> While Bernsen is simply awful (I don't like it very much), Roberts manages to be the best thing about the movie (and it doesn't mean much). It practically does it on a routine basis. <br /> <br /> The female protagonist (Brasselle) looks like a plastic doll and behaves as such. And Tim Abell and his crew look like action-man plastic dolls and act like these. <br /> <br /> The plot is really embarrassing. I didn't see any of the Carnosaur films, so I don't remember the video that was added from there, but it explains some things. But there are still huge holes like craters in the plot. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ALERT <br /> <br /> The first attacks are found outside the laboratory in nearby woods. But in the end they blow the whole laboratory apart and just relax that all is over, but they have forgotten those outside ?????? <br /> <br /> When the helicopter pilot is eaten alive, I wonder how he couldn't notice a T-rex going up on the helicopter ???? <br /> <br /> The guys in orange suits are my favorites - what are they doing, out for a jogging ride or what ?? /> <br /> Of course there are also standard B-movie sex scenes with silicone tits. This time it's Lorissa McComas who greets us. I have no problem (it looks horrible) but watching a guy tighten his tits and find himself on the edge of the climax for 8 !!!! the minutes are too long. <br /> <br /> Too bad for all of you (including Eric Roberts) - Now I can't wait to watch Con Games (I wonder ???)
