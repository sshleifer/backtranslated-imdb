This film is the worst I've ever seen. You might think you've seen some bad movies in your time, but if you haven't seen it, you don't know how terrible a movie can be. But wait, there is worse news! The study will soon reveal this masterpiece (I am ironic) because everyone sees it! The only things worse than the plot of this film are the effects, the acting, the direction and the production. Bill Rebane, poor Ed Wood (not that there is Ed Wood of a rich man) (I like Ed Wood's films, anyway) manages to get things moving at a snail's pace throughout the film. It opens with the capture of a bigfoot child (a Littlefoot? --Sorry, could not do anything about it) from a couple of unlikely hunters, who are killed by the parent. This causes the entire city where the hunters lived to hunt for a jihad in search of Bigfoot. This is pretty much for the plot. Nothing happens even remotely, and we viewers are never able to worry about any of the characters. If one is interested in Rebane's films, I would recommend almost any other on this. However, as I said, it will soon be released by Troma in order to bore a new generation of spectators.
