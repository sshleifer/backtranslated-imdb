I really saw the movie before reading the book. When I saw the movie I was angry because I wondered why Dean Koontz had made a bad book / movie. The film was confused and had no flow, was moved and made me want to throw a stone at the TV. I couldn't connect with the characters, so I didn't care what happened to them (I normally love characters because I can relate to their personalities or problems). Then I read the book and I loved it. I often re-read the book and the film is collecting dust. I would like someone to make a Koontz film that follows the plot of his books, so the movies wouldn't suck so much. DO NOT LOOK AT THIS FILM UNLESS YOU NEED TO REFUSE MONEY!
