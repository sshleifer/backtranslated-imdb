Peter Crawford discovers a comet on a collision course with the moon. But when the government does not believe him (stupid fact No. 1). He builds a shelter in the deep underground and attracts a lot to see who will go. He is also willing to kill to save humanity (stupid fact No. 2). With millions of dollars in technology, how could a civilian see what NASA can't do? Moreover, the end justifies the moral means of this story is simply wrong !!! This film is unlikely and absolutely incredible. What was going through these people's minds, why the hell do the shit stacks like this get the green light? Sometimes I wonder who should make a **** to make a movie in this city of cinema.
