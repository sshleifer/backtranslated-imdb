Based on what little I've seen of this show, I don't think I'll ever look at it again. It's not even remotely credible and frankly the character of Derek makes me angry. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but seeing a brat so spoiled leave often? Why should I watch it?!? No thanks, there are a lot of other shows that involve devious characters (Phil of the Future's Pim for example) where the wicked don't win or don't do it the way they think. <br /> <br /> Not to say that I think this is a terrible image to paint about living with half-brothers. Yes, life is not rosy, but one could try to portray a character who is not absolutely evil and wins. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is that you only look at it if you like to see the bad guy win.
