As a movie buff, I felt that as I rated my favorite movies, I felt it was right to classify my most hated movies. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid I have nothing positive to say about this movie. In fact, it's one of the only two movies I've ever released. In all honesty I went back to watching the movie again to give it another chance and I went through it just to wish I should have stayed away. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that the film has a really decent cast and team ... but then even the brightest Hollywood stars can't bring a dead script to life. <br /> <br /> Stay away ... Save yourself from this truly painful "movie" 1/10
