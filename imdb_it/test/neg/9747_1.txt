Would it be too trivial for me to create a review of myself only while repeating the word "STUPID"? Probably. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Seriously. There are better films on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I saw this film for the first time at a friend's birthday party when it was still in theaters. Although he was actually * with friends * and on one of their * birthday parties, * I had to leave. Actually I had to leave. I just apologized and left. Fortunately, some of the parents were doing the same thing, so it didn't seem like a complete asshole ... However, this movie is horrible. There is nothing to do about it. It is painfully (as actually causes physical pain) slow, and disgusting (literally induces vomiting) little fun. You almost feel sorry for Tom Arnold, but then you don't do it because you remember that it was actually in the movie. It really hurts me to think about that too. <br /> <br /> He was on TV a few months ago, and I decided I had to watch it all the way, just once. I remembered then why I went out in the first place, and I felt guilty for having increased his votes even by a single spectator. The gags are not fun, the characters are not interesting. it's just a mindless mess of pratfalls and stupidity. <br /> <br /> There is a small crowd of eight-year-olds who watched the film when it came out and considered it "brilliant". If you think having your face removed from Pece with a scoop of ice cream is brilliant, then by all means, go and rent it. But if you have any dignity, avoid this STUPIDO mess altogether. SCORE: 0/10 ... maybe a negative 1, actually.
