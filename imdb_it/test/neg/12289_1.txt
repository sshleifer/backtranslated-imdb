If you and your friends find so much humor and fun from horrible recitations, jokes, props and overall film production like me and my friends, you need to rent it. <br /> <br /> Simply by reading the tag line and seeing how funny it is, you should take in amusing, poor quality, fantastic, hilarious content. It is a fairy tale of some children who defy the laws of physics and reality and fly back in time through a modern big-screen television for a world of dinosaurs that will eventually become their friends. Not to mention a hilarious and serious scene in which T-Rex becomes a father figure for one of the children. Yes ... <br /> <br /> It should be in the comedy section but you will find it with children's movies if you find it. So call your friends, sit down, relax, prepare to laugh and have fun. For weeks, you will mention the horrible disasters of a film in this film. "What's with all the ruckus ?!"
