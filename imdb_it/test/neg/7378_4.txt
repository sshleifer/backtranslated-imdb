First of all, I'm in the United States. <br /> <br /> When I first saw it, I thought it was obvious - and repulsive - of "The Office" (UK). I therefore assigned zero stars, but behold, it came out much earlier than the Ricky Gervais series. <br /> <br /> Still, it's hard to watch this or any other show with a similar dynamic (including the American "Office") without comparison. It's not even close to being the same thing. <br /> <br /> I will give you the credit for being original and ahead of its time. I will also say that - and the United States "Office" and "Larry Sanders" - are real satires. "Office" in the UK is something bigger and more transcendent, as if it were populated by real people in events that seemed to really happen. However, unlike this or the shrill "mockumentaries" of Christopher Guest, it's not really a satire, while "The Newsroom" is definitely. <br /> <br /> However, "The Newsroom" is not yet available. very funny He is detached and self-aware, but with a cast and a crew not smart enough or talented enough to carry the goods. It is a heavy comedy carried on weak shoulders. Commendable, but ultimately not recommended. <br /> <br /> --- And what about the lack of an anamorphic DVD?! I know it was shot in anamorphic widescreen format, because I saw the pilot episode on one of our HD channels. CBC, go with the program. ; )
