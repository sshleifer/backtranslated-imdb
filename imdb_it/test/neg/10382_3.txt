This film seemed to lack direction. The plot developed so many twists in so little time that it seemed to lose all semblance of what the real storyline was. There was a lot of wasted dialogue and it just seemed like the writing was rushed and a little too wandering. The scenes of exorcism and the story of possession began to take a back seat in the secondary stories of the character (which at the beginning were a bit weak). <br /> <br /> All in all, I'd say skip it unless you've rented the rest of the horror section in your local video store and you've got jones for a movie you've never seen before. You look much better simply by watching The Exorcist or The Exorcism of Emily Rose.
