This was the worst Wrestlemania in history. The only good matches were Ricky Steamboat against Hercules Hernandez, and the tag title match between the British Bulldogs and the Dream Team (this is bounded by the classic). Everything else was either poor or terrible. The idea of ​​having three host cities was not necessary, it confused and messed up the fluidity of the show. Famous guests were terrible in the comments, especially Susan Saint James. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in WWF in the mid-80s, it is better to rent or buy Wrestlemania 3, or almost any other PPV for that matter.
