I was hoping that this show was quite realistic. It only struck me as another traditional show after seeing it. I didn't feel the characters at all, is this glamorous American idea of ​​how terrorism works? The main character does not behave at all like a fundamentalist, and the way he passes for a terrorist goes beyond my understanding. None of the other terrorists managed to look genuine. One of the members, a blond American white boy, would never have been accepted by Muslim terrorists in real life. Another member, a former French skinhead, does not fit perfectly into an Islamic terrorist movement. Furthermore, terrorists have sex with white American housewives, which I find very strange. This is just another stupid American television episode. It's as realistic as Prison Break.
