For the first time in reviewing the films, I found myself immediately uninterested in this story. I don't know if it was the way it was filmed or the story behind the characters, but he felt bland, abused and completely unoriginal. Within the first thirty minutes, I found myself quite apathetic with all the characters and the story. I felt like I had seen this structure before, and Tart wasn't providing anything new to surprise me. After thinking that it could only be my mood, I stopped the film and chose to start it again in the morning, but the same sensation persisted. I did not care. This is not a good sign. The characters were insignificant. When I say bland, I literally mean that by observing them they develop, you will never have any taste hit in your palate. The story seemed recycled, almost to the point of plagiarism. Now, I'm not saying that Christina Wayne stole this story, but she didn't add anything new to the prospect. The casting was horrible, the symbolism and underlying themes were so far away that no critic could find them (nor the characters), and the stories were vague and sloppy. You didn't know anything about anyone or anything, and instead of giving more emphasis to the characters, instead we found ourselves with drugs, sex and money pushed into our faces. These are themes we have seen in every film since the dawn of cinema, yet somehow they could not be creatively captured by Wayne. <br /> <br /> What immediately removed me from this story? They were mainly the characters. I've seen most of Brad Renfro's work, and honestly he needs to redefine himself. Director Larry Clark has defined it, and strangely he can't get out of that stereotypical character. In the first twenty minutes of Renfro's screen I was bored. I knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why. It was spectacular, it wasn't impressive, it's just repetitive. He needed to bring some excitement or suspense to his role, instead of just playing this socialite at random. Without a strong character, the final climax of this film comes instead as a disappointment. Renfro has not shown the best of his abilities in this film. While I'm on the subject ?? no one showed the best of his abilities. What is happening to Dominique Swain, outside of Lolita, I don't think she really emerged as an actress, and the following of roles like Cat Storm doesn't help. Bijou Phillips was the only actress I actually witnessed trying to bring something extraordinary to the screen, unfortunately due to the horrible acting of everyone else, it was lost. Rambling here and there, and honestly almost forgotten during the second act. Melanie Griffith was a useless cast and most of this film's budget probably went to her TWO scenes in which she was. Maybe the rest went to the casual guy from The Kids in the Hall, who desperately needs to get away from this project. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem, outside of acting, was the rhythm of this film. Nothing, and this is difficult for me to say, but nothing has come together. Throughout the film there were so many subdivisions that no real substance was formed. The robberies, the adolescent "anguish and trouble", the rich socialites who learn how horrible real life is, the kids in Kids in the Hall, and even the finale felt hastily and horribly mounted together. With this poor art the whole story has never really formed a true shape. Family structures have never been defined, characters have never been given any emotion, and all that remains is fragments of honest leftovers. Wayne did not complete the task at hand. <br /> <br /> While I hate putting all the weight on the director, all I can do with this film is a small choice. With a horrible title that just shouted the exact opposite of what the film was, with amateur management skills the cast was able to give every emotion in every scene, leaving us with disgusting acting and poor developments, and with a narrative vague it is difficult to put any "good" behind Tart. This was a film of which I had heard nothing, and after seeing it I can understand why. All that Wayne did with this film is a random excerpt from other films that did a better job of defining all the elements above and cutting all together to make the film Tart. It's hard for me to say this, but Wayne ruined this movie. Although I don't think there is much to take completely from the story, the remaining elements of excitement have been drained when Wayne took the helm. While most of the time you can attribute some value to the story, perhaps to acting, or even to music, in Tart you can't attribute any merit. From the opening sequence to the end, I felt like I was swimming through the very lumpy oatmeal. No consistency, no strength. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is a waste of time. If you are looking for some deep symbolic elements or perhaps some exchange in our society, you will not find it in this film. While I know it was what Wayne was trying to show, the final product seems to have been modified on an Etch-a-Sketch. It was an embarrassing film to sit down and encourage anyone to pick it up. Wayne blew away all the teachings of his education at Columbia University and destroyed two hours of my life. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Vote: * on *****
