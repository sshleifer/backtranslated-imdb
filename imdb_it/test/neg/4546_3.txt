I'm all about walking dead, but my mind is still unsure of walking, dead dead. Unfortunately, THE PHILLING didn't help me make a decision. This is really slow if nothing happens for the first 45 minutes, causing the "movie enhancement" button to be pressed several times. The moment the well-drawn zombies appear, it's too late and the director (two are said to have filmed this) has no idea how to shoot them. Haggerty, Blair and Donahue all look tired / embarrassed / somehow caught up. I will give credit to the film as it anticipates T2 and ends with the bad guys frozen by liquid nitrogen. The Shriek Show DVD offers a promotional reel promo from the day it lasts 8 minutes and I actually recommend it by watching the film in its entirety.
