Thunder Alley finds Fabian banned from the NASCAR tracks after causing the death of another pilot. Stanley Adams may wish to put him in his team of runners, but the other drivers are not about to have him around. <br /> <br /> Desperate for the job Fabian hooks up with an auto stunt show owner Jan Murray who is paying him peanuts and trying to capitalize on Fabian's bad reputation. He must take it, but Annette Funicello, who is Murray's daughter, offers another reason to hang around. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is Fabian's struggle to return to the NASCAR circuit and at the same time juggle the two and his current friend Diane McBain. Personally, I would have taken McBain, she has everything on Annette. <br /> <br /> Thunder Alley is helped by the shooting of locations on the NASCAR tracks of the south and by the good videos of the NASCAR races. Not helped by a rather stupid story that delves into the real reason for Fabian's problems and his rather unrealistic recovery from it. <br /> <br /> NASCAR fans could still do this.
