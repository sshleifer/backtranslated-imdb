The Plot: A group of young people with ridiculous names (Hutch, Swink, Phineaus and October) are brought together by the death of their equally ridiculous friend Loomis. After the funeral, they decide to share the personal effects of their deceased friend. Among these is a video game called Stay Alive. The group decides that there is no better way to show their pain than to participate in a small shedding of virtual blood. But the more they play, the more they realize the connection between the game and the death of poor Ol 'Loomis. <br /> <br /> The Production: This movie is just another entry into Hollywood's latest low-budget fashion PG-13's horror was aimed at cashing in middle school audiences. The direction is nothing short of sloppy with rapid cuts in the style of the music video that make the action difficult to follow. The dialogue is so bad that it effectively kills brain cells. The plot itself is so full of holes that we don't even learn where the game comes from or who dies who plays it. <br /> <br /> The idea behind this film, although not entirely original, had some promise. But the poor performance on both sides of the camera makes this a big fool. <br /> <br /> If you've ever had the lust for "killing someone in a video game makes them dead in real life" horror film follow my advice and skip Stay Alive for the upper Brainscan.
