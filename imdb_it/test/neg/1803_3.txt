The film adaptation of Heart of Darkness is disappointing, both as a film and as a representation of the classic story of Joseph Conrad. <br /> <br /> There are many small differences between the book and the film, but this is expected in any transition of a book or a movie. Kurtz dies in a different place; the manager does not accompany Marlow on his journey; Kurtz's lover spends much more time with him than in history. The real problem is the amount of footage that is inserted into the film but has no basis in real history. For some reason, the director discovers the need to "revive" some scenes, adding dramas or actions that rarely make sense and are always unimportant to the story. Some examples that come to mind are Kurtz's "mistress" who beats Marlow on the head and knocks him out. Nothing happens while he is unconscious and Marlow has not even caused the attack. They spend a couple of hours and he wakes up: total loss of time. Kurtz has a monkey that, for some casual reason, kills on a whim. Furthermore, when Marlow leaves Kurtz station, he takes the "noble" decision to leave all the priceless ivory he had obtained, without a real reason. Another flaw is the character of Kurtz. John Malkovich is a terrible choice to interpret the man who is described as tall and inspiring: a man with an imposing presence. Practically he whispers all his jokes that, in the hands of a more capable actor, could have been very stimulating. I can't remove the image of John Malkovich who plays a mentally disabled farmhand in Of Mice and Men when I watch him stain the role of Kurtz. Above all, I would rate the film as 3 on 10 stars. It's a good movie if you read the book and want to see it in film form, perhaps to help you visualize the scenes, but as a source of entertainment, I would never recommend it.
