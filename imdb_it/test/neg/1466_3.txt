Hey, do you remember when Hal Hartley was brilliant? What time it was. I would say that the Book of Life was when things really went downhill, but I will say that at least it went uphill from this. A film that seems to have been shot on someone's cell phone should not be a bad thing if it were distinguished by an interesting story and dialogue, but alas, those are missing, along with Hartley's eccentric and harsh dialogue. In their place there is a boring exhibition on themes from the end of Christian times and a banal story of a modern Jesus in a dilemma, packaged in a modern world that seeks to be fashionable, in which everyone seems to have come out of a film Hal Hartley. While it picks up a little in its second half, it is never pleasant, or particularly sensitive. What the hell happened to you, Hartley?
