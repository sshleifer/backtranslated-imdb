One of the worst theatrical films of the year, if not all times. Anthony Hopkins belittles himself even by appearing in this joke. I can't believe that the name of David Mamet and Ridley Scott appears on this parody. The best career move Jody Foster ever made was to lower the level. Julianne Moore was without emotion everywhere like a female Keanu Reeves. Gary Oldman was, of course, his brilliant self. He is a paralyzed victim of Hannibal and the trick is so good, I didn't know it was Gary until the end credits. but eaten by trained boars ??? Give me a break! It is said that he did not want his name mentioned in the credits. And frying and feeding his brain to Ray Liotta ... I was laughing at the absurdity, not making that stupidity of this movie at this point. I have not seen so many people coming out of a movie from Who's That Girl. <br /> <br /> Pay someone else for you if you have to, but this is missing on ALL THE COST !!!
