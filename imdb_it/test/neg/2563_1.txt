Steven Seagal has played in many action films. Most of them were bad but not as bad as The Patriot. This is a low-cost action movie from the Z series. After the Operation Delta Force, Act of War, The Substitute 2, Plato's Run, The Base, Drive, Sabotage, etc. The Patriot arrives. Now Steven Seagal is certainly considered a bad actor like Mark Dacascos, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Treat Williams, Jack Scalia, Gary Busey, Chuck Norris, Michael Madsen and many others. The scenery was full of holes and the characters weren't realistic (maybe because of the very bad actors) and the 4.25 dollars you spend renting The Patriot are called Lost Money !!! I give him 0 and a half (for laughter) out of 5.
