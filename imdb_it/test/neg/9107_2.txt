Wow ... this is the kind of movie that makes you wonder who the idea was and what soup cuisine they are eating now. To say that it was bad is an insult to bad movies that we all know and love. <br /> <br /> When I saw Guttenberg's name in the TV guide I thought it would be a parody ... maybe it should have been. He could have made a better film. <br /> <br /> Look for the scene where I am on a plane in mid-flight with the door open and there is no wind like ever. They could have been born for a fan at least. <br /> <br /> Look for numerous Canadian and c-list actors in the film. This is the kind of movie that sews b-rate cable stations that you never watch except on a rainy Sunday.
