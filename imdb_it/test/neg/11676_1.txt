All right. I really tried to take advantage of the (so called) silly and surreal humor that this film aims to be. I was told that the Japanese version of this film is much shorter than the one sent to America (see for yourself!), And has fewer political references. Apart from that, I found this sexual / political farce just as boring and useless as standard porn. The central female protagonist is easy on the eyes and could actually act. I'd like to see her in a non-pink movie where she could actually flex her acting muscles (and no, not the ones you're thinking about). It is obvious that Japan can produce (and does) as much crap as other countries. I could not recommend it to anyone, with the remote possibility of someone having a Jones for Asian porn. Go see a real Japanese movie.
