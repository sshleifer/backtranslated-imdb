This is by far the worst version of William Shakespeare's tragic masterpiece I've ever seen. It seems that the filmmakers did not actually read Shakespeare's text. No, they just took what they wanted from the Lawerence Olivier movie. The plot is out of order and reduced to its bare necessity, yet there is time for the non-canon Olivier has created an indication of incest between Hamlet and Queen Gertrude. Could we have had the "Something rotten in the state of Denmark" instead? Casting is another problem. I understand that the far superior Branagh movie has its weaknesses (Robin Williams and Charlton Heston come to mind), but this has very few good moments. I like Laertes and Polonio, but the rest of the cast is obsolete. Mel Gibson's eerie stubble is irritating, and one often wonders if he has any idea what he's saying. Many actors seem to have just memorized the part - they know less than what is said compared to sophomores in high school. <br /> <br /> If you want a version of Hamlet, take a look at Kenneth Branagh or Lawerence Olivier. To be honest, Disney's Hamlet is better too.
