If this is the idea of ​​the author and the director of a slice of life, they are clinically-manic depressive. A sad and moody film, at best, with ubiquitously contemptuous and unhappy characters who interact negatively with disastrous results. This film is advertised as a comedy. What was so funny about losing your home to an allegedly premeditated arson or the forced rape of one of the main characters. Does this art imitate life? Jack Black was slightly funny as a mountain man, a grass grower. However, even this part of the film was full of pathos. What was the point of living in the middle of nowhere with an entourage. If the character of Black was so paranoid, why was he souring with a group of people just out of Woodstock? There is no end to disconnected relationships, a plot less script and scene transitions without cohesion or logical chronology.
