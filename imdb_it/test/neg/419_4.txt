I went to see this movie tonight, trying to keep an open mind. I was hoping to enjoy a movie that I expected was different from the book. There were significant differences from the book, just like the changes made to the DiVinci Code. I went to see the DiVinci Code with the same thought and was able to enjoy the film, despite the changes in the book. It was still pleasant, full of action, and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and stimulating from the mental point of view. Unfortunately, Angels and Demons disappoint on almost every level. Throughout the film, the symbols are found and calculated quickly, without any interest for the viewer. They pass the various Immuminati symbols so quickly that we have not had the chance to see them and appreciate how they work. The final Illuminati symbol, which was the most interesting and creative of the book, has been replaced with the crossed-key symbol. In my opinion, it was a lost opportunity to concentrate and devote a little more time to symbols, which is the real reason for Langdon's character. Overall, this film is a bad interpretation of the book and fails in its attempt to be an action movie / a thriller. 4 out of 10
