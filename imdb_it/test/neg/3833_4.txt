I can't imagine any possible reason why Madsen and Hopper wanted to be in this movie after reading the script. Have they been blackmailed? Or is the money so bad? The main problem with the film is that it is boring. The conversations between Madsen's and Hopper's character are useless, just like the bored chatter between two friends while they drink beer on Saturday night. Never try any of the characters (although Madsen's psychotherapist is very nice compared to the other characters). Hopper has always been a good actor and Madsen does a great job as a serial killer, otherwise the acting is almost ridiculous. There are about three scenes in the whole film where something is really happening, each of which takes about three minutes. Although the scenes of "talking and thinking about the murder and nature of the murderers" would have been interesting, if they were scenes from a book. The whole concept would have been interesting for a novel, but a film cannot be discovered with a plot with so much inner thought and so little action.
