The film Heart of Darkness is an insult to the book by Joseph Conrad! To be honest, the film made me want to fall asleep. On the other hand, the book was definitely extraordinary. I feel that the film has left several key elements and has missed some of the main points of the book. Moreover, the actors were boring and lacked originality and enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> The book, although not an adventure story or easy to understand, is full of hidden meanings and interesting plot twists. The book, although very confusing and complex, is surprising. When you finally understand it, you feel like you've actually learned something. The story, or novel, had several key ideas like futility and madness, which the film left out. Furthermore, several key scenes have been modified, which in turn have influenced the entire plot. Many scenes seemed very "agitated" in the sense that they did not fit together. In summary, the film seemed to be a bad interpretation of the book. <br /> <br /> I only recommend that you watch this movie if you can't imagine or understand the book, but otherwise I'll skip this. It was terrible and in complete disorder. If you've never read the book, surely you don't watch the movie because you need the basic information of the book to understand the film. The film was a horrible spin-off of an exceptional and detailed book.
