The characters are annoying, immature and shaky ... Madison is the most annoying of all. OOH ... a cold spot! Such a terrible threat! Any ghost in that house would have fled in self-defense! In short, this film is boring. Seeing a chair flying in a room can be disturbing, but it's intriguing. I saw it once and when one of my sons wanted to watch it again, I was tempted to take a baseball bat on the TV rather than watch this junk again. If you want a good horror movie or even a passable comedy, this is not it! The only good part of it all was "the cockroach scene" and, at the end of the film, you ended up feeling sorry for the cockroach!
