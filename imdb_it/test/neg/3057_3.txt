This film is about a party organized by the "scary girl" high school. Due to the illogical nature of this kind of film, he obtains permission to hold the party in a house that used to be a crematorium, a suspect place that has been closed and closed for some time. Apparently the story of this piece of property is one of those city secrets left speechless among the righteous, even if the legend is whispered among the young. <br /> <br /> Why is this crematorium really off? What really happened in the past? <br /> <br /> I like these killing-kill-kill films of a supernatural nature as long as there is something in them not copied by a hundred or so other films. The highlights of this film are a "7-11" robbery, a small theft that distracts the clerk with a vivid view, the changing scene of the "good girl" clothes witnessed by her younger brother, the eventual disappearance of the ugly neighbor who hates the holiday, the spectral scene of the mirror and the concept of running water are a barrier against the supernatural; the best part of this film is when the party owned sponsors dances in BAUHAUS by the fireplace; that scene oscillates.
