This movie is definitely up there with the worst movies I've ever seen, probably in my top 5 of the worst movies. I laughed once and it was when: <br /> <br /> EVAN: "I'm building something" Evan's secretary: "I hope he's a barber" <br /> <br /> That was literally the only time in which I laughed in this "comedy", terrible compared to Almighty Bruce who as a big fan of Jim Carrey ... it wasn't even that great! <br /> <br /> This film lacked the humor of having the powers of God and was more related to family ties. Id class only as a family movie, definitely not a family comedy. <br /> <br /> Seeing a bird poop on someone's shirt is not exhilarating, nor the beard that grows instantly! <br /> <br /> I didn't even think the special effects were fantastic, the animals seemed really stuck, it was like watching a movie that hadn't been "glued" together correctly <br /> <br /> in format 2 / 10 - avoid!
