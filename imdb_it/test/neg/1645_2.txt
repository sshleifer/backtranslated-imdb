If you are a fan of Pauly Shore, you will laugh out loud. If not, this is a silly mess that wastes a very good talent. A nice student (Carla Gugino) from South Dakota invites her dormitory counselor in California (Shore) to share Thanksgiving. Noteworthy cast members: Lane Smith, Cindy Pickett, Mason Adams and the beautiful and wonderful Tiffani-Amber Thiessen. Look where you go.
