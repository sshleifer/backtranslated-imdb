The unpleasant "invasion house" phenomenon can be traced back to Wes Craven's first sleazefest "Last House On The Left", with blurred shootings like "I Spit On Your Grave", "Wrong Way" and "The Visitors" which they soon follow in the footsteps of that movie. Here, in these early 80s, the Italian that offers the same plot is regurgitated once again, with the difference that this is set on a continental train. "The Girl of the Sleeping Wagon" ?? known in English-speaking countries as "Terror Express" ?? it starts surprisingly well, but about twenty minutes ago a worse turnaround, as the sex scenes begin to take precedence over more serious actions and suspense. <br /> <br /> David, Phil and Ernie, three rich young men who bask in terrorizing and humiliating others, embarking on a trans-continental espresso in Italy. The train is full of other passengers, including the prostitute Juliette (Silvia Dionisio) who often frequents the train and has made an agreement with one of the porters to act as a sort of pimp, convincing the male passengers to part with their money for a night of passion in his compartment. The three idiots quickly began to upset the passengers with their aggressive and drunk behavior, but things get more serious when they take control of an entire car on the express and barricade themselves from the rest of the train. Very soon, are they enjoying their temporary control? a young wife (Zora Kerova) is raped by two young men in a small room; Juliette herself is subjected to a prolonged sexual attack; and then the hateful trio forces male passengers to play a dice to decide which one will rape a 16-year-old virgin traveling with her parents (a concept made doubly insipid by the fact that her father is one of the men forced to play the game ). The only passenger who seems ready to react is a convict who is escorted to Germany, but what hope does a man have against three armed thugs? <br /> <br /> The Girl Of The Sleeping Car departs in a decent way. Several intriguing characters are introduced and the three hooligans have been shown to have a truly disturbing influence on travelers. Although the story is clearly a matter of exploitation, the opening scenes are carefully constructed and the film seems to be above the usual gutter level of its kind. Things disintegrate during a horrendous scene in which Kerova is put to bed in a toilet by two of the thugs. The scene is gloatingly filmed, and the effect does not seem to be to generate sympathy for the victim or hatred towards the perpetrators ?? instead, we are asked to feel turned on. This is sensationalism at its worst. Further humiliating moods follow, but rape sequences involve too much work of shooting on oral sex acts and female genitals. A sequence with the 16-year-old girl on the edge of the hard core feels particularly "wrong". At the end of The Girl of the Wagon Bed it is easy to forget that it was intended as a thriller, because the last hour of the film is dedicated to pornography rather than suspense. Crap lovers will have fun; others may want to look elsewhere.
