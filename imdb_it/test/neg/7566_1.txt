There have been many movies, to live the American dream. And this is one of them. <br /> <br /> First of all, on the technical side, it's very wrong. The audio is bad, I had trouble understanding the dialogues here and there, and the positions of the cameras could have been better. <br /> <br /> They really tried to make a good movie, but for example the part where it shows, how Jonathan is getting lost in the dream, with girls, drugs and alcohol is very bad. The acting is very poor even for all the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time watching it from beginning to end, and I couldn't wait for the movie to finish. /> <br /> If your expectations are low, and you're bored on Sunday with bad weather, watch it. If you find yourself in a deep story with action, then this is not your movie. <br /> <br /> Normally I would not have given a score of 1, but 4.5 for this film. But the reason I gave it a 1 is because of the bad audio, and the camera uses, not to mention the bad cut scenes with cheese effects.
