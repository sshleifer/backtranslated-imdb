The Australian original Kath & Kim is brilliant. Why do American producers need to remake and ruin yet another classic show? Remember the original version of "The Office" with Ricky Gervais, it was an absolute masterpiece and there was no need to do it again. The producers have said that the British humor of "The Office" and the Australian humor of "Kath & Kim" would not translate into an American public ......... WHAT ??? So basically they're saying that Americans are too stupid and stupid to understand jokes, so they need to redo shows with exaggerated child gags, so that Americans can understand humor. The original Australian version of Kath & Kim is fantastic and very funny. Avoid the American version like the plague !!
