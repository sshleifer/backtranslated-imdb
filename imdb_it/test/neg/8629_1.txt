I saw this film, after seeing the original "Spoorloos" a few times, in anticipation of the chilling ending. <br /> <br /> I can't even begin to explain the anger and disappointment I felt when the finale arrived, and it went away, and the film continued to have a happy ending. What a waste of time he was watching this US remake ... <br /> <br /> If you have a choice, skip "The Vanishing" and look at the original Dutch "Spoorloos". The suspense is very well built. Feel Rex's frustration, searching for any trace of what might have happened to his girlfriend Saskia, after entering a gas station and never coming back to her car. The research takes three years, and when he finally gets in touch with the person who knows the truth about what happened to Saskia, he must agree to undergo the same thing that Saskia has undergone. The ending leaves you speechless on the chair ....
