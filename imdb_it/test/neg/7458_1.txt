Everything about this film is ugly. everything. Ridiculous 80s haircuts. Ridiculous whiskers Ridiculous action and fight scenes in which you can actually see that the opponents don't even beat each other. Bad, bad, bad music of the 80s. Repeated scenes of people crossing woods. A bad boy with a silver plastic hand and stupid hair. Stupid dialogue Acting is non-existent. Everything looks extremely cheap. This film surpasses even "Plan 9 from space" in its total malice. <br /> <br /> It's not "funny bad" it's just bad.
