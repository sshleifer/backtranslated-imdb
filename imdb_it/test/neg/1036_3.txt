Try how I could, I simply couldn't get into this. Perhaps it was the washed tones; maybe it was the approach pulled out - I'm not sure, but even if this wasn't a "bad" movie at all, I didn't really find an "effective" movie (words that I understand are much more arbitrary than their common uses. < br /> <br /> So basically, the agreement here is that a series of deaths of teenage boys triggers an investigation and anxiety in a small provincial town, triggering a witch hunt. the death of the boys with the mysterious and sexy woman who appeared in the city? Is the mad hermit involved, is it voodoo? The plot is a mixture of dramatic crime and horror as the various citizens are all suspect and corpses continue to appear while violence comes. <br /> <br /> Quite good, but for me, most of it fell a little flat.Oh, he had his moments ... the only guy who came into a beautiful naked seductress was rather good, and the scene in which the fathers beat the hermit was a bitter comment (although g the effects themselves failed, considering that his skin seemed to peel like they were whipping him with hot irons. <br /> <br /> My biggest problem was the ending. I have already inserted spoiler tags in this review, but BE NOTED, THIS IS THE GREAT SPOILER: I don't believe it. I do not believe that a priest can convince himself to kill the boys to become sexually aware without any reference to the psychosis that appears before, with other boys, with a story, or some other personal effect. The film has not really earned its end. FINE SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> However, Fulci is a big name and I am more than certain that there is an audience out there for this. I absolutely have to check that he did, because this could have been a bad introduction. Most Italian yellows are still hit-or-miss, so I am waiting to see what else this guy can do before canceling it. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
