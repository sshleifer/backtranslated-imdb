The theatricality and drama included in the film are fantastic, but the facts and the research are far from solid. Quoting Dr. Bovon, where the documentary tries to establish a connection with Maria Maddalena di Mariamene, the dr. Bovon later clarifies that it should be used for literary purposes (eg Fables of that time) not for a historical figure. In fact, he says, he does NOT believe that the Mariamene ossuary of Talpiot is Mary Magdalene. He also commented on his public letter, which was not informed that his words would be used for this documentary, but rather for information on Acts of Philip (a literary work in the 4th century). <br /> <br /> we have here a director who took a clip for a 4th-century fantasy of Acts of Philip and used it specifically to support a first-century ossuary inscription. A very sad trait and Dr. Bovon calls the connection Jesus / Mary Magdalene as "science fiction" - since this documentary should be correctly labeled.
