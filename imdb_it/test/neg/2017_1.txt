This could be probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I knew it was a B-movie before watching it (it was actually the reason to watch it), but I never thought it could be so bad. The title promises Dracula in space and does not provide, however, the story does not make real use of the fact that the character of Casper van Dien is a descendant of Van Helsing. And pay attention at the end of the film, it comes fast. I've never seen an ending crying "And now we're over budget!" in a clearer way. Their resolution of the film was rather comical, but the story had evidently been painted in a corner. If you feel you need to see it, watch it with a friend who shares your love for B-movies. If I didn't, I wouldn't have come to the end.
