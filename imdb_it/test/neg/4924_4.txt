The haze and atmosphere that this film has, but unfortunately it does the print I just saw. Raymond Massey offers a relaxed Sherlock Holmes, almost comically so in the early scenes in his bathrobe, which he mistakes for a workman's outfit to investigate the terrifying villa of Dr. Rylott (Lyn Harding). What was not clear to me was why Rylott wanted his stepdaughters to die. If as in the case of Helen (Angela Baddeley), she did not want her to run away to get married, she would have done the same thing by sending her. <br /> <br /> Other curiosities abound as well. After setting an early date of the marriage with Helen, the fianc√©e is no longer heard for the rest of the photo. The presence of a band of gypsies at the time of Violet Stoner's death provides only a diversion, and what could have been an interesting instrument of murder, a poisonous snake, is diluted by the fact that it was not a cobra, the musical rendering of the Indian servitude. <br /> <br /> Athole Stewart competently interprets Holmes's assistant, Dr. Watson, even if he gets used to it if Nigel Bruce is more your cup of tea. Like Rylott, Lyn Harding is quite threatening, a trait that could be used as a nemesis of Professor Moriarty of Holmes in two subsequent films, "The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes" of 1935 and "Murder at the Baskervilles" of 1937. <br /> <br /> With repeated choppiness and a shaky camera, it is surprising that the plot is no more upset than it is. Integrity is generally maintained, even if it lengthens a little to fill the gaps. I imagine this is my main complaint for the film, as the mental connection of some of the jumps in the image turned out to be a real pain for the asp.
