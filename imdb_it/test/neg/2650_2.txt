To quote a review by a film critic, "it started off slow and stopped." The plot was quite credible (although some of the character's actions seemed very, very RANDOM), the script was pretty well written (in the sense that the dialogue didn't seem forced), but everything was going too slowly. There were too many breaks between the lines and the way the lines were delivered was not that great. This film had potential, but it exploded like a teenager who turns to drugs. My advice? Wait for it to arrive on TV before you see it.
