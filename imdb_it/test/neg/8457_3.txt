"Terror in the Aisles" may seem like the ultimate gift for horror fans, but in reality it has very few offers. Of course, it presents a decent and versatile (too versatile?) Selection of horror / thriller fragments that are considered classics but ... what's the point? This documentary is mainly aimed at the audience that loves horror, so we've already seen all these clips, right? The only thing really worthy of praise about this project is the editing. If you like screaming women, chases of vile killers and that sort of thing, "Terror in the Aisles" contains some compilations of the most famous sequences. All these different scenes are hung up in a fabulous enveloping story featuring Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen sitting in a cinema. Between two sequences, the address the viewer and "explains" why we love horror so much. These discourses are naturally soporific and rather obvious (it is in our nature to be afraid ... blah blah blah) and I do not understand why many people love the concept. It's worth taking a peek if you're a passionate horror fan, but it's certainly not an essential vision. On the contrary: if you still have to see a classic genre title, make sure that fragments of it don't ruin your future vision. The main reason why I didn't like it in general is that it shamelessly ignores many lesser known, but fundamental (foreign) titles centered incessantly on "Halloween". This translates into a nice inside joke, however, when Donald Pleasance screams on the screen of his character.
