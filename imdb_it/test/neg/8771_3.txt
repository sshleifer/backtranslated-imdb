I am a Christian, and I saw a good Christian film, but this is a shame. They try to make it good, but it's too difficult for them. <br /> <br /> - You can see that the film is dubbed in many places. - You can almost think that the main personalities of this film are the only ones left. I think there will be many more. <br /> <br /> - The quality is poor and even the acting could have been better. The story is not so bad, but it could have been better. The only advantage I offer is the story of this film, but I can't rate it more than 3/10. Watch "Left Behind" instead!
