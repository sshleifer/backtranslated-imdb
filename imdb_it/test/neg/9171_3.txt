I waited a long time to finally see what I thought would be a fun caper movie and I was shocked to discover a poor direction, embarrassing dialogues, a lackluster rhythm, unimaginable beating gags and a general roughness that permeated the film. Not really fun! The sets seemed cheap, the costumes of the usual excellent Donfeld are garish and distracting. Even the title song is annoying. The entire character of children's books does not come close to representing the married couple whose life is turned upside down when they lose their job. For a film that seems to aim at a dart due to the injustice of welfare and unemployment systems, filmmakers have no problem not being unfair, allowing Hispanic, black and gay stereotypes to have played at such a cruel level. The appearance of the film resembles any episode of Love American Style. This is not a compliment. The fashions of the seventies abound in this world of white-collar theft that only gives an air of implausibility to any situation. Outside of an intelligent initial idea and two capable stars in Jane Fonda and George Segal, this exercise dated in social commentary presents itself as forced and petty for minorities, especially for gay people. If you want a better caper movie, look better with The Hot Rock featuring George Segal and Robert Redford or What's Up Doc with Ryan O'Neal and Barbra Streisand. This is fun!
