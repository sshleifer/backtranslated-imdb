"House of the Damned" (also known as "Specter") is one of your low-budget haunted house movies, full of mediocre performances and economic effects. It's about a family that inherits an old Irish home and, after moving, started experiencing strange phenomena and ghostly apparitions, including the ghost of a girl killed and buried inside a wall in the villa's basement. The couple's young daughter is then taken to another dimension and sought help from a group of paranormal investigators for help. <br /> <br /> The ideas this film has borrowed from the 1982 haunted house movie "Poltergeist" are obvious. I will say that this film has some scary sequences, but sometimes it's very, very boring. The acting here is nothing special, the mood is ok, the score (which was mainly this dramatic Irish opera music) was quite annoying, and the special effects of CGI are really horrible. I mean, it was 1996, you'd think they could do a little better than them. The ending in which the house was on fire was the poorest special effect I saw, very very cheap. But hey, this was a cheap movie. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the translucent wolf monster that the daughter sees looks horribly fake. And what was its meaning in the film anyway? What the hell has a wolf monster with a haunted house? The special effects here are what really ruined this movie. Even the acting was very bad. I usually like many low-budget horror movies, but not this one. "House of the Damned" is nothing special, just consider watching it if you have nothing better to do. But you will probably want to pass it on. 4/10.
