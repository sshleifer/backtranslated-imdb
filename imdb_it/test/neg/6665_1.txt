There are so many logical errors in this show that it is not worth stating. 1) Mystic Gohan does not exist 2) Uub is as powerful as MAJIN BUU but plays absolutely no role on the show, somehow it is easily overwhelmed by every bad boy 3) The whole idea of ​​Super Saiyan 4 is delayed and it's scary to lose at super 17 (which is the worst idea for a bad guy from DB EVER) 4) Super Saiyan 4 Goku is not suitable for the Super 17 but Goku not transformed using a move he learned in a movie that shouldn't have happened, he kills him easily 5) Vegeta is completely useless 6) No character except Goku has any impact on the outcome of the battles 7) The series ends with a spirit bomb ... from 8) Is Goku invincible? does it absorb dragon balls? lame 9) Gotenks? ... even better Goten ??? Trunks ??? both suck 10) Super Saiyan 4 involves a magical transformation in an adult 11) Goku is a child 12) Goku is a child 13) No super saiyan level 2 (characterized by electricity) 14) No imagination with the animation of Gogeta 15) Absolutely useless gogeta 16) Big Bang Kamehameha is the biggest disappointment in the history of souls (it's not logical but I'm going on a bribe) 17) Fights of shorter characters than ever <br /> <br /> I could go on and on long if I hadn't repressed most of the memories associated with this show. When I make enough money, I will fund the remake of this series.
