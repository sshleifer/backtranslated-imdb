I just read an extra long review on the front page of this film on this site and explained in detail that this film deserves to be seen only on the TV show "Mystery Science Theater 3000 !!!!!" And yes, I find that advice really useful! I mean, a film that tries to be so good and so exciting isn't exactly what the movie wants to be !!!!! So yes, watch this movie as seen on that show and instead of giving this movie a single star on ten stars, you can give this ten out of ten stars! Until then, my one-star review is only for the real, pure and intact version of this movie !!!!!! I got it?
