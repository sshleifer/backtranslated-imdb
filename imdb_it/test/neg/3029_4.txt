Does anyone remember the docudrama FILETTI? It is a dramatic documentary that shocked Britain in September 1984. Although it is not exactly entirely entertained by Mick Jackson's nuclear horror film, I could respect it. Unfortunately I can't respect this docudrama broadcast 20 years later about terrorists emitting a radioactive dirty bomb in central London <br /> <br /> The problem I have with this is that the production values ​​of director Daniel Percival are far away too good when in reality this would have benefited from rather cheap production values. Cinematography is superb but in this type of speculative drama do we need a superb and well-lit Oscar standard cinematography? What we certainly don't need is a musical score, while survivors of the explosion slowly stagger from the smoke. Nor do we need vaguely known cast members. Someone else sat there wondering "Hey, what was he in? I know that face" several times? I know I did it and it is very distracting. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest production flaw of DIRTY WAR is that someone has decided to make it a docudrama with too much stylistic emphasis on the drama. In THREADS the action cuts off the action in Sheffield and becomes an edition of HORIZON on the effects of nuclear war before discussing the fictional protagonists and THREADS is very effective for this very reason. Here the information presented suffocates the drama that drowns in the exhibition dialogue and totally unconvincing. The characters in teleplay are not really characters, they are just cryptographers to inform the public of what happens when the radioactive material is ejected. It would have been better if the action was cut into captions to convey this kind of information to THREADS. The worst thing is that director Daniel Percival used the same technique seen in THREADS a couple of years ago with his smallpox docudrama. He should have used the same style as DIRTY WAR <br /> <br /> I should also lay my cards on the table and say that, even if I don't consider most Muslim terrorists, I'm getting bored of TV productions like THE CELL HAMBURG, THE GRID WAR and the DIRTY WAR having to point out to me this fact with me slamming it over my head with what is somehow typical of the condescending attitudes of the PCs in television companies nowadays <br /> <br /> are failed to debate in the studio that Bob mentions here, but I also heard it discussed elsewhere and I can't help but think it's more interesting to see DIRTY WAR itself with its heated arguments between different factions on the political spectrum. If DIRTY WAR is remembered in twenty years (highly unlikely I know) it could be remembered for the discussion it caused more than anything else
