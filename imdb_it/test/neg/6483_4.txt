With Al Jolson at the height of its popularity and the Warner Brothers jazz singer, who had the highest grossing in 1927, it was inevitable that the other studios had some vehicles churned out for their Jolson-esquire characters. But while the Jazz Singer was a sensation for being the first talkie part, the Matinée Idol lacks the singer voice of her star (the now obscure Johnnie Walker), and must make do with only her visual antics. <br /> <br /> The Matinée Idol was a first directorial position for the famous Frank Capra. The first pair of Capra's feature films for Harry Langdon reveal an excessively showy style, which has made the farce of Marcellin already mediocre almost unwatchable. A couple of photos later and Capra has learned to fade a little, with some fairly regular and decent photographic work. However it still shows no aptitude for shooting physical comedies. The longest comedy routine - stage performances - seems to have some good gags, but it's all cropped up in a myriad of different angles, and there's no chance that the comedy will flow naturally from the performances. In theory, a good part of the jokes are in the captions, but there are too many and none of them is particularly funny. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Capra would eventually turn into a beautiful and dramatic romantic director, and you can see it begin to develop in this sense. Lower the line, closing the love with Walker and Bessie in the scene where she first looks at him in his Don Wilson gets up, clearly establishing the wordless connection between them. Then there is a beautiful and tender shot of the couple in their scene together with the masquerade, which is very reminiscent of Capra's early production scenes of the early 30s. <br /> <br /> Johnnie Walker, Columbia's answer to Al Jolson, is not an exceptional talent. His comic times are good but there is nothing to make him stand out. On the other hand, Bessie Love is also a pretty good actress, with a very expressive face. Congratulations to you for being involved in physical comedy and having lost your dignity with boys. There is also a good role for Lionel Belmore, that attitude of round and cheerful characters that seems to appear in all respects between the late 1920s and the early 1930s. <br /> <br /> The idol Matinée is one of those images that has earned more than its fair amount of attention thanks to its director, after having made a handful of masterpieces. In itself it is a very uninteresting piece, and like most of Capra's works before he met Robert Riskin, a disappointment.
