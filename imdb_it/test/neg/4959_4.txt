From the budget point of view, 2.5 million Canadian dollars are not many when you look at animatronics, the puppets in this film, which alone are the reason for the 9-week shoots. I really wanted to see this movie and was hoping to see it when it came out, instead I bought it on DVD recently. My main problem is that it's not funny at all, it's better than Tenacious D who doesn't have a funny bone in his body. But this was a really disappointing film. <br /> <br /> Trevor Matthews is a very strong artist, but his acting sucks! Rachel Skarsten gives what is perhaps one of the most annoying and fun performances I've ever seen. The only really GREAT star in this is David Scott who is a work of art for monsters! His special effects work is the main reason why it is worth watching this movie, he loved the Cyclops and the Troll and Prof Monster had come straight out of Henson's library. <br /> <br /> If you look at this, it won't be the biggest waste of time, but if you're trying to see this for a great Horror Comedy Romp ... Don't worry.
