Although he is not a big fan of the Coen brothers, I am an admirer of their dark humor films like "Fargo" and "Miller's Crossing". I was much less impressed by their other comic mode, goofy-camp (or is that Camp Goofy?) Unfortunately, 'O Brother, Where Art You?' falls into the latter category and is not even as good as "The Big Lebowski" or "The Hudsucker Proxy." <br /> <br /> "O Brother" is basically an episodic series of jokes without much sense, and not even so much humor or intelligence. As many reviewers have noted, is the plot of the film very generic? and, as far as I can tell, quite arbitrarily ?? based on The Odyssey. His main character, Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), is an "adventurer" like his Homeric homonymous and has the "real" goal of returning home to prevent his wife Penny's marriage to a suitor. Obviously, we don't find that this is what the Clooney / Ulysses character really wants so long after we stop worrying. And what does Homer have to do with "Cool Hand Luke" chain gangs, Ku Klux Klan meets "Indiana Jones" worship meetings, the vocabulary of a well-established lawyer, a talent for singing grass country music blue, an association with Baby Face Nelson, a hairstyle similar to Clark Gable and other traits and casual and various character encounters? I leave it for others to discern. <br /> <br /> The allusion to Preston Sturges "Sullivan's Travels" in the title "O Brother's" is just as useless. Yes, viewers who are familiar with Sturges' classic spiteful comedy may find it slightly gratifying to recognize the title of the socially conscious depression film that Sullivan abandons Hollywood and the comedy hoping to do. And they could also be slightly amused by a couple of twists and turns (for example, hopping freight cars, and the chain mixes when you see a movie). But then what? The Coen brothers do not seem to have anything to add to the critical debate on art for art and moral seriousness about the function of art. Obviously they fall into the old school, but this does not seem to motivate the reference in any way. Is it a tribute? If so, why do it? I like the reference to postmodern pop culture and textual play as much as the next person, but is it much more beautiful when it is equivalent to something at least tonally, if not thematically, consistent ?? and not just an arbitrary concoction. <br /> <br /> This script is simply a silly mess. The only coherent and coherent element is the folk / country soundtrack. It doesn't have much to do with Homer or Preston Sturges, but considering the rest of the film, it's probably a good thing. On the other hand, I would recommend using the admission price on the soundtrack CD.
