We chose to see this film as an alternative to The Polar Express which is shown at our local IMAX theater. What a waste of time and money! First of all, it's not nice. The snowman sometimes looked demonic. Other times, it was simply a zombie. He showed no expressions or emotions most of the time, and his hollow blue eyes were just creepy. Secondly, Santa states that in the beginning it is a film about the spirit of giving. Santa Claus and a snowman who declare war on each other is a film about giving? I'm all for a little parody, but it wasn't fun or funny. <br /> <br /> The idea that the snowman's flute is his voice is different. Too bad you don't see or hear the snowman playing his flute ... not even a "thank you" to Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> The only fun parts of the film were the "outtakes" at the end of the film. Too bad they didn't use them in the film. Would have been better.
