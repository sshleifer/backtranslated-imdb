It's a shame. There is an interesting idea here, but it is completely lost in a confusion of Commodore 64-style computer effects and bad narration. The plot, as it is, concerns a hunter of anime sizes. It should be a fairly simple type of hunter / hunter story, but the director and / or writer seem to have forgotten what the film should have been when they were about three days of shooting. Things are not helped by the fact that the main villain seems to be wearing a cheap Darth Maul mask, which they tried to camouflage with flowing CG colors. There is not much to recommend here, even the title seems to push it into darkness.
