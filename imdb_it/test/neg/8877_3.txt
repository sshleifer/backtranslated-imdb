I will recommend including this in the "jump" stack. I was slightly moved by the concept when my girlfriend rented it, and a little more excited when I saw that Milos Forman directed it. Ah, well ..... <br /> <br /> The costumes were beautiful, of course, but they were typical. There was nothing about them that said they came from anywhere except the period Costume department of one of the biggest Hollywood studios. There was no distinction between Spanish, English and French - all dressed as if they were at court in Versailles. The sets somehow didn't evoke the qualities of the settings - the prison didn't look like a prison, the dwellings didn't look like palaces, and the outside scenes seemed to have been shot on a back lot, for all that was probably practical places. <br /> <br /> The score was dramatically lower than it could have been. I've been a fan of soundtracks since I was young, noticing, appreciating and collecting, with which I mean more than John Williams. My fiancée is a professional film composer, a prize winner who had her work at Lincoln Center and a rising star in the industry. At the beginning of the film we had high hopes, and indeed it started well. It quickly deteriorated and in several places - including the scene of the release of prisoners - it actually reached a level of annoyance. Actually I reached the remote control to lower the volume. The soundtrack has never been anything more than the obvious choice to mark a specific stage tone, and it has not been integrated into the soul of the film (think of music in Babel and you will have an idea of ​​what I mean) . He never achieved the greatness he wanted, but then not even the film. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem, however talented, was horrible. For the first part of the film, his mannerisms are so distracted that he takes over his performance. During the second half, everything that was his character in the first half is gone, replaced by a completely different set of annoying mannerisms, and he looked like the son in love with Keith Richards and Lestat by Stuart Townshend. I never had the idea that he was interested in the role (that is, that the character cared about his life and his actions), or that the character was ever designed by writers as something more than an opportunist who, for some reason, change his mind and decide to stick to his principles in the end. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman was very good, even though her performance lacked the nuances of growing madness between her release from prison and the grip of Lorenzo's hand in the end that I really should have called it an effective performance. Alicia's character has never been defined enough to truly discern, and had it not been for the superb make-up on her eyes and cheeks, someone would have seen the beginning of the film and eventually she wouldn't have known she wasn't the same character. Prosthetic teeth were horrible, artificial and annoying, but there's nothing wrong with Mrs. Portman. <br /> <br /> Stellan Skarsgård was as good as Goya. Not worthy of an Oscar, but useful and generally credible. I don't know much about Goya's life, or his deafness, but it seemed to me to be attached to the film as a requisite of biographical information, rather than anything used in the film. I'm sure it has influenced Goya's life much more than requiring the need for an interpreter, but you would never know by looking at this. For the record, words and sounds can only be correctly interpreted 30% of the time through lip-reading. <br /> <br /> Don't get me started on Randy Quaid. At least he was a minor character. <br /> <br /> The script reads like one of the books "choose your adventure" that I read as a child: in different moments of the film, different results are possible, and none of the actions that preceded them brings with certainty to the how the film actually plays. Ironically, the film is also predictable, especially his miserable attempts to make the mood rise through small pieces of humor. The joke on the hands? Maybe it's because I paint (not well) as a hobby and I know that PITA's hands have to draw / paint, but I saw the joke get a mile away, as well as the second half shot. Has the child ever been there for some other reason besides being taken by Ines? There may even be a line of bread crumbs. <br /> <br /> Disappointing. <br /> <br /> (note: this review is a copy of an answer I made to a discussion in the forum)
