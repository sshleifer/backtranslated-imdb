I saw the world premiere of this on the Starz Action channel. They call it Vampires: The Turning. The plot was a bit confusing. There is a voiceover in the introduction to an 800-year-old war, and I have not understood correctly. The film is about a young couple somewhere in Asia (maybe in China, I don't think the film specifies it). The couple has an argument and Meredith Monroe escapes and is kidnapped by a band of Vampires. The boyfriend finds a group of vampires who don't kill humans and start a battle with motorcyclists. Somehow a human group of hunters is involved and the final combat sequence takes place during a solar eclipse. This film is related neither to the Vampires nor to the Vampires: Los Muertos. Confused but decent action. Four out of 10 stars.
