I'm sure there's a documentary in the ruins of this Yawn-fest somewhere, given enough time maybe the producers could find it. I don't connect with any of the characters. This is a problem for a documentary. This disconnection soon turns into a complete animosity bordering on hostility. Although due to the flow of poor stories, I'm not really sure what's happening to them and what the consequences are of whatever they're trying to do. The story and the faces jump so fast that it's very difficult to fully understand what's going on. The third founder who brings them for $ 700K was introduced so late in the film, Khaleil and Tom have to backpalle (to no avail) to explain "oh yes, this guy also created the idea". And just when I thought I had a slight understanding of who all the tertiary characters were, a fool prey to the idea of ​​having a puppy? What happens with that? Also, did Tom really have to give all those embarrassing speeches to the staff? I can only imagine the boredom they felt when it really happened. I actually think I feel for them.
