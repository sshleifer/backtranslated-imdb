When I first saw this DVD in a container for three dollars, I couldn't believe my luck: a Christmas movie with Tori Spelling, William Shatner and Gary Coleman ??? Needless to say, I immediately stole it and considered it a profitable investment. <br /> <br /> The film itself was as bad as any movie you would expect to combine Christmas and the three "celebrities" above. The dialogue was in vain, the characters were one-dimensional and the arc of Carol's character was absolutely incredible. The film itself was a lifeless boring piece that refused to finish and made me feel like a human being when it finally came at last. <br /> <br /> My advice: Don't watch this movie unless you should and then only under the influence of some serious Christmas eggnog.
