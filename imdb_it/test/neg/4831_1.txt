Wait till you see this ... I mean even after reading this review. No other film up to date has sucked more than that .... One thing I don't understand is that when you're ripping an English movie why add your creativity? With the amount spent on making this film, the producers would have to consider buying rights for "Cellular" to dub in Hindi and publish the film. They could have made profits that way, I think. If there was the possibility of classifying this film with a 0 I would have done it and the most pathetic performances come from Tanushree Datta and the girl who played the role of assistant to Aftab. I don't know if my problem is that I saw Cellulare long before this film ..... but this cannot be a reason to support this film ... I could go on for hours but I don't have time to discuss this useless crap of a movie, I don't want to remember those terrible scenes from the movie ..... <br /> <br /> please, stay away from this movie.
