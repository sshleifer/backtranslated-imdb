The novel WEAPON, which serves as the basis for this atrocious piece of garbage, is one of the best techno-thrillers to have come down the pike for a long time. The character of SOLO, which should NOT look like a human, is a wonderful creation and it was simply horrible to see him reduced to another Terminator clone with Mario Van Peebles trying horribly to "behave" like a robot. There is NOTHING worth this movie. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood insist on getting the rights to excellent novels and then massacring them? There are so many things that don't go well with SOLO that listing them seems as unfair as inviting a man without legs to a lively Hopscotch game. Avoid this horrible movie and look for the 2 ROBERT MASON novels that feature the fantastic character of SOLO. The books are WEAPON and an excellent sequel to SOLO. But pay no attention to this terrible disaster of a movie.
