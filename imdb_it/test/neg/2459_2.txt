I don't care much about the factors that others here have challenged: acting, lighting, and so on. For the most part, these things have been done well enough to bring the film and put its points. After all, it's just a horror movie. <br /> <br /> What bothered me were the points themselves. Because this is a deeply moralistic film, and its morality is profoundly negative. In fact it is actually fundamentalist Christian morality, and this is a fundamentalist Christian film. Look at the "sins": <br /> <br /> * The character of Sutherland was chosen by a child at school when he was a pre-adolescent, which led to his accidental death. <br /> <br /> * The character of Baldwin used masculine wiles, persuasion and good looks to gobble several women, some of whom he filmed. Ooh, the pigs! How unfortunate it is for him that women are passive creatures and without flocks who have no complicity in the matter. <br /> <br /> * The father of the character of Roberts returned from Vietnam a drug addict, so shameful to be discovered shooting that he kills himself Yes, what a terrible pity! Why couldn't he have become an alcoholic like everyone else? <br /> <br /> * and the character of Bacon chosen on another schoolgirl. What a horror! Apparently the fact that he was a child counts for nothing. The children, it seems, are divinely judged by adult criteria. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe many people support this level of moral absolutism. Surely it seems to have gone unnoticed in the comments of this film. Does everyone buy this stuff? At least human laws treat children differently than adults, recognizing that their ethical sense is partially formed. This film has no problems, and I find it rather questionable. The idea is that women are helpless and vaporous creatures before the bad lusts of young men. Or that a Vietnam veterinarian driven to drug addiction is so shameful that suicide is a viable option. Pathetic.
