My boss then and showed it to us at a Halloween party in our office. It is the Chris Huntley who collaborated on the script and action. He knows it's bad, we know he's bad and we all agree that the monster looks too much like a vagina to be a coincidence. Perhaps it was from a gynocological experiment that went wrong. <br /> <br /> It was a VERY low budget and the actors were all friends so what you have here is a case of "hey gang, let it put on a show". <br /> <br /> No one was hurt and it was a first attempt. Nothing wrong with that. He gave us a good laugh and it's a great movie to watch with friends and make fun of. :-)
