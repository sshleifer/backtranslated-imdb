I love the book. It is full of passion, romance, tension ... and the film carries with it two Spanish stars. Kylie Minogue was already a major star in Australia, having starred in Neighbors and releasing her first single. The decision to entrust it to The Delinquents was certainly a marketing maneuver. For me, it has not paid off. <br /> <br /> Kylie may have been great at Neighbors, but she was too sweet and innocent to play the exuberant Lola ... and, she wasn't from Asia like Lola was. Charlie Schlatter was a great Brownie, but there was no connection between him and Kylie. <br /> <br /> In general, the film was boring. He dragged on, lacked the passion of the book, concentrated heavily on Kylie and, in general, was completely disappointing.
