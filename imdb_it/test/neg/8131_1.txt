I inadvertently ran into this "trap" of a movie. <br /> <br /> If I could go back in time or just get a refund I would be happy. <br /> <br /> It was 7.30pm and Cenerentola Man didn't start until 10.00pm, so I rushed to the theater to get the movie that started at 7:20 pm ... and I dare say that God held out the hand (or he portrayed it) and allowed me to punish myself for my gluttony sitting film for this movie. <br /> <br /> It might be unfair to criticize a film that was not intended for my heterosexual cohort, however, there is no excuse for the lousy sound and video editing. This film was at most worthy of a budget for a high school project ... and I think I saw better in those French short films that starred at the theater of Louis Laloupe. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because I'm Canadian and this film was for the LA fudge-packing troupe and their nice ladies. Woe to me when I realized that the whole audience spared me for all the jokes and jokes ... I perfectly understood the mentioned humor ... but I just couldn't relate. <br /> <br /> This show has made me show, presumably, how gay men attend and build relationships. However, even if it was their purpose in the film, I feel that the "Gayness" was focused too heavily ... humanity seemed to be missing .... but, again, maybe that was the point ... just being avant-gard ... and take a dip. <br /> <br /> I believe that with a low budget and poor equipment, you have to make your film as "noisy" as possible to get crowds and cash back. I really hope I simply read my Sheldon Van Auken. Hehe ... I was totally in the wrong audience.
