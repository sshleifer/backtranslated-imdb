For a while, while I was in the middle of a job, I used to watch all the talk shows late at night. For a while I had a good choice: Conan, Leno, Letterman, Ferguson, Kimmel ... <br /> <br /> Until I reached the time slot 1:30. The time between Conan and X-Files, on SciFi. And the only show at that time was (and curiously still is) Carson Daly. <br /> <br /> His show intrigued me at the beginning. Young, casually dressed and with the fashionable pedigree of an MTV host, I thought Carson would bring a younger aesthetic late at night. I could not have been more wrong. <br /> <br /> It has no comic timing. His jokes are clearly not amusing, and his monologue is a painful affair of stuttering self-awareness. I started thinking that he simply couldn't offer comedies (and I'm right, he isn't), but it became obvious in the time that the writers of the show must have had it for him. The script was idiotic and too exaggerated and the scenes were terribly ugly. And towards the end of the studio show, the writers had Carson drinking alcohol on the set with gusto in every show, an unsuspecting Carson smiling from an emaciated cheek to an emaciated cheek as he made his way through interviews. <br /> <br /> Zero interview ability. None. Try to be friendly / talkative, but end up being rude and rude. Talks too much. He cuts his guests. He asks them rude or embarrassing questions - if he can find a question to ask them. And as someone had already pointed out, the guests stared at him literally or squirmed in their seats, clearly uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Now the show has come out of the studio and it looks like it was shot on a comfortable video camera. Still, Carson refuses to grasp the NBC clue. At one point, Carson didn't even have a cameraman, he had to film himself for an episode! Wake up, Carson ... that calligraphy is above the wall. <br /> <br /> I see that the show is produced by Carson. I can only imagine that is the reason why she is still on the air, she pays for herself alone.
