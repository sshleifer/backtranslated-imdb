Exceptionally bad! I don't expect much from Garcia since he's one of the most overrated actors today, but Keaton really should have known that this movie would suck and come out while he could (not that I'm particularly fond of him but hey, batman did). <br /> <br /> In one scene Keaton is transported to a chained hospital and wears a Hannibal Lecter face mask when two attack dogs bark at him (dogs can sense the evil you know (vomit)) and Keaton he growls at them making them retreat and whine with his tail between his legs. Did the film shoot the comedy right there? Garcia makes a fool of himself in an interrogation scene with dialogues that only a complete retard can find plausible and the child is too annoying to feel sorry for ... <br /> <br /> If you're going to make a movie with the poor a plot like you need a certain charm, humor, some solid action. Take Die Hard for example which is great despite the rather disgusting plot. <br /> <br /> Although the character of Keatons was a joke, I routed it all the time. I wanted to see Garcia crying over his dead baby and Keaton sipping martinis on some paradise island, anyway! This film makes a good laugh. Watch it with a witty friend and you can have some fun while this movie asks for jokes in almost every scene. <br /> <br /> All in all it is an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money. Greed made this film and thank God he bit his ass.
