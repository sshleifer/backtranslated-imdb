Yesterday was one of those days when we decided to go to the cinema. We chose "Ik ook van Jou" more or less at random, but we were interested in seeing the status of the current Dutch film. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a book by Ronald Giphart and I must confess immediately that it is not exactly one of my favorites. The film features actors who are best known in the Netherlands for their appearances in soap operas and / or afternoon talk shows. At least one of them (Kamerling) did pretty decent things after leaving the world of soap. So we decided to give this film the benefit of the doubt. <br /> <br /> And what a mistake it was. This film fails on all fronts. Bad acting (the best performance is actually from a guinea pig, which very convincingly pretends to be dead). A flat and uninteresting story with unexplained side insinuations (why in France? Why tell the story to a girl from Uganda?) Errors (blacks should not use sunscreen, as far as I know, and heating systems in the Netherlands they don't produce clouds of steam like in New York, even if this sounds beautifully on the film, people don't wear T-shirts outside on New Year's Eve in Northern Europe). There is a fun moment involving two little dogs, and that's it. <br /> <br /> So that's what I think, but above all, it seemed that none of the people coming out of the cinema had appreciated it. I heard one saying he was extremely disappointed, because he liked the book so much. I haven't read the book, but my advice should be: read the book, don't see the movie.
