I love Lucy, but this movie is so terribly bad that I felt embarrassed for everyone in the first ten minutes. . . and from that moment it got worse. The "singing" of Lucille Ball is definitely painful and attempts to make her look younger through the use of soft focus made me reach for reading glasses. They are bombs like this that give the bombs a bad name.
