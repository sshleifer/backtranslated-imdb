Just when you think you have seen the worst that the zombie subgenus can offer, here is another Romero and her team of talentless comrades showing that you are wrong. <br /> <br /> I suffered The Zombie Bloodbath trilogy, endured Death Valley: Bloody Bill's revenge, sat semi-comatose through The Zombie Diaries, and laughed hysterically during Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence, and genuinely thought that the making of amateur films could not sink. However, having just seen Zombie Planet, a long stack of bullies for two hours by writer / director George Bonilla, I think I found the most in terrible zombie movies. <br /> <br /> In this terribly amateur effort, which is part of Mad Max and part Dawn of the Dead (but ALL badly), Frank Farhat plays TK Kane, a tough fighter who kicks zombies for a hobby, armed just knives, a machete, some concussion grenades, and obviously he perceives a really bad look. <br /> <br /> After a hopelessly ineffective opening sequence in which he takes a horde of shy-looking zombies, Kane joins a group of survivors who not only must repel attacks from the undead, but must also appease a band of vicious thugs who have taken control of the area (searching for and delivering any valuable items they find). <br /> <br /> Of course, Kane is not the kind of man to take orders from a group of post-apocalyptic z-grade bullies, and decides to teach the bad guys they are a lesson (especially looking at them in a threatening way), stopping just to periodically save friends from zombies. <br /> <br /> With a horrible acting by almost everyone involved, a horrible script, laughable effects and poor production values, there is practically nothing in this film that is worth being a watch . To be honest, I really like the basic premise that zombies are the unexpected result of a very popular weight-loss drug that blocks carbohydrate cravings (we learn this when a character conveniently explains the background to Kane, who strangely has no idea what it happened), but this is the only vaguely interesting aspect of the entire production. <br /> <br /> I have some respect for anyone who can finance and create their own film, but when the results are this poor, that respect is lost when they decide to make it available for public viewing. I would have kept this under secret if I did.
