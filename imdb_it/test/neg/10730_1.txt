There is no "fun" entertainment in the desperate situation of illegal immigrants! Or the desperate situation of head-shop owners, after all! That the richest of God, Brian Glazer, has not seen the irony of having the "heroes" do exactly what the villain does - stealing honest and hard-working people of their life savings - it doesn't surprise me! Hell, how do you think he became richer than God ?! <br /> <br /> In this alleged greed satire, these mental midget reveal their own hypocrisy: the McMansions, the McToys, the McChildren, the McIllegals who are peanuts paid to take care of McMansions, McToys and McChildren! But the main problem (apart from the revolting caprice) is the premise: as a former executive of a now infamous company, Dick would be the great scalp for every corporate headhunter in the country! There are no tables for him! And, making six tall figures round up, you'd think he wouldn't be mad about a Gore / Lieberman poster!
