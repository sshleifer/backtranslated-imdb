Being a fan of the game and watching this movie made me physically sick !! <br /> <br /> It was a terrible movie, even though the plot was similar to the plot of the games. the whole thing about super-human soldiers. In addition to this Jack Carver, an all-American man in the game, is played by a germen, unless it is a kind of twisted irony, this is what made me pull a middle finger on the TV screen when it is started. The fact that it can be said that it was shot in a forest in the middle of what seemed to be mid-summer, this is not required because the game is set in the tropical rainforest, while it seems that the director has just looked out the window The morning went "This is a beautiful forest". <br /> <br /> THIS IS A NOTE FOR ALL THE ADMINISTRATORS: If you intend to make a movie based on a game / a book, make it clear, ask the fans not ... don't play it for an hour and think that you know !!!
