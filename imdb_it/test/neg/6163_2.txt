An American boy goes to Paris after his mother has committed suicide, becomes an artist and then discovers himself and returns to the United States to be able to do things well with his former friends. <br /> <br /> I have to think that people who rank this film so much are fans of X-Files, even if there are no aliens or serial killers. Don't be fooled, this movie sucks. <br /> <br /> The story is inconsistent, with little or no explanation of what people are doing or why. When you get an explanation, it doesn't fit the story that preceded it. What it does is to bore you. For all the acting talents in the film, it's not interesting. I spent the whole movie wondering when Duchovny, a sex addict, would hit someone. Maybe he was doing it backstage; they should have turned it instead. <br /> <br /> What comes out is the story of a self-obsessed artist who cares about small incidents in his life and wants to make them somehow right - even if they don't seem wrong to begin with. There are no particularly interesting or shocking revelations, despite the mention of a great secret in the first minutes. He's just a guy who thinks his life is as interesting to you as it is to him. It is not. <br /> <br /> I saw in the banality that Duchovny claims to have written the script in a week, is quite credible. The boy can act, no doubt, but writing and directing are obviously beyond his talents. <br /> <br /> Because Hollywood continues to give light to these self-discovery stories it's beyond me. Every morning I find myself in the shower, but I don't mind making a film about it. Mine would probably be better than this, though; at least there would be a little nudity.
