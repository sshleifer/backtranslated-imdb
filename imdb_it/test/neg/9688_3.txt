I just wanted to say that I was very disappointed after seeing this movie! I was expecting a biblical story displayed with a large special fx, etc. But during the film I discovered that this was an absolute disaster ... it was not biblical at all ... only the boat and the animals were similar to the story ... if you want a visual "translation" of the biblical version of Noah, then NOT watch this movie!
