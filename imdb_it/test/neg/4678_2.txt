The name of Bad Company's best-selling album is called "10 From 6". You may have just finished this album and cut the sound of this movie. Most of the songs played in the film came from this album. I imagine that the elderly in the 70s were probably tired of all the period pieces made in the 1930s and 1940s. That's how I feel in films made in the 70s. The characters in the film seemed to be auditioning for Danny Terrio. Because movies have to exaggerate in the 70s. The only vintage piece I liked was "Freaks and Geeks". They cut that television program. It was exactly like when I was in high school when I returned around 1980. I was old enough to remember the 1970s and no small city was like that. He was totally dominated by youth. There were no reactionaries who talked about the hippies and the inner city of Philly. It was more than the 70s that I remember as a child. This film was very boring and poor. Sometimes, I was falling asleep. I don't know why an actor who acted during the 70s appeared in this. He was probably trying to lend him some credibility. Walken didn't show up until the second half. I guess the only real thing about the movie was that the "baby boomers" were / are a little spoiled. All the guys in the movie were spoiled brats. I don't know what they had against their father.
