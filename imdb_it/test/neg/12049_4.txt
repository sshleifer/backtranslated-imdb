The brief shortening of John Irving's novel boldly aspires to depth but ends up being absurd. It's a strange, bizarre and bittersweet set of sketches, which tries to explain the growth of a man from birth to adulthood and how he deals with the vices of lust and fanaticism that surround him. Garp was born to a formidable unmarried mother, Jenny Fields, played by Glenn Close. (The various stages of Garp's childhood are interpreted by three young actors before Robin Williams took over as Garp reaches adulthood.) The story follows him in childhood at a boy's' prep school, where Jenny is the school nurse, through her high school passions - wrestling, writing and sex - to marriage with her high school sweetheart, children, marital problems and a writing career. Meanwhile, Jenny has become a famous feminist, marrying an unorthodox cause. The plot depicts an abundance of comic and tragicomic episodes and extravagant adventures. Williams performs as a cherub. This script was not suited to his wild nature and anarchy and therefore his talent was wasted. It's like a wounded bird that spits out of control. The role of John Lithgow as a transsexual father who imparts wisdom also makes no sense. This film was able to attract some attention in 1982, due to the popularity of Robin Williams and his new entry in the movies. Recently, Williams gave up his jobs on Mork and Mindy and focused more on cabaret and movies. The audience was confused by this film, especially from its arbitrary and inexplicable ending.
