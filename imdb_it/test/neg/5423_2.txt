From all appearances this serial could have been made at any time since the mid-forties. Cardboard sets, the kings of the moon with lightning sewn on their aprons, you know the drill. This is an adventure by Rocky Jones, with reports from the space cop with the unbearable Bitch Queen of the Offeecious planet, a communist planet that will not join the United Planets. When the noble messengers of intergalactic reason announce that Offeecious is on a collision course with this other vaguely Slavic planet, Bitch Queen decides to blow up others rather than evacuate her land. This introduces a moral to the effect of "The greatness of a nation is not in its land, but in its people", which is hammered five or six times during the conversation. The constant nasal beat of the BQ on "OffEEEEcious" provides relief from some seriously desired spatial effects, is this a TV show?
