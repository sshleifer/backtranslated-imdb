No, * Hitch * is definitely not a romantic comedy about Christopher Hitchens, a formerly bizarre (and biblical) ex-leftist-pundit-turned-commentator, although surely it would have been a more fun movie. A small and squat Englishman, with his teeth stained with cigarettes and Guinness, barking advice - and a bitter political comment - to men in love: "Watch his EYES when you talk to her, you mad! And remember: call someone a 'mole conservative "actually makes you an anti-Semite! Can't you get anything definite, you liberal pantywaist?" <br /> <br /> Oh well. Instead, we get Will Smith, whose continuing success remains a mystery to me, at least. They are apparently only in this sense. Smith is the most powerful man in Hollywood at the time of writing: Americans can't help but throw their money at him. I, on the other hand, find his satisfaction unbearable, not attenuated by a scene here (ruined by the trailer) where he undergoes a drastic allergic reaction to seafood. We know that Smith will bounce in his good looks, too muscular, because there is a fat sitcom actor (Kevin James) who makes fun of himself. We should laugh hysterically whenever the slob starts dancing like a donkey ("Everybody Dance Now!" By CC Music Factory), but why does an accountant with a straight arrow behave like this? I have worked for several years with several straight arrow accountants and I can tell you that if, in Norman Mailer's memorable phrase, "the tough guys don't dance," not even the straight arrow accountants. Am I taking this too seriously? Or - and here is a bold thought - perhaps the writers couldn't conceive a character logically designed to save their lives? <br /> <br /> About writers, they come up with a lousy idea for Smith's love interest: a writer for a tabloid (Eva Mendes). Since when does the tabloid insinuate it deserves love? In what universe are they, anyway? - Everyone here on IMDb is really gushing about this tripe. Or you all need to raise the level, in terms of entertainment value for your buck, or I'm just a skunk at the garden party. (I, and about 150 million other long-suffering boyfriends and husbands.) In any case, if I can imitate Smith's Attack and offer my male readers some smooth advice: when you are dragged to see * Hitch *, say at your best half, "hey, it was pretty good" after the movie ended. Don't be too enthusiastic; don't excite him, she'll know you're lying to her. Praise him in a slightly surprised way, as if the film were better than you expected and not the agonizing waste of time that it was in reality. But what am I saying, eh, guys? - we guys know all the moves. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10.
