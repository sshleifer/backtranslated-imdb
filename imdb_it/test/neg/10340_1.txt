At the moment I'm 22 and I remember seeing this movie in theaters when it came out. You heard me right, I was 5, yet I still distinctly remember what I saw that afternoon many years ago. Was it a mystical journey through the fantastic world of Mark Twain's creativity? ... No, on the other hand, it was a rather disturbing film on Mark Twain's dark, depressed and actually suicidal side. A scene that still disturbs me was a particularly strange scene in which Mark Twain is playing the organ at his own funeral. <br /> <br /> Would an adult like this movie? Well, this film probably has some interesting points of view that could interest a person with a practical knowledge of Mark Twain's writing; but believe me on this, "Adventures" is NOT the movie you want to use to present your children to Mark Twain.
