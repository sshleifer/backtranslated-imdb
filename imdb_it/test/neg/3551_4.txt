Not even original in the plot. I have buzzing. There were a couple of corners that could have been quite interesting, but the film follows the path of 90% of Hollywood movies. I didn't really "play" Samuel Jackson's acting most of the time in his other films, but he was pretty good at it. He rarely screamed and went much further into his character than going back to "anger in the face". I liked Eva Mendes - as usual - and although it is a great pleasure for the eyes, it proves to be much more than an actress. Even Luis Guzman was really good, except I didn't like the change of his character towards Samuel Jackson at the end of the film. How can his character focus on a dislike of a former cop and then turn into a lollipop within a fraction of a second? Has no original thought remained in Hollywood?
