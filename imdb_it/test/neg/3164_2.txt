This film looks good, and that's where my praise ends. "Love is a wonderful thing" came out in the schizophrenic year of 1955, when a caramel-colored absurdity like this co-existed with a breathtaking art fair like "Kiss Me Deadly". As a trend towards smaller and socially conscious films such as "On the Waterfront" and "Marty" have emerged in the mid-1950s, other directors have felt the need to stick to the pressing and tormenting melodrama that ranks many other films of that decade , and "Love" is one of the latter. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie from the 50s in which Technicolor is used to the fullest and lighting is invariably of high quality; even the scenes that take place in a dark room or at night are brighter than the average sunny day. I never want to listen to the theme again, since it is played quite frequently throughout the film to last a lifetime, and I certainly don't want to hear it sung by the sharp and penetrating chorus that surrounds it beyond the end titles. Jennifer Jones and William Holden are passable, but in reality anyone could have played these parts. The role of Jones is horribly written - his character is incredibly inconsistent, and it seems that every time his character is required to make a decision about something, the writers threw a coin to decide what the decision would be. <br /> <br /> People will no doubt tell me I'm taking this movie too seriously, that I'm not romantic, etc. But I loved "All That Heaven Permits", released the same year and just like the cornball in his own way, with the exception of Douglas Sirk is able to turn melodrama into an art form, while Henry King (director of "Love ") it is not. <br /> <br /> I can usually enjoy a bad melodrama, but in this case I was just bored. <br /> <br /> Vote: D +
