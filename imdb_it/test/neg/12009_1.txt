Whenever someone tries to tell me that they think a movie is the worst ever (and it's usually a "cool" movie to hate, like "Manos, the Hands of Fate" or "The Avengers"), I ask them "is Does that film a comedy about an orphan constantly trying to assassinate adults? Does someone say the phrase "I'd rather eat bullshit" in that movie? "<br /> <br /> This film is WAY too childish and cruel for adults, also too violent and irresponsible for children. Is there so much money in the demographic area of ​​Beavis and Butt-head to make a series of films like this? There is a Problem Child 3, but I have not seen it. I'd rather eat an asshole.
