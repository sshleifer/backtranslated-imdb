Don't get me wrong: I like auteur films, low-budget films, character studies and foreign films. Unfortunately, I couldn't enjoy this glacial rhythm, the complete lack of plot and characters that you don't like enough to hate, but you can't tolerate enough to like. <br /> <br /> To me, Distant was like watching the movie on the floor of a reality show - all the scenes that were considered too uninteresting and normally wouldn't have made the final cut, were the only scenes included. A camera in my apartment with two friends of mine who hang around for hours doesn't make an interesting film. <br /> <br /> Distant certainly makes the observer feel that way - long sections without dialogue (about 10 minutes before the first word is pronounced by the end credits) can be made to work (I can think of 2001 ), but for me something else has to happen that involves me. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of observer who can sit in a movie and be satisfied with the analysis of the film, maybe it will work for you. However, if you are someone who chooses to watch movies to relax, expand your mind or be entertained, you should probably look elsewhere.
