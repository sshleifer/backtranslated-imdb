Yes, this bizarre feature was written by John Sayles. Shot in Toronto, it is another film from the 1980s era about the dangers of the urban jungle, where the police are afraid to go and the homeless and the criminal classes are the only inhabitants. In this mix comes the myth of Wild Thing, a young savage raised by a lady purse after her parents were killed by a dirty policeman (Maury Chaykin) and Chopper, the local crime lord (Robert Davi). Mix local do-gooders (priest Sean Hewitt and clueless social worker Kathleen Quinlan), and have a recipe for some pretty exciting action sequences. Davi is the star of the cast, and director Rene Verzier does a good job. Otherwise it is a rather large action scene that will not satisfy the action fans and will leave the Sayles fans speechless.
