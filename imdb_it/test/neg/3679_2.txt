While I was in Madrid, I could see a copy of this film. Wow! Gallo is incredible. Very unusual performance that gives. Apart from the genius of Gallo, the film is still a boring film I've ever seen in my life and sometimes it's so badly done that it borders on the ridiculous. I'm also a fan of Val Kilmer so it was part of the reason I made a great effort to see the film. The problem is that Val is really alone in one scene. Having his name in the cast as a protagonist is an insult to my intelligence and the rest of the cast. I only saw Stranded by other filmmakers. Both films are far below average, but both contain very interesting interpretations of Vincent Gallo. If you are a Gallo fan then I will see this movie regardless of how bad it is. If you don't like Gallo then there is ZERO left to love.
