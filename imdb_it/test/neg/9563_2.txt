Needless to say, a minimum of permits must be made when a true story is adapted to the big screen. But if you shoot a fairy tale that has almost nothing to do with what really happened, why call it Bugsy and make the public believe that this was a story halfway? The Godfather trilogy elaborates many real characters and events, even Once Upon A Time In America, but they do not claim to tell real stories. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> In the film, Benny has this grand vision of a gambler's Eldorado; in real life Lansky had to convince him to go to Nevada. Benny considered the idea of ​​an idiot Montecarlo counterpart, and would have preferred to continue his life as a playboy in L.A. Not long after that Benny warmed up the idea. But obviously he is the hero of the film, so of course the idea had to be his. <br /> <br /> In the film, Benny wants to use the Count of Frasso to get close to Mussolini to assassinate him because he was Hitler's partner, and Hitler killed Jews in the gas chambers after all. Obviously we should like Benny, so the writers have invented this nonsense. In real life, at that time no one knew about the gas chambers, least of all Benny who was completely uninterested in politics. In fact he used the connection of the countess and visited Mussolini, but not to kill him, but to sell him explosives. He also met Goebbels and Goering during his stay in Italy. <br /> <br /> Greenberg's entire subplot makes no sense. Greenberg did not turn the pigeon into stool, did not seek refuge with Benny, Benny did not kill him (which was up to Albert Tannenbaum) ... at least they took the right name. <br /> <br /> I guess it should have been very romantic to let Benny return Virginia, offering him the money he had stolen. The film goes so far as to tell us through text panels that she sadly returned the money to Lansky after Benny's murder. Let me just say that revisionism does not become more brazen than this. <br /> <br /> This list is by no means exhaustive - there is the problem with Benny's family that does not live in Los Angeles, the way Benny takes care of Dragna and Adonis, the portrait of Costello (a kind of unpleasant body), Lansky (an adorable teddy bear), Benny himself (an old windbag that wouldn't have turned 12 if he was regularly "bugsy" in situations like those in the movie, and moreover, those who have neither 'look nor the charisma of Benny Siegel) and many others. Apart from some concrete facts, nothing is right in this film. <br /> <br /> * THE SPOILERS END HERE * <br /> <br /> All in all, this is the only film of the mafia that manages to be even more ridiculously bad than Harlem, NY. But honor where honor is due: this is an enterprise in itself.
