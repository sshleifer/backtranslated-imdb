Let's not fool ourselves, this atrocity is not Plan Nine or Cat Women. It's ugly, period! The performances range from the drama of the drama school (Marla English) to a "could not care less" through (Tom Conway). Photography (even with a good print) is so obscure that it is sometimes difficult to see what is happening. The real problem, however, is the aimless plot, meaningless, almost without plot and lead-free and lead-free direction. With a time of 77 minutes, it still seems infinite. <br /> <br /> The script is particularly inept. There are two lines of history that intersect only at the end of the image. Tom Conway is trying to create a super race, using voodoo and modern science (even if there is little science in evidence) that he can control telepathically. He is holding his wife (without any visible reason). Meanwhile, a couple of little scammers and a white hunter-type guide are trying to find the village he is working in, with the expectation of gold and jewels. When they finally arrive, Tom Conway decides that one of them, the woman, is the perfect subject for his experiments. She is transformed into a monster, kills Conway (natch!) And then returns to normal. He sees a golden statue half drowned in a pool of boiling water, tries to recover it and falls into the water and apparently drowns. The white hunter saves his wife. In the final shot we see that the apparently drowned woman emerges again as the monster; threatening a sequel (now that it's really a scary thought!). <br /> <br /> The producer AIP, Samuel Z Arkoff, in a conference included on the DVD, boasts of identifying the niche market for teenagers and satisfying them with ingenious films at low cost. However, it is difficult to see how anyone thinks that this rancid concoction can satisfy any kind of audience. What appeal do they think they could have? The monster appears so rarely that it could hardly be called a horror film. The action in the jungle is warm and boring. There are no adolescents and no characters with whom one might expect adolescents to identify. <br /> <br /> The producers have shown 77 minutes of film, but they have not made a film. This is a hoax and Arkoff should be ashamed of his association with it.
