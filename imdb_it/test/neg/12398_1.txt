Imagine the plot of b-movie horror as much clich√© as you can. Add more holes in the plot than the plot. Foul written by a 10-year-old child. Have the A-level theater actors play really fake American accents (in the Isle of Man!) Add the special effects of the monsters that will appreciate B & W Dr Who lovers. Result: film duff. Throw Samantha Janus by taking off her clothes (take a point of this on the cover) and you will probably sell enough copies to make a profit anyway!
