I saw this movie in 1956 and again on Cable a few days ago. The film did not improve with age. Quite the contrary. It's a real epic of spaghetti. <br /> <br /> The Trojans are heroic and likeable; the Greeks are evil, mean and devious. <br /> <br /> And if Paris had fled with the king's wife? Hey ... love is love.
