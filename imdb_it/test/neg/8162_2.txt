There is somewhere here the stuff of a routine science fiction story, albeit a decent one. It is hampered by several factors. First of all, the actor is simply horrible. Even the competent actors are horrible. The dialogue is of wood and stilts. The plot predictably limps. This seems less like a finished film than the actors who go for a walk. Extremely disappointing.
