Anthony Perkins and Sophia Loren are absolutely beautiful in this ca. 1840 "western". This alone, however, does not help a ridiculous story, with innumerable historically incorrect elements. <br /> <br /> Byrl Ives is as convincing as the 70-something tyrannical patriarch, an egoman who swears to see his 100th birthday. His wild dance at a party that gives his neighbors will cause someone to notice (does this guy have SEVETY SEI?). He always murmurs the biblical verses, demands respect, while he drives away his children and friends with his self-mockery and moving cruelty. <br /> <br /> The love story between Perkins and Loren appears initially absurd, but becomes credible near the end. There is a lot of drama, but not enough to feel good. Clearly written for the stage, this story was dated even when it was shot. Perkins whistles "My Bonnie" in 1840, although the song was not composed until 1882. <br /> <br /> The critics who knock on Sophia Lorens "the command of the English language" are rather mean. I found it impeccably English and completely audible. As a Neapolitan, Loren speaks a distinct dialect that has often been nicknamed "correct Italian". His "accent", however, barely affects the way he speaks English. As a first generation German, I can appreciate the efforts of those who learn English as a second, or even third or fourth language. <br /> <br /> "Desire Under The Elms" is a drama (or even a tragedy) in the classic sense. For my enjoyment there was no logical history and no overall "reward" for the time invested. Fans of the stars will not want to lose it, others, however, will tune at their own risk!
