Directed by E. Elias Merhige "Begotten" is an experiment with some interesting ideas that just do not succeed in what they were trying to do. The film is an ultra-slow, arguably effective, irritating 76-minute experience that attempts to present an intriguing philosophy about the creation of the Earth and human nature. <br /> <br /> It opens with God presented as a psychopath tied to the chair man who rips his stomach using a knife. Mother Nature emerges from the bowels, blood and human waste. He proceeds to soak with the sperm of the dead god. Later he gives birth to the Son of the Earth. A retarded person who has constantly abused a group of cannibal people that I consider to be the representation of humanity. <br /> <br /> "Begotten" takes a distorted and worrying look at the origin of life. Demonstrate the self-destructive nature, violence, lust and greed that have become a trademark for humanity. The problem in the film comes from two points. One is that the film is too slow in its show. What we get is a good thirty minutes spent to show how the Son of the Earth is shaking continuously naked on the ground while at the same time being molested and tortured by humanity. Such an insignificant prolongation becomes boring fast enough and the punch is missing in giving a blow to the senses of the spectator. <br /> <br /> Another point is the appearance and visual sound of "Beggoten". Low-key, inverted, black and white cinematography enchants the disturbing factor of the plot, but such novelties often only work in short periods of time. Then gradually they begin to lose their effect as the audience gets used to the look. The audio suffers from the same problems. It's constant repetitive and similar sounds get annoying so fast that I had the urge to turn off the volume. "Begotten" loses its charm shortly after the start. He tries to be original and creative but fails to expand on the ideas suggested by the vague plot, instead he repeats the same scene over and over again. <br /> <br /> The conclusion is that "Begotten" is blocked in an instant. Even if with regards to the plot he tries to move forward, the images and the audio remain the same everywhere. Show the same action in a slightly different way with a slightly different sound. A trick cannot make a movie by itself. It also needs rhythm and variety, something that Merhige seems to have forgotten.
