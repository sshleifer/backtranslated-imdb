Thank God for the DVR and the high speed of its fast forwarding. Even with that I could not bear more than that parody. When they met the old Indian who asked for beans, I gave up and canceled it. Is this the best that SciFi Channel can invent for Saturday night? What about some old classics? The idea of ​​a coed special forces unit was pretty bad. It seems they wanted to save money by having everything turned in the woods. What else can I say? It was so terrible that I don't think I can find enough lines to qualify for the space to review it. But it seems that an extra line will do it. Save your time, let alone your money on this movie dog.
