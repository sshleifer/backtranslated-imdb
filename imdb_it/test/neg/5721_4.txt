Honestly, this film is weak. Very weak. Only the capital character can do something. It works like a compressor on a poor engine ... so if you like red-haired Valkyries, do it. But better to find the image of Brigitte as Sonja and put it on the desktop. It will save disappointments. Well, Arnold also makes his agreement ... but it's definitely not his best role. Other characters: bad is not that word. Does the sword fight? Monsters? Ridiculous. The plot is really shameful. Why was rape necessary her? Above all, we don't see it. <br /> <br /> However the film is weak. Even if there are worse films ... Without main characters it would only be ******. And if someone discusses it, maybe ...
