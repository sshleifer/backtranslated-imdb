This film was really poor. I went to the theater expecting something exciting, and instead I was given the opportunity to hone my skills "guess the next twist before it happens". Seriously, the plot was written with a crayon very often so that everyone could see. Nothing was really shocking. In fact, even the gore was greeted with such a complete suspicion of belief that it really didn't do much. <br /> <br /> The excessive wise rift and the cops who speak in the crime scenes have made everything seem more fake. And the scene in which the character of Lambert is struggling with clues and reaches his "investigative epiphany" does everything to indicate the level of intellect expected by the public - small. <br /> <br /> Probably the most boring aspect of cinematography was the "X-Files" treatment: every building in the film, whether it was the enclosure building, a house at noon, or a hospital, suffered of a lack of visible lighting (not to mention the lack of "patients"). 'in the case of the hospital). I don't remember a single scene when someone turned on a light switch. It would certainly have been nice. <br /> <br /> Mr. Lambert is actually not an Oscar-level actor, so I suppose you should take this film for what it's worth. In the end, I came to the conclusion that the only thing that would make this movie more fun is to watch it after seeing "The Warriors". Otherwise, there remains an effort that is boring and unoriginal, and nowhere near the peers of such films as "Silence of the Lambs".
