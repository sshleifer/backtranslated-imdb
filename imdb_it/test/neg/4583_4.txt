But like the Disney movie of two generations ago, this film also fails in the precision department. But at least Disney used a Skye Terrier. <br /> <br /> Is the real story trivial for film producers? I don't think so. There is ample documentation to accurately portray their true story instead of the fictional accounts we had to endure. <br /> <br /> One day, a film will correctly depict Bobby's owner, John Gray, as the Edinburgh policeman he was, and correctly portrays Bobby's license paid by Lord Provost. When that happens, I'll be in the cinema.
