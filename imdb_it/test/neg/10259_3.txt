I have just finished this unofficial adaptation of H.P. "The Lurking Fear" by Lovecraft filmed in Louisiana. Outside of some changes (names, settings), this follows the short story point by point for the first 70 minutes, but then tries to inject its final "twist" that could be seen coming from a mile away. In any case, it is a much better adaptation of Full Moon's THE LURKING FEAR. Too bad it's a terrible movie. Director David McCormick shoots it with all the charm of an industrial short film. I swear I counted maybe two camera movements. Creature design is cheap (we're talking about masks bought in the store here) but shot in an obscure way (intentional or not) where they are somehow creepy. The most impressive thing in the picture is the abandoned villa, but McCormick fails to exploit it. File this into good adaptation, poor performance.
