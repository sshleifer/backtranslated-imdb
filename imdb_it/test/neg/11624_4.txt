I was disappointed with the sequel to the Swan Princess. I can see what they were trying to do with the story, show how married life was for Odette and Derek but the story was not interesting enough to get my attention and seemed to cover the same basics as the original. > <br /> It's not funny. The only aspect that I found humorous was when Jean-Bob became a prince and then again in a frog and no one saw it happen and was trying to convince them he really did. <br /> <br /> the villain is rubbish and the animation is not as impressive as the first movie. <br /> <br /> The Queen is a very irritating character and instead of cheering with Derek to save her mother, you hope the villain puts a spell on his voice box to keep her from talking. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because I really enjoyed the first film, but it didn't live up to my expectations.
