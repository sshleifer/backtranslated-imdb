I can imagine the authors of this story thinking of this script: <br /> <br /> 1. We make a serial killer movie like Se7en, Knight Moves, Copycat and Silence of the Lambs. People like serial killer things. Will sell ... 2. The killer must adopt a sort of scheme. I know; it will copy it from a serial killer mystery novel. This has not yet been done, at least not exactly so. 3. Now, we need a way to make this movie unique; of course, the good guy can be as bed-ridden as in Rear Window. 4. Finally, we need an ending that will give this film the success of The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects. <br /> <br /> Okay, now that you know these things, you know the whole movie, so don't waste your money. One thing I really hate about filmmakers is that they adopt a perfectly valid concept for movies and invest them completely in the ground. I wrote better stories than this when I was in Junior High. I kept checking my watch every five minutes. When the twist finally arrived, I wasn't shocked, I just said "Oh, who cares ?!" The characters are two-dimensional. They have your typical film personalities. This film is only proof that stealing the elements of other successful films is not an excuse for a bad script. I give this movie 1 out of 10. Normally, it would gain at least 2 or 3, but I'm so fed up with non-originality. When will they learn? 1/10
