I live in Mexico City, so I have to suffer from the trailers of every piece of trash that comes out of all these stupid Mexican directors. Do you want to admire a Mexican boy to make great movies? Take a look at something by Guillermo del Toro (especially The Devil's spine), or perhaps Alfonso Cuar√≥n (although I don't like his films, but I respect them). <br /> <br /> Mexican filmmakers often produce the most terrible garbage ever (Por La Libre, El Segundo Aire, American Visa), but this is one of the lowest points in Mexican films of all time. If you respect your brain, please avoid this piece of **** at all costs. It would be smarter to watch some videos of a wedding or watch Britney's reality show. It has more IQs than everyone in this "movie".
