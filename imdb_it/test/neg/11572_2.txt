the imagination must have escaped the mind of Jim Wynorski when he wrote the script to this. I don't care when the animal scenes are almost identical, but when the actors repeat the lines of other films it's going a little too far. I enjoyed seeing Jay Richardson and Glori Ann Gilbert being eaten. Gloria brings nothing to a movie but her boobs (my husbands' feelings). Jerri Manthey should remain on the island of survival, his acting is rigid, unbelievable and she simply a bourgeois. liked the scene where the cobra comes out of the ocean and eats the guy, then for an added taste destroys the squalid one. At least we know that the giant snake man in the next plot komod kills before becoming a dad in an egg nest. Jerri would be great like the mother cobra. sit with a pact of 6 or a couple of joints. will relieve pain.
