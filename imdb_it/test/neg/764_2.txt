My God, the things that went by entertainment in this country ... <br /> <br /> This is not the "Tom and Jerry" that you might have enjoyed Saturday morning, with an unlucky cat and a smart mouse . This is a very old series of animations, with a pair of Mutt-and-Jeff clones meddling in various scratches that translate into any of the typical skeleton-type dance gags that made up a large part of the early animations. /> <br /> This particularly vile excursion, apparently originally intended as a vehicle for a pair of black stage comedians of the time, has the couple crashing into the ocean as it flew to Africa, requiring face make-up black, exaggerated dialect "negro" and situations "Feets, do not fail me now". <br /> <br /> It only shows that in the 1970s between emancipation and this film, the American vision of Africans had not progressed much. Then again, at least one of them apparently had a pilot license.
