A group of student yuppies gather in their free time to latch onto each other's wires and die. So they stop counting the time before brain death, so they begin CPR and cardiac massage and come back to life. The fact that Julia Roberts was in this film should tell everything. FLATLINERS are like the GHOST group. Everyone wants to see their dead relatives and visit their dead old friends, so what better way to do it if a group of medical students kills you for five minutes and then brings you back to life. The rest of the film has predictable relationship problems, in addition to the predictable "GEE MAYBE IF WE KILLED EVERYONE, ONE OF THESE DAYS ONE OF US WILL BE DEAD? D'oh !!! This film should have been called BRAIN DEAD. The fact that the characters were portrayed as medical students made me wonder if they had gone to a foreign correspondence school to get their diplomas. The only thing that prevented this film from being a total laugh was that they didn't just stick their fingers in the sockets to "die". This movie would have been a great TRE STOOGES comedy film.
