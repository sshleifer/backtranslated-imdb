Now this is a film that I don't really like. It's one of the most boring horror movies of the 90s mainly because it starts slowly and focuses on a boring atmosphere. The settings are not even attractive to the eyes and do not serve the purpose of the film. <br /> <br /> The puppets seem really cheap, not as good as in the Puppet Master 80 films. What have they done to our favorite toys ?! <br /> <br /> The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER explains the sinister origins of the puppets. There are no death scenes like the previous films and the f / x is terrible. <br /> <br /> I fell asleep the first time I saw it, so I can recommend it for the sleepless.
