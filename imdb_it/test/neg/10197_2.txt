Defining this film as "Sunday School" could be generous, because, even as a Christian, I found the religious message so one-dimensional that I would not like to see it in my church. The message is: "Read your Bible, go to church and sign up for fire insurance so you won't fall behind in the kidnapping." There was no love. I guess when you get there, I don't believe in the god portrayed in this movie. The boy who should have had all the spiritual answers came across as Count Dracula. <br /> <br /> In addition to the spiritual / religious element, the script was boring - saying the same thing over and over again. This may have been to compensate for part of the acting, which was not able to provide a convincing line the first time, so they simply said the same thing over and over again. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the final scenes. I thought it was a point without hitting someone in the head or bowing to a Sunday School formula. The film was not bad at all, only most of it. <br /> <br /> I am in favor of cleaner and better made films and the truth present in a non-preaching way. This was not one of those, I'm sorry to say. I brought my family in this film, wanting to support this type of film. Now I'd like to get my money back.
