I agree that this film is too pretentious and it is not easy to know where it is going. I have been teaching literature and film for many years, and I find this film to be one of the most overrated, according to some of the previous reviews here. <br /> <br /> However, I remind you that this is the same director who has the religion time to his credit - a jewel of a movie! <br /> <br /> Were you trying to overcome the 81/2 of Fellini here ???? The scene with the dogs, which has also been reported, is absurd and excessive ?? just one example Others would require too much space and some reviewers have already noticed them. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very frustrating and annoying experience!
