Being a fan of the ZaSu Pitts comedies, I thought this was worth trying. I was pretty disappointed. <br /> <br /> (The version I saw was on TCM, but consisted only of the Niagara Falls movie, the movie Miss Polly was absent.) The talents of the actors, who give good performances, are wasted on one of the most stupid stories I've ever had the misfortune to sit on. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown (Tom Wilson) surprised me by being the strongest actor on the show, but the spotlight is pushed by Slim Summerville (Sam Sawyer), who, if he has any talent, has not demonstrated here. <br /> <br /> ZaSu Pitts (Elly Sawyer) is fantastic, but doesn't have a big enough part. The biggest laugh in the movie is when he ends up under Sam under a table. <br /> <br /> The only movie in the film that makes any sense is Tom Wilson. Margie (Marjorie Woodworth) is not reasonable in general. While he is physically very attractive, his personality and attitudes make him completely undesirable. Elly, Sam and the hotel receptionist are just crazy. <br /> <br /> Sam and Elly leave their honeymoon suite at the busy Tom and Margie hotel. But then they pick it up again. Sam ends up imprisoning Tom and Margie in their room. Most of the film is trying to burst, but Sam, always using a rifle, puts them back. <br /> <br /> Towards the end comes the worst part. Tom, who is finally about to repair his escape, runs into a minister on the lower floor of the hotel. Now the boy, who, as I said, is the only one in the whole film that has his head on his shoulders, suddenly, for no reason, decides to marry Margie! <br /> <br /> Drag the minister into the room he just escaped from, but Margie doesn't want to marry him. He kisses her and now, after a kiss, he feels compelled to marry him. <br /> <br /> Finally, Sam has the courage to tell Tom, "You tricked me," when practically the only line Tom had before Sam was, "We're not married," to which Sam replied, "You think what will I believe? " <br /> <br /> Idiotic.
