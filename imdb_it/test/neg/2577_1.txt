Get a good portion of Steven Seagal's environmental anxieties and some stunning mountain views with cowboy scenes (or alternatively use parts of any HORSE WHISPERER residue). Then add a large piece of OUTBREAK virus or similar (attention must be more lethal and at least Biohazard Level 4) wrapped around a fat leader of the Militia group. Add a teaspoon of martial arts and a zip of explosions and shots for taste. Add the classic red Indian herbs for extra taste. Serve immediately. <br /> <br /> What is the name of the movie you get ?: The Patriot. Perhaps the worst Steven Seagal film. I'm sure Seagal tried to say something in this film, except the usual I-am-a-cook (but-also-an-ex-seal), but his recipe was confusing and the taste was horrible.
