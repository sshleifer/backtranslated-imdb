This entry does not contain a spoiler. It is not necessary. The film is as predictable as the dawn. The element in the first Alien films was the suspense that something could happen. This was so in the first two Predator films, although less common. Requiem has completely removed the suspense element and replaced it with blood and blood. You know people will die (well, it's an AvsP movie), but you know that the WHO is going to die and WHEN they're going to die, AND WHERE they're going to die before it happens. The directors should take a lesson from Hitchcock who said: "The suspense is not a time bomb that explodes under a table: the suspense is a bomb NOT going out under the table". What's the point of going to the movies when you know exactly what's going to happen and when? If you really, really want to see this movie, wait until it comes out on video and then rents, but I would never buy it.
