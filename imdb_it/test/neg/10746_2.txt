I couldn't wait to give Dante's contribution to this excellent series of Showtime horror anthologies, but this was undoubtedly the worst in the group. It's really too bad. Part of this may be due to the scarce, albeit strange, choice of starting materials. Because Joe has not only written an original, I have no idea. Instead, we get this soapbox episode in which the "message" overwhelms the script, the characters, the staging, everything, and in the end I was wondering if it could be worse, and I don't want to ruin everything ... but ended up getting worse. That stink of a talented creative team. Skip this and buy John Carpenter's. He manages to balance all the elements: horror, humor, character, vision and it's fun. Coming home is as much fun as having a bear who dumps you while you sleep.
