Well, how to make a film as provocative as possible? This bewildering cartoon tries to have two low-life Parisian women (a prostitute, a recently raped ex-porn actress, no less) who hurl and go wild in a national campaign of murder and murder of men in particular. <br /> <br /> The very short execution time gives you a touch of the experimental nature of this violently hardcore "Thelma & Louise" - but it is done completely without irony or contemplation for any feminist message possible ... And from the moment that we don't wear to be very close to the protagonists, violence actually feels muted and insensitive - and maybe it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> As a liberal defender of freedom of expression, I am always happy when the "serious" film industry dares to include complete sex scenes. But the question is: does it work for the film as a whole? All right? Not much here, even if we give a new meaning to the phrase "a shot in the ass"! <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 from Ozjeppe
