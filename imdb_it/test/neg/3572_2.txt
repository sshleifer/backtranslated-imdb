I find it difficult to understand what makes the viewer opinion this is a powerful film. I imagine that the main intent of this film is the study of the character and the effects of racism in a British community. It is therefore all the more disappointing that all the characters are two-dimensional and that acting is at the level of a college performing arts course. I'm always skeptical of "improvisation", another word for being too lazy to write a decent script. I was embarrassed by the performances and sat in an audience that laughed when surely they should have been moved by the story. Racism is a serious problem, but I think that a subtle approach in the cinema works much better than setting it aside with a trowel.
