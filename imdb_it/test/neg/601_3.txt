When A Killer Calls must be the biggest repudiation released by Asylum so far. This is a sexy babysitter on duty who receives ghostly calls from a disturbing voice who repeatedly asks her: "Did you check the girl?" Of course he has the calls drawn by the policemen (after performing some realistically unnecessary tasks - hang up when "he" calls, waits ten seconds and calls * 57). Does it sound familiar? Yes, that's why I rented it. <br /> <br /> Well, it should. And I hate to say it, but this could have been more fun than the big screen crapfest that was released at the same time, except for a fatal mistake. Rather than enjoying the glory of the B-movie, he tried to do something original. He tried to make the main character nice, rather than having a cliché, campy fun with her. Mind you, this may have worked with a talented actress. But she wasn't. Sure, he looked good, and she screamed, and cried, but. . . oh well, whatever. <br /> <br /> Then came the horrible ending. It's not horrible as it was terrifying, horrible in that it was STILL. The pace up until then (about an hour) was campy, cliché and fun. Then he heads in another direction, and walks away from another stupid, funny slasher movie with a sexy "teenager" cast in a hostel bourgeois guru. <br /> <br /> I think this falls into "Oh well, whatever the" category. The leading actress skidded a line? Oh well, whatever, I don't want to take it back. We forgot to give killer motivation? Oh well, whatever, I don't want to rewrite it. Does pacing change completely in half? Oh well, whatever, I don't feel like shaving a quarter of an hour. Continuity errors? Oh well, whatever. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of movie (stupid, lousy, predictable, splatter campy movie with sexy cast), then you'll be fine until the end. The ending is stupid, it's not funny, it's not scary, it's not campy or cheese or fast-paced rhythms In fact, there were almost exactly five minutes in which the character did nothing but be tied up (and this is not a spoiler because it is on the back of the DVD) and looked around the stuff in the room , then screaming, and ... whatever.
