... and in this series, I was reduced to an annoying athlete with a gay haircut. Do you remember my friend Marco, who got all the good jokes in the books? Well, in this series his one-liners put Mr. Freeze to shame. Remember our uber-evil nemesis Visser Three? He's a bald guy with unheard-of phrases. Remember Rachel, "Xena, the warrior princess" and Cassie, my sensitive and caring love interest? They were turned into mindless bimbos by the 10 (!) Writers who decided that the original characters weren't interesting enough for TV. Do you remember the incredible extraterrestrial ax, which was nice, smart and really adorable, cinnamon rolls? In this series is the Alien Token with an extremely annoying voice. Do you remember the jokes that our team had in books? In this series our dialogue is so depressing and stupid it is obvious that the writers were following the lowest common denominator. <br /> <br /> So forget everything you thought you knew about Animorphs! It was Cassie who became allergic to morphing, not Rachel, thought-thinking * supposed * echoing, and Visser Three and Ax, rarely, if ever, appeared to be Andalusian (no, it has nothing to do with the budget! ). <br /> <br /> I'm not crazy. And I'm not lying. The idiots surround us. And if you're unlucky, one of them could adapt one of your favorite books, or series or graphic novels, to a really horrible TV show. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> "Finally ... television deserves to be seen." ~ (very bald) Visser Three <br /> <br /> (r # 91)
