This for one has nothing to do with the absolutely fantastic first shot. And of course we Americans have to redo all the success in English, because the man who reads the subtitles is SOOOOO Hard not so! From what I've seen in the new trailers with the lovely pregnant Jessica Alba (well, that definitely ruins wherever every teenage guy doesn't!) Looks EXACTLY the same but probably double the budget. I thought the original was one of the best horror / suspense / mystery films I've seen in any language for a while now. I would recommend looking at it and jumping all together together, there's no reason to see it because there's no reason why even "The Eye 2" was no exception to exploit the excellence that was the first movie. Do yourself a favor, look at "The Eye" with the volume up and get ready for a possible jump. I looked at it with headphones and was pleasantly surprised by the excellence that was the direction of the Pang brothers. If the remake of "The Eye" is fine, I hope he does it for Pang Brothers movies, but at the same time it seems a pity that people don't see / can't see the original, because very often / almost always remake it's not as good as the original. Look at this if one wants to be a little bit boring, but the original is not comparable to this sequel named only film.
