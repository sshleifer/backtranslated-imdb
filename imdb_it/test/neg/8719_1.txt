If you've never read the classic science fiction novel on which this mini-series is based, it could be really good. Unfortunately, if you are a fan of the book, you probably won't be able to watch more than the first hour or two. All the political intrigues have been removed from the film, the most important scenes of the book have been extracted, the motivations of the characters have been completely changed and the words from the mouths of the wrong characters. Where in the novel Paul Atredies was a teenage boy with incredible political ability and a great understanding of how the world worked, in this film he is hot and frustrated. Avoid this movie at all costs.
