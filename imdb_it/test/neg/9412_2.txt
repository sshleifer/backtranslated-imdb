I went to this film determined to like it. I usually like dramas like Wall Street, Glen Gary Glen Ross, Boiler Room, etc. I went to this movie thinking I would be on the edge of my seat. Plus, I'm a big Pacino fan. <br /> <br /> What a piece of garbage. Most likely the worst movie I've seen in five years. This makes the Pacino debacle in Any Given Sunday actually look good. First, half of the movie is watching Matthew McConaughey lift weights. OK, we understand. You are in shape Matt. We don't need to see every other scene with you pumping iron without a shirt. <br /> <br /> Secondly, how many plot holes are there in this movie? Why introduce the phone call from Brandon's missing father and never address it again? What was the point of his mother scratching him - why did he call to say he was sending her too much money - what was the point? The Puerto Rico boy who lost 30 million? Furthermore, since sports bets are illegal in New York, and acknowledged that it is illegal, how can they possibly guarantee everyone's bet in the end? <br /> <br /> This was simply a poorly written script. It had potential, but it lacked a coherent plot. I thought that Pacino had learned the lesson on screenplay selection after Any Given Sunday, but apparently not. My Gosh, this is the same actor who played in the Godfather! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money.
