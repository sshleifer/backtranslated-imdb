If you find the depiction of violent murders and brutal police brutality expressed in a plot less filmed with glacial entertainment, then you are destined to have fun with Surveillance. This film was rubbish for both mind and spirit. The idea that this is a "thriller" is comic; this would imply a kind of tension and twists. You kept waiting for the story to really end "starting". It never rises above a glorification of violent criminals with weak minds and individuals from all walks of life. Imagine all the violence of "No Country for Old Men" without any kind of pursuit or sympathetic characters. The killers of the blow go wild. The acting is good, above all, but the script is a flashlight. Don't disturb yourself and tell your friends not to disturb you.
