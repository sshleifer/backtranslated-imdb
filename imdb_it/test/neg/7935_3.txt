OK, here's the deal. I love action movies and generally have no problem with suspending a great deal of disbelief on the holes in the plot or on other implausible actions. However, this film went far beyond small flaws and went straight to ridicule. Let me get it right. The police send a notorious gangster and a killer cop (along with a number of other prisoners) on a bus with a total of two guards. So they are forced to stop in an area where exactly two policemen work, one of whom is a day away from retirement and the other is an exhaustion. Apparently the building was going to be closed, so somehow the police decided that everyone else in the whole district would wake up on New Year's Eve. Right. But wait, get better. Gabriel Byrne shows up to capture Fishburne before he can hit him and other dirty cops. (although we never find out anything about their relationship or their relationships). It is interesting to note that the policemen who launch the assault on the district are in full SWAT equipment with night visors, assault rifles, all nine meters. Later they even bring a helicopter with OTHER people in gear. I'm not a cop, but I'm pretty sure you can't leave the station with a whole plectrum of equipment without someone asking you what you're doing. And the police helicopter ??? In the supposedly terrible winter storm ??? Also, does anyone close to the fence hear or see this great siege underway with flashing grenades and heavy rifle shots going off? I mean seriously, come on. I know this is set in Detroit, but even there it would raise suspicions about an apparently top secret mission. I also like the fact that they find a Tommy Gun in the rehearsal room and somehow the gun still works and has bullets that are still intact and usable. <br /> <br /> I could live with some of these problems if there were no other obvious problems. For one, the first few minutes of opening the film turned nicely in a very frenetic and hyperactive way and I thought it would set the tone for the rest of the film. Unfortunately I was wrong. The rest of the film has no sense of rhythm or tension or drama. The "characters" are in no way related to each other, which probably depends largely on the fact that they are not particularly interesting. There is not enough interesting action to make this action movie good, and there is not enough character / storytelling development to make this a passable thriller / drama. The "relationship" between Hawke / Fishburn is the only thing the director tries to make interesting or intense. Oh, by the way, the final scene in the wilderness? Uh, I thought this was in the middle of an abandoned industrial area of ​​Detroit and suddenly we're in the woods ?? Acting is not terrible in this film, it's just that the direction and writing are atrocious. I really like some Hawkes, Fishburne, Byrne, Dennehy movies, but this is terrible.
