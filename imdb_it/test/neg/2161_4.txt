In the early 90s "Step-by-Step" came as a boring combination of "Full House" and "The Brady Bunch". The differences between "Step-by-Step" and the two shows mentioned above were obviously better, an excellent comic timing of almost all the actors, and much more enjoyable situations that were not as sugar-coated as extremely popular predecessors. I admit that, despite the big increases in the basic dynamics of the show and everything that wasn't exactly spectacular yet, it wasn't even that memorable in the long series of banal family programming! It was just a much better pastime, one might say, compared to the "Full House" lull which, coincidentally, went upside down with "step by step" during that time period in terms of general popularity. The show, now in syndication, of course, is definitely suitable for the family, but make sure you don't expect much more than that when you look at it.
