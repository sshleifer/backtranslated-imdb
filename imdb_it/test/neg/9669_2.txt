An ugly bad movie ... terrible plot, it depends on the character of Bolo Yeung, but he speaks maybe 20 words in the whole film and has only one fight scene - still in great shape considering he was also in the kung fu classic "Enter The Dragon "Interesting to see William Zabka (" Johnny "of The Karate Kid) in another role of martial arts.
