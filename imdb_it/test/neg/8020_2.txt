This is a weak set of almost everything: refugees, Croatia-Slovenia relations, globalization, sexual orientation. A very large, clumsy metaphor about Slovenia that is at the crossroads of its past, which is symbolized by everything that becomes queen-virgin of the family, and its future, which is symbolized by listening to music in clubs and being lesbian and never having children. <br /> <br /> Play on a rather recent Slovenian legend involving a virgin and a "forest" king "taking the form of a goat (even the images of Zlatorog Beer are based on that legend), but unfortunately the treatment it is very inconsistent: Weiss seems to think that the end justifies the means: he can use all kinds of "dreamlike" sequences, then choose and choose which ones are real and which are imaginary. be real for all three girls, but the scene outside the tent is real only in Simona's imagination? The ending continues to drag on and on (I can't believe that the film's running time is only 98 minutes, I'm looking at a director's cut without knowing it?), with the three girls who have to look at the camera for about 10 seconds while looking frightened and happy at the same time (so obvious.) I never thought I'd be able to recognize bad acting in a film whose language I don't understand, but it didn't take long to see it "Simona" is most of the time, as if it were acting in a silent film. <br /> <br /> It was not as bad as I kept thinking that the director was just starting and wanted to capture what she thought. Her generation was about film making a semi-experimental film, until I realized that the director was 37 when he made the film and his work is probably "serious".
