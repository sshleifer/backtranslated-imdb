Very boring show. What's worse, it's very racist. White boys are stupid idiots and the only love story is between a black boy and a white woman. There is nothing interesting about this love story, it's not exciting, it's not funny, it doesn't even seem to interest each other, it's more like writers and directors wanting an interracial thing going on. Why is this so popular in the media today? It's a social programming and it won't lead to anything good, there's always tension when too many people want the same thing. This show is not worth the $ 20 for the season, it's a waste of time and harmful to society. At least when they use TV programs to sell the products they are more discreet, selling any agenda here is fairly obvious, and without clear ideas some may feel wrong in their opposition, but some of us know it better.
