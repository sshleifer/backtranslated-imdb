This is another alien and not very good imitation. Replace the outer space with the South African desert, use the same ingredients, a group of people stuck in an inhospitable landscape, hunt down an alien creature and you have the same old story of a very common movie that tries to mimic an classic movie. A group of miners and scientists are hunting down some missing colleagues and finding their bones in the desert stripped of meat. Their vehicle breaks and they head towards civilization while being chased by the monster. The African location is pretty nice, but basically this whole movie worked. There is a vain attempt to increase the tension, but I discovered that this did not work and made the film rather boring. The creature didn't appear much and when he did it didn't really set a horror feeling. a scene in which someone tore the flesh from his arm but was basically on the front of the blood. In conclusion, I found this film as exciting as looking at dry paint. I give this movie 4/10 and this is only for the interesting position that alone is not enough to save this film from being a total snooze-fest
