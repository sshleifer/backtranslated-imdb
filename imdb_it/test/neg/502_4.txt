The movie, Heaven's Gate, was a good vision, although still boring at over 4 hours. But the film has taken a big license - as usual with Hollywood. James Averill (Chris Christopherson) and "Elle" were actually married in real life. Their main contribution to the Johnson County war was to start with being hanged. Well, starting with, I mean that it came at the beginning, not the end. Here is the real scenario: James Averill and Ellen Watson were secretly married because a family could be given to every family. By presenting them as individuals, they could obtain two country houses. They chose homes on Crazy Woman Creek by controlling the water above the land held by a powerful member of the Cattleman Association. He offered to buy them repeatedly, which they refused. <br /> <br /> Although characterized in real life as a brothel owner (Cattle Kate), and a prostitute herself (and also in the film), there is no real evidence that it was true. It is known that he bought a lot of sick cattle, he brought them back to life and later he was accused by the Cattle Association of receiving the cattle on the market for "obscene acts". In the end, she was accused of fruscum - an almost certainly false act, so much for this part of the myth of the "American West", which is a gooble-de-gook of myths that spans a period of time of some hundred years. <br /> <br /> In real life, she and Jim Averill were one day surprised by several members of the Cattleman Association, taken in hand and promptly hanged. Those who perpetrated injustice were never brought to trial, but that was the first connection that led to the murder of Champion Nate, and the beginning of the war in Johnson County. <br /> <br /> Very different from the Hollywood version that shows its shot at the end. <br /> <br /> On top of that, I think the main problem with the movie was the editor, which could have made the action faster with more skilful editing.
