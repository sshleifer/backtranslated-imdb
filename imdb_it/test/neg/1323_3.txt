The war in the East, as the Germans referred to the Soviet Nazi conflict of World War II, was a war of annihilation by Germany. 90% of the German army was fighting with the Soviet Union. Their ultimate aim was to wipe out the so-called Russian population "sub human (Untermensch)" and colonize the predominantly empty country with German settlers after winning. <br /> <br /> Read "Hitler's Willing Executioners." <Br /> <br /> Here we have the German army presented as innocent victims and not as Nazi mass murderers. When will modern German filmmakers be honest and face the past? <br /> <br /> Better to see the Russian film "Come and See" instead!
