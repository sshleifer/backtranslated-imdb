I saw this DVD for sale and bought it without thinking twice, even though I didn't even know it was out because this is one of my favorite books of all time. As soon as I returned home I ran to watch him only to find myself disappointed. Although it is true that this film is somehow based on the book, the similarities end there. The characters have changed (for example, Finny looks more like a pompous asshole than anything else, while Gene seems to be a bit hilly), the scenes are misplaced or completely changed (for example Lepper), many characters are missing and there are no famous lines / thoughts. The film tries to describe a feeling that the previous one lacked, but it is done in a lackluster way that makes it a flat and boring movie. It is the depth of the character and the feeling that makes the book so classic and this film takes those things and destroys them completely in its rewriting.
