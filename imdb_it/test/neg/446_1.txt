A painful and useless sequel to a classic in good faith. An American werewolf in London was, unquestionably, a jewel of a film: humorous, demented, with a hint of romance and so very, very British that made me want to get up and sing God Save the Queen every time the film ended . Then came this abomination. You know you're in real trouble when the contacts are so utterly unlikely that you rejoice when they are massacred and actually start cheering for the werewolves. Truth be told, folks, I only had about half of this CGI disguise before I lost the will to live and shut it down. Absolutely pitiful and a putrid waste of anyone's time.
