Almost certainly staged the editing of women who read the lines (very briefly) and undress (not very briefly) in front of an anonymous panel (and uncredited) - almost certainly including the producer Charles Band. The random scenes of many Surrender Cinema films (mainly lesbian scenes) are castrated. Most women love "riding" (Hmmm); there is a Polish woman who seems to have no interest in acting even though she goes to an audition; a secret; camera that films the actresses who undress behind the screen ... Jacqueline Lovell (too makeup but still beautiful) presents a couple of scenes and speeches of her film in a "sexy" way to the camera (if you like lesbian scenes it is including the one with Lovell and Vanesa Taylor from Femalian and probably the most beautiful lesbian couple ever.) A strange excuse for a film and, apart from the obvious design of naked women, a frankly boring and uninteresting experience.
