This movie is fun if you are the gentleman who was sitting in three rows behind me (repeating every line, laughing when there were no gags on the screen, and emitting a haaaa grin in every scene involving a computer or mobile device) ) <br /> <br /> For all the others, it is a petty and messy "comedy". The film strictly follows the formula of the subsequent "Scary Movie" films, as well as "Epic Movie" and "Meet the Spartans", even if without the deluge of heartless pop culture references that made the last two so irritating. Yet the satire of intellectual and pacifist figures around the world makes it clear that the film knows its audience: people who envy the brain. "Superhero Movie" is particularly and decidedly bad with Stephen Hawking, introducing him as a sex-hungry drug addict and using his disability as a vehicle for slapstick. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on "Spider-Man", with "Batman Begins" and "X-Men" launched only to offer a physical comedy. Much of the film is slapstick, but not in any way invigorating or interesting. The longest gag is a fart joke, and in the beginning the writers seem to believe that the fact that the main character is thrown into showy piles of fake animal poop automatically revives another non-trivial rehash of the Spider-Man bite scene ". Perhaps the only saving feature of this characteristic is the energy contained in it, particularly absent in other recent parodies. Filmmakers act like they're doing something new, and audiences can feel the influence in the way the actors bounce off the screen. An extremely short length (about an hour and fifteen minutes) and the joy of the presentation make the film "Superhero Movie" tolerable rather than terrifying.
