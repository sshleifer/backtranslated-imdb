"No one really knows how power was born. Not even the Book of Damnation recorded its beginning, but those who dominated it have always been driven out. The families of Ipswich have formed an Alliance of Silence? "After this intro, we suddenly see Take That. Or was it N'Synch? The Backstreet Boys, maybe? Well, I don't know which of these they belong to, but one thing is certain: Salem's descendants are a boy-band. Can you tell them apart? I could not. If you can tell me which one it is, I would appreciate it very much. These boy-band guys look so damned the same ?! Seriously now Is it a horror movie or a movie for teen-boppers? It is sad that the horror genre (however weak) has been kidnapped by adolescents. And this is one of the youngest I've seen so far. The film is visually solid, but the cast is so bland, the acting so terrible that it was a process that finished the film. As bad as the cast was (after all, boy-bands and models are rarely good actors) the absolute "prominent" in this regard was the guy who played the villain, Sebastian Stan. This guy's overacting is right there with the worst in the film's history. I have rarely seen anyone make such annoying and foolish faces in such a short time. What's worse, he has the most childish face of all the girlish faces in the whole cast. I mean, it's a joke.
