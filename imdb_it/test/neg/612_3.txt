I was a carpenters fan for a long time, I read the biography, saw the special offers and saw Karen Carpenter Story. This movie really didn't show the real Karen Carpenter. In the film she seems to be a shy and rather lonely girl (except for a girl). The real Karen Carpenter was very different. He was outgoing and friendly. He had many friends, especially Olive Newton-John. The film does not even show Karen's attempts at a solo album and her encounter with Phil Ramone and his wife Itchy "Karen". Itchy knew the real Karen Carpenter in New York. When Karen was in New York, she saw a psychologist, but he was a volunteer once a day and then he left to go to his hotel room. Also, Karen was taking thyroid enhancement pills so she could lose weight but stop taking them because the psychologist didn't recommend them too much. Also, Karen's husband in the film is called Bob Knight, but in real life he was called Tom Burris. Moreover, Karen was not divorced from Tom, but only separated. Karen had to sign the divorce papers on the day of her death. In addition, Agnes found Karen naked in the closeness of the wardrobe, unlike the movie in which she was dressed in white. The music was very good. This was the only thing I would recommend seeing.
