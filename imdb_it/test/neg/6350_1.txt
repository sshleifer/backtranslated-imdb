If you want to see an example of how not to make a movie, then you have to watch this. I, myself, without film experience, could do better. The script is laughable with a weak plot and there is no effort to be seen for any intelligent structure. To remedy this defect, you would think that the action would be decent, right? <br /> <br /> Since the acting, editing and overall editing of the film are terrifying, the only thing that saves is the terrible performance of the protagonist. The reason why it is saving grace, is because it is so genuinely bad in acting, that it should win an Oscar for it. At least a little recognition for making me laugh so much. <br /> <br /> Throw the body of a dead woman after a male has shot out (where does it come from?), pull the semi-automatic trigger dozens of times while the sound engineer pulls out two gun effects, reflected of the television crew in the Kool Mo Dee tones, a single ONE musical track for the WHOLE film, a non-original screenplay that has no logic; it's a perfect recipe for a really, really bad movie. In reality it is more fun to identify the errors than to actually try to find something positive. Avoid at all costs.
