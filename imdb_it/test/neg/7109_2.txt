Being a fan of Marlene Dietrich's films, I was very anxious to see this "documentary". I was also sucked by reading rave reviews after a rave review by the national critics. This should have given me a tip. <br /> <br /> The film is simply boring and obviously extremely overrated. You don't even see Dietrich. He is heard in the background, discussing his films and this video. He does almost nothing but complains about everything. What a bore! <br /> <br /> The director, Massimiliano Schell, constantly complains and begs to be on the camera ..... all uselessly. Continue to refuse to cooperate. After a while, this kind of thing gets really tiring. With his attitude, why does Schell continue with this project? He should have told the first woman to "slip it on". <br /> <br /> Regardless of what you read, don't waste time with this.
