I saw this film when it was released for the first time in the cinema. We were looking forward to seeing Mark Hamill re-launch his career, but we came out wishing we hadn't worried. Many people went out after about half an hour - I wish I had it too. The basic premise seems okay, but the plot has been ridiculously involved and tortuous, and ends in half. It's completely immemorial, and not a movie you want to get paid to see. If you are really bored and on TV, it will help you kill a couple of hours (or it will help you nod!). 2/10
