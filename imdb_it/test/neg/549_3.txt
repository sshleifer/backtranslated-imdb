I was happy to discover that TCM was showing this, as I love the 1992 version with Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Joan Plowright ... This film had a bright Ann Harding, a wonderful performance by Frank Morgan, but the acting of others made the film more of a farce then the wonderful unfolding of the next film. Reginald Owen's Arbuthnot is painful to watch and you can't understand why his wife loves him. I discovered after seeing the film that was based on the theatrical game in which the 1992 film is based on the book. Even the original film looked like a fragment of a larger piece and seemed incomplete. Too bad it was disappointing.
