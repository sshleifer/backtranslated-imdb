... but I'd be lying. A relative was a member of the crew, and we had to go and see the production of this film for a couple of days (and I was an extra). I have to die and have a second of screen time, not that I'm going to move to Hollywood anytime soon. I just thought it was great to see how movies are made and be part of them. Also, I received a copy of the film once it was finally released. They had no studio support when they made this film, so it was really independent. Because writing and acting are so horrible it's beyond me, but the main character "Cherry" is the director's sister, so she could be part of it. But the photograph was good. :)
