A satire on greed and money, what? There is more greed in the intentions behind this fiasco than in any of the themes that pathetically seek to make fun of. The reign of Jim Carrey was certainly short lived. It is an unbearable presence on the screen. The insincerity of his interpretation is disturbing to say the least. He produced this, this "masterpiece", so he can't blame anyone here. "The number one comedy in America", shouts of desperate TV addicts. Of course, Jim Carrey had to guarantee full houses, but the game is over. If I look angry it's because I am. I spent a sunny afternoon in California, plus, with tickets, parking, flat Cokes etc., almost $ 45 for this thing, played and produced by Mr. Carry. Not anymore, did you hear? Not anymore.
