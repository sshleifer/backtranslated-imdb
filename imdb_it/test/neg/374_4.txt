Although the story is good and portraits, what I expected from Sam Elliot in my DVD copy contained almost unbearable synchronization problems. The dialogue was almost 3 seconds behind the movement of the lips throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I would therefore be very careful when buying any DVD of the film without checking the problem. <br /> <br /> I will also follow the rankings of the recommended censors, particularly in relation to the use of language and drugs. <br /> <br /> This film could become a silent classic policeman and with the cautionary notes above I can recommend it to potential spectators
