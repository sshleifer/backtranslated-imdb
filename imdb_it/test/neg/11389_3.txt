***** Spoiler or two, it's not important ****** <br /> <br /> Two things stand out on this film. The first is that it was titled both "Bruno" and "The Dress Code", and if you've seen this film, you take the irony. <br /> <br /> Secondly it is about dealing with issues completely off the wall. The adventures of an elementary school cross dresser are not something to worry about for a film, nor a topic that I think most people would be interested in. Shirley MacLaine manages to walk around gender issues by tying Bruno's desire to wear a dress to religion, which probably opens up an even more thorny box of worms - what were you thinking? <br /> <br /> Yes, there is a bit of humor and it is not directly offensive, but the kind of disturbing feeling at the beginning continues to grow. It doesn't do much if not to repeat the liberal mantra that "different" people should be accepted (or perhaps excluded?) Regardless of what. <br /> <br /> Which is fine ---- but to make people live in a society everyone has to give a little to get along. Bruno doesn't just want to wear a dress, he wants to present himself as a miniature Gladys Knight for the night of the awards, and his final costume makes him look like a Cowgirl Cabbage Patch doll. Yet all the other children dress and behave well, like normal children. So what does it give? If it comes to us, we could declare ourselves special or different and behave in any way we feel, and the result would be total chaos. <br /> <br /> Even the acceptance of "different" people is defined fairly narrowly, I doubt we will ever see a film about a child who finds his true self and wants to wear overalls, hunt geese and go to tractor pulls and asks everyone else to accept it as is. "Bruno" is a stupid movie and a complete waste of time.
