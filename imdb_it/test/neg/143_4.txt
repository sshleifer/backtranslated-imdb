I saw this film on VHS some time ago (January 27th 2003), only for the name of Paul Rudd on the cover. I really liked his performance in "The Object of My Affection" and I really expected a good job. However, I found this film a complete disaster. The plot has a very confusing script and the characters are not well developed. Also, low-budget special effects don't help much. I don't know the previous generation of Gen-Y cops, but this next generation is not good. I don't remember exactly why I gave this vote (and I don't intend to see this movie again), but my vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): `Gen-Y Cops In Nova Geração '(' Gen-Y Cops The Next Generation ')
