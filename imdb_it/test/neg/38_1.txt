I came here just to check out Terror Hospital for an alternative title, so I know what not to collect. Not only do I get the original title, but I come to find that the Terror Hospital is one of the seven more aliases. This is a real clunker. Movies like this can usually be forgiven for any number of reasons, mostly unintended consequences of the function on every level of production that result in at least a mild form of entertainment, mainly fun. This has none of this. Instead, the viewer is witness to an unnecessary redundant performance and too convenient for the situation and traces scenes of characters moving cautiously from one room to another, and all this is half of the film. Forget about trying to figure out where they are (or who they are) anyone during dark or night scenes; you probably won't care, though. There's also a sequence of random car chases that looks pretty boring compared to some of the old driving movies I've shot ... er, I mean, they've gone through and watched in high school. Really, we are talking about mysticism, possession and murderer in freedom - not a bad recipe for junk cinema. Unfortunately, there is nothing here to make it even "good" garbage; when they join the aforementioned, the effects of bad acting and not so special are just that: bad and not so special effects. This is just trash, pure and simple. Leave it on the grill at the pawn shop or in that box at the sales area. There is a reason it is there ...
