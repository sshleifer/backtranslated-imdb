I was really ready to watch when two of the best film critics labeled this film as "laughter". But the film was disappointing. <br /> <br /> You will be advised to watch this movie by keeping your brain at home, but you cannot simply ignore the flaws and shortcomings. <br /> <br /> 1. The missile scene was utter stupidity. <br /> <br /> 2. The pair of Katrina Kaif and Govinda looked horrible. (49 years old and only 24 years old ... more than twice his age) 3. Salman's comedy is less acting and more exaggerated. <br /> <br /> 4. The songs are good but break the rhythm of the film. <br /> <br /> 5. Some scenes were deliberately attempted by the film's creators to be funny, and 6. Poor and imperfect history. <br /> <br /> However, there are some advantages: 1. Govinda. Great individual performance. <br /> <br /> 2. Some scenes are actually quite funny. <br /> <br /> 3. Kattrina Kaif. Look and Acting continues to improve with each film. <br /> <br /> 4. Sequences of Don by Rajpal Yadav. Even if underutilized but exhilarating. <br /> <br /> So 4 good points, 6 bad .. this becomes 4/10.
