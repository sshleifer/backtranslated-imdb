Pretty bad price for the PRC that I rarely bother to review, and it's no wonder: it's slow, creaky and boring like a butter knife. The crazy doctor George Zucco is there again, turning a farmer in overalls (Glenn Strange) into a wolf man. Unfortunately, the trick is practically non-existent, mostly composed only of a beard and a moat of fangs. If it weren't for the presence of Zucco and Strange, along with the nice Anne Nagel, this would be absolutely unwatchable. Strange, who would go on to play Frankenstein's monster for Unuiversal in two years, makes a Lenny impression of "Of Mice and Men", it seems. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (of Four)
