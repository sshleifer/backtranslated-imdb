In a career up and down with all kinds of movies, this is Altman's only attempt at science fiction, and it clearly shows that it's not his forte. <br /> <br /> The film is practically incomprehensible. It looks like a disastrous combination of experimental theatrical pretentiousness and an important study that tries to jump on the after-Star Wars bandwagon (not that this film is not modeled after that, but you can imagine that the studio has signed with the hope of a different film science fiction by Paul Newman). The story is non-existent, the characters remain strangers to the end. <br /> <br /> Altman has packs of dogs that feed on corpses throughout the film, obviously striving to create a sort of POINT. But since the film is so ill-conceived, starting from the lack of plot, it is absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> The planned production is confusing, the photograph is canceled by the blurring at the edges and the score is terrible. However, "Quintet" has a ransom function. Not only is the film clearly filmed in snow and ice, but the interiors are also kept cold. See the breath of the actors in every scene. FEEL the cold.
