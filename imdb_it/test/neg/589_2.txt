I will never go back to the three hours of life that this film stole from me. <br /> <br /> The film is basically a psychedelic journey disguised as an important creative process. I'd like to know what they were when this film was made. <br /> <br /> It is also the most historically inaccurate film in existence; 2001 arrived and left without any of the events or forecasts taking place. <br /> <br /> The characters are unlikely, the design is simplistic and everything works without any sense or logic. <br /> <br /> And the ending is probably the worst: it's supposed to be provocative, but the only thought that came to my mind is "What's going on F $ * K ?!" <br /> <br /> I would say that for all those who are looking for serious entertainment purposes, AVOID this movie at all costs and choose a science fiction movie that was NOT created by just $ $$.
