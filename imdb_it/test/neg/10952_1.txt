Wow, I was told that this would be a B movie that is worth watching. I feel I was deceived after seeing this preview event. The plot is a twisted version of several films at best. Even the title is a film about another film, if you can give the film a lot of credit. I'm sorry to say that I was taken to the cleaners. I wouldn't waste your time with this. This film seems to be a group of aspirants who got together and made a bad idea of ​​a movie in a weekend with a borrowed camera. Being in the entertainment world, I can judge a decent film and this deserves to be shelved or discarded. My advice, stick to a classic like the 1979 Dawn of the Dead. On a scale of 1 to 10 even 1 is nice for the producers because this movie BLOWS. (Under the limit of what sucks) Producers must stay with their day jobs. If you watch the movie, be honest in your posts, this seems to have been inflated and inflated by a few. There are some who have seen this for what it is and published correctly. Sorry, but I have to say it's one to jump.
