I can't remember the last time a movie was so boring that I went out. The Weatherman and The Island were both so bad that I thought about it, but I stayed at the bottom of those too. This film was incomprehensible, not funny and went on forever. Like other commentators, I wondered if the parts were just French humor that I didn't receive or if the characters were serious. In the end I gave up and tried to doze because I didn't want to disturb my husband if he was having fun, but he noticed and let me know that it was OK if I wanted to leave and we left the door. He would like to know how it ended ... if Denevue lived or died etc ... (I don't even care).
