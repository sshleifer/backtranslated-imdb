Milla stands out in this film for her personal sense of style and the way the clothes hang from her. I learned to hate that crumpled little three-year-old face he does every time he pretends to cry. It makes any point he is trying to make while a serious actress walks away quickly. Of course, in a film with Baldwin and Denise, he still shines like a mature person. David seemed to do Woody Allen with Howdy Doody. No single word or gesture in the whole film seemed sincere or even sincerely recited. "How Harry Met Sally" and "Two Weddings and Funeral", also "Sleepless In Seattle" had scripts, locations and ACTORS. The script seemed to be a string of bad and bad gags separated by a lot of SPEAKING. The positions seemed to be a few blocks from each other. There are only two actors in this disk of an independent film, Milla and the lady who played the girl who was in the stars. I watched most of this through the first time with the sound turned off, just looking at Milla. That gog in subscript was old the first time I saw it and it's a stupid rip-off of a song in "How to succeed in the business world without really trying".
