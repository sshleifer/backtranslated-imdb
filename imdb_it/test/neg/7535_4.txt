Very strange. But he wanted to be. This director is his man. Although there are strains if Polanski, Bergman and Kafka at least in episode n. 6, that of the voyeur. What made everything so strange, and which recalls the three artists mentioned above, is that it went everywhere, you never knew where it was headed, and it could have ended up anywhere, and in the end, when it ended, it could have continued. The ending is certainly not a goal, no one could tell you what these two characters could do even in the next frame. Another thing must be said to the director: it is not surprising that Kubrick found him fascinating. There is a lot of Eyes Wide Shut in this episode somehow, in the direct approach to the character, the realistic elements of fantasy of both. A Kubrick positioning of the camera without any of the net effects, much more faded, and hasty, not so agitated. Having said that, coming back to the beginning, this guy still has his things to say and tells her well. And yet, for some reason, there is not a single scene that I want to see again. But surely I didn't feel ripped off at least watching it once. But I still felt the sensation of three or four other ghost directors moving through the show, confusing everything. The caveat was that it was only episode six: the other nine could give me completely different sockets. But since this episode revolved around peeping, watching, the absolute dominion of the film, I will say this, it did not take any of the usual routes, it certainly went its way bringing with it the baggage of many good directors.
