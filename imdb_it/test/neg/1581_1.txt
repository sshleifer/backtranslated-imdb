Wings Hauser and his son, Cole Hauser come together to make a film about neo-Nazi thugs who target a gay man and terrorize a city. Wings plays the hero, and his real son is the villain. Low budget film that doesn't have many saving features, and for some reason, nobody saw it! Maybe because it's a pretty ridiculous and ridiculous movie, and the studio understood it! Perhaps Wings Hauser himself has prevented the distribution of "Skins" after seeing him alone! Maybe people didn't want to comment on such a bad movie! Oh good! Generally I like Wings and Cole as actors, but this was a movie that both of us should have skipped. Wings directed, wrote and was the main actor in "Skins"! An extremely bad and stupid movie! 1/2 on *****!
