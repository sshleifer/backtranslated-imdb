I remember reading that Darwin had a fundamental experience in the Galapagos Islands, seeing the wide range of animal life there, and intern, he wrote his theory of evolution. Not according to this film, it was inspired by the British campaign. OK, and as John Cleese-Giusto would say. I also didn't think that Darwin was a man who suffered from profound personal conflicts and someone who suffered from obscure daydreams and distress. According to this film it was. It is sad that apparently he lost one of his daughters due to illness, but I do not think that losing a member of his family had much influence on man's scientific abilities. Well, not second ... you have the photo. I think there is nothing worse than when science turns into a fairy tale, and to a certain extent this film comes out as an attempt to debunk evolutionary theory by saying that it comes from an emotionally unstable man, which to me is simply gross. I think that Charles Darwin was the soul of scientific investigation, cold and calm, and that he always thought logically. This film tries to dramatize the clear and unthinking scientific exploration. It's like a Canterbury tale. I would not recommend it.
