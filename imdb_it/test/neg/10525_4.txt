What I wouldn't do to give this film a rewrite. Extra disappointing for the great start, Solo Dios Sabe degenerates into a superstitious bull pie after half the way and ends with a note so ridiculous, dark and melodramatic that I couldn't believe I was watching the same movie I'd started with. The film has had numerous elements in its favor, such as the chemistry between Diego Luna and Alice Braga, so palpable that I thought that the screen would start to sparkle, a fantastic soundtrack and beautiful places. Instead of ending with the religious mumbo jumbo, the film should have kept the emphasis on being a frothy road movie with perhaps some undertone on fate and superstition against disseminated logic. I understand that the director's entire intent with the film was to make people talk about religion, but the fact is that it just didn't work, and he threw away so much from the beginning, doing so.
