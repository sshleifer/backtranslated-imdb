I was forced to read this sweetened "love story" between a 24-year-old German prisoner of war and a 12-year-old Jew. This has "political correctness" written everywhere. It's like the movie "SPIRIT" in which a horse wants to be free but those "bad" Americans won't leave it because they need it. Well, I have good news that the Americans are "bad" in the German soldier and in his summer book. Why!!! Horses where they were given to us by God and if the Americans needed a horse, you can very well use it. In the same sense the German was trying to kill Americans, but this book / film makes it look OK! The casting is absolutely horrible !!!!!!!!!!!! The girl is Hispanic, the mother is white, the father is probably mostly white and the little sister is "shirley templish". Even the acting is bad, the serious parts become comedy! Conclusion: bad film, bad book, but both have different endings, neither read nor see either of them!
