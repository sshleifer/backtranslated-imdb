Lately, I've been watching a lot of westerns from the 30s to today. There are some great low budget spaghetti westerns from the late 1960s and early 1970s. This film had all the elements of a decent western: a beautiful story with talented actors and all the rest. Although, it's a parody of this genre, and for me the way it was done didn't work and was made for a disappointing film. <br /> <br /> This film can be easily divided into two parts. > <br /> The first part is fantastic; has a large opening scene and develops an interesting story of a bounty hunter (a.k.a. the stranger) who chases a bandit who is chasing a large bank shipment guarded, in part, by a banker. During the film these three characters form mutable alliances in an attempt to get the money. There are subtle comic references to the contrasts of previous films of this genre, but the comedy does not interrupt the overall story. <br /> <br /> The second part of the film is where comedy goes beyond the lines and basically ruins the film. The turning point is just in the part where the maid causally reproaches the dwarf to stop firing at customers as he goes around waiting for other seemingly oblivious patrons of the four corpses that lie on the spot. From this point on, the film moves from a discreet spaghetti western with comic subtitles to a stupid stupid parody. <br /> <br /> There are three horrible punching scenes (one on the river, one on the market and one in the bathrooms) which follow in rapid succession as if one were not bad enough. The fighting is so fake that it's ridiculous, and since the sound isn't synchronized with the image it makes it even worse. In the market fight scene the banker bounces on the spot on hidden trampolines and whirls on poles as if he were in the circus; it's clownish. Although, the worst part of these fight scenes is music; it's a cheerful and cheerful mix, more suited to a square dance or an episode of "Hee-Haw". These scenes practically derail the main story. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film was disappointing because it had great potential as a decent western, but the comic has just turned into something. If you want to see a good western parody, then see "Blazing Saddles". If you want to see a good spaghetti western, avoid this movie.
