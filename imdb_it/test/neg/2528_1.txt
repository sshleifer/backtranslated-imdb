Friend, are you serious? Did you read the book or watch this movie? Well, if you did, let me warn you, it's fake. Mark Furhman has been looking for a job since he lost his job with the Los Angeles police. You remember him, don't you? He was the guy who lied on the counter and gave the OJ Simpson defense a foothold they were looking for. Well, he has written three books since then. I read all three. No, I'm not a fan, I was given. HOWEVER, I will tell you a resemblance in all three, severely distort the importance of Mark Furhman. He shamelessly exaggerated his stature in all three. In "Murder in Spokane", he pretends to have something to do with catching the killer, when he had nothing to do with it. In all the books he is very happy to reduce the efforts of local law enforcement. A bit like his efforts were cleared in the OJ trial. In this film, there are a lot of slow-motion shots of women watching Furhman and craving it. Many other shots have put him in the spotlight, when in fact I'm sure the only thing people thought at the time was "hey, isn't the racist that caused OJ to leave?" This was an interesting real life story, but not a good movie about it.
