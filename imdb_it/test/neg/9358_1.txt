This very well done film commits the unforgivable (which is ironic, given the theme of the film). No one in this film knows what they are for. Worse still, at 3/4 of the movie, no one still has the slightest idea what they are in because everything up until that "moment" is a different film. <br /> <br /> fans of the front row of Dutcher's first two films, competing for the best 2 Mormon films to date (in competition with Saints and Soldiers and, now, New York Doll - seen in a screening) , Dutcher made me want to see his movie for a long time. I was there. I wanted to believe, I think I would have seen the next great movie Mormon, one that would have held the Number One place for a very long time. But no. The three quarters of the film made the sharpest left turn and dragged me through something I never wanted to cross. He takes on the Mount. The Everest of all moral questions, yes, both, with little time or emotional capacity left to face them adequately, but instead greets them both with a nod to Jesus as if that would have made all the good things, to the instant. (It is true that Jesus saves, not accusing me of not believing it, is not a problem of Dutcher.) <br /> <br /> Is the film shot well? Indeed. Do the actors act? They behaved well. Was the music appropriate? Everything but anything was beyond the end credits. Everything about this film was superb, except the story, which was so wet and wrong, that everything else doesn't matter. (By the way, I learned "dank" from New York Doll, a very honest show.) The third act of the film was neither desirable nor affirmative. I know Dutcher was leaning back to make it, but by then I was so far pushed out of the film that nothing, nothing, could bring me back. The incredible absurdity of dozens of details in the final minutes didn't help. Anyone who has been on a mission knows what I'm talking about, especially anyone who has noticed that Spoiler Alert is aware of events surrounding someone who is sent home from a mission in advance for moral and / or psychological reasons. It is as if a parallel universe suddenly arises where the normal rules or behaviors suddenly do not apply. <br /> <br /> There are a million good things about this movie, but they were created and embellished just to be trampled and thrown away in an instant of "ooh, this will really make them" elitism. So unforgivable. I can only hope that when Dutcher touches his next film ("Falling", apparently), remember that film critics can only buy so many tickets and that the fans pay the bills. That is why God's first Army was so successful without reservation. <br /> <br /> Dutcher's shock and awe-proving approach proves that when it comes to the Big Issues he is above his head, having neither spiritual nor creative maturity, nor business sense necessary to carry them forward. You are welcome ?? Please! ?? he learns his lesson and in those years he and all of us look back, with regret, and we rejoice for having pulled out his head from where the Light does not shine and really, successfully, takes on those and other problems and changes the world forever because of it.
