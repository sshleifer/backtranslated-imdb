Three young university students, Simona (Iva Krajnc), Alja (Tanja Potocnik) and Zana (Pia Zemljic), embark on a canoe adventure along the Kolpa river, dividing their Slovenia from neighboring Croatia, in this 2002 Slovenian film by Maya Weiss . What could have been a version of Eastern Europe of the well-known and exciting "Deliverance" of 1972 turned out, for me, to be absolutely groundless with portraits of flat characters that denied sympathetic identification with the characters. <br /> <br /> Alja and the Zana are not at all convincing as students, although Alja expresses the desire to be a writer, and both use what seemed to me excessive bad language. Alja is bored by her boyfriend and seems to be adrift in life. Zana, even less scholarly, is a self-absorbed adventure adventure with an attraction for other women. I had some sympathy with Simona relatively innocent, conservative and starry-eyed. The very idea of ​​these three trips together does not work for me. The contempt shown by Zana and Alja to Simona does not make sense - because they chose her as a traveling companion to start, how surely must they know her behavior and her attitudes? <br /> <br /> The three begin a carefree journey the river on two canoes, undaunted by a news of the disappearance of a woman along the river. Things get darker with the mysterious, sometimes real and sometimes even hallucinatory, appearance of a rabidly conservative political fisherman (Jonas Znidarsic). I liked the scenes along the river and the small villages visited by the trio. It may be due to a lack of cultural understanding, but the film did not move me any differently. I was surprised to see that the film won some awards.
