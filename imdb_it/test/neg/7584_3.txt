Experienced professionals live in an exotic and dangerous place. They get drunk every night. They are smuggling opium. Drop the pigs into the parachutes. It flies in impossibly dangerous conditions. They dress strangely and behave strangely. They are iconoclasts, outrageous. They violate every rule of command and despise their employers at the CIA. They are irreplaceable. <br /> <br /> No. It is not "Only Angels Have Wings" and it is not "M * A * S * H". It is an uncomfortable mix of the two that unfortunately appears more foolish than funny. <br /> <br /> Aiming for shock, fun and education, but it doesn't really reach its goals. <br /> <br /> As for its shock value, well, we're already tired, aren't we? Is it really shocking anyone that a group of tireless pilots did secret missions in Laos in the 1970s? No, it's not shocking. It is not even educational now, in our current circumstances, when it would be interesting to learn that some paramilitary excursions were NOT buried in an archive called National Interest, Defense de Toucher. All right. So we've been a little wiser and are no longer so shocking or so stupid. <br /> <br /> The problem in this case is that the film depends on those same qualities for its power to entertain. Without this, the film implodes. A group of drunk and drunken CIA pilots are sitting in a cat house, doing goats, shooting at the lights with a silenced gun, killing lizards with them. He asks the novice Robert Downey, Jr., "When do you guys act like this mean there's something to celebrate?" Another answers, sneering: "No, it means it's night". It might be fun if we expected the renegade pilots to be as straight as the rest of us. If we do not do it, the gag, like the film, falls flat. <br /> <br /> There are action scenes of course. All that can happen in or on an airplane in flight happens in or on an airplane in flight. People fall out of them, the luggage is thrown haphazardly from their hatches, the engines fail, take AAA damage, they are torn apart during landings, but we have seen most of this elsewhere, often done better. <br /> <br /> Some might find this more fun than me, and the acting is pretty good. Robert Downey Jr. is particularly effective as a straight man. Look at the other comments and if they describe a movie that you might find attractive, then watch it carefully. There may be some laughter that I missed.
