Yes, I had the misfortune of watching this film when I was younger in a friend's house, since his mother was a teacher and wanted to see the film to see if there were inappropriate scenes that a parent could object to. Well, aside from the funny jokes, I think this was clear, well, the funny little jokes and the strange scene where Ernest's appearance hits a girl. So yes, Ernest is thrown into jail thanks to a similar appearance and proceeds to try to escape and there are other things as if he were magnetizing himself at some point, firing electricity, and very painfully watching the final flight. There are a couple of jokes, but nothing much to mention except for the soap-carved pistol ... I think it's the only scene where my friend's mom or me laughs out loud. This and the field are the only two Ernest movies I've ever seen and from what I've seen in them I'm not going to track down the other films. Ernest was good at small doses, but a film is very similar even when it's short like this. I imagine the films made money, mainly because all you need is Varney, a location and a theme and you have your movie.
