Do not get me wrong. I have a remarkable weakness for the works of Charles Band, both as a producer and as a director. But you have to raise an eyebrow when the man who was willing to put his name on "Dollman Vs The Demonic Toys" is a pseudonym of anything. As a bit of a funny bad movie, "Head Of The Family" is rather lacking, although it is better interpreted than one might expect. Jacqueline Lovell is a defined talent who deserves better than these films. J. W. Perra is also quite funny as the titular monster, even if for such a superintelligent being she is easily fooled. You know, I'm fussy because the rest of the film is so sharp and witty, of course .... <br /> <br /> And having a main character called Lance Bogan? Nice guys. We didn't know you Americans knew that piece of jargon!
