I must say that I was surprised to find several positive comments to this turkey (in desperate need of a feather transplant)! I'm giving a 1 because I think the idea of ​​making a movie about the wild man of rock'n'roll - Jerry Lee Lewis, is honorable, but it's a shame to put out that garbage and the "killer" doesn't do it deserve it! It's a good thing he came late in his career ... they said that Elvis pretty much ruined his career with the movies he released in the 1960s and that he could do the same for Jerry Lee, if he came out 15- 20 years before! It is based on the book by Myra Gail Lewis and it is a shame to start. It's a bad and inaccurate story of his life with Lewis and there are far better books on the Killer, which could have created a much better and more interesting script. Add to this a group of actors who don't know if they are participating in a drama, a comedy or a bit of both! The good actor Dennis Quaid is staging what must be one of an actor's worst performances in many moon! He is walking in the picture, talking about his "god-given talent" and as a spectator, you would like him to show something even on the screen! Silly gestures and funny faces and Jerry Lee must have felt betrayed when he saw what became of him in this really terrible movie! The rest of the crew is almost as ugly ... except for Winona Ryder, who does her best with the nasty lines she was given. It's "Grease" once again and every time Jerry Lee walks around Memphis in his convertible, with the radio on in the car, the whole city dances with music from it! Everyone in this movie is like cartoon characters of real people involved ... from the wild man in person to Sun Records Sam Philips! And it's a real pity! A charismatic and interesting artist like Jerry Lee Lewis deserves better and I hope he got the $ 500,000 he got from the deal and told the company to go and do it alone ... twice!
