I had to watch this movie with my 5 year old son. He didn't laugh once during the whole movie ... and he loves dogs and will laugh at almost anything! This film was horrible from all aspects: poor screenplay (even for the G-rated movie for children), poor production (the disturbing camera shots made me sick for the first ten minutes), poor acting (maybe they were "direct" to act cartoonish), and also poor sound quality (there are parts where the audio level looks good, so you can't hear what the next actor is saying). I'm willing to put up with a lot when it comes to watching a children's movie, but this was worse than having a stick in my eyes. I also didn't like being crushed on the head with the god-heaven sideboard. In all, it was the biggest waste of 90 minutes in my life ... and I did some serious waste of my time!
