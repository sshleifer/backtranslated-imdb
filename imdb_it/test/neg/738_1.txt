It is difficult for a lover of the novel Northanger Abbey to sit through this adaptation of the BBC and to avoid launching objects on the TV screen - in fact, if Jane Austen herself were to see it, she would be quite amused and perhaps excluded. Maggie Wadey's adaptation has made Northanger Abbey into what it has satirized, the gothic novel (and readers of gothic novels). <br /> <br /> The role of Catherine Morland in the adaptation is portrayed quite close to Catherine of Austen, a generous-hearted, whose imagination simply runs off with her. But the novel's Henry Tilney is not a nerve-racking, cynical and pipe-making hero of a gothic novel - he is a provocative, almost handsome man with a messy room and a life (it's true, Henry Tilney is a cleric, a charm that has completely fallen from the script). Some of the best scenes of the novel, when Henry, completely impassive, outrages Catherine, on diction, diaries, Mrs. Radcliffe, etc., are not portrayed in the adaptation. A large part of Henry's personality is lost when those scenes are not adapted. Furthermore, Peter Firth's appearance is not accurate: Henry Tilney should be 24 or 25 years old, dark hair and a brown skin, not 35 or 40 and blond. <br /> <br /> There are so many other absurdities in adaptation that invoke surprise and disgust - who is the marquise, and what is she doing in history ?! Why is John Thorpe less an idiot and more intriguing? Why is Northanger Abbey a castle? Catherine of the novel, with her romantic visions, expects hidden passages and dark tapestries, but is very disappointed to discover that Northanger Abbey is actually a comfortable and modern home, another element of satire! Why portray General Tilney as drunk? Why does Catherine have those strange visions of Mrs. Allen sticking her finger, etc.? Catherine's imagination escapes only with her to Northanger, with Henry there to correct her gently. And finally, why are there so many facts about the Tilney family and Ms. Tilney's death has been changed unnecessarily? To make the story more "horrible"? All these oddities and more simply are too strange to be overlooked. <br /> <br />>
