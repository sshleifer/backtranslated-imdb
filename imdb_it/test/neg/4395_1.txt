Useless film. A complete waste of time and nothing of what I expected it to be. The packaging makes it look like it's American Pie (it's not). rather it is a ridiculous combination of coincidences that makes the film look more like a writing exercise (let's try to see how many mixes we can write to make what should have been a bad SNL in a feature-length presentation). What is remarkable is that the directors (based on their comments on the DVD) take themselves completely seriously. I was a big fan of the films to which National Lampoon gave its name, up to Van Wilder. With this, I feel completely cheated. In fact, I feel like DUPED. I was expecting a Van Wilder like a farce to relive my university days, but instead an hour and a half of garbage was served. What led to my ultimately unsatisfied expectations? Well, for starters, the fact that the cast appears naked (with a huge sausage covering what needs to be covered) on the DVD cover. Add to that the images on the back of the case and the description and make people think that this is a movie that is not. To make matters worse, the film begins as one might expect even with half-naked drunk university students who weakly attempt a photo shoot, but in the end this has absolutely nothing to do with the film. Actually, I didn't even realize that the people in that opening sequence had to be the characters in the movie until the directors told me in the comment. Don't get me wrong, I love twists and I'm surprised by the movies, but I hate the fact that this movie tries to get busy as something it isn't. Ultimately, it is in itself a huge disservice (artistically, albeit most probably not financially) because it puts its audience in search of confusion and disappointment simply because it fails to offer what it advertises. <br /> <br /> In short, don't rent this movie based on what you see on the case. It's not your usual national Lampoon movie. The only funny thing is that many of the actors have appeared in other films and TV shows that make their involvement here fun.
