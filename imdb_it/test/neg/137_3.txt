this is one of the least made films I've ever seen. We need to take something seriously from Truffaut; it's not just a B series movie created by the hacks. <br /> <br /> Truffaut evidently could not decide whether he was doing a noir or a sentimental chick movie. and not even Deneuve, whose dozen (?), flip-flops of character are simply incredible - not even misinterpreted; it just didn't work at all. By the way, as a beautiful woman like Deneuve could be a person like Julie / Marion is simply beyond anyone's ability to suspend disbelief; the role absolutely requires someone not so beautiful. Belmondo's acting suffers even if his character is not as incredible as Deneuve's. The final clich√© (which I will not describe) is unfortunately too appropriate for this complete error.
