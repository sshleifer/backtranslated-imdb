Although unusually in color for a second oater, the bright clothes of lead women fail to bring any kind of life to the direct script. The "plot" revolves around the young people released again on the word, trying to go straight but pursued by a vengeful ex-Pinkerton (a scenario that chews Fred Clark) and a femme fatale determined to involve them in her bank robbery plans, both whether they want to or not. Like Cole Younger, Wayne Morris is big and fat but his "cool" behavior and his acting skills in wood undermine things. The standard of action is frankly, not better than an episode of Gene Autry or Roy Rogers TV with Colt .45 that never needs shooting and framing skills that allow a rider to shoot from the side and hurt a man for at least 50 feet. ..Oh dear...
