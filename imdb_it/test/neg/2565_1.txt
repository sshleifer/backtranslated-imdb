I don't know the rest of the spectators of this film, but personally I'm tired and tired of the Steven Seagal films. When Above the Law came out, it was a great action movie. Wahoo. Now in the Patriot, Steven Seagal plays Steven Seagal from Above the Law. I get tired of not seeing changes of character. It is the same character, from time to time, after time. He needs to change. This film was probably one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. Calling it an action movie gives him almost too much credit because there are too few action scenes and they spread out of proportion throughout the film. I imagine they wanted to do a little drama, but it was a meaningless attempt as the film describes nothing but the regular Steven-Seagal with cross-eyed eyes we have seen thousands of times. Getting a new look and losing the ponytail is all I have to say, I definitely don't recommend watching this movie in any form, going to eat, heck, renting Barney goes to Las Vegas but don't rent this movie under any circumstances the precept that Seagal will make a great performance.
