This movie made me so angry !! Here I am thinking that here is a new horror movie, one with a sense of intelligence and then the film begins. The scenery, the delivery of the lines, the costumes, the fake blood, do I have to go on? There are porn movies with dialogues better than this. I understand the concept behind indie films, but my God, this was not just indie, this was a report from a high school shot with a video camera and the cast are all friends and relatives. This is a film that has been condemned since its inception. Perhaps if it were 1982 instead of the new millennium, this film could fly. But it seems to me that someone has hung a stone around the neck of this albatross and that it is sinking at a constant rate of speed.
