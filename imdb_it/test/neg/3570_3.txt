I have to say that the film is not the best I've ever seen, but I'd like to mention that the actors that portray Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey were the real Dorsey brothers. As actors, they were wonderful musicians. The film, based on their famous division, would have been better if professional actors played the parts. Many films made during this period have taken advantage of the popularity of Big Bands. Very often, the films were not so good because the musicians are not professional actors. Most of the public going to the movies didn't go to see Tommy or Jimmy Dorsey play alone; they went for the plot and the music. I've never been a big fan of Dorsey, but the music is good even today. <br /> <br /> I have to comment on a previous post regarding the actors who played Mom and Pop Dorsey and that their accents would have been considered extreme by a Dublin audience. Arthur Shields and Sara Allgood were actually Irish actors, both born in Dublin. You could remember Mr. Shields as Reverend Mr. Playfair in The Quiet Man and Ms. Allgood as Mrs. Monahan in Cheaper than The Dozen.
