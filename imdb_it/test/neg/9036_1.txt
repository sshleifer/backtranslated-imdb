I love beach boys and their music. So, since I'm a director, I thought, wow, a Beach Boys movie sounds great. Well, WRONG! Actually I just turned off HDNET, the channel on which the movie was played, because it was so ugly. Someone mentioned above talked about editing ... well, they should have at least watched the monitors while they were shooting. I don't know if anyone else caught the mustache that fell from the face of one of the boys after kissing his wife and then put it back with his hands. Have you ever heard of redoing a scene! Acting was terrible. The management was terrible. The trick was TERRIBLE !!! Perhaps the worst make-up job I've ever seen. Brian Wilson's "fat" cheek looked like pl-ado. <br /> <br /> It is honestly the first time I commented on IMDb, and I know that it really doesn't make a difference ... but come on, what the hell were the producers thinking?!?! !?
