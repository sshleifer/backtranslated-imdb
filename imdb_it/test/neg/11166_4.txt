Korea's response to "I know what you did last summer" follows a similar path to its American counterpart: a year after a group of high school friends accidentally killed a classmate, a masked assassin starts picking them up one by one. Who could have ever seen them that night - or was they still their living 'victim' when they dumped him at sea? <br /> <br /> Originality cannot be expected from the teenage slasher genre, but an effort can still be made to ensure that this ilke's films are fun and scary. RECORD is neither one nor the other, churning out scenes badly reworked by "I Know ...", "The House On Sorority Row" and "The Faculty" (among many others) and failing to get a decent shock for all 95 minutes. > <br /> The acting is decent from the cast which, as seems to be the norm in Korean cinema, approaches an uninspiring script with taste and an undeserved enthusiasm. The direction is mediocre at best, however; a strange choice of camera angles and the worst killer costume * NEVER * contributing to RECORD's downfall. The most disappointing is the ending of the film, in which the two "surprise twists" are obvious that in the past you have dismissed them as excessive! <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves RECORD is its brilliant start: the first act is actually excellent and shows American counterparts how character development and mood setting are supposed to be made - but apart from that, this is a very poor film. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> ** / *****
