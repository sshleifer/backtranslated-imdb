The title doesn't make much sense to me. I'm not sure which movie port shouldn't have been opened. <br /> <br /> The film begins without incident, with a conversation between a man and a woman in a room that looks like a richly furnished train carriage, complete with the sound of the train traveling. In fact, the man's house is a wagon, and it has a box of train sounds. The woman leaves and calls a young woman. The young woman tells her boyfriend, a doctor, that she was told that her grandmother is sick and that she must return to her hometown. It hasn't been there for thirteen years. <br /> <br /> Flash returns to thirteen years ago. A dark figure enters a house. He caresses a sleeping young woman, then goes to another room and stabs the girl's mother. The girl wakes up and enters her mother's room and finds her dead with a knife in her. She screams, and an arm comes out of nowhere and beats a hand over her mouth. He looks up in fear. That first scene of the killer movie stifles his scream, and the girl's appearance is one of the few effective shots in the film. <br /> <br /> Not very successful in the imaging department. Occasionally there is a strange use of sound, and there is a strange lighting in an attic scene where many of the glasses are red and blue. <br /> <br /> Return to the present day. The young woman arrives at her grandmother's house. There is an old doctor, who does not trust, along with the man from the opening scene "Giudice" and Kearn, the operator of the city museum. He does not trust any of them, and it is true that they do not inspire confidence. It's rather grumpy throughout the film. He wants to check his grandmother in a hospital. The men of the city want his home, and the museum operator wants things in it (his museum is already full of many things about his grandmother). Inexplicably, the woman wants to keep the house. <br /> <br /> The young woman starts receiving phone calls from a man who speaks in a sinister whisper. He makes various threats and wants her to do things to wake him up. Such scenes are repeated often. Unfortunately, there are so few characters in the film, that the possibilities of who they might be are limited. Worse, we see from the start who is making phone calls. So while the young woman does not know (even if the caller occasionally falls into his normal voice), the audience always knows: without suspense. Every call rattles off more and more. <br /> <br /> The ending was unexpected for me, so maybe the points for not going with the obvious, but I'm not sure I cared.
