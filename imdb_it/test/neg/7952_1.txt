... Or is this another way under the underlying masterpiece of the cane? Preferably both! Somewhere between 1969 and 1972 came a series of horrible horror films that are almost lost again. Nothing more needs to be explained, asked or shouted out loud. If you followed my writings on CARNEVALE DI SANGUE or GURU THE MAD MONK closely, then you know what's in store with SCREAM BABY SCREAM. The title sounds interesting; it's just the weak script that should have gone somewhere else! Even so, this is out of hand, the most terribly written piece of cinematic master ever worked on the film! <br /> <br /> If you thought it was an early slash (which benefits IMDb users on average to write another comment), next time you'll be luckier! The real truth behind the script has NOTHING to do with the film, which supposedly tells of a blue-faced psychopath who "kills" and makes ugly facial sculptures on his victims. Looks like you're watching another episode of "SCOOBY-DOO". My favorite scene is the monkey cage in which the four young hippie teenagers play. And the horror of an actress with the name "Eugenie Wingate" for giving us the worst facial transformation, ever! 1969 has never been so bad, but it is! <br /> <br /> Try to find this 30-year-old rarity in a business basement for five dollars; makes it the perfect novelty item to return to those psychedelic days of flower power, bad fashions and trash music! Interesting note: SCREAM BABY SCREAM is also listed in Troma's film archives on the company's website. Only time will tell when this will reach the top of the list of the 100 down with other cheapies of the 70s; God knows they have to NEED !!! PIANO 9 is history !!!
