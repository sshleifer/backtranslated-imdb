A total and total disaster of my precious two hours. The entire film could have been made in less than 60 seconds by simply showing people getting killed, a car crashing, people getting more and more angry, people having sex, people crying and people getting caught . The slogan for this film should have read "Come and see how our characters are fucked! They are stoned! They are coca junkies! They are a mess! Who are these people? Do you really care?" Just give us your money, please because we don't care about anything else! "An absolutely terrible film. It never went anywhere, you never knew the characters (they never even said what these people did to earn such a big house and so many money, cars and coke), and it was simply boring.You might like the movie a bit more if you're a hooligan, but for the vast majority of us who aren't, this movie is a waste of film and time .
