An assassin killer takes victims in Niagara Falls and New York City before being hit by a car. Sheila Morris (formerly Miss Sweden Janet Agren, who gave a hilarious dub "Southern belle" to prove she was originally from Alabama) finds a connection between these murders and the disappearance of her sister Diana (Paola Senatore) and decides to investigate. This takes her to New Guinea where she promises a squalid guide (Robert Kerman, American porn star R. Bolla) $ 80,000 to help locate her sister. Having just crossed a jungle full of bloodthirsty cannibals, they finally found Diana, who is under the control of type cult leader Jim Jones, Jonas Melvyn (Ivan Rassimov). Jonas does the typical crazy guru-style things, like passing LSD, starting group suicide, threatening to kill anyone who disobeys him and raping him with a giant dong dipped in cobra blood. Occasionally a character will look to the right or left and will see a bloody scene raised directly by JUNGLE HOLOCAUST or MAN FROM DEEP RIVER (both also directed by Lenzi). I'm pretty sure they also use at least two CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST scenes. Here we get the slaughtering scenes of the animals (gutting of an alligator, natives eating live snakes), plus some additional nudity and castration. Me Me Lai shows up to give her breast implants another workout by playing a widow who is slammed by three of her brothers in the laws on top of her newly cremated husband's ashes. Mel Ferrer appears briefly as a professor and is not given much to do. <br /> <br /> So anyway, with EATEN LIVE! you have virtually a promise fulfilled with all the nudity, blood, dead animals and bad taste you expect from one of these titles, so if you're a napping dog, watch it carefully. Personally, I got bored halfway and just wanted it to end. The original version (heavily cut) of the United States in 1985 was entitled THE EMERALD JUNGLE to induce people to think that they were actually renting John Boorman's EMERALD FOREST. He was also called DOOMED TO DIE AND EATEN LIVING FROM CANNIBALS!
