The horrible production does not qualify as a "film". Obviously it was shot on videotape and very bad! There is a constant sound for the audio (sounds like a bad microphone), which is so annoying that sometimes you can't understand what the characters are saying. Badly dubbed music will suddenly appear in one scene, and the whole montage of this thing is worth about a ZERO! <br /> <br /> The plot is invented and ridiculous. A late 20s gay man trying to hide his live lover from visiting parents? PLEASE! And the reaction that the mother has when she finds a photo of her son kissing her boyfrioend is beyond the melodramatic and ends up in the stupid. Talk about a stereotypical vision of gay life! Acting is worse than a porn movie, and the direction is very poor! <br /> <br /> As for the "production", there is none! <br /> <br /> This title is simply a lame videotaped attempt to call itself a "movie". There is no soul or heart to give him even the smallest praise. <br /> <br /> It's just a stupid waste of time, so avoid it at all costs! EVIL THAT WORKS! BAD WRITING! BAD DIRECTING, and the title of "producer" is vanity since this garbage probably cost them the price of the videocassette on which they turned it. <br /> <br /> This garbage has no business to be published on a DVD because it is misleading to the cunsomer. I can't stress how horrible this "SUGARPLUM" shit is! <br /> <br />
