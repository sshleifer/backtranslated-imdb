This strange film from Texas speaks of Fallon, a boy rich in amateurs in the late 1800s (although he looks like a C & W singer from the 1960s with fat hair and sideburns) whose wreckage on an island owned by Count DeSade (pronounced de-sayd) with his Captain. The count is afraid of pirates and torture, a girl who was once a pirate hostage and also tortures the captain. Meanwhile, the gruesome old nurse Cassandra tells Fallon the secrets of the castle. The countess has leprosy and goes mad! Fallon is trapped but brings supplies. The captain is killed by a racist-caricature slave. Fallon is thrown into the prison with the leper, who always thinks it's his wedding day. The leprous bride is excited, but Cassandra kills her. Fallon and Cassandra flee the castle, but the count and his slave chase them with the dogs. DeSade kills the slave and Fallon kills DeSade. Fallon and Cassandra fall in love over the next year, but when the refueling ship arrives, the crew refuses to take our lovers because they are both lepers now. They live in the castle for years ... Fallon's hair turns gray and Cassandra is bingeing. Fallon puts her in the dungeon. Our story of love and leprosy ends. <br /> <br /> So weird it is watchable and you can smell the drive-in popcorn.
