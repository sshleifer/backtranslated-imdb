Not well done, the whole movie was just the Grudge that turned and killed random people from nowhere. Random people who have nothing to do with the story are killed, such as the 3 school girls. <br /> <br /> At first the family has nothing to do with the story, I believe they are random family that has never entered the house, and has never had anything to do with the killings of Rancor . <br /> <br /> It didn't hit me at all, I wasn't afraid, I wasn't jumping anywhere, and the whole movie was just a piece of shit to get more money. Gridge 1 also looks crap, which was actually a good movie. <br /> <br /> I think The Grudge 2 is like a leading movie for The Grudge 3, if they ever make one. They shouldn't even have called this Rancor 2, they should have called it the prologue of Rancore 2, and you'll see if you've looked at it, because I'm not going to ruin anything. Not that this would have mattered anyway. <br /> <br /> 1/10, not scary, bad story, and it's completely random.
