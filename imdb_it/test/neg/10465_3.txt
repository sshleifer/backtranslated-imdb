All I can do is laugh. Wow. I like Jim Wynorski movies, really. I mean, Chopping Mall is a classic. But this, what happened to this guy? He used to make funny horror movies that tried to be good. But it wasn't even funny ... I mean, I guess it was, because I laughed. The villain is incredible. I mean, CGI horrible. It looks ... terrible. And the film has no blood and nudity as saving qualities. It is rated PG-13. A movie called "Bone Eater" that you know won't be a hit movie, you know you probably won't have a smart script. A film like this can count on gore ... but no. It doesn't rely on anything really, it's just ... shit. Watch it if you want to laugh, though. But don't expect a good movie. I hope Jim Wynorski returns to movies like Chopping Mall and Ghoulies IV, because this is Komodo vs. Cobra isn't cutting it.
