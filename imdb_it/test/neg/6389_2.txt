This stolen derivation pool stole from every film of Soviet notes and failed miserably. I have had an experience of all that is wrong in organized religion in general and in the particular shortcomings of the Russian Orthodox Church (make sure this comment comes from a person of faith). Even the extraordinary cinematography left me without inspiration. I spent his best moments knowing the masterpieces he was imitating badly. I would not recommend seeing this film unless you have a deep passion for the Russian Orthodox Church, its monastic traditions, miracles in the face of communism and the saints of the 1970s. It is a meaningless film from (and about) a narrow perspective that has done absolutely nothing for me.
