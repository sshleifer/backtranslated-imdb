The worst movie ever made, without exception. Get a pat on the shoulder if you can sit in every painfully painful minute. Apart from the bite in which the unlucky loser turned the deranged psychopath from forced medical experimentation, he pours his pea soup over the doctor's head and laughs as any good delirious madman should ... that's all.
