This is a spin-off of Pulp Fiction. I thought it would be nice to have some good laughs. Well, it turns out that this movie was really terrible. The entire plot does not follow the plot of Pulp Fiction. He turns to other films like Forrest Gump and more. Some laughter came out of this film, but everything and everything took me 90 minutes of my life. If you are thinking of renting this movie, please don't waste 90 minutes of your life. Reconsider renting this and move on and find a movie that actually makes sense. Please, if there is a Plump Fiction 2, I will definitely not go ahead and rent the sequel. I'm just going head to head for those out there.
