I'm so disappointed. After waiting 3 years for the repetitions / the DVD of the series of original masterpieces "Darkplace" I could not wait for this series. The first episode is just over and I'm horrified. Everything that was exceptional on Darkplace has been virtually canceled here. Worst introduction: canned laughter. this takes the original point and makes it almost unwatchable. (a joke about Garth's eyes that fertilized the audience was good ... the rest is hard for me to remember ...) seems a poor quality "Knowing me, knowing you". I hope this will improve as the series progresses, otherwise I will be seriously disappointed. back to "Darkplace ..." <br /> <br /> "You're the most compassionate man I've ever met and I know God ..."
