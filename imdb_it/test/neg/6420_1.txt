Years ago, Sara, a girl saw her parents being killed, now as an adult she suffers from various mental disorders (did I say she has an imaginary friend?) a sense of drowsiness. Deadly boring, I found it difficult to sit while I felt my eyelids become heavier and heavier with every infinite minute of idle chatter and supposed "mysteries". Is Sara going crazy? or is it the paranormal? A better question would be, who cares? And the answer to this, no one. No one at all. Skip this movie, save yourself some more time to do other more useful tasks. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D-
