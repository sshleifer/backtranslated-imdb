I find it terribly ironic that Hollywood's "left wing" continues to keep its bets at bay, making these films terrible and lukewarm that neither condemn the war on terror nor embrace it. <br /> <br /> If you are a survivor of the sixties and a committed pacifist, and you hope for a death sentence like BORN ON THE QUARTH OF LULY or ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, this movie will really seem like a rip. None of these soldiers actually question this war, or any war, or the idea of ​​war. They only complain about having to do another tour. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you are an American patriot who wants to see a story of courage and honor, this movie will really seem like a rip-off. None of these soldiers love America, or even love the service. The way they pout and pout make them look more like suburban teenagers than blue-collar boys. We are NOT SOLDIERS, and it is not SANDS OF IWO JIMA. Nor is it a mindless action, and the war scenes are less RAMBO and more BUFFY. <br /> <br /> Ryan Philippe cannot bring this kind of film so completely. Although he is devastatingly sexy, in a difficult market, in the men's room, in a bisexual way, it is difficult to imagine him as a Texan boy who speaks slowly and wants to stand up and be counted. This is not a sergeant. Croft in Mailer's THE NAKED AND THE DEAD. It is more like Joel in OTHER VOICES, other rooms of Truman Capote. He can't sell you the idea that he was in combat and did his part, O he wants his woman and wants her right now. He goes off to the battlefield and into the bedroom scenes, with the feeling that he'd rather bend over and take a good stiff attack from the back.
