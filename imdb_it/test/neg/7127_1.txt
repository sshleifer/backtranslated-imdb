This film was a tripe. It is possible that it is in fact a pollution. The subtle and tense atmosphere of the original remake is no longer to be seen. Sarah Michelle Gellar has nothing to do, even in her death sequence, but it's still the best performance in this film, and her death is the best thing, even though she deserved a better death. It is the sign of bad writing and direction. I guess he made this film to end his connection to garbage. <br /> <br /> It's not scary. Not stretched Not funny. It makes no sense. And as mentioned above, Sarah Michelle Gellar offers the only reasonable performance of the entire cast.
