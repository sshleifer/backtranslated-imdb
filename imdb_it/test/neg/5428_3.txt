Oh God. Why was Nickelodeon so difficult to produce even a half-decent film? I mean, this movie could have been good, but it was: <br /> <br /> A. Too short B. Rather superficial, stereotypical and offensive to some C. Ultimately useless <br /> <br /> Before everything, the "dress the nerd to look cool" thing was VERY consumerist, VERY shallow, VERY useless, and VERY insulting. He has stereotypical nerds - stupid faces, glasses, never kissed, vacations with his mother, etc. Well, maybe the reason that boy never kissed a girl is because he's gay! Does that mean all gays are nerds? And what's wrong with being friends with your mother? <br /> <br /> The worst part, by far, was the end. The whole drama of the film revolved around Zoey discovering that Chase loved her, and bla bla bla, and then, when Chase finally decided to tell him, <br /> <br /> A. didn't tell her in person why he really while he was going to the typical distraction he arrived with B. he tried to send her a text message, but his PDA fell into a fountain and died before she received the message. <br /> <br /> The End. <br /> <br /> HOW HAS IT BE ????? I mean, why can't cartoonists change anything in the series? So many of us would like to see these two get together. Why can't we see it? I mean, aren't the producers really so creative, that can't come up with new problems with the changes in the series? So they have to respect the same plot and the same patterns and how many episodes can they just use? After a while, it becomes boring and frustrating. <br /> <br /> I WANTED TO SEE SOME REAL ROMANTINS IN HERE, PLEASE! <br /> <br /> Ok. I'm done with my rant.
