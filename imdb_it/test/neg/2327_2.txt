If you don't like bad acting, poor editing, ridiculous dialogue and incredible characters you would hate this movie. If you like all of the above, ie if you are a Lynch fan, then you will love Mulholland Drive. This is probably the worst movie to rank above a 7.0 on IMDB. <br /> <br /> Outside of the work of Naomi Watts, it will be difficult for you to find competent acting in Mulholland Dr. The other female protagonist went to drama school "hide your face with your hands when you don't you have ribs ". Given the script they worked with, it's a wonder that all the actors don't keep their heads in their hands. <br /> <br /> The characters wander in and out of the movie who do nothing to advance the plot. You have a hit man, a mysterious cowboy, an adulterous wife and his clich√©, a lover of the poolman, a mafia type figure sitting in a dark room that speaks through an external voice box and a host of other people too numerous and boring to mention. Suffice it to say that they can do little more than fill the time on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's not so bad because it distracts the viewer from the fact that the film doesn't have a recognizable plot. You will wait and wait for all the loose wires to come together and at the end you will be deliriously disappointed. The hardest thing for a writer to do is to gather everything credibly at the end of a film in a way that leaves everyone satisfied. The easiest thing for a writer to do is to create many strange characters and put them into scenes that are not related to the film as a whole and then take the few coherent threads that are there and then mix them up by surprise. Guess which way Lynch goes. SURPRISE !! <br /> <br /> You know you have a bad script when you have to resort to dream sequences to make sense. After all, a dream sequence covers all sins. Dreams don't have to make sense. Anything can happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> Assembly is similarly disjointed. Let's just say that good editing does not call attention to itself. Much of the way this film is modified seems to be done for the sole purpose of calling attention to editing. "Look at me ... can you see my montage ... am I not a genius?" Uh, well ... NO! This film has all the marks of the worst and most self-indulgent French film. <br /> <br /> So why is this movie so popular? My theory is that it is just another sign of the decadence of our culture. Melodies are difficult to compose, so we listen to rap. The plots are difficult to follow so we try to do without them. The images are difficult to paint, so we pee in a cup and stuff ourselves with a crucifix. These are the symptoms of our times and Mulholland Drive is just another part of the affliction.
