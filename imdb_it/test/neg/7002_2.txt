I rarely close a movie after the first 10 minutes, but that's what I did with it. What upset me is that it was so obvious that the only purpose of this film was to exhibit as many B actresses as possible, and nothing else really matters. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong; I like beautiful actresses and sex scenes, and sexploitation movies have their scale of merit, but this director does nothing else. <br /> <br /> For example, take the scene where the two cops (obviously a gal and OF COURSE there's all this seemingly witty joke between them) are talking as they stand over the first corpse . The camera moves between them for each line, (there is more than one screen width between them!) And you end up wondering if you are sick or not. <br /> <br /> Well, it could have improved after the first 10 minutes, but I wouldn't know. I refused the sucker bet and found something better to do.
