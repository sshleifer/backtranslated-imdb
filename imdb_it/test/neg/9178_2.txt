Fred "The Hammer" Williamson distributes another low-cost film. He may have set a new standard for himself. Look for the cursed deadly cannon for special effects that is visible on the street during a chase scene. You don't see it only once, you see it several times. Look for the focus out of focus in a scene and the camera operator tries to fix it while the scene is scrolling. Watch this with a group of people and create your own Mystery Science Theater!
