Wow just Wow. There are already many reviews on this film but I wanted to add some of my comments. I agree with most of the reviewers who said that this film has a terrible acting, writing and directing - who ever does it. However, I think there are other problems here. <br /> <br /> 1. Why are Christian beliefs and compensation for extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive? Does the film act as if you could not be a Christian and also allow the possibility? Why? They always touch so briefly in the film (ie "The Bible does not say that there are aliens." "Well, the Bible does not say it is not there), but the true refutation is never answered. The Bible does not actually say that it does not there is, so how about facing the question instead of rejecting it out of hand? Or better yet, recognizing that this is an infinite universe in which we live and if we believe in an infinite God there is the possibility that he made some other life from somewhere and has his plans for them. <br /> <br /> 2. Why the only two explanations for kidnapping that are valid are demons and hoaxes - the night terrors that have been linked to kidnapping experiences? if it were something completely different, it's a pity that the directors have already made their minds. <br /> <br /> 3. The directors claim that all those who have had abduction experiences have had ties to the occult, this is a rather large statement to make without any concrete proof from present arguing that they do not, but if you are going to say something so simple, it is better that you have the facts to support it. <br /> <br /> 4. Why does the other reporter (not the guy with the fat blond hair, the other) always have his hands in his pockets? It is difficult to take someone seriously when they constantly play billiards. <br /> <br /> I WISH this was an exploration of the Christian faith and UFO phenomena, but unfortunately the filmmakers were too worried about their "message of faith" "worrying about creating a provocative film. As a Christian I same, this makes me sad.
