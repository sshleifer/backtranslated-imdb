Even if I'm not a woman, I can enjoy a chick chick if it's good. But this goes beyond evil. You have the story of the book, the girl is divorced, a boy with problems appears. The magic BOOM happens and its demons are banished as it realizes that its life has a new purpose. <br /> <br /> Now, while I can believe that this kind of thing could happen, I'm not an idiot. It wouldn't have happened for a geriatric-picky weekend, it would have taken some time. Yet here the producers know they have only 1 hour and 30 minutes, so they force the changes of the two to happen, I suppose a night of hammer blows and a night of grandparents and grandmothers who go like dogs in heat might be enough if you thought that romance novels were the Gospel ... but most people don't know. <br /> <br /> Now, if this is not enough ... the producers remember that a chick film needs to make the viewer cry ... ... well, they tried to make you cry with the two elders that they made themselves mocking by failing ... so how could they hit you again? Because I know, we kill one of the characters for no good reason, apart from the fact that a casual death will surely bring a tear to the eyes ... and now let the teenage daughter magically bond with her mother with broken heart for no reason beyond to the fact that it would be nice (completely unreal, but who cares). <br /> <br /> Here it is ... girl finds boy, boy finds love, death finds boy and mother cries ... what a movie - NOT.
