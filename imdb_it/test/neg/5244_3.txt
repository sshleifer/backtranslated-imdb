Another B movie for teenagers, based mainly on CGI effects, an industrial soundtrack and some medieval images. It is a pity that the Beowulf legend is used in such an uninspired way. I'm a fan of Christopher Lambert, but I have to admit he's getting worse as an actor and his films too. Rent it if you're just a teenager.
