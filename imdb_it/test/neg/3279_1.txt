The acting was bad, and the plot, well, I don't think there was one. <br /> <br /> Some fat blonde who is always dressed in an evening dress, kidnaps a species from a disco, I think he then kills a copper. useless fights then they happen The kidnapped girl is caged on a boat, why? The trained, tough and uncompromising policeman shows up, speaks English badly and does things that make no sense. His whole tripe. But he has a nice car. Christ on a bike, this film was a waste of 90 minutes.
