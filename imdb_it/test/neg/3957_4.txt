A group of teenagers discovers a bootleg video game, but when they start playing, they start dying like they do in the video game. By becoming addicted to the game, they must find a way to beat the central thug of the game, The Blood Countess, before it kills them all. <br /> <br /> The premise seems a bit silly and familiar, but this film could still have been pleasantly fun. However, this "horror" movie is not at all scary. In reality it is more a comedy than anything else. The film takes itself too seriously and the film is not much fun to watch. Of course, there is occasional laughter, but for the most part, the film is very boring. PG-13 horror movies can still be as good as The Ring or Cry Wolf. However, The Ring and Stay Alive are not the same type of horror film. Stay Alive is more of a slasher film and from its valued PG-13, the death scenes are very quiet. It had to be the main sale of the film and since it had an interesting concept, the deaths could be really good. Unfortunately, the studio wanted a wider audience and the film had to be modified. <br /> <br /> Acting is a complete joke and most of the cast offer horrible performances. Jon Foster is not a great guide man. He lacks charisma to really engage the public or the public that takes care of him. His character is not unlikely only very bland. Samaire Armstrong actually offers a satisfactory performance even if a little too bland to really stay out. Frankie Muniz offers probably the best performance in Stay Alive. It is an honor to the level of being the best Houston Texans player. Sophia Bush is absolutely terrible like October. His performance seems so hasty and so fake. The most annoying character in the film is Phineas played by Jimmi Simpson. His character is so unpredictable that he will be rooting for him to die. <br /> <br /> In fact, most of the characters are rather unlikely, so it's even more difficult to take an interest in the film. It's hard to feel sorry for some of these annoying children and it's a lot more fun to watch if you want the characters to really survive. The only positive thing about the film is the atmosphere. It's a bit old but it still works. The film is also very short, so it's not too painful to sit. I really don't want to blame the cast because they worked with an inexperienced director and writer. The management is not very good and the script is not much better. Stay Alive is not actually the worst horror film of 2006. This honor would go to When a Stranger Calls. Stay Alive is still a missed opportunity. In the end, this cumbersome and limping horror film is best left on the shelf. Evaluation 4/10.
