Casper Van Dien ... what can I say? I like the guy! His films give them a certain charm that is not actually brought by the director or producer, but by him! Recycled pitches ... check. Stuffed with better films ... check. The wooden acting ... check. It is not that Van Dien is a bad actor (it was effective in the Hollywood glory of Starship Troopers and Sleepy Hollow) that he was not really offered a script worthy of his talent; and yes, he has acting talent as well as being a pleasure for the eyes. This film offers a slight hint about what Van Dien can offer but is bogged down by the production of all this. The script can be developed better (see the U-turn of Oliver Stone). The direction can be better utilized (see From Dusk Til Dawn by Robert Rodriguez). The DP could have made the desert more exotic (see Russaster Faster Pussycat Faster Kill by Russ Meyer!). This script is weak because this is something we've seen many times before, so there are double / triple crosses. The management is weak because it offers nothing new and telegraphs many of the weak moments of script. Cinematography sometimes depicts a delicious autumnal taste of the desert, but at other times it does not take advantage of the burning light and the initial sequence is horrible in bluette. <br /> <br /> Now to acting. .. Van Dien shows a little grace and charisma to his Jake. He has neither too methodical nor too campy in his role. A nice balance, especially because the rest of the cast seems too distracted about how they should act in this film (bad script or bad direction ... make your opinion). The only other noteworthy person is Bryan Brown's villain as he provides the only real credit for acting in this film ... aspiring actors forget to try to learn how to act on the green screen, try to learn to act in a hideous script and taking notes on Bryan Brown in this film. He adds further depth to his role and is a beautiful counterpart to the Van Dien character. It seems that Jake is always a step ahead or control of every situation, whether he is out of his control. The femme fatale is weak (after all this is a desert noir) and is another nail in the coffin of this film (you decide ... script or direction). The character of Rosalita should have been pushed forward in the film instead of being pushed to the bottom to make room for the real femme fatale. So watch the movie for Van Dien and Brown; and for fun, try jumping a stone through the holes in the plot tied into the film.
