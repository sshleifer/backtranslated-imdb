This film tells the story of John Belushi, based on his "Wired" biography, written by Bob Woodward. All films are narrated in flashbacks without a chronological order, where after the death of John Belushi we see an angel accompanying Belushi during some points his life. Michael Chicklis in the character of John Belushi is quite credible, but completely devoid of Belushi's devastating force, and his drama remains only a pale animation. The director, moreover, fails to give continuity to the plot, the one for those who do not know that the book is very confused. But the worst is that they characterized Bob Woodward who spoke with Belushi before he died. For these negative points the film is only an attempt to narrate the controversial story of John Belushi. My rate is 4.
