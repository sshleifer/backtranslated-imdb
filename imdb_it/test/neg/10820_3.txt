The mission of seeing the movie "The Cave" was a dream of a friend of mine after witnessing the highly dramatic trailer, full of glare from a creature lurking in a cave, some young cave breakers, and not much else. Too bad the film hasn't changed much more than the trailer. <br /> <br /> The immediate charm of a film like this is the creature. What will it look like? Why do you live in a cave? How should this be different from the other creatures we've seen in movies like Alien and Predator and Relic? The "demons" of the cave do not seem far from the skeletal creature of Alien: the Resurrection and even have the sight of Predator. Too bad it's a total rip-off ... <br /> <br /> Well, let's take a look at the plot: very confused and jump to increasingly unlikely twists as a team of divers is sent to find a cave and its inhabitants in the Carpathians. The casting was very clear that we want young people, hips, strong girls, chiseled boys, and even girls with brains must be warm. We also need to have one of each racial background in case the public thinks that the filmmakers are distorted in a certain point of view. Completely done, and I'm completely tired of it. <br /> <br /> The other main problem was the ending, as if to say that there could be a sequel. Shoot me if there is one. The tagged on ending made me wretch. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 3/10 stars. The points he got were more or less points of appreciation towards the creators of creatures for their high quality work spent on costume and design for the monsters that live inside, even when they seemed totally robbed. And there is an interesting (but laborious) documentary on the DVD about cave diving. Go take a look only if you love new creatures of monsters and creatures, but I warn you that you've probably seen this movie before, and it was better the first time.
