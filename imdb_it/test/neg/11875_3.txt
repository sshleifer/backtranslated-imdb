Unlike some of the reviews written here, I didn't hate this movie. It is a film that could have been much better than it was. Not the Oscar material, true, but much better than it was. <br /> <br /> I thought the plot had a good connection and a line. Of course, this film was poorly written. It is TERRIBLY directed and produced. I mean, how many irrelevant flashbacks can you have? Why were we there? What exactly is the point of the opening sequence? It seems that the producers have watched American Beauty a little too many times and thought 'I'll use it in an action movie! 'I thought the movie wasn't so bad. Wesley Snipes did a credible job, he just ran into bad direction. And once this movie hit the production hall, things got worse. The main actress, I think, had the same problems. Some of the other actors were suspicious, yes, but it was a low-budget film. Once again, I would say that it is the director's job to take it back and correct it. <br /> <br /> As a general recommendation, I would agree with the first review I read that this film is not worth seeing. Or maybe it's worth seeing, if you're a film student and want to see what NOT to do. <br /> <br /> 3/10, and that's praising it.
