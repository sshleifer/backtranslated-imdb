As a fallen Orthodox Jewish writer and woman, I was terribly disappointed with this film. The dialogue is trite and expensive, the characters, too busy with lines ranging from the damned prosaic to the surprising melodrama, cannot expand into truly structured individuals. The one-trick musical score tries to make up for the madness, falling headlong into silence to shake the viewer and the script from the prolonged catatonia. <br /> <br /> As a revolutionary teenager on a hypocritical tirade, this film is swept away by the wisdom of its revelation - patriarchy is wrong - and wastes its energies completely, hammering on this point. The resulting artistic crime is a complete lack of imaginative development; moral crime is the reduction of human beings to caricatures: martyrs and grotesques.
