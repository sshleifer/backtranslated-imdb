"Quintet" is definitely not a movie that most people might find funny or even interesting for that subject. There is no scene, dialogue, acting or plot that ignites a spark. The frozen world is one thing, but the confusing plot is something you really can't stand. The characters are not only three-dimensional, they are not even one-dimensional, there are no emotions and there is no sense in everything that happens. There is a world enclosed in ice, where no one is doing any meaningful work, except playing Quintet, and the rules of the game are never even mentioned. The houses are not heated, even there is electricity, but who and what produces it? There is wood, but there are no animals, except dogs, so where do clothes or shoes come from, because, apparently, there is no industry, and everyone is dressed like in 16th century Europe , which is in stark contrast to the not so futuristic pavilion background. The whole film seems to be stuck in Altman's imagination and he never bothered to share his ideas or his vision with the public. Desolation or despair has nothing to do with the lack of attractiveness of this film, the world of George Lucas "THX1138" is not a brighter place and the characters are no longer funny, but the story has its path. In Quintet, there is no obvious path or even a hint, and in my opinion it does not even lead to thinking of the idea behind it, such as, for example, a similar film, "Zardoz" by John Boorman. It's not even done in Altman's unique style, so his fans don't like it, and I'm one of them. All in all, Robert Altman had a dream, and he woke up without telling anyone what it meant, not even him.
