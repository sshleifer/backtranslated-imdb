Seventh chapter very disappointing in this series that is dying slowly. Very obvious that the budget was extremely low. This film was made for one reason and one reason only. To sell Puppet Master Toys! Fans, like myself in the series, have decided, from what I've read and heard that the only one in the worst series of this is Curse of the Puppetmaster. In turn, moving away from the series. <br /> <br /> The choice to make this PG-13 movie, for whatever reason, did not work in favor of the movies. The plot seemed to be almost there, but it was easily lost in the constant stream of nonsense. <br /> <br /> The only film in the series that is worth watching, also directed by Decoteau is Part 3 - Vendetta di Toulon. <br /> <br /> Granted, I support the scenario of the film. <br /> <br /> Yuck!
