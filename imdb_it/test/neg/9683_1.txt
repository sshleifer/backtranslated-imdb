Oh boy. Where do I start with this piece of slime? This is one of the few high-budget films on my list that I considered appropriate to rate 1, and this is not for production values, which are quite high. This film has absolutely no respect for the account in the Bible and treats the whole story as a fantastic laugh. I could not recommend it to anyone, except to see how low we have become as a company ... <br /> <br /> First, Noah was absolutely not a friend of Lot. Anyone who actually read Genesis could tell you that Abram was who they were thinking about. The writers were just trying to complete the story with all the sub-plot of Sodom / Gommorah, and it seems out of place because it is. Noah is treated like a bad goofball ("You were kissing! You were kissing!") But at least it's a step away from the exhilarating exaggeration of Voight in Anaconda. <br /> <br /> However, these offenses pale in comparison to God's heretical treatment in this film. God is portrayed as a small and incomprehensible being that changes his mind at the slightest whim. ("I am a perfect eternal, but I can be wrong") What? Where does this come from? This kind of God ... no one should ever pay attention to, much less worship, praise or love. What the director says in this, I don't pretend to know. I only know that a responsible treatment of Noah's ark should not take an easy way out. Too bad for these people.
