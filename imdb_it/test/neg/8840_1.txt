With great expectations I went to see this film, Spain's contribution to the Oscar race this year. Part of being completely useless, trivial, pathetic, poorly written, edited, acted and directed, the film is too long. It fails to deliver the "message" it seeks to give, fails in its narrative, in the awkward historical settings and above all in its rhythm. There are some such extreme twists that I haven't seen in a movie in a long time (the story of Lucas whose dead sister lives in his head, the divine revelations, all that lizard nonsense). The Spanish-speaking audience around me was yawning and was quickly losing patience, and some of the comments I heard were whether the members of the Spanish Academy had drugged themselves before choosing the film for the Oscar competition.
