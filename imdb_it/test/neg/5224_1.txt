This is quite possible the worst movie ever made. I know people talk about how awful Ed Wood's movies (Plan 9) were, but this movie makes Plan 9 look great. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris makes a cameo, why don't I have any idea . Perhaps to ruin his film career. Apart from Chuck Norris, the cast of the film is made up of soap extras during the day and Mike Norris ... it's true, Chuck's son. <br /> <br /> This director does not even have a resume and I have no idea where the plot or screenplay originated. This must have been lit by a horrible Southern Baptist minister who somehow had a 3rd cousin who owned a studio (which I'm sure was closed). <br /> <br /> I don't know what else to say about this movie. I'd like to give you a summary of the plot but I'm lost. There is something in Jesus and in Satan ... some eternal battle. In addition to this there are Indians. And a bunch of crazy kids who don't know how to behave ... they're just embarrassing and they shouldn't be at the camera. I don't know what was happening most of the time, but I know the film was a big laugh. Mike Norris pushes his daughter (on his bike) in the street somehow ... but in the shot he is in the middle of the park. So, somehow, he learns to ride a bike with a speed equivalent to Flash and gets hit by a car or a bus ... I don't know. But she's dead. This is actually the funniest scene in the movie. I know he looks sick, but once you see Mike he raises his hands in a sign of victory and then you hold your head and scream with terror ... you'll understand. It doesn't show that the daughter was hit or anything ... you just have to assume she was hit by some vehicle. But the film is not clear. So maybe he was a complete stranger and died of cancer. Anyway ... after that the movie gets really confusing and I have no idea what really happens. I am a Christian and I have no idea why this film was made. I see no value for this film in a religious or non-religious sector. This is probably the first thing they show students in Film making 101 ... this is what YOU DO NOT want to do. <br /> <br /> Just see it ... it will hate you for me suggesting you see it.
