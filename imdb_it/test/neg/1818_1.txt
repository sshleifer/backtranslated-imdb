This series continues to frustrate and annoy. How will they drag it for another year? Each episode offers more and more questions, while providing very few answers. To quote another very popular site, I believe this show has now blown up the shark! <br /> <br /> Will, I keep watching it? <br /> <br /> Probably, <br /> <br /> Will they keep the show on until the end? <br /> <br /> Probably not ... <br /> <br /> How did two qualified doctors not notice that Naomi was still alive? How come 30 people didn't notice that a corpse wakes up and they leave with a knife still in his back? How has anyone had enough strength to create two paths and climb a tree to hide Kate? <br /> <br /> Now we have introduced a ghostbuster ... <br /> <br /> At the same time next week? Yup!
