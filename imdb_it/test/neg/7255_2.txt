30% of this film seems to be the Map Channel prototype. You see a giant map for about ten minutes, then release the archive material for a long time while droning (drone, do you understand?) On the radar. Apparently there are many radar stations in the far north, which protect the borders of North America from attacks by deadly polar bears. Bears never show up, but a giant mantis does it. It has been frozen in the ice for over a million years or so, until it was released from an earthquake somewhere else in the world (yes, right. For my money, it was released by global warming). It is a huge prehistoric insect and needs a lot of food. Since there are no cows in the frozen north, he decides to feast on the most cow-like creatures he can find up there. I.E., human beings. He starts to attack the radar stations, probably because the hum of the radar antennas has started to get on his nerves. <br /> <br /> Join Col. Joe Parkman, the lively and nice guy from the movie. He's investigating a plane that went down, and he's puzzled that there are no corpses in the wreck. The only thing he finds is one of the Mantis's claws. Apparently he decided to have his nails cut while he was snacking on the plane's crew. Parkman takes the tip of the nail with it to be analyzed by a thousand-year-old scientist. <br /> <br /> The grandfather scientist cannot make the head or the tails of the claw, above all because he misses the naps so his mind is not working too well So he calls a pleased paleontologist interpreted by the boy who was the P.I. to Perry Mason. He and his friend, a photographer in disguise, fly north because he decided that the claw must come from a praying mantis. Just one of the size of a commuter train. <br /> <br /> It is a warm love of Luke at first sight when Col.Parkman looks at the male photographer for the first time. The men of the base, who have obviously been deprived for many years, think they are the most exciting thing since Grandma Clampett is not there. The nice boy of science and the skinny soldier begin to work together to trace the path of the Mantis, which has devastated some footage of an Eskimo village. Comes to the base looking for a snack after dinner, and crushes some economic series quite effectively. Then it flies south and disappears. <br /> <br /> Now the hours of tension come when the core of the civil earth observer is called to sweep the skies in search of anything great that flies overhead. I doubt they would actually have told him that they were looking for a giant flying mantis that ate humans, as this would cause a panic. He was probably told to look for a 727 giant painted green and hummed because his engine was out of tune. <br /> <br /> Col. Parkman gets on a plane to try to shoot the Mantis and destroys the mission. The Mantis lands in New York City, probably because he wanted to see a show on Broadway or visit Sex World in Times Square. The army approaches him at the Tunnel and Parkman and his men wear stupid clothes that they borrowed from the Orkin Man to get in and try to blow up the Mantis. Success! Well, almost, since the Mantis is still spasmodic enough to kill almost the photographer's lady Eve Arden. There is a lukewarm love scene at the end and the paleontologist takes a picture of the dead mantis because Colonel Hair Grease and Mrs. Gender Unspecified are busy doing the smooching. So a kind of nauseating ending.
