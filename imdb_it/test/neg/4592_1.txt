This movie is terrible. A true hockey fan should assume that people who appeared and produced this film have never played or seen a real hockey game. I got this hoping it would be a "movie guy", but the only people who would probably like this movie are women aged 13-17. The hockey scenes are terrible, the defenders play as if they were 5 years old, the Goals dive into a 10-foot wide net, etc. It is difficult to predict the end of this film, though !! For those who have seen it, who would have ever imagined ?? For those who haven't seen it, don't waste time! <br /> <br /> I understood it less than half of the film. To call this film a drama is ridiculous !!
