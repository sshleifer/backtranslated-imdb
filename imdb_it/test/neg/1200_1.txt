<br /> <br /> I still can't believe that Louis Gossett Jr. has agreed to appear in this movie. Everything in this move feels artificial, forced and artificial. Air sequences are flat. Enemy characters look like puppets. This is just an excuse sorry for a movie. At least Top Gun had air sequences that seemed good (the external shots anyway). Queen's songs are nice, though. Instead Midway.
