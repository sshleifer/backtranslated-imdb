"Mame" is a shame for many things - for Lucille Ball, for a story that has been told better many times, and for the musical genre altogether. Miss Ball does not understand her character and seems to be heavily sedated. Bea Arthur is good, but it's not enough. The production is very poor and inexpensive, the songs are sub-par, and almost every joke fails. Furthermore, Lucy could not dance well, so the music had to be slowed to a funerary rhythm. Avoid at all costs, but see the delicious "Aunt Mame".
