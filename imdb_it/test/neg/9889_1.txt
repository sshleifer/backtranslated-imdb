This economically successful film is based on a true story. I don't doubt it. This does not mean that it is particularly interesting (unless you are one of the main characters who lived this experience). A young woman named Angela buys a large, very old, very cheap country house. Well, as we all know watching horror movies, when you buy a large cheap house it usually means that it is infested in some way, shape or form. In fact, the second in which the house is handed over to Angela, the wise boy who lived at home, takes a moment to "introduce" Angela to one of the ghosts! Nice boy, eh? Angela gets in touch with a psychic and a paranormal expert and tells them that her house is haunted and invites them to come and see the ghosts alone. They come to a party and sure enough there are ghosts that go around, sitting on the couch, hanging in the garage and trying to seduce people in the bathroom. Some friends sleep during the night of the party, they see the ghosts and they swear not to come back home. (Looks at the girl who says "I'm so scared, I'm so scared." Totally emotionless If she was so scared because she didn't get up, turn the knob and leave?!) Ghosts don't really do anything threatening except appear (and there is no blur or aura on them. They look just like normal people). They steal the celery from the kitchen, move the chairs around a POLTERGEIST and a bisexual ghost seduces Angela, who, understood, doesn't seem to mind! This scene sounds like the kind of soft-core porn you see on the SPICE channel. (Ummm ... not that I would know! Hahaha). But the actresses are not your typical porn stars. They should hit the beach and the gym more. When Angela does not make love to death, she gets angry with them and remains alone in a room screaming "Why don't you go away?! This is my home! They don't leave. I couldn't help thinking at all the times I heard the psychic Sylvia Brown on TV saying that if you have a ghost in your house you should calmly rationalize with the ghost and say "Look, you're dead. cross over to the other side. In other words, get out! "According to Sylvia Brown, until they are hostile and bad about it, they will leave! It seems that this film has a cost of around $ 50. It has a really cheap look and a bad acting. I could have made this film with 5 friends and one camera.
