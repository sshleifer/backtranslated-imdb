First, I admit I didn't see Vampires: Los Muertos, but I saw the original Vampire movie and I love it. I rented this movie without having heard of it. I didn't expect to be hit. I wasn't. <br /> <br /> I like the idea of ​​moving the action to the Far East, which was supposed to open many new paths for action sequences and plot, but not enough was made of this The scenes fighting and motorcycle pursuits were painfully boring. <br /> <br /> There were some parts that I liked, like the way the assassin team was not shown as heroic good people, since they were in the first movie. <br /> <br /> I've been hoping since I saw the old Hammer Legend Of The 7 Golden Vampires movie a few years ago that someone would one day make another good vampire movie with an Asian base. It wasn't this.
