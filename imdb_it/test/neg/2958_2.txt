The film begins with Ingrid Bergman and her two extravagant servants arriving in New Orleans from Paris. Apparently years before, her mother was caught up in a scandal and Ingrid returned in an attempt to irritate relatives who would soon forget if she or her mother existed. This is because she thinks if they are shocked enough, they will pay her to get rid of her. So, with this money, he will leave New Orleans and look for a millionaire somewhere else, while he acts as a Countess. Along the way, Gary Cooper shows up and looks totally out of place as a love interest. <br /> <br /> It is incredible that this film is not the reason why Ingrid Bergman's film career collapsed: her performance and her character were SO bad! Instead of the classy and demure woman who usually played in movies, she is probably one of the most annoying characters in the film. His fake countess was superficial, demanding, unpredictable and stupidly stupid. How she was able to flush ANY man seemed a mystery, as she seemed less vampire than simple crazy !! I'm not exaggerating in saying that she behaved, at times, like someone with a combination of a serious mental illness and a personality disorder, and all these together make me think "who in the world would fall in love with this mess ?!" . Honestly, I could not bear to observe his histrionic and narcissistic behavior and seemed more like a guest on "The Jerry Springer Show" than a protagonist! Confused, horrible and overcrowded are the words that come to mind when I think of his role. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is, frankly, overwhelmed by Bergman's ranting and hysteria. While Gary Cooper is generally an excellent leading man, he is dominated by her and seems just lost. And, strangely, they launched two strange weirdos as his entourage: Flora Robson and Jerry Austin. Mrs. Robson is best known for her portraits of Queen Elizabeth I, but here, for some strange reason, they covered her with makeup and the end result was very much like the love son of an Indian cigar shop and Aunt Jemima! His face was very wooden, he wore strange eyebrows and dressed like a slave. As for Mr. Austin, he was a dwarf and while this should not be held against him, his role was written as if he were a court jester - a very, very ungrateful role for someone who is "vertically challenged"! Overall, the marked acting, the writing and the ease make this one of the biggest stinkers of the time, almost useless and boring like the famous turkeys like PARNELL and SWING YOUR LADY.
