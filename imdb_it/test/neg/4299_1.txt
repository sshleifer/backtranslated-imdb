I found this movie at the cheap flea market. I was so happy because I thought it was a skateboard movie. I came home, the rules of the previews and the opening scene with the old man rolling down the skateboard on the street was fantastic. At that moment I realized that it was a post-apocalyptic film, but I still had great hopes. This film was terrible. A friend of mine was out of his mind when we looked at him and he also thought it was horrible and a waste of being tall. I kept falling asleep during the film because it was so boring and the music was absolutely horrible. I don't know if during the apocalypse all the good music, and all the music that is just a little crappy is destroyed and all the memories of how to play it are clean but I think I would rather die than endure that shit. Also, what the hell was with the TV studio? I can only assume that this film was adapted from an ancient Greek opera, with the names and the title, but some plays were not meant to be adapted into a futuristic science fiction setting. Or at least not from the people involved in this film. If you are forced to watch this movie, I can only suggest that you carry a handgun and finish before the end. It would be a good movie to kill yourself, everyone will understand why.
