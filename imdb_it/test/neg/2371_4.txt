Leonard Rossiter and Frances de la Tour bring this film, not without difficulty, since the script was evidently rushed by old episodes. When it came out, this must have been a real disappointment, as was also done on the budget of a bus ticket. Attempts to move it from home - which is hopelessly unrecognizable, a bad job from all sides - with a picnic, fantasy sequences, rugby and a boxing match in the local gym simply don't work. Most of these are just character configurations for a not particularly good solitary gag. That said, the interaction of Rossiter and de la Tour (and anyone else with him) is mostly hilarious; they even manage to make a gif work siphon, but you can see the fight by recycling a literally uninspired script that changes the plot halfway. Don Warrington has very little to do except "be black" and, due to random scripts, Christopher Strauli changes character at least twice. And in the end, as he often did in the TV series (even though you might not remember - read the scripts), Eric Chappell leaves you with a "timed out" ending. Were they cynical, or simply too desperate to be in the world of cinema? Rossiter and de la Tour are always fun but, as a film, it's a terrible postscript of a TV series fondly remembered. REST IN PEACE.
