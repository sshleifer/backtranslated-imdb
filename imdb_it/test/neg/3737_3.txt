First of all, I think casting and acting were excellent. The problem is history. There is practically no story here that is worth telling and therefore basically no film here. Larry McMurtry did Lonesome Dove and I can't fault the original, although he probably didn't need sequels. He did Hud with Paul Newman, which is one of my favorite movies. Mellencamp should be a country singer, but the only song I hear is an old song by Buck Owens. The film is a big problem for chicken breeding. The character of Mellencamp has a good wife and it is absolutely stupid of him to walk away from her. The incident with the guide in the sliding cage is absolutely stupid. Maybe people do it for fun in some parts of the country, but I've never heard of it.
