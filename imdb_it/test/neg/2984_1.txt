I just saw this movie last night and I almost cried. No, it wasn't because he left me completely petrified, no. It was absolutely HARD! Sometimes you see films that ask you what will become of the human race in the near future: this film is one of those. It is as if the writer, the actors, the director and others had just joined and copied and pasted the scenes of their favorite horror films, packed together and said "hey, here is Satan's whip !!!" After seeing this film, I couldn't help but be tormented by the sight of people who call themselves "actors"; wandering around as if they were a sort of talented artistic performers ... don't be fooled, they suck! Don't waste time wasting time or money !!!
