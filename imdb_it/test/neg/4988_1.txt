When Underdog made his cartoon debut in 1964, at the age of 7 I was immediately captured. It was Top Dog in my book - (that is, until Batman was previewed on ABC about a year later). Even when it became clear that Disney would make a live-action version of the famous Saturday morning cartoon, it was equally clear to me that it would be a piece of shit. Even reading newspaper reviews seemed to confirm this. However, I decided to: a) never try to write a review unless I saw the film from beginning to end; and b) never spend a red penny on a movie I am almost certain I will hate. <br /> <br /> Thanks to YouTube I: a) I am fully qualified to write this review; and b) it only cost me 84 minutes of my hard money. <br /> <br /> It also shows my point, which is that this film is not just a piece of shit. It's a steaming pile of dog excrement. It looks like the TV series in name only, although they almost did well with Simon and Cad. <br /> <br /> All in all, Underdog is a huge waste of time and money, which fortunately, I didn't do it spend. <br /> <br /> Evaluation: 1/2 * on *****
