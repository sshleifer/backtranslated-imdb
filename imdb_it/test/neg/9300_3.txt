Frank Falenczyk: It's not that I'm sorry I killed them; is that I'm sorry I killed them badly. <br /> <br /> Wow! Talk about a swing and a miss. You have a great cast and a fantastic plot with endless possibilities ... how do you do it ?! Well, apparently John Dahl has found a way. With an atrocious screenplay with amusing jokes like a malaria epidemic and such painfully dry dialogues that makes none of the characters funny, "You Kill Me" could be the biggest film failure of 2007. On a positive note, Ben Kinglsey offers another great performance as the Polish alcoholic killer who tries to be clean but the material he has to work with is crap. Tea Leoni is as good as Luke Wilson, Dennis Farina, Bill Pullman, Philip Baker Hall and the rest of the cast. I imagine the best way to describe 'You Kill Me' is a terrible movie with good performances. Degree: D +
