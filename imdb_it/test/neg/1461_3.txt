When I saw "Race Against Fear" for the first time (don't you like the LMN movie titles?), I had to keep scratching my head. Was this to be serious? Why couldn't the main character even run like a normal running person, much less like a stellar runner? How did I know that the coach was evil only for 1 minute in the movie? All these questions and no answers. Then, I let the inane script and the horrible direction take me away ... it was easier not to resist ... then the movie became more fun by the minute, and now I rate it among my ten junk movies by LMN. Some have said that Ariana Richards is really talented but that the material was defective - I disagree. Not only can he not convince me that he is an athlete, but he walks wide-eyed for the rest of the story, as if he had just landed on earth. Maybe the coach got out of prison and finished it ... at least I hope so.
