This movie is a bunch of shit. It is quite disturbing to see that anyone can say that this is one of the best films of the year. What can I say? Bad acting, bad action scenes that get really funny in the end. Forgive me if this was a comedy, so I didn't understand. If I were, I regret laughing at the tent scenes! Do yourself a favor - go to bed instead of watching this! Good night!
