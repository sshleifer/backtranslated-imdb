Camp Blood looked great when I was buying it, but when I looked at it I was wrong. He is gaudy, acting is outrageous and the quality of the film is shocking. Being a movie buff, I usually find the humor of a tragic horror, but sometimes I couldn't even laugh. Perhaps Camp Blood 2 will be an improvement.
