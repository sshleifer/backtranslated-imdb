This sequel is terrible enough to be honest. I'm a fan of kung-fu movies and this is by far the worst I've ever seen. Bride with White Hair 1 was actually pretty good and this is a big disappointment. BWWH 1 was brilliant in a sense with a nasty bad-ball villain. <br /> <br /> The couple from the first film had a small role in this film. Instead the film revolves around a group of uninteresting characters who seek revenge on their fallen clans. But there is no antagonist in this film, so revenge is silent. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is kung-fu or lack of. They literally argued with a street-style knife. The character eventually refused to fight because the choreography was missing.
