This movie is horrible, I can't even be bothered to write a review on this junk! All I will say is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> And the acting is very bad. The guy who plays the main character really bothers me, has the same expression on his face through the film. I just want to slap him! Basically 80% of the movie is a slow-motion skateboarder movie, weird music, and absolutely sh * t .. <br /> <br /> Apparently I have to write at least 10 lines of text to send this comment, so I'll use some other sentence saying that the protagonist has one of those faces that you just want to slap! <br /> <br /> I give up ... THIS FILM SUCKS !!!!
