This film was recently broadcast by Turner Classic Movies. He may have been considered bold at the time, and may have made money, but even the most uncompromising fan of Jane Russell will have a hard time sitting in the middle of this dreck. <br /> <br /> There are many movie musicals from the 1950s that can stand the test of time, even if dated by current standards, but can still be enjoyed due to good music or dance or a funny plot. "The French Line", however, fails in all these aspects. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter that Russell was a good singer when given vile vocal material. The entire cast is driven by a boring and trivial plot and dialogues. <br /> <br /> It is not even worth recording and jumping only to musical numbers: they are poor.
