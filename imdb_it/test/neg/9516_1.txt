This film was so frustrating to watch. Split screens won't let you be very involved in the actors' emotions. I was constantly going back and forth looking at all these tiny images that I found myself with a sponge stroke at the end. This is basically a rip off of "The Talented Mr. Ripley" and "Timecode". I was very disappointed with this movie that tries to be cool. I wish I had come out like so many other people.
