When Kristy Swanson gets a guilt attack on what she does, she wants to go out. Unfortunately, Madsen is his boss in a company where "giving two weeks notice is not an option". <br /> <br /> As a teenager who kills vampires, Kristy did a great job. The image of the girl from the valley seemed to fit. But as a killer on the run ... well, Kristy keeps running. Run, run away! This film is not a concept that has never been done before, but it was done better! <br /> <br /> I didn't want to see the rest of this film, but I felt I had to, if I wanted to review this film. I have always liked Madsen, and his character was a bit predictable, but this film was definitely a waste of time both to watch and to do ... no wonder it was never released in theaters!
