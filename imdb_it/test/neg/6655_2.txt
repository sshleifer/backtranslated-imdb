They give you the set up then they bore you to death with a constant chase of cat and mouse. The main characters are involved in a constant deadlock in which they threaten each other, every five minutes or less. And I'd like to see the police forces that would allow one of their policemen to break away from the bite of A. Garcia. He's like a local cop who gets Charlie Manson out of jail for a cup of coffee. Come back down to earth!
