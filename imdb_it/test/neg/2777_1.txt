I'm not sure I've ever seen such a bad movie like this. Terrible attitude, plot of the whole place, terrible special effects. There are some "so good and good" moments here, but not enough to maintain interest. The woman who plays Tracey looks horrible. There are some pretty worrying scenes with a dwarf that leave you feeling so slightly violated. The upside is that the operation scenes are pretty fun for special effects, as is the car chase in which a car is "trying to force us to go off the road" without actually making contact. Guess that the budget was not spent on destroying cars. Oh, and what looks like a Taj Mahal postcard is shown every time they cut the imaginary foreign country.
