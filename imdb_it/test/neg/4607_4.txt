An excellent cast who does his best with a horrible script, inept direction and some of the worst scores I've ever heard. More TV movies of the week than a serious drama. Which is sad considering that the source material is very serious and very real. The directors decided that instead of building dramas and characters, it was better to show only the most graphic and violent pieces and hope that the audience was shocked in sympathy and thoughtfulness. In my opinion, one of the most obvious forms of adaptation to the film cuts and glues.
