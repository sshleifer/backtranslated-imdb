When I saw Zoey101 for the first time with my sister, we thought it was a piece of trash. No one is so rich and lives in a dormitory off the Pacific coast. In the show, Zoey is a rich and popular girl who always goes to her for advice. Zoey is always the one with the good idea and everyone agrees with her, no matter how stupid her idea is. It is always perfect in everything, including its perfect figure. And she's such a dietary craze that talks about carbohydrates as she knows what they are. When she sees that her friends are eating chocolate, she sets it up. And another thing that makes me sick is that she always chews a piece of mint every time you look at it. And everyone wants something to do with her, for example in an episode that Logan's boyfriend offered $ 4000 to make her and her friends cheer for everything she does in her pathetic life. And her friend Nicole is a monster too lively that screams a lot. And Lola dresses as Mrs. Houdini. The 80s asked for their matted hair back. He could even shave the hair chase. This show sends a bad message to children around the world to make them think that if they don't have the latest I-Pods and designer clothes they will hate each other. <br /> <br /> This show is a big thumb down. <br /> <br /> We hate you Jamie Lynn, <br /> <br /> My best wishes Ryan and Kara L
