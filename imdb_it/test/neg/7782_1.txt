Don't look any further, this is the worst movie ever made. There may be others that are related, but there are none worse. It can't be. <br /> <br /> I found this film on a sales-sale laserdisc for $ 3.25, and I thought that no movie with those actors could not be worth that price. It turns out that it is worth tripling that - at the very least, I would have had to pay to watch it. <br /> <br /> I am practically certain that the girl in the photo on the cover of the package is not the girl in the film, they have replaced someone else, someone younger and cute, to make it more attractive. Any "plot" there was about three minutes of real movie, the rest is full. And I don't mean the kind of grout you realize is filler when it's over, or that it's a kind of eye candy you don't mind having there, I mean filler that makes you think about your shopping list. I think "music" must have been invented by someone with a friend who had a radio that he listened to once. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> If there was a shot of a beautiful mountain, a river valley, a forest, anything, there would be something positive about this film. There is not. Even with the speeder button on the remote, even at the maximum speed of the laserdisc, you can't get it over quickly enough. <br /> <br /> After years of thinking about film comments, being tempted but not registering with IMDb, I finally broke up, because I had to do my part to push the user score on this skunk as much as possible . <br /> <br /> The guidelines call for "focusing on content and context". I can't. There's not enough content to focus on, and that's exactly my point. Sometimes evil is just ugly, and this film should be much better than what it aspires to be just that.
