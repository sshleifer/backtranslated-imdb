Paul Mazursky is wrong in this film. Writing, directing, casting and acting (except for Victorio Gassman) have no meaning. I remember that the reviews over 20 years ago were mediocre, but I thought it might be worth it. With notables such as Susan Sarandon, Raul Julia (who wins in most of his scenes) and John Cassavetes, I was understandably expecting much more. The music chosen for the film is staggering, the cuts between New York and Greece are confused and the general rhythm leaves much to be desired. Because Paul Mazursky felt the need to update this story, or to add his touch to it is puzzling - this revisiting of Prospero and his daughter takes very little of the import from the game, and adds not much more. However, the drama is not among Shakespeare's best, and even fading seems not to be a good decision. Unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend in this film.
