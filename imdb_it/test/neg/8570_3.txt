The title describes it exactly. This dribbling of a movie was nothing but the typical group of teenagers killed someone by mistake now that someone is persecuting them / killing them 20 years after 'crap that have been pushed down our throats for decades. The only breakthrough is instead of an angry ex-classmate or a psycho-loser, he was a nun. Nun wants to eliminate sin from girls, blah blah, girls accidentally / purposely drown the nun, blah blah, nun persecutes girls, people die, the film ends. The only thing that made this watchable was the scene of death, which was very beautiful (especially the one with the elevator door that tears off this fat lady's arms) but they also failed to make this a fantastic movie. Brian Yuzna should hang his head to attach himself to this refusal. I'm sure glad I rented it and didn't buy it, or I'd be furious beyond belief. If you want a nunsploitation movie to satisfy the senses, go watch Demonia or something. Stay away from this garbage.
