Simply put, skip this movie, it's so bad. In short, this film is about a weapons factory where secret weapons are being developed. Because they do bad things, they are not popular so to speak. A new female managing director intervenes to clarify things and make sure that the company's reputation is improved. It does this by disclosing confidential information to the press to the press ... do you believe it? He also starts firing people he has never seen. Incredible A pacifist group tries to destroy the company's mainframe, because there are plans for those secret weapons. This mainframe is located at the bottom of the building hidden in a sort of vault. Obviously the film would not be complete without the mad scientist and a robot that is the last killer machine, which looks like an Alien from the Alien movies. The mad scientist loves the female CEO. <br /> <br /> The mad scientist orders the robot to kill everyone, and so he protects his work, increases the chain of command and makes the film interesting. The pacifists work with the CEO and another person on the board to escape from the robot. Later, they agree to blow up this evil mainframe computer, avoiding the robot. They also find that the factory was developing a part-man, a small soldier in part. They can erase a memory of people and replace it with that of a veteran soldier. One of the pacifists is turned into such a soldier and he hunts the killer robot. I imagine the mad scientist also wrote the script for this film. This super soldier looks and acts very much like Robocop, even if it's not so funny. <br /> <br /> It comes down to this. People run, they are chased by a killer robot, they are injured, but they do not seem upset by this, besides limping a little, and of course the female CEO is the protagonist of this film, and he cannot be killed, that is he survives every attack, explosion, you call it. I won't bother you for the chase, we jump to the end. They have a lot of weapons, yes, even the pacifist and they know how to use them. When they are on the roof of the building, empty all the weapons on the killer robot. They enter an elevator that is used to clean external windows. And then the female CEO also knows some magic, on the roof she complained about being out of bullets, and like magic the gun is reloaded. This way he can shoot the cables and let the elevator fall 70 stories or so, and let it stop right above the surface of the ground by pulling the brake. And to top it all off, the police are waiting there for them. The robot jumps after them and kills the cops. Hilarious isn't it? The robot chases them in the vault where the mainframe is and when the robot is finally so close to her, that it can touch / kill it, it stops. Because the mad scientist didn't want her killed. A better name for this boy would be the idiot scientist. Even if it is he who made this film watchable. At that moment I was already looking for the killer robot to finish them all, so the movie would be over. <br /> <br /> I can't believe this movie has such a high price, and that's why I wrote this comment. Avoid this movie like the plague. He's a monster, and I'm not talking about the Death Machine.
