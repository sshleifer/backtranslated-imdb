I've read comments on IMDb for some time. An average of 8.3 for this film drives me crazy. I don't intend to pull one of those "I just signed up for an account so I can post on this movie" bit ..... but, I just did it. The only issue with which you will come out of this film is that incest does not deserve to be ridiculed. <br /> <br /> Now, I realize that many people in the 'hoity-toity' movie love this movie; however, it is crap. The thing that REALLY comes to me is the fact that the director expects you to like the "bad guy" in the film. If you have sex with your sister, you should probably be an outcast from society. Only my personal feelings I believe. Still, I spent 2 hours of this * curse * expecting some very deep reasoning behind the Dae-Soo prison. <br /> <br /> I really like foreign films, but this is my first encounter with a Korean film and put them last in my book. Oh ... I feel better after a little ventilation.
