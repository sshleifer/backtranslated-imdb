I couldn't believe how bad this film was, and believe me, I didn't expect a masterpiece from a bespoke film. I only recorded it because I liked Jane Seymour. I've seen her enough to know she's definitely an established actress, so I don't know what happened here. The characters were superficial, the dialogues were drawn up, the acting was bad, and yes that includes Seymour. It was nice to see her play against the guy, but not in something so bad. I noticed that he had a credit for the executive producer, so he can't escape the blame for the pure malice of this movie. And oh yes, they had Barry Bostwick playing the male lead. Nuff said.
