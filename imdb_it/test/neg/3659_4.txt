Maybe I saw a cleaned up version, but apart from a few flashes of breast, I'm not sure what they are referring to these other commentators. <br /> <br /> All in all it is not as bad as I expected from previous comments, even if in the end you ask yourself ... WTF? It was dark, but not so much that you couldn't make out the scenes, and I think it only added to the strangeness and terror of the situation. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film could have been better, but the acting was pretty decent. <br /> <br /> All in all a decidedly gruesome (and yes, brutal) film with a disappointing ending.
