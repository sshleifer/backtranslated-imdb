"Love and Human Remains" is one of those clearly dramatized, obviously played, obviously scenic gestures, which is so obvious that the speed of escape from its devices and manufacturing is beyond me. It is not worth being explained, this amateur film tries to cram every intelligent line, every misanthropic nuance, every particular sexual predilection in a film with an absence of concern in making the pieces fit. In short, sensationalistic disgust without the feeling ... that practically leaves only crap.
