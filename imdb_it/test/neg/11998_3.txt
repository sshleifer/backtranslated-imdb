Wow ... I suspected this was bad ... But now I find myself at a loss for words ... Honestly, no word of mine can do justice to this movie ... <br /> <br /> I will try to say something anyway ... <br /> <br /> This is truly a unique gem. One of the worst kind. <br /> <br /> Lash La Rue - having seen his past as an actor - fighting a whip with a Toltec zombie-sorcerer during the climax of the film ... ??? A real stroke of genius, no doubt. <br /> <br /> It is rare to laugh loudly when watching a movie alone. It has happened many times with this. <br /> <br /> The accents of the actors, the man, the accents ... And the dialogues I heard them speak ... And the acting itself ... I could not believe what I was listening to. <br /> <br /> That fat uncle who runs so hard (when he walks home with his grandson) for no apparent reason ... <br /> <br /> boobs! Yes, there are tits! And female ass! There's even a naked girl in a tub sipping a beer ... <br /> <br /> That "extends her mouth to her face" - killing was the bomb! A real highlight. <br /> <br /> The aspects of the comedy were absolutely thrilling. I couldn't believe what I was seeing and listening to. For a while I even thought they weren't intentional, shaking their heads in disbelief. But about halfway through the film, I started getting the bigger picture. I suppose it took me half a film to silence half of my brain, for finally taking it. <br /> <br /> I really had trouble believing this movie ... But it's nice, really, I think. He had a black chick approaching a very small closet, opening it and saying "Wooow, look at all the storage space!" And she said it like she meant. I mean, this is good dialogue and good acting, isn't it? <br /> <br /> Oh, and maybe needless to say: Lash La Rue's skillful whips suck their biggest ass in THE DARK POWER. It's really sad and pathetic to look at. This is all part of the comedy, of course. Or wait, I could be wrong. No, yes, I was wrong. Lash La Rue was fantastic with the whip! It was the editor's fault. He messed it up, cutting his eyelashes together and all the rest. Or wait, it may have been the camera operator. He filmed from wrong angles ... So why didn't Phil Smoot say anything? It's all, it's the director's fault. <br /> <br /> But it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> I'm going to stop talking about it. I don't have anything significant to say anyway, except that I hope my brain recovers from this experience ... soon.
