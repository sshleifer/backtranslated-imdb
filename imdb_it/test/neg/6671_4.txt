Was the last protagonist of Norman Wisdom a departure from his previous releases? bringing us up-to-date its accident price, this is a Swinging Sixties product! The end result is an uncomfortable and occasionally embarrassing comedy that mixes the typical slapstick (and sentimentality) of the star with a mild sexuality and even a milder satire; the plot has to do with a travel executive for a banking conference that falls for teen Sally Geeson (who doesn't mind being involved with him but doesn't even take their relationship seriously); Sarah Atkinson appears as Geeson's friend who warns Norman of his fickle character. <br /> <br /> The film is nowhere near as bad as Leonard Maltin's BOMB assessment and, if anything, is interesting for his mid-life treatment (being in many ways similar to Hoffman [1970] and 10 [1979] both, among other things, I have just seen); towards the end, Norman even tries to bring his wife to her new way of thinking! The Pretty Things appears as if performing a series of good tracks in a nightclub and Norm himself sings the catchy title track!
