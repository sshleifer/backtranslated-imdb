Other than rock rock and that show where the child dies eating a spoiled hamburger he found under the bed, this was always the worst and most stupid show to survive in the early evening. Were it not for the unjustifiable success in Jason Lee's film, this show would never have come out of its conception had it been presented as a relatively unknown protagonist. <br /> <br /> The concept is TERRIBLE. Moron redneck hick spends his lottery winnings to redeem himself with the white trash of his past. It is funny? periodically but not constantly. Is it stupid? Every single episode. <br /> <br /> I have seen many great shows come before their time, yet this mistake has survived longer than I could have ever imagined. The dialogue is incredibly funny as the themes of the episodes are. Each episode for someone with an IQ above 100 is an absolute struggle. And the icing on the cake? The annoying voice of Jason Lee that tells every episode. If it were not for the southern culture and the rednecks of the southern state, this show would not have an audience. <br /> <br /> If you are a moron and need a show completely devoid of humor but overflowing with bad taste, wrong dialogues and stupid characters, they cannot succeed in life ... well then you are probably an actor in this show.
