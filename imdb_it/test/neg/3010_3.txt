A professional production with quality actors who simply never touched the heart or the funny bone, no matter how hard they tried. The quality cast, the stiff setting and the excellent cinemography made you hope for Fargo or Drifter of the High Plains, but I'm sorry, the soup had no seasoning ... or meat for that matter. A 3 (of 10) for effort.
