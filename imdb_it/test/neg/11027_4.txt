Carole Lombard and James Stewart try to inject some life and meaning into this bizarre movie built on the tribulations of a newlywed couple. The scenes play as if they were divided between various directors, each with a different objective. Some are cute goat, some crazy, some melodramatic and some surprisingly noir. There is also an extended adventure sequence, when the plot suddenly concentrates on a small plane flying through a snowstorm. It is difficult to say which scenes are the most incongruous, when the film as a whole has such an irregular tone and the plot is not exactly credible. It is worth looking only for film students or fans of actors - some smaller parts, like Judge Doolittle and the intrepid pilot, are also very well played.
