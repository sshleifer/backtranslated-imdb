Eaten Alive acts like a bad test for the Cannibal Ferox the following year. The characters are universally bland, the places are underused criminally, there is no attempt to create tension or suspense, the physical effects are either ridiculous or shameless stolen from other films, and the ubiquitous tribal rape scenes are barely worth PG- 13. Even the "cruelty" scenes of animals are more boring than usual. The only slightly shocking scene involves the mad Jonas, who does a little Goldfinger, wielding a blood-soaked dildo; a scene that is simply bizarre rather than graphic. My beloved wife, she of the "Romeo and Juliet Collector's Edition", watched this movie without even a hint of disgust! And he calls himself a Cannibal movie! Overall, a rather lame effort that completely betrays the Cannibal tradition. Cannibal Ferox, the sequel to Luci, is a far superior example of this kind.
