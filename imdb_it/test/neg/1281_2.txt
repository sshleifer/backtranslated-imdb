Why did they change the lovely Rugrats television program that we all know and love in a lame attempt to hit teenagers? They don't have to do it. All ages watch the normal Rugrats. When I heard about it, I thought, "Hey, they did a TV series on the movie, except they're really great as teenagers!" Will be better. "When I saw it, it was like we were watching As Told By Ginger, except they sucked. Great job. <br /> <br /> When did Rugrats become a director in the series? Never. Basically all the episodes of this "Attempted series are about Tommy's love of directing. I don't like it. I prefer to look at the storylines that change every episode. It's not the same thing over and over again. Besides, when in the old series every character has their own story sides?" "Never. This series did it. I didn't like everyone getting separated. I don't want to see the Angelica part of the story. I hate it. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this show if you like As Told By Ginger and Rugrats.
