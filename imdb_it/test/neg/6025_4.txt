Since the characters start with "unknown" identities, they are not identified by name, so start with the handsome James Caviezel waking up in a warehouse. He finds out that the place is locked. Don't ask - windows are made with safety glass, and it's impossible to get out. Four other waking men make it a quintet - Mr. Caviezel in his "Jean Jacket", Barry Pepper in a "Ranger Shirt", Greg Kinnear with "Broken Nose", Joe Pantoliano as a "Bound Man" chair, and Jeremy Sisto shot and "Man handcuffed". Oh God?? <br /> <br /> These five men have a collective amnesia. They think three of them are kidnappers, and two are victims - but, they don't know who is who or who is who. Forgetting is due to a loss of tube. Don't ask - it happens. Meanwhile, outside, principal lawyer David Selby (like Parker) sends his cops to solve the kidnapping while one of the men's wives, Bridget Moynahan (like Eliza Coles), frantically waits. But the head of the criminal gang, Peter Stormare in "Snakeskin Boots", is on his way. <br /> <br /> As the synopsis of the DVD says, "While secrets are revealed and clues revealed, the five men must race against time to understand who is good and who is evil to stay alive" . This story reads much better than it looks on the film, unfortunately. When secrets are finally revealed and memories become clear, there is no longer much interest in what happened. Simply, the director Simon Brand has a great premise with the idea of ​​Matthew Waynee, but the investments in the characters that hold the shorter part of the stick are cumbersome. <br /> <br /> **** Unknown (11/1/06) Simon Brand ~ James Caviezel, Barry Pepper, Greg Kinnear, David Selby
