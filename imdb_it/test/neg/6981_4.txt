This film has wasted 2 hours of my time and makes me want to shout: "LAME". Nicholas Stoller writes the movie "Yes Man", but directs "this" perhaps he should just write. <br /> <br /> I'm so disappointed because I've heard all the fantastic review. I was expecting something like knocked out. Do they say it comes from the "Knocked up" producer? why can't I see the resemblance? but this seemed to me a kind of superficial film, exaggerated for me. I'm so disappointed. It's actually not bad if you consider it as your average chick movie, but that "band guy" character gets on my nerves <br /> <br /> Maybe I wasn't paying enough attention to the movie, but yes, they have some lines and funny scenes, but I didn't feel the originality. And the ending makes the movie a little better. At least the ending is not a boring clich√©.
