I looked at it with great trepidation, and my trepidation was well founded, it seems. What was this film about? Knight? Season? The players? What? It was all the time all the time. He had no tension (sorry, we all knew that Bobby was going to curse and throw things away), but Brian Denehy, a good actor, runs into rage and zero tension. Economic shot, like a MacGiver episode. In contrast to this main Thanksgiving course with the work that HBO did on Don King's film "only in America" ​​to show how to make sports bio-disks, warts and everything. Notice that ESPN promoted hell and never showed it again.
