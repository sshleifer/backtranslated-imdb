Look, some movies are worse than ever. I suggest it could be India Song. When I saw the film in 1976 he played at the Carnegie Hall Cinema, a place frequented by people who love cinema. From about halfway through, people were simply leaving the theater. My girlfriend wouldn't let us go, but in the end the theater was practically empty. I kept telling people that he was leaving "the good part is yet to come". And it was. The best part was the screen at the end that said "fin". It was the only good part. I'm still bothered by this movie 24 years later. It was useless, stupid and derivative (Marienbad, part 2). Look at it only if you want to spend two endless hours learning to distinguish between simply bad and simply horrible.
