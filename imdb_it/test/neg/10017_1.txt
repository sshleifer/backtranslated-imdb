The New York family is the last of their neighborhood to have a television, which almost ruins David Niven's marriage with Mitzi Gaynor. Chamber comedy that rarely ventures into the bedroom (and nothing sexy happens there anyway). Gaynor as an actress has a much wider range than an oven - she turns on, turns off. The only compensation for Film is the supporting performance of Patty Duke, pre- "Miracle Worker", as Niven's daughter. It's delicious; "Happy Anniversary" is not. * from ****
