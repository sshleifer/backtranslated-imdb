'Carolina Moon' is a bespoke film for a girl with psychic powers who returns to the city where she grew up and where her best childhood friend was killed. It turns out that every year on the same date another girl <br /> <br /> is killed and Tori, played by Claire Forlani, has to solve the mystery before it ends dead. Claire Forlani (Meet Joe Black, CSI New York) is the female lead and does a great job, ably supported by the delightful Oliver Hudsom and a still luminous Jacqueline Bisset. The script, adapted from a novel by Nora Roberts, is bog standard and the plot <br /> <br /> is boringly predictable. This, however, is compensated again by, as I said, the lovely Oliver Hudson.
