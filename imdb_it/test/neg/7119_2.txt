My best guess is that this work will be released on DVD sometime before Christmas. <br /> <br /> This film was terrible. The time line jumps everywhere. This wouldn't be so bad if it left some suspense for the end. It was completely predictable. The bitch girls let themselves escape, the outcasts want to know why they hate her so much, the bitches die of a terrible death, the marginalized girl returns home and looks crazy. A marginalized girl brings evil spirits with her, drives neighbors mad and kills each other. Creepy child understands what's going on. Oh, and the younger sister is not good enough for Mommie, a sick mother who sends her youngest daughter to take the golden child home. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there have been some good moments here and there. First of all, the character of Sarah Michelle Geller dies in the first minutes. More positive. I didn't see it coming. I didn't expect his wife to pour bacon fat on her husband's head. If the movie had kept that kind of chills, I would have loved it. The beginning showed many promises. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed because I liked the first one. It blew me up, I didn't expect most of what happened, and even though I questioned some of the movies, it was still a fun watch. I didn't see any preview for this sequel, because I wanted to be surprised. I was, but in the wrong direction.
