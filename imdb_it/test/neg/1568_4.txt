George and Mildred is a really funny little movie. This attempt to translate the hit TV series to the big screen was a sad failure, as often happens. <br /> <br /> The witty and intelligent one-liners of TV shows have disappeared. The plot is a typical English farce of confused characters and mistaken identities, which is neither funny enough nor bizarre enough to elicit many decent laughs. <br /> <br /> George and Mildred fans may want to see this final episode of the couple's release (Mildred died of hepatitis before the film was released), but others should invest their time more wise.
