Totally amusing "jokes" that fall flat, amateur acting (with one or two exceptions), boring characters and dialogues that, at best, are mediocre. After seeing this movie, one has to wonder why a producer could come across a project like this and think, "I MUST make this film." No wonder it wasn't possible to get a film version.
