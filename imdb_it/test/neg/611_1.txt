I am very diplomatic in my reviews and, as an academic writer, I try to give a creative license to television authors who try to explain a true story. This story, on Karen Carpenter, may have helped so many, but because of directing and editing, no. <br /> <br /> The story, in this case, is not completely addressed, unless you read psychological magazines. While Cynthia Gibb portrays a realistic Karen, it is sad that so much has been changed ... Louise Fletcher portrays her mother and does an excellent job, with limited materials and dialogue. In this case, I give the actors the merit of surviving this project. <br /> <br /> Why is the public not allowed to see the causal factors? .... The American public is quite experienced and, if it has a cable, usually polite. <br /> <br /> I sincerely feel that I could have written a better story, I would not have changed the truth and allowed the actors to project reality. <br /> <br /> Richard Carpenter, as director, has seriously underestimated and insulted the American public. Karen's story is important, and it's sad that we will never hear it.
