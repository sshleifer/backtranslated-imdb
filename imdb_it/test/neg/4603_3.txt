I waited a long time to see this movie. IFC finally ran it one night. I thought it would be something like "Barfly" by Barbet Schroeder. Mistaken. This film does not recreate that underground world of chintzy bars, dirty, full of smoke, full of characters you associate with its stories. He also fails to capture the attitude of Bukowski that Mickey Rourke did so well in the film mentioned above. That natural asshole attitude. Charles Bukowski fans will enjoy seeing the scenes of his books on the screen, but those unfamiliar with his books may have the wrong impression about his work. This movie looks like just another "movie of the week" about a drunk and his relationships. If you want to get a better idea of ​​the world of Charles Bukowski look at "Barfly".
