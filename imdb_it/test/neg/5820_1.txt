Thank God this was not renewed by ITV. <br /> <br /> This series, although popular (God knows why) has a very simple look: "Look I found another body behind the flowers / bushes / trees / wherever they are working - for the sixteenth time the plot of this series. The dialogue is so simple that it is as if it were written for children - talking to the viewer and explaining every point of the plot. <br /> <br /> Simply "happens" to be around when someone does something out from the ordinary - and no one notices them. <br /> <br /> Whenever they examine and investigate someone's murder, they put themselves in the middle of everyone else - ruining everyone's life - including the completely innocent ones. < br /> <br /> They break and enter people's homes, stealing objects and evidence (including firearms) by being nosy and entering people's lives, spying on them and going through their things. they are never captured or arrested (and if they do they can make their way, anc he if another character who does the same is put in prison !!! <br /> <br /> They are always come on trumps. Now I know this is an easy series, but I think that realistically this should not have gone beyond the first few episodes! Put simply, it's unrealistic. <br /> <br /> I think they found enough bodies in the undergrowth both here and on the continent (where I am every two weeks), so I hope it never returns. <br /> ITV should get some action on screen instead of all the humdrum years - "someone was murdered at the village fair - again".
