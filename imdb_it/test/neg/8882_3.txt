With a title like that, you'll be forgiven for thinking this movie is about the great painter, Goya. Then after half an hour you decide that it's more about the Roman Catholic Inquisition. With even more latitude, maybe it's just a snapshot of the period. With his terrifying characterization, too many axes to grind and little consideration for the fact, Milos Forman prepares a colorful but fake mixture of melee that fails on all three accounts. <br /> <br /> Milos Forman (who lost his Jewish father in the Nazi concentration camps), is the great director who painted the artist Mozart as a fool and fared well. He has won awards for this, in fact. His life in Czechoslovakia gave him a taste of different and repellent regimes, especially communism. He also did the same over-the-top but rather impressive, Someone flew over the cuckoo's nest. So, at 74, how does he come to offer us this mess? In Goya's Ghosts, Goya is a step removed from the fool. The main character is his brother Lorenzo, played with passion by Javier Bardem. Natalie Portman is just as lively as Goya's model Ines (and later in the film, her daughter). The tenuous connection with Goya is that he happens to paint both of them. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo tortures (and then rapes) Ines, who suspects he is Jewish. His father tortures Lorenzo. Napoleon rushes to free Spain (briefly). Ines leaves the dungeon where the Church left her and looks for her son. Goya is still painting but has become deaf. His main concern seems to be to help Ines. And so on. <br /> <br /> Historically, Goya was also a historian. How had Forman sadly abandoned the idea of ​​a biographical film by Goya the painter, could this fact be used to pull together the whole film? a great slice of history seen by Goya. But the painter is too tangential to receive any weight. Similarly, should a document of the terrors of the Inquisition be made ?? compared to other despotic orders over time, the Holy See was barely forgiven with a confession. Although one might wonder if Forman is competent enough to trust a factual account of anything. <br /> <br /> "I thought this could be the heart of a wonderful story," he says in the production notes. "There were many parallels between the communist society in which we lived and the Spanish inquisition." But the story is too tenuous to get our attention. Against our expectations and with a background of something important (the life of a great painter, the horrors of the Inquisition and even the French Revolution), we are instead asked to feel involved in an infatuated (if kind) infatuation of Goya. The result is that we feel cheated. <br /> <br /> The details in the background are scary. Goya became deaf in 1792 (when the film begins), not 15 years later. Napoleon is credible as a clipping of a package of cereals. We see the Church issue a death sentence (when the normal procedure called for the Church to insist that the secular arm do that dirty work). The battles seem too choreographed and theatrical. A piece of free naked breasts cannot compensate. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, production values ​​are mostly good. The colors are lively, the rhythm excellent (at least until we give up on finding some useful plot.) Bardem is excellent, and Portman is a joy until he goes into overdrive like crazy. Although he doesn't say much about Goya, what he says is nice, even if superficial and rather irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I once had a drunken conversation late at night, where my friends and I asked ourselves, if I could choose a director to paint your life, who would it be? On his record, Forman should unfortunately be at the bottom of my list.
