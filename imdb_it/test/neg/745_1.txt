The filmmakers were clearly under the influence of the drug. This is the only explanation I have. How else do you explain this parody of a Jane Austen adaptation? Northanger Abbey is a parody of a gothic novel. But this film was made as if it were a gothic novel. The bizarre music and dreamlike sequences suggest drug-induced hallucinations rather than a naive, innocent girl with an overactive imagination, like Catherine of the novel is ... <br /> <br /> The actress who plays Catherine stands around with eyes wide open all the time. Peter Firth seems to be at least 10 years old to play Henry and he actually seemed a bit gay. I don't see the attraction between him and Catherine. The representation of John Thorpe was rather strange but Isabella was not so bad. But nothing could save this PIECE OF CRAP movie! Another thing: this film invents a character not in the book, a French friend of General Tilney, "La marchesa". Because exactly they added it is beyond me. They had to be drugs. He looks scary beyond imagination, with a white foundation, red lips and black lines painted randomly on his face (dimples?). <br /> <br /> You would think that at least it would be fun in a "so bad is good" quality but unfortunately it isn't. It's just BAD.
