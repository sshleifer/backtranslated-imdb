I'm sorry, fan ELO, but I was disappointed with this concert at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. It's decent music, but the presentation is simply boring, a great moment. Most of the songs sound the same and singer-writer Jeff Lynne is as animated as a shop dummy. He has a pleasant voice, but doesn't have much to look at. He stops at one point and sings for an hour and 40 minutes. The songs all look like bubblegum stuff from the 70s and 80s: pleasant but not exciting. <br /> <br /> Lynn is accompanied by a very pretty woman, Rosie Vela, but she isn't too animated either. The only song - on 23 - that creates excitement is the last one: "Roll Over Beethoven". Now, if only some of the other 22 songs had that excitement for them, this could have been a much better DVD for concerts.
