A really bad film, with very few good moments or qualities. <br /> <br /> Start with the pregnant Linda Blair, who runs down a corridor to escape from what could be a monster or a person with pitchforks, I'm not sure. Jump through a window and wake up, and we see that she is very pregnant. The degree to which she is pregnant varies a lot in the film. <br /> <br /> She is an annoying and possibly retarded kid who I thought was her son going to an abandoned hotel on an island. Italian horror directors find the most irritating kids to put in their films! On the island there are already David Hasselhoff and his German-speaking virgin girl (you know how it is said that the Germans love Hasselhoff ...). He's taking pictures, and he's translating a German esoteric book on witches, I think. <br /> <br /> Even traveling around the island are an elderly couple who bought it, and a real estate agent, and a woman I thought was their daughter. Evidently he was an architect, and Linda Blair and the boy are the children of the older couple. I guess they all traveled together on the island, but it really seemed like Linda and the boy were separated from the rest of them (maybe they were filmed separately). <br /> <br /> The hotel looks clean, certainly from the exterior, but is not used to great effects. An old woman with bad makeup and a black cloak continues to appear to the boy and occasionally sings something in German, which he records on his tape recorder at Sesame Street. <br /> <br /> People begin to be killed, either in their dreams or sucked into hell or something. Some of these gore scenes are OK, but not enough to recommend the film. Although the copy I saw stated that it is not cut on the cover, the death of a character whose veins explode seems to have been cut. Most of the scene shows the reaction shots of another character, since we see nothing of ourselves. The most disturbing scene is one in which a man or a demon with a mouth wound that looks really untidy rapes someone. He seemed particularly bad. There is a ridiculously and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is possessed. I wish that if a horror film were to launch it, they would do something original with her role, and let her leave the exorcist behind her (except for the annual horror conventions). <br /> <br /> In the strangeness, largely Italian, tradition of affirmation of being the sequel to something to which it is not related, this is also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2. That is, it is supposed to be a sequel of Casa 3 - Ghosthouse, La (1988) - it is not (which is also a better film than this). House 1 and two were The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead II (1987) - still unrelated to Witchery and La Casa 3 (and much better than those). There is also a Casa 5, La (1990) AKA House 5, which seems to be the sequel to the fake La Casa series and the House: House series (1986) House II: The Second Story (1987), The Horror Show ( 1989) AKA House III, and House IV (1992). How's the Horror Show going? In fact, he claimed to be a sequel, so he requires the true set of voices to renumber himself to cause less (or more?) Confusion. Strangely, The Horror Show is also AKA Horror House, and The House 5 is also AKA Horror House 2. Does your head hurt?
