Pumpkinhead itself was a decent 80s horror movie. No classic in any way, but a fun piece of hair. Because then, we have now been treated to a fourth film in this franchise is beyond me. As in the previous sequels, there is nothing here to really connect the movies except the monster, the witch and Ed Harley (Lance Henriksen). This time we follow the feud between Hatfields and McCoys. Part of the film is a love story of Romeo and Juliet as a young McCoy and his Hatfield lover decides to run away to be together. Soon, however, they are torn to pieces and the boy's sister is killed. The boy escapes into the woods and brings the witch to revive Pumpkinhead for revenge. Acting is at most passable, at worst. The titular demon does not show itself even for almost forty minutes and when it does it is a pale comparison between this and the original design. Overall, Blood Feud fails to impress. It may be worth looking at once, but it certainly isn't an addition to the collection.
