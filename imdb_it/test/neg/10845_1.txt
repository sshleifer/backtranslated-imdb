I rented this movie for about $ 1.50 - the most complete waste of money (and time) I've ever spent. IT'S LAME! I couldn't believe how they could come up with something similar. <br /> <br /> The plot ... there is no plot. Everything you would expect to happen, it does, only in a worse way. The acting was horrible. My dog ​​could have done better. The special effects have no effect - except that they induce complete disbelief. And the cheese lines ... I mean, why bother? <br /> <br /> The only credit I can give to this piece of sh * t are the opening scenes. In reality they were pretty nice. And one of the reasons why I decided to rent this. The graphic shown here is probably the best and most realistic CG of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Total Reality gets 1 out of 10 for not being able to score it lower.
