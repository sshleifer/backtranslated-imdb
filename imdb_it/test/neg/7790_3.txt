I once had a conversation with my parents who told me that British cinema goers in the 1940s and 50s would check to see the country of origin of a film before going to see it. No matter what the plot was or who was in it, if it were an American movie people would like to see it and if it were a British people they wouldn't want to see it. It might seem like a ridiculous generalization, but after seeing THE STITCHED HEART I can understand why people in those days preferred American cinema to the variety grown in the 1940s <br /> <br /> British equity lacked members of the working class and show in this film. Everyone speaks in a high class English accent that makes the British Royal Family look like a working class scum and what it does is foreign to a great deal of potential British audiences who would no doubt prefer to watch Jimmy Cagney in WHITE HEAT because People would had, if not related to it, surely an empathy with a violent gangster in film terms more than some high-class English shrink in 1949. This is entertainment, the reason people go to theaters. Even the names of the characters seem bizarre: Leonora! How many Englishmen were called Leonora in 1949? And the protagonists drink cocktails. And they use words like "Austere". You have the feeling that this was not commercialized for a traditional British audience in 1949. But why should it happen if most British cinema goers were queuing up in cinemas to watch American imports much more enjoyable? <br /> <br /> Looking at THE PASSIONATE HEART in 2005, I was amazed at how dated everything was, so it's actually so dated that I thought it might be a parody of THE HARRY ENDFIELD SHOW. What did not surprise me was that these types of films have come close to sinking the British film industry, an industry that has not taken root until American money has invested in spectators like ZULU, ALFIE and films of James Bond
