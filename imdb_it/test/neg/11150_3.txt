To summarize, skip the End of Days and look at the novel Roman Polanski's Ninth Gate. This film is the perfect American stereotyped movie against the Ninth Gate which is the perfect stereotyped European film. <br /> <br /> Ninth Gate: Noir-ish, intelligent, well engraved, evocative, excellent acting (Johnny Depp, esp), beautiful scenery, good cinematography, funny jokes, vulgar intellectual language, minimal, stimulating. The only flaw is that some people did not understand the final indefinitely and said that the film was "lousy" for this and there were a couple of questionable scenes. <br /> <br /> End of days: Too violent and liberal use of vulgar language, NO musical compendium except a poor attempt at a commercial soundtrack that was only heard when Gabriel Byrne wandered around New York as Satan ( but all that could be grasped was the unintelligible scream of Jonathan Davis of Korn), sex that had nothing to do with the plot, the violence, the incredibly predictable violence and I mentioned a lot more violence? I guess some of the special effects were good but it's all right. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe I'm wrong, but I thought the Ninth Gate was much more interesting, bizarre, original and intelligent. But maybe Americans don't need it. * dripping with cynicism * Even though I'm American, I sometimes wonder.
