... a good script or director could not fix. <br /> <br /> The original 'Poseidon Adventure' was a story of human courage that triumphed against terrifying adversity and personal tragedy. The survivors were led by a charismatic figure of great spiritual strength who took whatever God had thrown at him. <br /> <br /> The follow-up tries to recreate the mix but fails through a script and pedestrian direction. Irwin Allen may have been a great producer of successful films, and he did a great job directing the action scenes in 'Towering Hell', but he can't bring any human depth to his characters. If the characters are not credible, even the danger they face falls flat. <br /> <br /> The script also tries to copy the original too clearly. So we have Peter Boyle doing the Ernest Borgnine thing being hard and hateful (but he has a tender heart); Karl Malden is the moderating influence of the red buttons (and is terminally ill for good measure); Slim Pickens does the comic relief for Shelley Winters, and so on. <br /> <br /> To make the story more contemporary we have an outlawed arms dealer ready to whip the plutonium by arms to the highest bidder. A really nasty job that ruthlessly abandons the wounded (the actors who play his henchmen have allegedly been paid for as extras because they don't seem to have lines) and have a woman hit in the back - that's all! Thankfully, the French rescuers made the hole in Poseidon's hull twice larger than 1972 (and on the other side of the propeller shaft) so that he could get his goods out. And while we're on the subject, how did they get the boxes * for * the ... oh, forget it. <br /> <br /> I actually paid good money to see him when he was released. Given the film's current reputation, this may sound strange, but it has actually gotten quite mixed reviews at the time. Some said it was rubbish, some said it was as exciting as the original. No matter, nobody can be right all the time.
