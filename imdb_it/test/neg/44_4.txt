A rather lame teen slasher from Brisbane. While the plot depends on a fairly decent idea, the writing is profoundly lame and two of the three main boys are absurdly made of wood. The problem is that for children to carry out their plan they must be far more reckless than those shown, but if they were that rude, it might be difficult for them to be nice, so they end up being neither really. In fact, I only started enjoying the movie when I started to want death. One of those films where the most sensible option in a thousand places would be to call the police. I realize we wouldn't have a movie if they did, but it would be nice if we could believe that they really wouldn't. To avoid.
