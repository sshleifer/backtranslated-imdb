This was not a good movie. Poorly scripted and acted - the concept was not new, poor effects and not a showcase for Arnold Vosloo who is really a half-decent actor. I saw him under some protests and I just remembered seeing him before until the end - that's how you can forget. The acting seemed to consist of a number of reflections and looks devoid of any sincerity. I kept expecting this to really go on and in a short time I was just hoping it would end. As for the medical tips - well, I didn't expect a true version of the ER events, but this was simply comical - I'm a Dr so I know what I'm considering - and the operating parts were just silly. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your precious time - unless you have absolutely nothing else to do - go out, call a missing friend, look at the dry paint, fix the design of the sock, do some housework . AVOID at your own risk.
