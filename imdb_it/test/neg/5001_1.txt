I'm not sure what the attraction of this film is, but I couldn't find it. It's a really long conversation, barely credible, barely lucid between three guys on a set. <br /> <br /> It doesn't move anywhere, the characters are just totally bizarre, the plot underlying just as much. It's lost on me, definitely a release film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that prevents you from going out is the possibility, never realized, that may have some sort of meaningful point or climax, and the fact that, all the irritations apart from the trivial personalities, they behave fairly reasonably. But you must prepare yourself for an endless dialogue, hoping on many occasions that Teach interrupts the% * and * for a moment.
