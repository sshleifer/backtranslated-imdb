"Not to be confused with the 1943 George Zucco movie" The Mad Ghoul "," The Mad Monster "is a film that Zucco appeared in the previous year. In this quite picturesque relationship, Zucco perfects a way to transform his terrible handyman, Petro, in a hybrid wolf / man by means of injections of wolf blood, and then wastes little time in sending the transformed doofus to kill the former colleagues who had mocked his experiments. , and a very low budget production.Glenn Strange, who plays the wolf / man here, would soon reach a greater fame by playing Franky's monster in films like "House of Frankenstein" (1944) and "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein" ( 1948. The makeup work on him here is quite lame, and he only manages to make him look like a hippy with bad teeth (like that of "Teenage Monster" in 1957). The sets in this film are also quite non-existent and the conclusion is b rusca and unconvincing. I gave the film a very generous 4-star, partly because I have a lasting love for the horror films of the 1940s, but actually, most objective viewers would probably consider it a ridiculous shit, and I suppose that it is. It is certainly not a well-done Universal deal or Val Lewton's masterpiece, that's for sure! However, Zucco is always fun to watch, even in a non-demanding piffle like this. If you can save 72 minutes of your life, I suppose you could do worse than "The Mad Monster" (not TOO much worse, of course!). Oh ... another thing. This DVD is from Alpha Video, and you know what it means: blurred images, poor sounds (indeed, the worst sound of any DVD Alpha Video I've ever seen so far) and no extras. You have been warned!
