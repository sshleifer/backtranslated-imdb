'Helen of Troy' follows the story of Helen and the outbreak of the Trojan war. This is more of a love affair between Helen and Paris, who is shipwrecked and falls in love with Helen without knowing she is queen. The film portrays the couple as in love and wants nothing more than to be together. (Other films and books have different portraits of the characters, but in this case they are simply hopelessly in love.) The film is rather slow in some places, but the battles and the detail of the scenario are done quite well. There are also good performances. I thought the slave did a particularly good job, and was one of the most beloved characters. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a good adaptation if you can look beyond the slow story in places and look beyond some of the cheese novels and dialogues. In my opinion, a film version of Iliad perfect has not yet been created, but this is fun and has some beautiful pieces.
