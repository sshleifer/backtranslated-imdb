Your time and your brain will be much better spent reading or listening to Charlie Wilson's War. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, plays the most entertaining character in the film, Gust, the Greek, and interprets him as a eunuch. The burst in the book is hard and completely free to say what it thinks. In the film, it is not even shown as important for Charlie. And poor Charlie is never shown donating blood (which he did every time he visited the fields in Pakistan). In short, the film is too bland and the story is too old for our modern time. We do not really care about the end of the Cold War and the defeat of the Soviet Union (which occurred despite Reagan, not because of) from a well-funded group of people who were extremely willing to fight. It is not really the lesson that we must listen to and see considering how well the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are going. (As I read the book, I kept feeling that sense of déjà vu, except that it was the present day).
