The narration was clear and concise, but overall the film never caught my interest - the scenes felt flat and uninspired .. Ghengis khan, historically speaking, had a very interesting / epic life but the film failed to capture him, focusing instead on small skirmishes like youth and a love story I think I saw him disguised in a string of other films. I never felt sympathy or empathy for the main role - yes, he had to overcome slavery, but then he seemed to have an easy ride to the khan, sacking, killing and crossing double towards the top. The only quality that redeemed was photography - the landscapes certainly helped the bleak atmosphere of the film, unfortunately combined with the desolation of history - I was indifferent and disappointed ..
