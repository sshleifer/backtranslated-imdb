I am disgusted and upset by the positive reviews this film is receiving. Not only is it hokey, manipulative and melodramatic. It is also shamelessly offensive. The character of Radio `Gooding Jr. 'is presented as a cute little animal, like a puppy that is so cute that you just want to take it home. "This mentality is shameless; the radio is never treated as a human being, but as a manipulative means of attracting sympathy from its audience. Even more atrocious are the numerous moments of the film, in which the radio is hit on the head / stumbles / falls over / etc. These moments of slapstick comedy made the audience laugh simply for the simple reason, "it's funny because the radio is delayed". This is shameless, now I don't feel that the word "retarded" is an appropriate word to describe the mentally handicapped, but this seems to be the film's stance, "The radio is delayed, but that's okay, because it's nice and we like it." The portrait of Gooding seems more suited to a John Water film than a drama inspirational family.To add insult to injury the film is incompetent at all levels, Debra Winger lacks inspiration in the role of "stereotypical housewives" that the memory of her heinous monologues awakens in all those who see the film. John Horner's score is pure sap always superimposed on his tear compared to tired cinematography. Ed Harris is decent in a role he could have gone through, but he manages to keep much of the public's attention throughout the film. In conclusion, if you consider yourself a decent human being, ignore this parody of a film, read the book, but otherwise skip this terrible film about an interesting character in American history.
