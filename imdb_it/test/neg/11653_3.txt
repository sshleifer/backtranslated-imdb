Based on the comments made so far, everyone seems to hate this movie or love it. I think it would be fair to point out that although this is not a GREAT film, it has its interesting moments. First, it was filmed on site in Colorado (was it Breckinridge or Telluride? I don't remember, but it's in the credits). The location is absolutely stunning and spectacular. It's nice, even for me who lived in Colorado for several years. <br /> <br /> Subsequently, he has the inclination of Disney for the wonderful actors of characters. Harry Morgan has never been in a better shape than when starring in a Disney movie. It is literally hysterical. Also, remember the wonderful Mary Wickes? Although she has a "small part" in this film, she is fantastic, as always. If you don't know who he is, think of the animated Disney version of Hunchback of Notre Dame (he was one of the gargoyles), and he was also the most interesting nun in "Sister Act", as well as the best nun in "The Trouble With Angels". She has always been a great character actress and most character actors never received the recognition they deserved. <br /> <br /> In addition to the actors of characters and casts of all the actors, in the 60s and 70s Disney might not have had the "biggest" films, but, if you really watch them from the beginning in the end, NOTICE that every movie has a really funny or hysterical moment. The entire movie may not be fun, but there is always a jewel (at least 1 or 2) in every single Disney "live-action" movie ever made. Whether it's Harry Morgan in one of his bellowing tones, or Tim Conway struggling, or Joe Flynn giving one of his priceless looks of horror, it's all right. The whole movie may not be good, but there are ALWAYS hysterical moments in every Disney movie of that period I've ever seen. Disney has always managed to make a person smile, despite the film's stupidity. <br /> <br /> Based on these comments, I disagree with viewers who say that every Disney movie at this time is horrible. This statement is not accurate enough. Rather, it is easier for me to give credit to the funny moments and to neglect the weaknesses in the plots. <br /> <br /> Some Disney live-action films are true classics (Old Yeller, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, Mary Poppins), but for those that are not, they are able to appreciate them for what they were: a good family fun at a time when films had become vulgar, raw and offensive.
