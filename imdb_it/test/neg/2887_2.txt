Once again not bad enough to make it enjoyable. In reality this is just boring. It's reasonably well done, even if the script is bad, the effects are OK and the acting average. (Except for James Mason who is always fantastic, but underused in this) <br /> <br /> I suppose it's hard to write something about this movie because it didn't provoke any reaction in me what ever. br /> <br /> boring, dull, boring, boring, boring.
