I found the first fragment of animation in intriguing stop motion and the short live mostly with the girl who went around in any country was my interest, but the other eleven short films didn't really interest me or made me think of something all. The 8mm music and footage seemed to be so random that everything seemed random. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you see it for free. <br /> <br /> As for the music that is so abreast of not seeing. I rented the DVD because I thought it was all animation in stop motion or SMA mixed with live action and only the first short was SMA, the second had a small stop motion mixed with mostly live action. There were scraps of paper in one, and the rest were taken outdoors by an 8mm camera with the music bed. I just didn't have any meaning that I could see.
