Personally, the book was a very well written, surprising, electrifying piece that was not done justice to the film. Watching the movie at 12.01 am to see that the main parts of the book were left out frustrated me, as it influenced the "different" result of the film. There was something to be desired from this film, but all in all, it was missing from the plot. <br /> <br /> For someone who has not read the book, I could see how this film would be seen as inviting and entertaining with its controversy and suspense. However, for a dedicated reader who has read it seven times, I have not seen the strong connection between the two: both the film and the novel. <br /> <br /> With the main characters missing (such as Maximilian Kohler) and the sharp turn in the plot with the survival of the last cardinal in the favorite, the plot of the film was a bit scattered thus bringing to a different grip in the conclusion of the story. Even Hassassin was portrayed as a common white man, compared to that of the novel in which he was portrayed as a Muslim; his motivations in the book are mainly based on his links with the Illuminati, however, in the film, his motivations are based on money and seemed more like a job than a personal connection with the task at hand.
