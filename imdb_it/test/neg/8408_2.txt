The first film is a bit good for me, I liked it for the most part, but I thought it wasn't really anything so special. However, compared to this mess it looks much better than a lot. Because they felt the need to make the film is beyond me, but they should have known that it could not match the acting of the first film when they could only return Ruth Gordon to resume her role. The story follows the story of Rosemary and things like that, but in reality it is a bit of a mess, it doesn't help that the film is a TV movie and the look in the television shines very well. He also has a more moving tone that greatly hinders him, if they really felt the need to make a sequel, they would have to turn it into an R-series movie with a bit of nudity and blood. I'm sure it would still be pretty bad, but at least it would have been more watchable and fun that this movie is not, despite its attempt to be funny. I saw this on Monstervision and Joe Bob had nothing good to say in the introduction and I don't even have much to say. I must say that it was a sequel that would never have seen the light of day.
