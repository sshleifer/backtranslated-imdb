I rented this movie with my friend for a good laugh. Actually we were mocked by the video store salesman because of our questionable film tastes. Unfortunately, I don't remember the first part of the film because all I did was stare at the gigantic metal braces that Jane was wearing. and I didn't hear anything either because of the incomprehensible lisp. The other thing that caught my attention beyond his metallic mouth was his questionable sense of fashion. This film was made in 2005, but it seems that people in the wardrobe have skipped until 2000 for clothes. If you remember the times when Aaron Carter was considered a "popstar" and you like high-waisted jeans, ankle socks and knee-length skirts, then this little journey into memory is perfect for you.
