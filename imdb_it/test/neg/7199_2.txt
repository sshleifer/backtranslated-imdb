This is the first film I saw from the Italian Ed Wood, Demofilo Fidani aka Miles Deem. The title above was superfluously added later, as there is another 1961 film starring Richard Basehart, which was Michael Carreras of Hammer Films, the only stabbed in the West; the real Italian title was originally translated as his name was SAM WALBASH, but they called it AMEN although in reality it was WALLACH in the Italian variant which, of course, implies a tribute to the Hollywood actor Eli! <br /> <br /> Although they are not deceptively bad, there are many examples of awkwardness and ineptitude, so much so that I often crackled in howling laughter: a horrible number of an irresistible aspiring French chanteuse; a totally irrelevant barroom brawl; actors doing somersaults when they are hit; an elderly inhabitant who does an impromptu dance routine; ineffective (or rather abuse) use of slow motion; and, easily, the most absurd, seeing Gordon Mitchell and Lincoln Tate play two gunslingers (who show off the names of the actors!) hired by the villain to kill the title character and then never seen them in the rest of the film! ! <br /> <br /> The main actor Robert Woods is just that, if only to whisper ineffectively to the Amens about the bodies of his victims. The supporting actress Simonella Vitelli (actually, the daughter of the director!) As the villain's wife is quite an aspect but, unfortunately, she can't do much in the film ?? despite having a change of heart towards the end. The main musical theme is actually quite good, but again, the title song is, in itself, quite bad.
