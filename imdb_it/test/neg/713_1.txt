This is not a movie. This is a collection of random shots collected in a fascinating part of the world, dubbed with a random text. The movie is not great and the text is also not exceptional. The final product is terribly boring. <br /> <br /> In the DVD, shooting the comment can provide some entertainment value, since the director makes a rather disconcerting discussion about whether it's a science fiction movie. It is also fascinating to read the extraordinary risks and difficulties that the crew had to endure to collect this video. Too bad it's rubbish. But I think "The Making of Fata Morgana" is a fascinating film, like "Ed Wood".
