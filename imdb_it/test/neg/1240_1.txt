Did writers pay people to come here and write positive reviews? I mean, really, it's a little hackneyed and Spike isn't so funny. He looks more like the serious guy who tries too hard to be funny. There are so many mediocre concerts in this show; as in the past, the initial sketch was "Talk show, applied directly to the forehead", over and over again. And another that showed Spike and another guy who was getting too tall, and it wasn't even funny. They did nothing but sit and laugh again and again. Ha Ha! And another in which Spike talked to a Korean boy who ate duck and told him he had a pet duck. Ha ha! I mean, really, Spike only receives fun guests in his show, that's why people like this show
