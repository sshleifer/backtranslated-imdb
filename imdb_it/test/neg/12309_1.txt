I've seen some bad things in my time. A half-dead cow trying to get out of the mud of high life; a head colliding between two cars; a thousand dishes that crash into the kitchen floor; human beings that live like animals. <br /> <br /> But never in my life have I seen anything as bad as the cat in the hat. <br /> <br /> This film is worse than 911, worse than Hitler, worse than Vllad the Impaler, worse than those who put kittens in the microwave. <br /> <br /> It is the most disturbing film of all time, easy. <br /> <br /> I used to think it was a joke, some elaborate joke and that Mike Myers was perhaps a tall cocaine who sniffed a drug addict and drug addict who lost a bet or something. <br /> <br /> The shudders
