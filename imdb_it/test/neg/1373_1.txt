while the mind of a mancia could be summed up as nothing more than a clone of the Chappelle show, it's really worse than that. first of all, Carlos Mencia is a jacka ** that is as much fun as it is original, which doesn't say much. the show contains limping swear words from American TV commercials and political issues, and Mencia's "comic" intuition about politics adds to the low quality of this show. above all, mencia launches into more ethnic stories and steals the lines of Jeff foxworthy than he can count on a hand. while Carlos occasionally chuckles cheaply, the rest of the time he spends insulting everyone in sight, which includes the exploitation of members of his audience. with the exception of the south park, gathered together, and on Friday night standing, this show marks the end of the glory days of the chappelle show, which for those of you who haven't heard, was before you went to Africa.
