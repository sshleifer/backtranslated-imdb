André Roussin was a specialist in what the French call "Theater de Boulevard": it plays where the eternal triangle is: man / wife / lover (male or female). Many of his works have given Elvire Popesco some of his best parts on the stage. ... and the great actress was the main reason to watch them, because Roussin is not Sacha Guitry, for a long time. The French public remembers "Au Theater Ce Soir". <br /> <br /> Still with me? Roussin's works were not made to be filmed. And this is a fairly mediocre material, even though the writers call Lewis Carroll to their rescue. I like Stewart Granger and David Niven, and Ava Gardner is a feast for the eyes. But this could be their worst film, being crude, predictable - even the native's intervention (Bola-Bola) is ridiculous - an upside-down farce around a Menage à Trois on a desert island where Granger would be a kind of Robinson , Niven, his Friday and Gardner his girlfriend Friday.
