Perhaps the weakest film in the "Kharis" series, despite the presence of John Carradine (mixture as Egyptian high priest) and George Zucco (like his predecessor, exhilarated exhilarated by a bad case of Parkinson's disease) that supports Lon Chaney Jr. as a titanic creature - if indeed he was under the bandages, as his contribution is somewhat negligible! This is a 60 minutes controllable by itself, I suppose, but the standards have dropped considerably compared to the previous two items, and the final result is strictly routine and not at all memorable. Almost the only interesting feature here is the fact that the female protagonist is the reincarnation of Princess Ananka, mentioned a lot in previous films but never really seen.
