This show should be titled "When bad writing happens to good actors" whereas most players have shown immense talent in other places, eg. Andre Braugher in Homicide: Life on the Street and David Morse in St. Elsewhere. I hope the frenetic pace of the show is adjusted as the series develops along with the obvious absurd clich√©s and dialogues that I wondered how stupid the writers imagined the main audience to be. We are beaten in the head with the main points of this show instead of being gradually left to understand it, almost as if the writers heard that they must specify that the main character is a sort of avenging angel, condemned to redeem himself from sins, both venial and mortal, passing by his taxi a lot of business. Watching the first one required a lot of suspension of disbelief, that Mike Olshanskey's rates would overthrow their liver so quickly and he would feel impelled to intervene in the lives of strangers. Who possesses those "Super-Cop" abilities, being all for everyone, weapons expert, martial arts master, psychologist, father-confessor, blacksmith and so on, ad infinitum. Pure drivelesca fantasy. What do the recent Philidelphia television shows talk about that all seem to be imbued with an ugly ex-wife and a very shameless child? Exaggerated. I wanted to appreciate this show, I really did it, because it had the merit of having a slightly different premise than many of the clones that appear during this season and recites some of my favorite actors. But I'm afraid this is just another good idea ruined by a carefree performance.
