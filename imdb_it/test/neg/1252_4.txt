This film tried to make Stu Ungar's life interesting by being creative. What they forgot is that his life was fun enough to do just without having to invent anything. <br /> <br /> A short list of inaccuracies: <br /> <br /> 1) Stuey was not sent directly to Las Vegas for a Gin Tournament to pay off old debts, he spent quite a bit of time before in Florida, and only in Las Vegas when he finished the Gin games on the east coast. <br /> <br /> 2) Stuey has never associated (or played Gin) with a casino executive (like the one played by Pat Morita in the film). <br /> <br /> 3) There was no magic breakthrough in the 1997 WSOP buildup. In fact, Stuey barely managed to enter the tournament as it was. He snorted cocaine the week before. <br /> <br /> Or tell the right story, or don't say it at all. 4 out of 10 stars for the credible performance of Michael Imperolli (the only saving quality of this film).
