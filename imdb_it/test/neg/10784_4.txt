The orientations of Western feminism on the various subcultures of India have remained largely inexistent to date, the two entities belonging to alien and threatening realms (in the name of tradition) never coincide. Art imitates life (or at least it states) and popular Hindi cinema is no exception, reflecting an underlying misogyny which, unfortunately, forms the foundation of much of the Indian collective culture. But why? What is there in the female gender that made it so odious to the culture that women are usually subjected to the most unimaginable horrors, including rape, murder, infanticide, imposed illiteracy, infidelity and the subjugation of the spirit that goes by the name of ' dowry'? The last offer of Rajkumar Santoshi, "Lajja", poses the same plaintive question, linking the atrocities committed against women through three separate chapters / episodes that make up the journey of shame borne by its protagonist, Vaidehi (Manisha Koirala). <br /> <br /> Santoshi's management is not up to the level required by history. He fails to reach the necessary sensitivity in painting the saga of sadness and faces the problem of misogyny on the one hand, rather than on the frontal one. Santoshi recently stated that he had not made the film for an international film festival, but rather for the masses of his country. Unfortunately, the show shows, and the film too often deepens the kind of blood-blood action in which Santoshi specializes. The film suffers from its jerky and episodic rhythm and its finish is rather too forced. <br /> <br /> The female cast is characterized by much gentler and more rounded characterizations than the male counterparts. The protagonist is sensibly interpreted by the beautiful and luminescent Manisha Koirala who demonstrates to Lajja that she is one of the most competent women of our time and, given an appropriate role and set up, emerges with a truly commendable performance. One wonders how brilliantly he could have shone if the film had been made by a director with the appropriate creative intention and appreciation of the problem in question. Mahima Choudhary stages a commendable performance and continues to show that he is an unexpressed talent. In the role of Janki, Madhuri Dixit performs with a fervor and a happiness never seen before for what really deserves the name of "acting". The role of a street artist who finds relief in alcohol and the promise of an unborn child is the greatest risk in his role as a singer and dancer who has maintained his tent status over the past decade. Which leaves the final and most disturbing performance in this aspiring feminist saga, that of the incessantly talented Rekha. Lajja is Manisha Koirala's film, there is no doubt, but it is Rekha who dominates the process in a performance that digs you into your bones and sends echoes of terror through the vestibules of your heart. Rekha astonishes as Ramdulari, renounces the vanity and the complacency to offer an exhibition so full of authenticity and ingenuity that emotional nudity becomes the mantra of this part of the film. The comparisons are really hateful, especially when they are put in front of one of the greatest ladies of the world, but in the graceful presence of this legend on the screen the others reign in its shadow. <br /> <br /> "Lajja" does not have the refinement of proto-feminist dramas such as "Zubeidaa", "Pinjar", or even the celebration of the infernal Queen "Laadla": it meets its feminist goals in two first moments: the strong pull in which Mahima scolds her in-laws for their abuse of her father who has committed no other crime than giving birth to a girl. It bursts, leaving the procession of marriage parading. Seeing her devastated father, she begins to cry, blaming herself for the chaotic destruction in front of her. He complains: "Why did I say something? I ruined everything! It's all my fault!" His grandmother, silently witnessing the abuses he endured, comforted her by saying: "Why are you crying? There is no reason for you to cry, you have no fault for anything, the fault is mine, the fault is of every woman who came first of you, because if we had had the courage to say in our days what you said today, you would not have needed to say anything today ". In this scene the importance of feminist heritage is evidently in sight through words. <br /> <br /> The other, more subtle moment arrives very early in the film when Vaidehi (Manisha) escaped from her violent husband to the shelter of her parents' home in India. For viewers of Western societies, it may seem perfectly reasonable (indeed, natural) for any abused woman to seek the protective protection of her parents; this, however, is a social taboo in many eastern cultures, including India. Once a woman has been married, the identity she assumes is that of her husband and his personal possessions (family, business, children, etc.). For her turning her back on these responsibilities is a grave social sin, what it has really no equivalent for the western woman. Subsequently it is considered contaminated and "damaged goods", whose value was canceled entirely by its own actions and by its refusal to submit to the role assigned to it. It is not so much an individual as it is an emblem of family honor. Her father scolds her for her actions, worried that her family honor will be irreparably tarnished by her daughter who had already transferred to another man. His main concern is the imminent marriage of Vaidehi's younger sister, a prospect made much less likely by a divorced daughter in the same family. He tells her that it is not certain that he should return to the man to whom he belongs legally, however violent and sadistic he may be. He takes the old saying against her that "The honor of every house is in the hands of his daughter". Quietly and thoughtfully, she replies: "Yes, the honor of every house is in the hands of his daughter, but there is no honor for the daughter herself."
