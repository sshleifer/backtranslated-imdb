I saw this movie and thought it was a stupid movie. What is even more stupid is that whoever thought that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles? The fact is that there are no volcanoes in Los Angeles. This film should not be shot in Los Angeles, it should be shot in Honolulu, Hawaii. Hawaii has volcanoes which is a real fact that this film should be made in the state capital of Hawaii. This film should be shot in Hawaii because this is the real idea and not in Los Angeles. There are earthquakes in Los Angeles, but there are no volcanoes. To be honest with you, this is an incredible and very silly nonsense. In conclusion, I won't worry about this film because a Los Angeles volcano is nothing but an absurdity.
