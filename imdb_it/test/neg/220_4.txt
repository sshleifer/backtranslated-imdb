There is not much to add to what others have already commented, the film fails hard where it shouldn't, has no depth in planning the robbery and the characters are so incredible. <br /> <br /> One thing that made me think, is that although the rest of the gang is trying to remove the pins from the doors of an armored truck, because there should be no other way to open it, the guy all Inside the truck, it is very easy to remove the floor of the truck which has a hole so that it can exit, and then re-enter, without being noticed by anyone, because no one else could think that it could get out of there or even better, that they could have come in from there. <br /> <br /> Promising but not right there.
