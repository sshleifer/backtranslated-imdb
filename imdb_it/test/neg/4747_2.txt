Starting from where the last AVP was interrupted, an alien "villain" emerges from a dead Predator on a Predator spaceship and collapses the Predator spaceship in today's Gunnison Colorado, where he raises many other Aliens that start causing chaos . The Predator breed sends a solitary and armed Predator with great experience to "clean up the mess". Our human characters are caught in the midst of the intergalactic battle. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this film is the rhythm. This film moves too fast. The initial credits have just rolled over and already the Predator ship crashes into the Earth after the Alien has reached its maximum height, a hunter and son character have been introduced, but before they learn their names they are both killed, so we see the Predator the home world and the protagonist Predator flies away to fight the alien infestation, and all this happens within the first five minutes. This unnatural rhythm leaves no room for the whole film; the National Guard arrives in the city but within two minutes they are all killed without even having a good look at a single face, the manager of a pizza shop gets a scene of character development only to be killed the next time we see him once again without even learning his name, random hobos, a waitress and a bar chef are again killed without knowing their names. One moment our main characters are at home, the next one running in the city, the next in a weapons shop, the next in an APC, and this casual set that jumps over and over again never leaves the public leaving time for settle down leaving them clinging to the straw. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the settings and the time interval. The film is set in today's Gunnison Colorado. Every other Alien and Predator film was shot in engaging settings, such as industrial space ships, guerrilla zone rainforests, alien planets and underground mazes. Now comes the AVP-R, set in a small modern American city, with "highlights" that include a sports shop, parking lots, pizzerias and bedrooms for girls. I mean, were they really trying to make the movie as boring, gray and uninteresting as possible ?! It is difficult to perceive these monsters as frightening creatures when they are next to a shelf full of Reebok or hiding in the bushes outside the bedrooms. <br /> <br /> Continuity is a big problem with this film. The Alien series was set in the future, no human had ever heard of an alien before the first film, and the aliens had never only been on Earth, but if they ever reached Earth, humanity would have been destroyed. This film ruins the whole concept by acclimatizing to the present day, with Average Joes that sees the Aliens everywhere, and at the end of the film, humanity is not destroyed, even suffering those that could be considered minor losses. Piss all over the concept of the other films. Attempts to maintain continuity are made with the massive Deus Ex Machina. The Predator just happens to carry around a bottle of unlimited magical blue liquid that is just to melt any body with a single drop, the army at the end of the film only happens to go to too drastic measures and release a nuclear warhead that only cancels conveniently all evidence of the existence of the Aliens despite the fact that there are many survivors of the accident who are witnesses, and many other bad attempts are made to fill the holes in the plot impossible to cover. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, for a movie "Verses" has an inexorable partiality in favor of the Predators. For most of the movie, a lone Predator manages to kill dozens if not tens of dozens of aliens, all within reach as he barely earns a single scratch, while the aliens are simply slaughtered to the right and center like clay pigeons , simply waiting for their turn to be killed by the Predator without making any effort to defend themselves. This film should not be called "Alien vs. Predator", as long as it should be "Predator massacres Aliens". I mean, how can you have two species that fight with suspense and tension, when one is portrayed as enormously superior to the other? <br /> <br /> The characters in this film are among the biggest flaws. Not only do they pale in comparison to the characters in the previous films of Alien and Predator, but also as stand-alone films they are lifeless, sad and sometimes even shivering. The characters in this film consist of the fact that I don't understand you, horny couples who want to fuck, pizza delivery boys, blonde bimbos, high school bullies, children and a blatant copy and paste job that rips away Ripley and Newt; the worst ideas and the most clich√©s possible for the characters. Not only that, but all the characters mentioned above are played by teenagers. While teen casting is an obvious attempt to engage younger audiences, its only effect is to make the movie look like a typical porn-pornographic teen movie, with actors too young to have learned to perform convincingly with the most completely empty facial expressions offering monotonous dialogues. Not only this, but these characters do some of the most film-delayed things ever, like using Predator guns, commenting on powers when it was for hours, following stupid plans to get out of the city rather than walking out of town somehow in a hurry, and just so many other nonsense that the film actually had the audience in my theater sighing in frustration. <br /> <br /> In the end this film is just a horrible B movie, something that deserves the direct on DVD category. The fact that this film was a theatrical release amazed me, as every part of the film is only part of the amateur work.
