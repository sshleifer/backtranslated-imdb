See Dick work. <br /> <br /> Watch Jane work. <br /> <br /> Dick and Jane are married. <br /> <br /> They have been successful. <br /> <br /> Have a child. <br /> <br /> They have a nice house. <br /> <br /> They have a Latin housekeeper. <br /> <br /> The housekeeper teaches her son Spanish. <br /> <br /> The son speaks Spanish. <br /> <br /> Ha-ha. <br /> <br /> See Dick being promoted. <br /> <br /> The pompous CEO is a scammer. <Br /> <br /> See Dick taking the fall for the pompous CEO. <br /> <br /> Jane quits her job. <br /> <br /> Oops. <br /> <br /> See Dick and Jane <br /> <br /> Dick & Jane turn to crime. <br /> <br /> As a plot device, they decide to rob the CEO. <br /> <br /> Watch the theft fail. <br /> <br /> See Dick & Jane finance the company's pension plan with robbery money. <br /> <br /> Yay. Look at the credits. <br /> <br /> Ok, so you have the plot. Besides that, Dick and Jane go from one scene to another. One barely connected with the last or the next. Everything is terribly episodic in nature. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey didn't bother to bring his "A" material, he just looks bored and slightly embarrassed about the whole thing. But heck, when you get paid $ 20 million more, why worry. Tea Leoni is hectic. I guess I would be impatient not to be blamed for this flop. <br /> <br /> There's just something more about Dick & Jane. Carrey and Leoni are not funny and have little chemistry. The script is not funny. And it is not well traced. <br /> <br /> But it could be bigger than that. The reality of Dick and Jane is, perhaps, a little too real. Maybe it's not fun for people to lose their jobs in a situation similar to Enron, when in real life they still lack a happy ending.
