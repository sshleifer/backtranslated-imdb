This film seemed to have been shot with a videophone, had a very small plot and useless nudity. The film was never really combined or made much sense and for a film like this, of course, there were some unnecessary hits. The director was obviously trying to make the film subjective and different, but he never gave enough information about what was really going on, even though in the end there remained a mixture of anger and confusion. Confusion from lack of plot, and anger because I wanted my two dollars back from the blockbuster and a 1.5 hour of my life back. They should have a payment program for people who accidentally rent this movie.
