I loved the first Grudge, I saw it in an empty theater and, honestly, I was crazy. Never before had I heard the unique sound of chilling sounds, it was really compelling. <br /> <br /> However, The Grudge 2 had a couple of nice jumps, but the plot was really messy, and not entirely credible, and everywhere, with a couple of scenes, (like a female urinating if herself out of fear, or another of a young woman who drinks a jug of milk and then vomits it all up again) which really didn't make sense, and didn't help improve the film's sliding factor. During these scenes, and a couple of other people, people in the exhausted audience actually laughed loudly. That was a good indicator to show how this film lacked chills, chills or shivers. The acting was decent, the emotions represented were credible, so much to take them out of the actors, but the cluttered plot and its lack of direction were something I could not shake for the whole film. I was more annoyed than anything else, the same old grudge, a couple of unexpected short scenes to make me jump, but overall, I was very disappointed.
