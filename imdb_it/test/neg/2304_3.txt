Nice idea to have Dionne Warwick as a singer for this film adaptation of the best seller by Jacqueline Susann (in the "Valley Of The Dolls") ... although it's really a pity that this sudser doesn't have Neely O'Hara by Patty Duke for pin the story. "The Love Machine" is incredibly boring. Even the final brawl (with an Oscar as a fight item!) Can't save it. Dyan Cannon looks embalmed in his heavy pancake make-up and cumbersome fall (although his small tanned figure is a beauty to behold), John Phillip Law is a block of wood on his head, David Hemmings embarrassing in gay-mode like a flamboyant photographer . And where is Robin Stone going to end up? Are you trekking along the waterfront to catch sailors? After Cannon has deflated his masculinity, it would be a safe bet. In that case, "Love Machine - The Final Episode" may have been a more interesting film. Definitely better than this yawning snooze. * 1/2 from ****
