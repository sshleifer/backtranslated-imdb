This two and a half hour movie was shown recently at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in a 10 pm show. There was a show scheduled for the first hour later, but I wondered if anyone would stay awake to see it until 3:30 am. The opening scene is of a man walking in a field and takes four minutes to film. It is a threatening sign of what will come: a good 144 minutes more or almost the same. There is a scene of a man and a woman against a wall, standing in the sun. It is repeated 15 times, with very scattered dialogues. Occasionally, these long slow sequences are interrupted by shocking images, such as a close-up of female genitalia, shown for a full minute of film (the audience crowd laughs in the last 20 seconds, as if to say "what is the message?"). The story recalls the novel by Dostoevsky "The Brothers Karamazov", in which a cretin falls in love with a woman of easy virtue. In one of the rare moments when the crowd laughed (more in desperation to try to justify being already there for two hours to see that nothing happened) it was when the declaration of a British tourist who could not see things clearly since then the Eurostar train was traveling at 180 miles per hour, it was translated by the translator with the automatic passage of the units of measurement from the English system to the metric system to "they could not see things clearly from the moment the train traveled to 300 kilometers per hour ". The surprising thing about this film is that the quality of the film reveals that a lot of money has been spent on it. This was not an 8 mm kitchen experiment. It was carefully planned, structured, acted, mounted. And yet, I took so little. Some comments prompted on the harrowing detail, like the minutae of a key chain dandling on a newly opened door. Okay, it was noticed, but what was the purpose? Some brave people in the audience left after the first hour. The rest remained out of curiosity: there must be something happening at the end. There never was. And maybe that's what the movie is about. All the films in the theater are full of action. This wants to be different. Nothing is happening.
