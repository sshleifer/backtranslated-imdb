Richard Donner shows his liberal credentials with this simplisticly absurdly ridiculous attack on South African politics. It is not as if America were the cradle of racial harmony and brotherly love - and a further irony adds to the fact that the film is set in the city that was the home of Rodney King and glorifies the Police Department that he has done so much for the community's relationships with their brutal racist behavior. So Donner's salt and pepper pair that clearly have a late adolescent crush on each other does its own thing with a subtle disregard for the rule of law or the rules of evidence and nobody cares why the bad guys are white South Africans - surely a worrying example of police racism in itself? Inside Rudd's office (Joss Ackland - eminently slippery) the furniture was designed and lit to resemble the Fuhrerbunker as much as possible and, if some rather stupid spectators fail to grasp the point, he and his men are called "Nazis" at regular intervals. For me the only bright spot in the film was when Mel Gibson showed up at an anti-apartheid demonstration carrying a banner with the inscription "End Aparthied Now". The intensely irritating Joe Pesci is introduced into the franchise to take a little weight off the boys' shoulders by following them around incessantly like a poorly trained puppy. This would be bearable if there was the remotest chance that he would end up in a concrete coat, but unfortunately he survives to irritate another day. Miss Patsy Kensit seems in a world of her own, perhaps not believing her luck to be chosen to play Mel Gibson who has little trouble dragging her to bed in her mobile home that seems to have been washed somewhere on a beach. Shortly after consuming their deal they come under fire from a number of helicopters firing enough shots into Mel's caravan to keep the US army in Iraq running for six months. Fortunately, he has a dog that is not afraid of causing intercourse to stop just as they are going for seconds and his bark warns them of the impending attack. I hope he received a special bone as a reward. The film culminates (without interruption by Mel's dog) in a merchant ship for Nazi Germany (sorry, South Africa), when Mel and Danny kill so many members of the main race that I lost sight of. Despite struggling like Bonnie and Clyde under the impact of a barrage of bullets, Mel survives, curled up in the arms of his companion like a small child with a wise and benevolent father. Take this, Apartheid!
