This P.of S. was highly recommended to me by two friends who have a great taste in movies and who have seen more than anyone else. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what they saw in this movie. Sadistic, cruel and repulsive is good in a funny movie, but this is a windbag effort that tries to pass as a high-level intellectual film. Or is he a low-level intellectual? <br /> <br /> The old clich√© of the generation gap "no redeeming the social value" comes to mind. Bill Pullman is rehearsing, maybe a little too hard, and with the exception of the kid the rest of the acting looks awkward and a little lame. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and watch a double function of "In Cold Blood" and "The Hitcher". <br /> <br /> As someone said, this would never have been done if Jennifer Lynch was not David Lynch's overrated daughter.
