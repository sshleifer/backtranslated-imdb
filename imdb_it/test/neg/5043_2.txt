This movie is like a porn with all the good parts removed. It is as if all the pornstars who did not want to fulfill their obligations joined around this horrible, trivial, useless piece of gargoyle abstinence. <br /> <br /> This is a useful film if you are in the mood to torture a loved one (or no longer loved). It is important that, if you choose to use this film as a method of torture, insert earplugs and cover your eyes so as not to go crazy. <br /> <br /> If you could choose between this movie and The 700 Club ... choose Girls Gone Wild. <br /> <br /> Overall, better if you have been drinking. But only because it becomes an alcoholic game of epic proportions.
