It so happens that IVAN THE TERRIBLE, PARTS I and II have both included in the 50 Worst Movies book by Harry Medved. Now, I think that to declare that they are among the worst films of all time is an exaggeration, even though they are still both rather poor films - in particular the first one, since it showed more squinting eyes and "squinty eyes" than I've ever seen before !! Director Eisenstein and a lot of other people out there thought this made the film "artistic and profound" - and since I'm legally balanced, I have to say I hated this first movie !! The second, although still very incomplete, is a great improvement, given that the film is minimal, although the scenes are too boring and boring in this film just like in the first part! While the second part seems rather incomplete and needs at least another hour (especially since it never arrives at Ivan's crazy behavior later in life - how to kill his son and heir while in anger). Since both parts 1 and 2 were commissioned by Stalin to excuse his murderous reign and glorify it, it is not surprising that Ivan's life story is left incomplete. Even without all the terrible behavior of Ivan, apparently the supreme villain Stalin did not like the film and did not allow his release during his lifetime. Maybe he didn't allow it because he was more worried that people would see what a huge waste of money and resources the film was instead of seeing Stalin as crazy as Ivan! <br /> <br /> By the way, there was a segment of this tedious film that was so beautiful that the film deserves a 4 (without it, a 2) - and that's the scene with Prince Vladimir at the banquet ! It is well done and rather amusing in a dark way. And the scene was performed in a Russian version of 2-color Technicolor. This is VERY strange, by the way, because in the mid-1930s, Technicolor developed a significantly improved true color process that no longer made it all orange-red and greenish blue. So, this film during color sequences looks a lot like a silent or early sound color film. Very strange for the 40s.
