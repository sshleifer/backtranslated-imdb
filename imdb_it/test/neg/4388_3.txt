It seems that companies are probably paying for services that post comments of fantastic films on IMDb. <br /> <br /> This movie was horrible. The plot was stupid. The acting was poor. The jokes weren't even funny. The film included fewer nudities from what looked like porn actresses but none of the other characters. <br /> <br /> It was clear from the first 15 minutes that the movie wasn't funny. There was some disgust here and there but most of the humor had to be derived from the characters who talked about each other and spread rumors. This is not even done well. Every joke is obvious and you see it coming. <br /> <br /> The film is worthy of a fast advance or better yet is not looking. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I saw this movie and if I could upload the studio film and distributor for 1.5 hours they stole it from me I'd do it.
