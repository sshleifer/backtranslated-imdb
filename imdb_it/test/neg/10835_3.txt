What a terrible movie. The effects were mediocre, especially by today's standards, but it was forgivable. What was unforgivable was the terrible downsizing of every flood / dam that breaks the disaster ever made in this piece of garbage. The acting was terrible and I mean terrible. The point in the story where Michelle Green stops to save a dog from the approaching stream was hilarious. They see water approaching and running for their lives. (By the way they had to find a very old fat dog so as not to make Ms Green seem unsuitable). They manage to climb over the water for a while before taking refuge. What a speed! Later, a moving car is not fast enough to escape the creek. God, she and that dog are fast courses! If you want to see a good movie about breaking a dam, this is not it. Porchlight Entertainment makes some good family movies, but this time they missed the mark.
