I love the first and third Beastmasters, but this was an abomination. It was almost as horrible as "The Never Ending Story 3", for the same reasons. They have taken a fascinating fantasy world of barbarian tribes, peasant villages, witches, supernatural creatures and a cult of religious fanatics who use a pyramid; and I thought it would be fun to mix our materialist world of rock & roll pop culture, sushi (I think it was what it was) and flashy sports cars. These two worlds do not belong together. I don't want to see a bunch of old-looking barbarians dancing on a car radio rock song. I have a sense of humor, but this is just stupid. This is what Hollywood does to good fancy movies when ideas run out. Don't give up though, the Eye of Braxus is much, much better. The one I gave at 10. This, Portal of Time, I give 1. Believe me, I don't always give such high or low ratings. I only tend to comment on such films.
