Boy Oh Boy, this movie stinks. This film is one of the worst pieces of trash I've ever seen in my life. Please, even if your life depends on it, NOT, and I repeat: NOT under any circumstances, look at this horrible piece of garbage. Just look at this when it looks like an MST 3000 episode. That was the only way I could sit for the whole thing. If I had to watch it without that show, I would have stopped watching it before it was over. It has only one use: A Cure For Insomniacs !!!!!
