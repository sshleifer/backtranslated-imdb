This is the stupidest movie ever made. The story is ridiculous. His wife and son think he's crazy. So they don't. Then it turns out that he is and I think they knew it forever. There's a dog named Ned that causes some problems and I think it's all his fault ... as is Jim Carey. God knows why Virginia Madsen has taken this role ... this is a career plunge. I think the target audience for this is 11 and 12 years old. And this adds up to 23. Or maybe it's for 8 and 10 years, which also adds up to 23. Or maybe it's for the really stupid 23 years. Or maybe really stupid 32 years old because he is 23 on the contrary. Or maybe the 46 years have fun because half of that is 23. I think looking on the internet number 23 would be more fun than this movie, unless I wanted to see a play.
