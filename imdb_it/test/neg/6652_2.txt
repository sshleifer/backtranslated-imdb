I can't believe I saw the whole movie. Another "Ishtar" where I kept waiting for it to improve, which never happened. The sound is terrible, going from too low to listen to conversations, to ringing sounds in a few seconds. The plot is absolutely far-fetched, acting is mediocre, although Keaton does his usual good job as a mental case, although being typed in that role could certainly be considered negative. The director knows absolutely nothing about hospitals, drugs, science or anything of a technical nature. "Sociopath" ???? I wonder how they got to that diagnosis? There are so many mistakes, tricks and things wrong with this film that if we had to list them all, we could set some sort of record. Demerol as a general anesthetic? A motorcyclist on the highway wearing a non-DOT / Snell off-road helmet. San Francisco ??? The paper walls move when they are touched, the helmets appear just out of nowhere, the guns point in one direction but hit things in another, the lighting appears and disappears and there is barely a moving scene that does not contains any kind of error. My wife, who is an RN in an Oncology unit, eventually left the room before the end of the film, so upset by all the medical errors. I gave a 2 only because of Keaton's acting, otherwise he would have gotten a 1.
