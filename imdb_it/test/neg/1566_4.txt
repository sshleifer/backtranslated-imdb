GEORGE AND MILDRED was a spin-off of the mid-70s sitcom, MAN ABOUT THE HOUSE. Although I have not seen the series since it was last broadcast, I remember that it is quite funny with most of the comedy born from the couple of the same name that will live next to the snobby family of Fourmile, a sort of LOVE OF THE NEIGHBOR without the cynical racist gags. <br /> <br /> Having seen this "big screen version of the show" I find myself asking what it is about a big screen version of? Certainly not of a popular mid-70s with the same name. For some reason, the film undermines all interactions between television characters by making sure that George and Mildred leave the path they live in and get involved in a plot that involves some serious gangsters who want something that George inadvertently took and which leads to anger situations and lines like: <br /> <br /> "He gave it to her" <br /> <br /> "No, this is the first time a man has resisted my charm "<br /> <br />" I meant the envelope "<br /> <br /> You had the impression that the writer Dick Sharples (who never wrote an episode for the original sitcom) has never seen an episode of the original material and have the show confused with the film series of CARRY ON. In many ways it resembles the same errors as the second LOST IN SPACE film as it has absolutely nothing in common with the series that generated it
