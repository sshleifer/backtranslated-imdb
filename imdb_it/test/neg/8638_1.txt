The film begins with a narrative of the protagonist explaining some crimes that occur throughout the city and then we come to know that the hero is a policeman who is suspended or probably retired. I did not have the patience or interest to verify the above before commenting. If there is a stereotype for storytellers to have a deep voice that induces sleep, then the time has come to end it. I fell asleep seriously and didn't even bother closing the film. I'm still trying to figure out what it was and why there were no outdoor shootings. A third-rate serial TV will have more serial numbers than this movie shit and I still pity the actors and producers involved in this huge movie shit. It must have been produced as a normal TV series or maybe even as a local theatrical drama instead of putting it on the big screen. Total waste of time and money. The film had to be in production for a long time and it would have been better to have left it that way. With the redundant sleep that induced dialogues and scenes, this is the worst movie I've ever seen.
