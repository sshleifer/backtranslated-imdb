This adaptation contains two parts: <br /> <br /> 1. The "now", when Gulliver is at home in England and is soon put into an asylum by the evil Dr. Bates <br /> <br /> 2. The "described" time, in which Gulliver describes his travels. <br /> <br /> Times are interspersed by a very rough time, which makes the suspense of disbelief much more difficult than it would be if the film were simply discarded that part and I followed the book as written. In the book, there is no Dr. Bates, there is no asylum, and Mrs Gulliver does not make much mention. Journeys - in the plural - are represented as one in the film. There are several movies that deal with the topic of healthy people being downloaded to a mental hospital by some bad person out there, watch them if you want that stuff. The "now" time part adds absolutely nothing to the value of the story, it is a complete invention from the film adapters and requires precious time from the real story. As long as this was happening, I wanted the next piece of real travel to be shown. <br /> <br /> So much for the disadvantages. The parts that are actually part of the real story are well made, and the CGI is really well made for its time. Many small (and few medium) parts of real journeys are simply cut off, but that doesn't stop the story. This is AFAIK the only version that describes all four trips, and for this the film should receive a special mention. <br /> <br /> The two interspersed parts get approximately the same time. I consider the first part 0 out of 10 and the actual travel coverage as 8/10. Calculating the average, I give him a 4/10. If only they had cut the garbage and concentrated 99% on real journeys, since that cut would have freed up a lot of time much better spent to fill in the details cut by travels. <br /> <br /> Because some adapters think they have enough talent to improve Swift's work, I don't know. My best guess is that in 1996 the CGI was so expensive that the movie company felt the need to incorporate lots of fillers that didn't require elaborate sets, GCIs, etc. To keep total costs below a certain limit, while at the same time producing a mini-series that has recorded a certain number of minutes.
