If you're about to make a movie from any book, make sure the characters are consistent with that book. This film not only challenged the biblical story that was told to children thousands and thousands of years in one way or another, but clearly took liberties that no adaptation would probably have ever experienced. At least the Lord of the Rings is close enough to the books that people understand the story better if they read the books than this "Noah's Ark" tried.
