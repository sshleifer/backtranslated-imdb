I wanted this film to appeal to me, but there is very little pleasure. It starts with Jean Stapleton and a song by Randy Newman in Iowa (Iowa northwestern, I guess), reminiscent of Norman Lear's Cold Turkey, which was one of the best films ever made, according to people on IMDb. So far, so good. And the idea of ​​the archangel Michael living in the motel of Pansy Milbank on earth? Well, give him a chance, it should be a comedy. Ok, so far, so good. But Michael does things that an uncaught angel would never do, and this completely erases any credibility that the film could have. The other characters in the film also don't have much appeal. Michael brings a dog back to life, and we should be intimidated. People invent shameless country songs. In the end, Stapleton dances with Travolta. Big deal. If he were intelligent, he wouldn't even be in this movie. When he finished, I thought, "Damn, what a stupid, bland, boring, silly, sacrilegious movie!" It is not suitable to be seen by children or anyone else.
