This is a polarizing film. People love it or despise it, apparently. I despise him. The film is born in the same context as Oh Lucky Man by Lindsay Anderson, but while that is a masterpiece, it is simply horrible. <br /> <br /> Both films carry the unfinished novel by Kafka - America, for their inspiration and the general ideal. America is a surreal story of youth travel across the country. Kafka uses this character as a pure observer, one who does not change during the journey (although the book is about 300 pages and still looks like only a finished quarter, so we will never know). Allowing Kafka to concentrate and comment on absurd / surreal situations and surroundings. Oh Lucky Man follows this same pattern to show Britain through the eyes of Malcolm McDowell and Weekend does the same for France. <br /> <br /> Both films are also brutally Brechtian, using various tricks and techniques to emphasize the fact that this is NOT REAL, this is confabulation etc. But the difference comes where Oh Lucky Man uses the built film to convey the absurdity of life and the class system, Weekend uses the film built to strike to death with ideological controversy. Since Godard goes beyond the Anderson in his Brechtian principles, we end up with two main characters in which we have no investment. We are forced to spend 90 minutes with them, but we don't care about them. Deliberately so But in doing this, Godard leaves us with a film that is entirely about his message, which, in the first half of the film, is delivered through relentless and overbearing symbolism, and in the second half through a series of long talks directed at the camera . Combined with unpleasant and unnecessary scenes like the horrible pig that kills, much worse than any off-the-chamber violence of traffic accidents. <br /> <br /> The end result is like listening to a student political apparatchik that sings and pays back and forth about his opinions, while repeatedly kicking you in the head to get the message. The problem with Brecht is that if you stray too far from the public, you have alienated them from what you are trying to convey. Which always seemed obvious to me. <br /> <br /> The parts that really stick to the search for this film are the contrast between the extremely sexually explicit verbal description of the trio at the beginning and the out-of-field comic rape in the middle, which, although it could be considered as an allegorical, it completely destroys the faith of the film itself and its characters, which in fact did not exist at all. He's so French with a capital F, it hurts. <br /> <br /> Look at Oh Lucky Man instead. This is a work of genius. Weekend is a work of claim. <br /> <br /> Two stars, and only for the traffic jam scene and the piano scene, which are only hints of genius, even if in reality they make the final result more frustrating and unsatisfactory than without them, this is a bad movie of the worst pretentious director in the world, with them, well it is obvious that this is a damn good technical director who makes the most intellectually pretentious film in the world. Somehow it is much worse.
