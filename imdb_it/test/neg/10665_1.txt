Okay, this movie is well shot, but it makes no sense and it makes no sense to use how they did 2 hours to look like 3 just above a little love story, <br /> <br /> this may have been episode of the bold and the beautiful or the oc, in short please do not watch this film because there is a song every 5 minutes just to wake you, sleep, I gave this movie 1/10 because it was the lowest, and no this is not completely based on a true story, more than half is composed. I repeat the direction of photography is 7 or 8 out of 10, but the film is just a little too much, the actor's nasal voice makes me feel I want to go blow my nose. Unless you are a true mesh fan, this film is a huge no-no.
