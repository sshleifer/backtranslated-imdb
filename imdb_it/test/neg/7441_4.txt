After that, the touted update goes and shoots through the head. Quite apt, considering the unpleasant state of this film, a sequel to a film that evidently didn't need it. <br /> <br /> What really annoys Robocop 2 is that the producers obviously didn't understand why the original was so good in the first place. Robocop (7) was a witty and vibrant satire of bad action movies. Robocop 2 is just a bad action movie. <br /> <br /> Subtle to dialogue, particularly towards the boring and unrestrained ending, it attracts little interest and does not possess the energy or spirit of the original. The fake ads, now a bit bland ("Warning: continued use will cause skin cancer") simply seem there as an afterthought. And calling a new design drug "Nuke" is nowhere near as thin or fun as the original family board game, "Nuke ?? em!" <br /> <br /> Stop-motion animation ?? the weakest element of the original ?? it is used more extensively, while this sequel without humor does not include a sequence of credits, which makes it even more economical and hasty. Ah, without humor? You could say. But what about the nice mayor, or how Robo is reprogrammed to hit banality? Yes, these are attempts at lightening, just as Robo tightens himself with a screwdriver ("we are only human") for the final punch of the film, but no one is able to provoke laughter. Like the rest of the film, they are firm and moral attempts at entertainment. <br /> <br /> The third and final film of the series (from the imaginative title Robocop 3; 5) saw Peter Weller leave, to be replaced by Robert John Burke, who does well in an undemanding role. With attenuated language and violence, it was an obvious invocation to the market of the kiddie, a very blocked Robo action figure. With his overestimated social conscience, and Robocop's new arm attacks and jetpack become too stupid, the final film was never destined to become a masterpiece. However, the fluid direction of Fred Dekker and a fluid rhythm make this vision pleasant to throw away. <br /> <br /> Robocop, therefore, is the actual film. Robocop 3 is the sequel that you could see if there was nothing better. Which leaves the second film hanging in the center, a deceptive imitation of an image. A franchised vehicle that has nothing to say, apart from the signs of the pounding ring. Irvin Kershner is not Paul Verhoven, just as the cartoonist Frank Miller and partner Walon Green are not the authors of Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner. A tragic waste of a good concept, if limited. 4/10.
