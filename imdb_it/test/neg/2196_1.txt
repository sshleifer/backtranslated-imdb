[as a new resolution for this year 2005, I decide to write a comment for every movie I saw at the theater (10%) or on DVD (90%). <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the DVD has revolutionized this habit. For example, I can hear the true voice of the cast, which is an essential trait of personality. In my country, non-French films are dubbed and we end up with aberrations: the French voice is terrible, very far from its original tone! the same item for different people or the same people with different voices !!!! <br /> <br /> And well, if everyone found my comments useless, well, in 2006, I'll stop my reviews ... Ah, AH .... So enjoy them now !!!! ] <br /> <br /> My summary means that the story, the locations, the cast are not very funny ... <br /> <br /> Only .... <br /> <br /> Sandra bullock is there .. She is a talented actress, able to induce the viewer to capture the film .... <br /> <br /> Remember a feminine "the fugitive" .... So if look for a time to escape your life, watch this film gets worse because Sandra's life is a mess .... <br /> <br /> She had nothing to hold back, only her poor mother (who's sick of Alzheimer: again the touch for depression) .... <br /> <br /> Actually, she has a sad life at the beginning of the film, she has a sadder life in everything, to finally return to the end .. .. what a happy ending !!!! <br /> <br /> perhaps the writers wanted to make a point about the life of a nerd .... <br /> <br /> very far from the best computer movie of all time: * WARGAMES *
