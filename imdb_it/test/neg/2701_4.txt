Until now I didn't even like every single Jean Rollin film I've seen, and this has always bothered me because it's an acclaimed Euro-junk monument and extremely popular among the many reviewers on this beautiful website; people whose opinions I always appreciate and usually agree with. Apparently everyone always seems to focus on certain types of obscure and stylistic film brands in his work that are completely lost to me. Rollin's films are unimaginably boring, they all have the same basic concept (lesbian vampires in various settings), the dialogues are incredibly absurd, the wonderful gothic sceneries are always underused and the production values ​​are cheaper than the price of a ticket. 'bus. I had already given up Rollin's repertoire (especially after putting up with "The Iron Rose"), until I discovered "Night of the Hunted". Presumably, this film does not present any lame vampire lesbos and stands as an authentic horror film with macabre plot twists and macabre twists. And the verdict is ?? Yes and no! On the one hand, this is undeniably the most compelling and inventive Rollin movie I have had the pleasure of seeing so far (and also the only one I watch without dozing off?). On the other hand, it still remains a morally film with an absurd plot and sex sequences without emotions to compensate for the dullness. Jean Rollin tries hard to create an atmosphere of secrecy and suspense, mainly through the lack of information and vaguely introduced characters, but he can barely hide the fact that he doesn't really have a story to tell. The stunning lead actress Brigitte Lahaie and the wonderfully threatening musical guide are the only elements that keep you glued to the screen. During a night of returning home to Paris, a young man must suddenly stop for a confused and poorly dressed girl who comes running from the woods. Her name is Elisabeth, but she also can't remember anything about herself and what or who was running away. His case of amnesia is so serious that he constantly forgets who took her in his arms. The next day, she is kidnapped again by an old man and taken to a sinister apartment complex where several people in the same bizarre state of mind are held captive. Elisabeth knows nothing, but feels that she needs to escape from here. Obviously I will not reveal the epilogue, but I can assure you that it is rather stupid, illogical and far-fetched. Apparently Rollin understood it, because the explanation is kept very short and fast. There is a large number of excessively strange and senseless sequences, the sex movie is disastrous and filmed without passion, the bad effects of make-up seem cheap and randomly launched without a real purpose. As said, the score is mesmerizing and the perfect body of Brigitte Lahaie is addictive.
