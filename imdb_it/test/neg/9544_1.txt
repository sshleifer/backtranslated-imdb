I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except movie goers who like to laugh at a movie, not with it. <br /> <br /> A promising premise and a set of actors progressively worsen during a film that ends with perhaps the worst final ever seen in a movie. I don't want to ruin it, but in practice the most overused set of movie clich√©s is hurt and reluctantly for the last five most disappointing minutes of any movie, ever. <br /> <br /> The film also includes the most indolent scene ever, the attempt at chemistry on the screen between the two main roles when we are presented with a close-up of Angela Jolie caressing Denzel Washington's finger lovingly. It could be the only thing that could move, but that's precisely why the viewer is treated with a zoom of Washington's finger that is caressed amid soft lighting and the appropriate music for a sex scene is beyond me. I laughed hard and shook my head. <br /> <br /> The direction of the plot is borrowed heavily from Se7en, but here it is performed much more simplistically, and all too obviously. To call it a poor Sebiano would be a euphemism, this is nothing more than a TV movie and even the best efforts of Jolie and Washington cannot convince you that it is a movie at the box office.
