When a Stranger Calls belongs to this year's remake group, with films like Poseidon just beyond the horizon. Director Simon West (Con Air) works out this updated version, with many relative unknown casts, which indicate that the mortality rate is high (it is not), or that established stars are moving away from a potential turkey. <br /> <br /> With a clock of just 87 minutes, it is mainly composed of two acts. The first one, which requires a whole hour, is the setup. Our heroine, Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle), recorded 800 minutes of conversation on her cell phone (reckoning), and as a lesson of responsibility, her parents had confiscated her cell phone and grounded it. To pay off his debt, he works part-time as a babysitter, and looking after the children of the wealthy Mandrakis, is his first stint. <br /> <br /> The huge villa Mandrakis receives complete treatment, since this is where all the action will take place. A lot of rooms (makes for good hiding), an indoor pool-sized aquarium (to get wet, to treat with a wet shirt), and check it out - the motion detector lights, which you know, will contribute to the fears with the manipulation of lights and shadows. Of course, joking calls, false herrings are in abundance, which makes the runtime of this act, but most of them collapse in the suspense department. <br /> <br /> There is an emerging minor trend, with actors who do not see, who provide and act instead through their voice. Recent attempts include Edward Norton in the Kingdom of Heaven, and V for Vendetta by Hugo Weaving. Here, Lance Henriksen honors the anonymous, nameless, psychotic murderer, but falls to the ground. Why? The script does not give him much dialogue. Most of the phone calls made were of a silent nature (mind-masturbation), which I felt was a waste - they could even throw some stranger, and the job would still be over. <br /> <br /> the second act, in which the main action takes place, is too little and too late. And the black man, well, it's purely a scarecrow. Those who expect blood and blood will be disappointed, because in practice it is a one-person show to hold your attention in the first hour (the candy of the eyes always succeed), and this act will solve it all in the double fast time, wing Rachel McAdams in Red Eye. Don't expect any form of character development, or a subplot that will involve. <br /> <br /> The finale tried to be too smart for its good and turned out to be a cheap way to finish the film. There is not much goodness to highlight from this film - no fear, no chills, no enigmatic villains, and a lot of security flaws, especially with that door alarm - the only thing that is good for you is to provide a number for the 4D.
