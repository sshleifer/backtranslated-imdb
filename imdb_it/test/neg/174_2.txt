I've heard people compare this movie to Sideways. How this comparison was made, I will never guess why this film was not comparable to Sideways. <br /> <br /> These two films were as different as Star Wars and Thornbirds. The only thing they had in common was that they both had wine as a subject. <br /> <br /> Although the interviews in this documentary were semi-interesting, they were ruined by the absolutely worst photographic work ever ... attempted. I've never seen the worst camera work in my life and I'm comparing it with home videos taken by mistake from 5 year olds. <br /> <br /> I give this two stars, ONLY for the interesting interviews with French types of wine and to show how American wine companies are pushed and corrupted (aren't all companies intrusive and corrupt?), the I would give -10 stars (Yes, this is NEGATIVE 10) for the deplorable, terrible, horrible, terrible, VERTIGO-INDOVING, 5-year-could-do-better camera mess.
