This game comes from a genre of games that have tried to take advantage of the entire Myst-inspired trend: walking, talking to people, solving puzzles. The puzzles themselves are absolutely horrible, but I land myself in the acting itself, which is only slightly better. If you're looking for a convincing performance from a single character, you won't find it here, but this game is worth buying if only to watch Christopher Walken's exhilarating performance. His acting is so horrible in this game that he seems to be imitating someone who is impersonating him. He is a caricature of himself. <br /> <br /> So buy this game if you're a masochist, a Walken fan, or just want to hear the F-word a lot.
