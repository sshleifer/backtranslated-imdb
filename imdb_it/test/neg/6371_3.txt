I'm a fifth grade art teacher, and after reading this book (which the students loved), we saw the film. They laughed loudly! Unfortunately, it is NOT a comedy! The acting was so horrible, I felt like I was watching a group of kids in the neighborhood playing a comedy. My students imitated the jokes and enjoyed themselves all along the way. I have to agree with them, sometimes it was pretty bad. Again, I would show it to the students again, just for fun, and to compare the film with the book. We did a Venn Diagram (teachers know what it is) later, to show what was the same in both and what the differences were, so there is an educational value in showing it. I noticed that another adaptation was shot for 2005, so we can only hope that acting is better!
