I hope this was done before Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds because it was crap, Seagal didn't have to blame that it was the short director when the few action scenes took place. The plot was also confusing and in practice it simply ran out, maybe it was set aside and released to capitalize on Seagals' latest films ?? <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> Not finished yet, bring Under Siege 3 and lose weight!
