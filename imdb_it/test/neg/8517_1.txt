I saw this piece of pseudo-intellectual shit a couple of years ago, and now it's back to local cinema. Use every clich√© in the Indictual Movie Makers Handbook to appear as intellectual as the director probably imagines himself to be. Get your pace in run-of-the-mill slow motion, brown scale, slow pans through bombarded environments, vacuum, suffering facial expressions, too symbolic images and the miserable ending required. <br /> <br /> It is a complete failure, a perfect unintentional caricature of the typical Russian art film. Director Aleksandr Sokurov has an excellent command of the technique, but does not keep an eye on it. He does not see when he crosses the line in the realm of the pathetic. <br /> <br /> This film is a wet dream for those who hate art cinema. It lives up to every stereotypical vision of the kind that exists. <br /> <br /> If it were ugly in a funny way, it would be a turkey. But for a movie that is so bad that after you go crazy, we need a new term. This film is a Sokurov.
