If like me, you liked the first movie "Bruce Almighty", my advice for you is not to let your hopes hurt too much; in fact, he neglects all the hopes you have for this film if you are over 12 and have some sense of cinema. <br /> <br /> Without giving too far, the story sees Evan (Bruce's nemesis still from the first film) move home with his family to the Virginia suburbs to "change the world" with a new political path. What follows is a rather far-fetched and quite "silly" plot, which is obviously destined to affect children as the main target audience. Unlike his predecessor, Evan Almighty is a family-oriented film with the ambiguous genre of "comedy" labeled on its misleading "sequel" position which some would consider a classic of modern comedy that can be appreciated by a slightly public more mature and of high public level. <br /> <br /> In general, Evan Almighty is made up of terrible cinematic values. The acting; little man Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman, he was stiff and many of the characters were apparently cast to use the unnecessarily large budget issued for production. In addition, the cast includes the acting legend John Goodman, who makes an appearance like a heel and is seen only a few times in the film in its entirety; I didn't buy the character anyway and I thought that the plot he was involved in wasn't even thorough for a family comedy. Every other character in the film (especially wife and children!) Deserves a mention for their way of behaving so trivially that it could fill a Kiev king-size. Be warned though; it is the typical Americanized cheddar associated with many family-oriented mainstream films, so I would advise you to defend yourself with the nearest grater in sight. <br /> <br /> It might seem that the film is useless so far, however, it has positive-promising aspects. The CGI was exceptional and it was clear that he spent a lot of time modeling the Ark and producing effects of water and animation of computer-generated animals towards the end. The particles, renderings and textures used were aesthetically stellar. Although a part of me couldn't help, but I think they didn't deserve a film with such bad ideals and, in my opinion, they were "too good" for this piece of cinema and they brought the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, I consider this film a disaster in terms of a continuation of what was a huge potential franchise, but unfortunately it was not up to the Omnipotent series and approaching the end of the film I had set my expectations for an epic and a somewhat significant ending to make up for the mediocre content I had had so far. This was not the case and I was deeply disappointed and confused are the closing credits. While I was in a bad mood, I couldn't help thinking, but the film wasn't close to "Mighty" as I had hoped. In many ways the film reminded me of a "Night at the museum" watered down because it showed similar style and features, but unfortunately the championships were still below. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie 3 out of 10, as it's watchable, but it's definitely to be avoided! If you have to watch this movie, be prepared for disappointment because "moderately amused" is the best you can hope for by watching the production.
