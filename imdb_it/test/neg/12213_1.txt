I am an atheist with little love for certain aspects of Christian fundamentalism. <br /> <br /> That said, this film is reprehensible, vile and transparent. It only works at the level of the currently fashionable (and tired) hatred of white American Christian fundamentalism. If this film had been made on a fundamentalist family of Jews or Muslims, or even on a black Christian family, indignation would have been palpable, and the film would have been crumpled in all environments. At present, however, it is "OK" and "skilled" because white Christian fundamentalists remain one of the last "acceptable" targets for garbage like this. <br /> <br /> And it's really rubbish. If you want to see a quality movie with a similar inclination, find and watch or review "Badlands". Nothing good was done in "The King" which was not done better decades ago in that masterful film. <br /> <br /> As other reviewers note, the characters are almost completely underdeveloped in "The King", the lines are a nap, the cinematography is sluggish. We have seen the story of the sociopath better done 100 times. This film does not do it for reflective viewers.
