Yumiko (Wakana Sakai), the beautiful adopted daughter of a recently deceased Japanese businessman, inherits control of her father's company; his uncle Kazuo (Shun Sugata), annoyed that the business was not left to run, ordered a blow to his niece. When chef Jens-eared Kensuke (Takashi Okamura) accidentally enters the wrong hotel room and puts the hit-man Invincible (Jung Yuen) out of action, he is mistaken for the murderer and is sent to kill Yumiko. Instead, he falls in love with the beautiful heiress and ends up swearing to protect her. However, she is kidnapped by Kazuo's men while Kensuke is busy playing an arcade game with Daniel (Sam Lee). <br /> <br /> Uncle Kazuo holds Yumiko in a hypnotic trance and takes control of the business, but runs to a point of disturbance when her gangster friends threaten to reveal her illegal activities unless she gives him the total control. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Kensuke teams up with two martial arts experts, Lam Kau (Yuen Baio) and Lam Doi (Candy Lo) who is looking for Invincible. Learn Kung Fu and try to free Yumiko. <br /> <br /> A mixture of slapstick humor, spoofery scenes and fight scenes, No Problem 2 is a disappointing film considering the talent involved: the kung fu superstar of the 80s Yuen Baio runs a few scenes of fighting, but it's getting a little old for the stunts these days; director Kar Lok Chin offers the kind of stupid parody I would expect from a Scary Movie film; Jung Yuen resorts to mocking his character in the Scorpio operation; and Sam Lee ?? well, Sam Lee is as annoying as ever! <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Collin Chou, like the gangster Ben, struck me; he has a clearly strong screen presence that has not gone unnoticed by Hollywood - he has since starred in two Matrix movies and is about to appear in D.O.A., directed by Corey Yuen. I was also impressed by Wakana Sakai, but for a completely different reason: this beauty is easy to see and should go much further into the world of cinema. <br /> <br /> It's a bit of fun to practice which movies have been parodied, but at 104 minutes I found this film a real task to sit on. If people who make funny faces accompanied by stupid sound effects make you laugh, then No Problem 2 may interest you. Otherwise, I would let myself feel good.
