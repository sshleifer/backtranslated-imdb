License fees to watch this junk and pay for it with hard earned money? Without humor, no hint of laughter, God knows how he won a BAFTA! <br /> <br /> We have been subjected to "Eastenders" for twenty years. When, oh, when will the great British public go to see this horrible soap for what it is? Daddy crass! This program no longer describes the reality in the East End of London of everyday life in Beirut, and has never done. <br /> <br /> The Eastenders I know (the real ones) are kind, courageous, hard-working and loyal. And one of their greatest attributes is humor. It was the Eastenders who crossed the worst of the London smashes and attacked two more fingers until Hitler. And what do we see on our screens for five days of the week (including an omnibus)? Nothing but a bunch of moans, howls, "dead from the neck up", which seem to do little more than sit in a pub all day long sniping each other. What a great advertisement for Britain !! Do writers really believe this junk they are pumping out? Obviously the audience section has a sluggish mind, but then I heard that apparently anyone can be brainwashed to believe something.
