Well, how to start? I saw The Italian Job for the first time some years ago and by visiting a rental store I couldn't remember because I had a bad feeling about it. Now I do it. <br /> <br /> After voting for the ratings of this film I saw the statistics. Apparently this film is liked by less than 18 girls. No surprise. They didn't pay enough to make Charlize blink and I imagine some girls magazine rated Mark Wahlbergs "INCREDIBLE" abs. <br /> <br /> In addition to this film it is completely predictable, the actors are mainly B-stars forever and even the good guys are horribly abused, the film is full of obvious product placements and imagine this: it even succeeds to repeat itself without making a sequel! The first 15 minutes are the best part of the film and it's all downhill from there and once you understand that they decided to use the best time again, eventually repeating their golden robbery in detail. All in all, a lot of noise for nothing. <br /> <br /> I think Charlize Theron is good and Ed Norton could be more like before. Apart from the look of Donald Sutherland, "I am here too" at the beginning, I would say that this film should have a "passage if you are over 18".
