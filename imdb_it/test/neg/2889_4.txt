*** SPOILER ALERT *** Dishonest and confused malicious tragedy that has to do with a sinister plan to burn an important holiday resort before New Year's Day. Being insured for ten million dollars the man behind Valley View Estates in the Blue Mountains in Australia Julian Fane, Guy Doleman, is determined to bring his project into focus to be able to collect it. This must happen by January 1, two weeks before the project's insurance policy runs out. <br /> <br /> With his mind totally on his work builder and architect Howard Anderson, Tom Skerritt, he has no idea that his boss, Julian Fane, is planning to set fire to the resort he is building and probably will become the autumn boy. Anderson becomes a little suspicious when investigator Sophie McCann, Wendy Hughes, informs him of some very bogus events between Fane and the insurance company Proud Alliance. It turns out that Proud Allience is actually owned, or 60%, by Fane himself! This explains that Whey Fane is making all these arson attacks happen in order to collect the ten million dollars of insurance which is at least double what the entire Valley View Estates is worth! <br /> <br /> Then we have Sophie McCann murdered, in a false swimming accident, to prevent her from finding out what's going on with suspicious chips around and in Valley View Estates. It's when Lloyd's of London, who is signing Proud Alliance, insurance investigator George Engles, James Mason, shows that Fane takes a powder leaving his incendiary ace alone and out of control to blow up Fane's entire plan. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Anderson has become wise for both Fane and Engles who unlike Fane wants the Valley View Estates to go for reasons that are never clear, just look at the last few seconds of the movie to make it out account, by its author and director. The arsonist is exposed as he is about to do in his girlfriend with Anderson coming to his rescue. So we have this wild chase scene with the arsonist who gets lost in the Valley View construction site just to have set it on fire, with the help of Howard Anderson, where he ends up burning a fry when the firemen come to the tube him down. <br /> <br /> The sudden and inexplicable ending has never made clear exactly what happened at Big Cheese in this whole scheme of things about the sinister and evil Julian Fane. It is as if Fane managed to escape without sheriffs and only his unstable and unbalanced henchman, the arsonist, who was only the instrument of Fane's crimes, ended up as the only person who paid from them.
