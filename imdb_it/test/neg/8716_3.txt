But caricatures also need a plausible plot. I suppose that in 1934 a part of that audience long ago would have enjoyed this lukewarm farce. It doesn't age well. Give Nat Pendelton and Zasu Pitts experienced and experienced support players a shot at the main roles. Pendelton, who plays a leading role in the Thin Man series, does his best but is combined with a witty plot. With the background of being a theatrical game with gangster its not exactly original material. The saving grace of the film is the always excellent Edward Everett Horton in a wasted performance. But don't waste time looking at Everett in this movie. I would encourage anyone to see it in his Holiday effort, with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn. The same was from 1936, but much better script and plot. Gag better and needless to say even the power of the stars.
