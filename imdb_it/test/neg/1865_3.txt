This is a bad movie but, oh, well, this movie is no less disgusting than the third Ghoulies movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a bad film in terms of writing, directing, acting and basically everything in between. It has a story so weak, simple and ridiculous, that it also has little to do with the previous voices of the Ghoulies films. Try to link the film to the first movie "Ghoulies", from 1985, but on the other hand, if they really wanted to connect this film with its predecessors, then were the Ghoulies in this movie? But now we are having some small people, played by Tony Cox and Arturo Gil, dressed as demons. Not that the Ghoulies of the previous films were classic characters, but they were still the heart and soul of the film and also provided some fun to the movies. It's like having a Gremlins movie without the Gremlins. <br /> <br /> The film is not very interesting to watch because it lacks any tension, good humor, intriguing characters and practically everything else you can think of because it was put together by people who are obviously not the most talented of their business. Just like in the curriculum of director Jim Wynorski, with films like "The Witches of Breastwick" and its sequel, "Alabama Jones and the Busty Crusade", "House on Hooter Hill", "Scream Queen Hot Tub Party", "The Bare Wench "Project" and the sequels "The Bare Wench Project 2: Scared Topless" and "The Bare Wench Project 3: Nymphs of Mystery Mountain" and "The Da Vinci Coed". <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is rather silly and captivating, but it is not enough to enhance this film and give it more entertainment value.You know, it's the kind of cheap-looking movies with some special special effects, costumes, tricks and actors that no one has ever heard of . <br /> <br /> Still not the worst film in the series due to the fact that "Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go to College" is by far a worse film, since that had some horrible attempts at humor. This film, at least, still has some attempts to be serious and professional, even if the result f inale is far from perfect. <br /> <br /> Bad movie and maybe just watchable for those who have seen the previous rumors of Ghoulies. <br /> <br /> 3/10
