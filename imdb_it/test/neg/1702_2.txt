I had high hopes for this production, being one of my favorite works. <br /> <br /> In fact, many are reasonable: Helen Baxendale is not a bad Lady Macbeth, but there is no devilry that the original character is infused with. Many of the minor characters do well, and the Scottish settings are superb. <br /> <br /> The big disappointment for me is Jason Connery in the title role: he seems to be reading his lines from a splint card with the wrong glasses - certainly also for the first time. It can do much better. Any production compared to the sublime Ian McKellen (Macbeth 1979) that in my opinion gave the performance to the gold standard, will find it hard to be appreciated, but in reality I fell asleep and had to rewind it before I could cross it - hardly a big sign. <br /> <br /> Honestly, one to avoid.
