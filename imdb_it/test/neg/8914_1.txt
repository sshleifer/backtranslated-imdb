TDY is probably the single worst piece of junk that has ever hit the video selection. They take a scene from The Order with Jean Claude Van Damme and this makes me angry because Van Damme is a favorite for the comedy of the movie B. Segal has done a good job in the past, but he fell very low in my books and probably not he will never extract another undersiege or marked for death unless he sits down and has a very good brainstorming session with himself. <br /> <br /> It also annoys me that he didn't do many of his stunts like he did in the previous movies. In conclusion of all this if you are ready to see a suitable film for a garbage can or a woodchipper, then rent today you die.
