Set in 1976 for no apparent reason other than to keep the experts busy, "The Box" was directed by Richard Kelly ("Donnie Darko"), and interpreted Cameron Diaz and James Marsden as Norma and Arthur Lewis, a young couple who allegedly struggling financially even though both have successful careers - she as a high school teacher, he as an optical specialist at NASA's Langley, Virginia, Research Center. They have a son, Walter (Sam Oz Stone). One day the Lewis find a package on the doorstep, containing a black box with a big red button. There is a note from a "Mr. Steward 'indicating that he will return at 5:00 PM to explain the box. <br /> <br /> The mysterious Arlington Steward, played by Frank Langella, shows up at the appointed time, elegantly dressed in an elegant men's Savile Row, he is polite but professional, yet his most noticeable feature is his face, half of which seems to have been blown away and improperly cared for, Langella is the only thing that is worth it's worth watching in the film, but it's unfortunately overshadowed by his own make-up, reminiscent of Harvey's "Two Face" Dent (Aaron Eckhart) from Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight." he can try to ignore it, but it is more than a little distraction. <br /> <br /> Steward explains that he will be back in 24 hours to pick up the button, if, during this period, they decide to unlock and press the button, they will give their $ 1 million in cash - the only outlet - and it's big - is that from here A stranger's part will die. It could be in the city, it could be in another continent, however Steward assures them that the victim will be someone unknown to them. As a demonstration of good faith, he leaves them with a $ 100 bill, their to keep if they press the button or not. <br /> <br /> Arthur and Norma are skeptical, believing that the whole thing is a scam or an elaborate joke, yet it doesn't take long before they start wondering what would happen if they pressed the button? Would they really have a million dollars? Does anyone really die? Tired of speculation, Norma slaps the button. Nothing happens. However, their initial relief gives way to the alarm when Steward shows up the next day with a briefcase full of money. They decide to call it all, but Steward tells them it's too late. "You have already pressed the button," he explains. As Steward's limousine moves away, Arthur notices the license number, which he later discovers is registered with the NSA (National Security Agency). <br /> <br /> At this point the film begins to veer deeply into the inaccessible territory as secondary characters begin to sprout blood from the nose and flashing peace signs. Meanwhile, the city is invaded by plump, jaw-dropping geeks in bad shirts who begin to follow Arthur around like a scouting party in advance for a race of alien zombie nerds. Eventually Arthur is trapped by the menacing library mice in the library (?), Where is the scornful wife of Steward - whom we have never seen so far - and informs Arthur that to get out of the library he must enter one of them of three vertical columns of poor-looking digital water effects. "What happens if I choose the wrong one?", Asks Arthur, appearing much less baffled than he should be in the circumstances, and certainly much less baffled than the public right now. "Eternal damnation," the spinster says spinster. <br /> <br /> Arthur enters the central column of the digital liquid effects, and after a brief absence suddenly appears, still in his water cocoon, poised on Norma's bed. When she wakes up and sees him, the water bubble bursts and Arthur falls on the bed in a rain of water that, strangely, continues to drip from the water pipes over the camera while a soggy Marsden and Diaz flop on the bed . <br /> <br /> It's confusing, I know. <br /> <br /> In the end we find out that Steward was once the NSA public relations officer until he was struck by lightning that destroyed part of his face. He was declared dead, but later came back to life, turning into a sort of superman who now serves "those who do lightning", and whose powers enabled him to conquer the CIA, the NSA and NASA all by himself . <br /> <br /> And what's the point of all this junk nattering? Apparently, Steward's mission is to subject human beings to a sort of test on biblical characters (for example, "Bond of Isaac"), to determine whether humanity deserves to be saved. If enough people pass the button test and refuse to push it, the Steward masters will become the race. Unfortunately, those people who push the button, like Norma and Arthur, must be punished for their morality without a backbone, to which they are subjected to a series of dark "Lady or the Tiger" trials that take place as one of those "Ho seen the movies, "except without the funny gore or the benefit of a coherent plot. <br /> <br /> 'The Box' represents the kind of useless mental masturbation that freshman philosophy students like to chat after a few beers. Richard Kelly's tedious exercise of an existentialist mess eventually collapses under the weight of his own incomprehensibility; the tortured melange of unbearable ideas finally freezes, as with the mixing of too many colors, in a clumsy gray meander of an insipid film like one of those flying narcotic films whose plot suffers more or less than having been interrupted by a light nap. <br /> <br /> There is a point in "The Box" where Arthur, who is a technical minded guy, becomes curious to know how the button works. Opening the unit, he is disappointed not to find anything inside. <br /> <br /> After seeing The Box, I know exactly how it feels.
