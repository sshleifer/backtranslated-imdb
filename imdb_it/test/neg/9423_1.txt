I was told about this movie by a friend who saw him late at night during the week. He told me it was so bad that I had to see it! So I went to an auction site and bought the movie. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. It makes you laugh when you really shouldn't. Terrible acting and terrible plot. Also it doesn't look like Michael Jackson ?! <br /> <br /> I still recommend buying this movie as one of the funniest things you've ever seen. Van Peebles is a joke in this film. <br /> <br /> Robots can't bluff ... PSYCHE! <br /> <br /> I must say that the special effects are really incredible ... PSYCHE! DVDs were probably out when this movie came out, but if I had done it my way it would have been a real VHS, yes people are so bad!
