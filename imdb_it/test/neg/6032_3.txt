Very clich√©. Quite trivial. The acting gets worse as the show goes on. Don't believe anything that people say about the "realism" that this film should represent. It's just a shoot'em up. An interesting turning point since the VC that besieged the base had a human face and was not portrayed as an incarnate of evil.
