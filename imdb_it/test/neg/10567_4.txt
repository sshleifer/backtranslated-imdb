From almost alien lasers, to an elementary school style shuttle fight, "Nightbeast" is best classified as a farcical mix of fake blood and bare chest. The almost pornographic style of the film seems to be a failed attempt to recover from a lack of cohesive or effective stories. However, the acting is not nearly beastly, many of the young aspiring actors show off a hidden talent admirably. In particular Don Leifert and Jamie Zemarel, who poured a very necessary piece of light on this otherwise terrible film. Nightbeast would never have appeared on the set if he had known the terrible cinematic talent of this little Maryland town.
