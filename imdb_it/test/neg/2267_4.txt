If you really loved GWTW, you will find the story quite disappointing. Those who may think that this is only a romantic and southern story will probably be satisfied with this decent television production (although I consider it an important mistake in choosing Scarlett). But let me tell you that, considering the novel, nothing good came out of it. <br /> <br /> I've read GWTW more than 20 times and I can really appreciate the adaptation that Mrs. Mitchell has made for the film. It took me some time to understand how beautiful the ending was: Scarlett knew for sure that she would recover Rhett, since she always got what she wanted. But in the end there was no kiss. <br /> <br /> Then Alexandra Ripley came to "solve" this by showing us exactly how perfect and powerful Scarlett could be, and, of course, describing in detail how she gets exactly Rhett back even when she had an important relationship with someone else (nothing could have been further from Mrs. Mitchell's mind, I'm sure). <br /> <br /> The story between these points is in my opinion only a long and boring ride made to tie the ends, show costumes and scenarios just to give us an obvious and totally useless ending. <br /> <br /> If Margaret Mitchell could come back to life, she would die once again at the very moment she would find out what became Scarlett after GWTW. <br /> <br /> It certainly isn't fair to compare this to the original, but this is not GWTW's fault. It's not true? Is it okay if I don't compare it to the original? Could be. I'm sorry to say that I don't really care. <br /> <br /> I would expect a little more compromise to continue the work (suberb) of someone else, otherwise don't even try.
