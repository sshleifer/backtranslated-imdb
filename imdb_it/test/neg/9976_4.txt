Yellow-fanatic Fellows: do you pay attention and / or proceed with caution? for this film it is not exactly what it seems to be. It certainly looks like a Yellow, with his juicy VHS cover (which shows a naked girl with big breasts and a big bloody knife), the rhythmic title and the names of two veteran Italian actors in the cast (John Phillip and Fernando Rey), but basically it's just an erotic thriller without too much plot. The version I saw is supposedly severely censored ?? with a running time of just 77 minutes ?? but then there is still a serious lack of suspense, character development and above all sadism (and typically yellow). "Eyes Behind the Wall" can be briefly summarized as the collection of a group of perverted characters and the extended representation of their sexual problems. Despite an interesting effort, because the writer / director Giuliano Petrelli (his only film) has clearly tried to do something special, but the overall result is unsatisfactory and unfortunately domesticated. Inspired by Hitchcock's "back window", the main character is a frustrated senior and wheelchair-bound writer. He and his much younger lover take their sexual kicking from spying on the only male tenant who lives across the street. The tenant, respectively, likes to perform gym exercises at home while he is naked and clearly has bisexual desires. The guy in a wheelchair sends his wife and they have sex. Then, there is also Ottavio the butler who repeatedly rapes the students. Are there normal characters in the story? Well no, of course not! The film benefits from an always threatening atmosphere, with a moody soundtrack and refined photography, but none of them ever leads anywhere, so it's all just crap and meaningless sex. There is a really bizarre twist / turn at the end of the story, but it comes too late and too randomly to increase overall quality. Not recommended for fans of horror / cult Italian cinema, but perhaps it is a great vision for psychology students, to analyze Freud-style characters.
