... I normally hate word games, but this seems like the only appropriate summary for "Barnyard". I suspect I'm not the first one. And I'm sure that many, many observations focus on the idiocy of bulls with breasts. It definitely bothered me right away. But there is much more wrong with this film than a fundamental lack of knowledge about how mammals work. <br /> <br /> Personally, if I were a parent, I would be irritated by the violent turn at the end of the showdown with the coyotes. (Although for me, at least he injected a small action.) And from the point of view of conventional screen writing, you might expect the coyotes to play a bigger role in the conflict (Gee- you have a "widow" cow ... maybe Has her "husband" been killed by coyotes? No ... there is a much more stupid explanation.) And what kind of farm is this? Otis swears to protect all animals from harm, but there seems to be no threat to humans. They refer to the fact that the farmer is vegan, but what is he raising pigs for? In all animal stories for children - Babe, Charlotte's Web, you call it ... the reality of life on the farm is at least touched. Perhaps our friendly farmer is running some sort of rescue shelter (there is some reference to this, but it is never explained). But all the farmer gets in return is an abuse from a horse in a scene that should be fun, but he left me seriously wondering if he was going to end up buried in a shallow grave behind the barn. And what the hell is the deal with "Wild Mike"? It was like the Gimp scene in Pulp Fiction without the ball-gag. <br /> <br /> Add in some really terrible attempts to emotional scenes, an almost total lack of laughter, and those UDDERS, and you've got the worst children's movie I've seen in ages. Generally public only on IMDb to highlight a film that is not so famous, not to slam the current box office success # 2. But this film made me angry. He was taking up space in my local theater, a space that could have been used to show something useful. This summer there was a lot of good entertainment for the family - in fact there were at least 2 other children's movies playing in the same multiplex. But I'm not allowed to see something like "Little Miss Sunshine", so Viacom can deceive families for an additional $ 30. At least I got a free pass. <br /> <br /> I know that at 35 without children, this film was not designed for me. But there is no excuse for such a lazy and terrifying children's film like "Barnyard" in the Pixar era. I was bored by the "Ice Age" movies, but they certainly didn't irritate me like "Barnyard". "Shark Tale" was a weak attempt at street hipness, but he had a few laughs. After all, you can activate Nickelodeon at any time of day and see something more fun and intelligent, which is why they should be ashamed to have put their name on this junk. <br /> <br /> I'm giving it a 2 out of 10, just because Pip The Mouse was sporadically funny, and Maria Bamford had some funny jokes like the peasant wife. Well, not the farmer's wife. Some other farmer. They didn't really explain who he was. They have not explained many things. Especially not because Sam Elliot - the last "man of the man" - had a wiggling breast down there. Horrifying.
