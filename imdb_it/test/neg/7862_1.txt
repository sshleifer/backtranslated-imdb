Curse of the Wolf begins as reluctant Werewolf Dakota (Renee Porada) manages to escape from his "pack" and in the city where 6 months later he works in a veterinarian. The rest of the Dakota pack is unhappy and they want it back, their leader Michael (Todd Humes) says he will come back to them but the fat Werewolf Franklin (Brian Heffron) picks up his scent and the pack decides to force the problem and bring it back back using her affections for her human friends including her boyfriend Danny (Dennis Carver). Can Dakota save Danny and finally get rid of his pursuers? I doubt it will interest you ... <br /> <br /> Executive product, written and directed by Len Kabasinski who also had a fairly important role in the film as Stick I feared watching Curse of the Wolf since Kabasinski was the man behind Swamp Zombies (2005), which is certainly one of the worst films ever made, ever. Unfortunately my worst fears have been confirmed and one has to say that Curse of the Wolf is a really horrible film anyway, both conceptually and technically. Curse of the Wolf is the genre of films in which the low budget determines what happens and the script rather than the script that dictates the budget. You have the impression that everything has been written and designed to take advantage of the few sets and actors they have had, you can almost imagine that the producers say we have a couple of actors, some basic equipment and a couple of positions to make a horror film around them. The story is terrible (Michael finds Dakota's position by looking at a big dog that two women are walking around), the characters are horrible (a big werewolf that runs a lot), the dialogue is terrible (almost every line in the thing) and there is never any motivation for everything that happens (why is the pack so desperate to get Dakota back?), people do seemingly random things and since the director Kabasinski is in the martial arts he insists on putting in a lot of martial arts fight sequences in the plot. No offense but this is meant to be a horror movie and not martial arts, right? In fact, apart from the presence of some werewolves, you would be hard pressed to describe Curse of the Wolf as something that comes close to a horror movie. At almost two hours of duration it seems to go on forever and it's so slow and without incident that it's not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Director Kabasinski was obviously working on a low budget, but making films that badly should be a crime. There is no continuity between the shots, the fight scenes are horrible and they are so badly staged that it is not true and it is sometimes impossible to follow what happens due to the uncertain editing and the poor angles of the camera or the fact that Sometimes it's so dark that I literally can't see anything. Seriously there are moments in Curse of the Wolf where the screen is completely black and you can't see anything, I hate having to watch it from a low resolution blurry VHS. Even the sound is terrible, you can hear the wind and the breeze against the microphone! There are also many other unpleasant and unwanted sounds of the environment during almost every scene. Does production actually have gears during production? He doesn't feel like it. The special effects consist mainly of Werewolf masks that resemble the type of Halloween shops for children, they look horrible in practice. <br /> <br/> Technically the Curse of the Wolf is as terrible as them, I am sorry because I know this is a low budget but it is really horrible to sit down and try to get some entertainment. This is the quality of high school film students, I'm sorry if this seems unkind, but it's a fact. The acting is, well, you can probably guess, so I'll stop here before I say something else negative, I mean I've already done enough and I don't like it at all. <br /> <br /> Wolf's Curse is terrible, both conceptually and technically this is a real task to sit down. Curse of the Wolf is the kind of film in which, while you watch it, time seems to have stopped, it's the kind of film that lasts almost two hours and yet lasts two years. One of the worst movies you or I love to see, definitely one to avoid.
