this could have been better, but it was fine ... it helped me escape from my boredom. I didn't even want to see it, the only reason I wanted to rent it is because Jamie Martz is in it ... he is an unknown actor, but he is brilliant and it is the highlight of the film ... the ending was so horrible and the acting was it was good for a movie ... they give me 4 out of 10
