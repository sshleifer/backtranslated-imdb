I'm used to being patient with movies because I usually find that it usually pays off. But some works take new levels and enter the realm of provocation .... "Last year at Marienbad" comes to mind. Well, "Pola X" is not "last year at Marienbad". I can count on one side on the number of films I have dropped over the years. "Pola X" has achieved membership in that august group. In my defense, I believe I made a courageous effort to maintain my position - hoping things would turn upside down. However, I finally threw in the towel as soon as I feared the 90-minute mark - fairly respectable under the circumstances. "Pola X" does not come close to the promise of Carax's previous work. After a 10-year break, it must have been really bitter for him. Melville still runs in his grave!
