BELL WITCH HAUNTING (aka THE HAUNT) is an American horror film apparently based on real events that occurred between 1817 and 1821. <br /> <br /> This should not be confused with BELL WITCH: THE MOVIE , the film is played by Betsy Palmer based on the same events. However, I can say that I wish I had seen this other film instead of what I saw! I liked the chilling performance of Betsy Palmer on Friday 13th. As such, I believe that even on a bad day, he would get a better performance than anyone involved in the disguise known as THE HAUNT. <br /> <br /> As for my column, this film is not painful to watch because the content is disturbing. It's painful to watch because it's simply boring. <br /> <br /> Reading the positive reviews for this film, I could only identify three possibilities. The first possibility: these authors have been involved in the production in some way. The second possibility: the authors, although not directly involved, were paid to write positive reviews after the production was completed. The last possibility - none of these authors saw a sufficient number of horror films and therefore is inexperienced with the concepts that use the attempts of success. <br /> <br /> The setting for the plot is Robertson County, Tennessee. James Johnston receives a visit from two journalists eager to hear the story of Bell Witch. The story is told as a series of flashbacks. A series of supernatural events begins in the home of John Bell and his family. He will soon discover that behind everything there is a spirit of revenge. <br /> <br /> Apparently the plot seems to be a matter of standard poltergeist, even if based on real events. <br /> <br /> Where execution of the brilliant concept is concerned however, almost everything that could go wrong does not work. And then some! <br /> <br /> Firstly, acting. The acting is almost uniformly terrible across the board. This factor causes the greatest damage to production, undermining any possible credibility of belief or interest on the part of the viewer. The voice of the vengeful spirit seems more like a young girl who experiences adolescent anxiety rather than a powerful demonic force expressing malevolent intentions. I almost laughed when I heard some of his lines. Unfortunately, this rumor started to get very annoying very quickly! I may not have been alive in 1800, but I find it incredibly difficult to believe that any young woman alive at that time would talk the way this "ghost" does! <br /> <br /> Second, the management. The direction is random and very irregular. Some scenes show promise but the potential is dispelled by the clearly inexperienced director. Nothing is done with the camera, with sound or with lighting to add intensity to scary scenes. The atmosphere is equally flat. A vengeful spirit is presumably behind supernatural events. Yet the effects are so incredibly inept that no one who has seen a suitable horror film can buy them. I will give an example. In one scene, the spirit attacks someone. Watch the scene for yourself. It's almost funny - almost. <br /> <br /> Third, the script. While it is possible that the events shown are true to actual event reports, there is no denying that most of the scenes are incredibly flat and boring. The scenes shorter than two minutes feel much longer thanks to the poor dialogue - a dialogue that fails to add depth to the characters or to the story. This film is too dependent on conversations to advance the story. Although this style was also the case in the British films of the apogee of the British horror of the '60s and' 70s, it cannot be denied that the exchange of dialogues were always interesting to look at in these earlier professional works. For example, Peter Cushing could read a telephone directory and still attract the attention of viewers. The same cannot be said of the actors of THE HAUNT. <br /> <br /> Finally, humor. The misguided attempts at humor in this film are heartbreaking. An obese boy is the target of many jokes. A particularly horrible scene sees the boy said going to the outdoor bathroom. This scene should never have been included, but it is complete with sound effects in case you can't understand what it's doing! <br /> <br /> The only positive points of the film are the location and the costumes. The decision to take the picture near the original location helped to add authenticity. The costumes were also well chosen. <br /> <br /> Overall, THE HAUNT is a scary movie. It's not even in the league "so bad it's good". It's just boring instead. I advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague. Don't even worry about seeing it for free! <br /> <br /> I've never seen the other Bell Witch movie. But it really couldn't be worse than THE HAUNT. Can he? I'll give this other film a chance if I can find it. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, I would advise everyone here to take a look at some real horror films about ghosts and disturbing ones. THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, RINGU, THE GRUDGE (Japanese original) and ONE MISSED CALL (Japanese original) are good places to start.
