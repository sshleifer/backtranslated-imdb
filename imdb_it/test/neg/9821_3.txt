The book gets 10 out of 10 stars ... <br /> <br /> IT PROBABLY CONTAINS SPOILERS OF BOTH THE BOOK AND THE FILM !!! <br /> <br /> If you have never read Rogue Male by Geoffrey Household, the base material for Man Hunt, you will probably appreciate the way Fritz Lang has treated the story. On the other hand, if you are in my field and have practically memorized the book, the film will be an overwhelming disappointment. I imagine you have already read a synopsis of the story and proceed to my complaints. The small novel by Household is one of the great suspense classics of all time, tense and bare, with only a handful of characters to push the action. Fritz Lang and his screenwriter Dudley Nichols feel the need to throw the protagonist's brother and a nice sprite, the second of whom reduces the depth of the story by injecting an extrinsic motivation into the script where the novel needed nothing. In reality, the true climax of the book was not the escape of the nameless narrator from his underground lair, but rather his self-acceptance of his true motive for hunting in the first place. And this is another thing: if David Fincher and Quentin Tarantino manage to get us up to Fight Club and Kill Bill 1 without revealing the names of their respective protagonists, why can't Lang? "Thorndyke?" What hat did they get out of? Which brings me to my sharpest complaint: the Household hunter is so typically English, that he could bleed a Union Jack if you cut him. But Walter Pigeon, who plays him, is Canadian! He can hardly bear the accent, which is only slightly deeper and more convincing than Kevin Costner is in Robin Hood. He looked good in the role, and was a good actor for the 1940s, but as the reluctant hero of Rogue Male? Let's take a look at Sceptered Isle itself for a more convincing version. Remake early with subtlety and with, please! Will I direct it for free?
