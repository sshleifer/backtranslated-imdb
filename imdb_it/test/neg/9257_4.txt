This film was released in the United Kingdom under the name Blood Rites. It was issued outright and never presented again for release. <br /> <br /> Like The Ghastly Ones, it was presumably a hit with the starving inhabitants of the famous Grindhouse circuit on 42nd Street in New York. If you're looking for a damn horror movie, you'll find it in this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately to see how Colin (Hal Borske) disabled for development falls on a live rabbit, you have to endure the flickering 16mm photographic work that makes Ed Wood look really wonderful. <br /> <br /> Three sisters spend three days on the family farm with their husbands before the old man's money is paid out. Of course, in such a situation, people start to fall dead. Family secrets are exposed and a lot of blood is spilled, especially during a frightening dismemberment. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the piece of rabbit that the British opposed, I know I did.
