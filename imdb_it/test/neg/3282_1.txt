Robert Montgomery-Myrna Loy farce of Loy (Irene) and her boyfriend, played by Reginald Owen, stuck in Labrador when their plane crashes. (That's exactly what should have happened to this highly predictable movie.) Montgomery lives there while waiting for her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Surprise! Montgomery and Loy are soon attracted to each other. The scene with the bear is thus invented. We knew he was a bear that had always been tamed. <br /> <br /> Complications arise when Clara introduces herself. Loy wants Montgomery to tell Clara that they should part, when he refuses, he wants to leave immediately. <br /> <br /> You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out how it will end. Outside with all that snow, it's too cold for anyone!
