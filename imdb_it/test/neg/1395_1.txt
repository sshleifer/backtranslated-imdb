... so where is my fucking trophy? I seriously expected a banner and confetti to fall from the ceiling to watch the 30 minutes full of that shit. Comedy Central is really dropping the ball lately, trying to fill the gap left by Chappelle with more seasons than a retarded person who plays retarded men. Dah duh nah !! If you pay attention to the show, you will notice that when Mencia does not stutter beyond the lines and laughing at her skits, she only makes exaggerated remarks that seem devoid of sense of humor. Have you ever noticed how the people in Buick's guide really slow down? It's like Dah duh nah! Not even the half-naked dwarves and chicks manage to distract themselves from Mencia's distinct lack of talent. Moreover, Mencia is not even a "wetback" as he constantly and categorically proclaims he is, which makes him a fraud above all else. <br /> <br /> If something good could be said about Mencia, it is his effort. The man clearly has no talent, but like a wounded antelope in the mouth of a hungry alligator, God knows he is trying.
