A collection of western tourists in Africa suffers the misfortune of their plane crashing, so they are forced to board a bus to cross the Namibian desert to reach the point of departure closest to civilization. Not surprisingly, the driver's compass ends up not working, and they find themselves off the road, stopping in a deserted ghost town that had been a barracks during the fighting of World War II. They find kerosene (useless in terms of filling the tank of their bus), a warehouse full of carrots half poisoned in tin cans and an indigenous hermit who watches them with indifference. The only one among them who seems to have something at stake in terms of survivalist techniques is looking for help. They have to remove the tires from the bus and burn them if they don't come back in five days: hopefully someone will see the black smoke. <br /> <br /> Do you find it interesting? Well, of course, even if it sounds very similar to * The Flight of the Phoenix * or any number of films in the "desert island" genre. This is why it is surprising that * The King Is Alive * is the number 4 (if someone is still counting) in the current series "Dogma 95", which, if I remember correctly that ridiculous "Dogma 95 Vow of chastity", proclaimed that "film of gender "are strictly verboten. Ops. Well, anyway, you can say that it will try to be all artistic and stuff to make up for the fact that it's a genre movie. Yes, it doesn't take long for a member of the group, an old withered theater actor, to start scribbling - out of memory! - the various roles of * King Lear * on, well, paper rolls. The idea is that playing the game will help pass the time. All this really goes against the survivor's advice to remain optimistic (hasn't the old actor ever done a theatrical performance of * The Odd Couple * only once in his life?), Regardless of an activity like that of a colossal waste of precious time and energy. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I really don't know how to continue. He is so monumentally stupid, so full of situations and absurd characters that he begs rational criticism. It could be an opportune moment to offer a complete revelation: I disregard this so-called "movement" of Danish cinema to an almost irrational extent. I think my face becomes slightly red at the mere mention of Dogma 95. First of all, if the name of your movement has the word "dogma" in the title, you've already lost me; secondly, in this particular case, the insistence of the movement on the abnegation of individual artistic results is a recipe for the hypocrisy of the arc when it is considered that the filmmakers here are looting one of the greatest works of the greatest INDIVIDUAL writer who ever lived. (But, no doubt, the Dogma crowd believes that the Works of Shakespeare have actually been written by a consortium of Elizabethan big boys like the Earl of Oxford, Francis Bacon, Walter Raleigh, and the queen herself.) <br /> < br /> Hell, I could have forgiven the whole enterprise if it had played the scenario for farcical purposes (attacking the precious Dogma - now THAT it would be subversive!). But the film takes itself very seriously and soon turns into clich√©s about the genre in which it unequivocally belongs: people who are opposed; men who grow beards; the inevitable death of some of the main actors. All with a straight face. "Is this the final promise?" Well, not really: we also have to endure the abyssal transfer of DV. Because this is another rule of dogma 95 Vow of Chastity: manual digital video only. Some friendly advice for the Danes: your "movement" is in trouble when your finished product has a worse visual quality than a normal high school home video. Professionalism belongs to the baggage of tricks of an artist, right next to his individuality. "Artisan" and "artist" are similar words, Mr. von Trier: not all absurdities with a free hand of $ 100 can be a director. Pass it on. And anyway: let your Dogma directors be credited for their films while you're at it. The fact that the writer of * The King Is Alive * receives credit, while the boy (or girl) who is actually filming it, is only a little hypocritical. <br /> <br /> Contemptible. 1 out of 10 stars.
