I became interested in this film because someone had made a beautiful video for Bj√∂rks "Bachelorette" with clips from it. So I saw the movie. And it's really incredibly beautiful. A masterpiece of animation. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story does not stand comparison. Start off well, with interesting plots about the people who fence for possession of the Bride of the Roses, but suddenly the elevators fill with water and lose their walls, people float away and, finally, for no reason, Utena is turned into a car , and High-speed hunting follows. <br /> <br /> I really like the anime because of its ability to create alternative universes, but this universe is simply stupid. If you watch this movie, the sound turns, it's better this way.
