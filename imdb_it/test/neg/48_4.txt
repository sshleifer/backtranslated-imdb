It's Saturday, it's raining, and I think every movie should have at least one comment ... so I just watched "The Crime Doctor's Courage" to the end. It's a mystery of murder with a typical cast of characters, and a couple of usual suspects - each with their own possible reason for the crime. The story begins abruptly and the viewer is thrown into the plot without any character development or narrative whatsoever. I guess it's not too surprising for a B series movie of this period. There are also some moments that seem to be before the Second World War, but perhaps this is due to the writer's background in radio programs. <br /> <br /> The "Doctor of Crime" is the detective who visits California for some R & R from his psychiatric practice on the east coast. He connects with a mysterious novelist friend with whom it is implied that he was with him for one or more previous mysterious chaplains. The novelist occasionally fills the role of assistant for our investigators (AKA Dr. Watson), and occasionally lightens things up with some comic relief (sort of). <br /> <br /> There is also a rather simple way, but not entirely a police captain who is sometimes annoyed by the intruding investigator. And then there are the mysterious Braggas, a brother and a sister who are dancers in a nightclub. Dance is a kind of interpretative dance that seems to be one of those moments that seem more like the 30s than the 40s. Although the story is set in California, the Braggas seem to live in a castle! <br /> <br /> There was an element of the plot that could make me have some fun, but I won't divulge more than that because I always enjoy the movies more when the story is discovered, rather than known in advance. (although I can think of many, many, B movies that could give a higher score and it's hard to say that watching this is a time well spent) I haven't seen any other movie in the "Crime Doctor" series, so I may not comparisons
