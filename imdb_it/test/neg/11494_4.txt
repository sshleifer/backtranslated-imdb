I just finished reading the Forsyth novel "Icon". I thought it was one of the most thorough, detailed and eye-popping books I've ever read, certainly in my top 10. I acquired a DVD version of the book starring Swayze. OK, first of all I would like to point out that it would have been impossible to adequately adapt the novel to a 2.5-hour movie time, so I understand that the teams are right to influence the version of the book and are different. However, when I say "defer" what I really should say is "take the characters from the book, add some, leave a little out, remove the plot of the book, add a new modern storyline, add Frederick Forsyth's name somewhere ". I'm not saying this was a bad photo, far from it, some of the effects were top notch and acting wasn't bad. History has sucked and is not based on logic or reality. Forsyth's novel was so beautiful and real and altered the facts of reality instead of exaggerating .. This could have been much more if his time had been taken and written in a series of 10 parts. If you haven't read the book, then wait for a decent TV movie with a good acting cast, if you've read the book, try to forget it while you watch it.
