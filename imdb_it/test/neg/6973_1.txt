Thank god! What can we say about this bizarre and amazing fake tale about Ed Wood's disguised fantasies ?? Well, a word that comes to mind is inconsistent! Wood uses raw slabs of harmless and random archive material, and then builds a "story" around them - and what a story !! Wood himself plays Glen, a habitual Joe who enjoys relaxing in his girlfriend's lingerie and sweaters. I think what Wood wanted was a call to tolerance for all the Glens in this world by proving that Glen is just like all of us below, only in angora. Ummm ... ok. But then, we get this very bizarre montage of a horny devil, a chick in slavery, some rude, indicator people, some archive footage, and finally an emaciated Bela Lugusi, who plays a kind of intricate and invalid puppet master. Lugosi is a howl, which emits such garbage as "Beeevaaare ... the beeeg greeeen dragon that can be seen at hand: the leeetle boys, the tails of the puppies and the snails beeeeeg fall asleep!" Um, ok, Bela ...: = 8 / There is a strange, twisted logic of the wood that is happening here. After all, it reminds us that "7 out of 10 men wear hats and 7 out of 10 men are bald". Hmmm, it must be that alien / cross-dressing / habidashery cowspiracy-thang !! Glen or Glenda recites a plethora (whatever it is ...) of trustworthy wood schlock actors, including Lyle Talbot, Delores Fuller and Timothy Farrell, and Wood manages to convince every little unfortunate and non-talented out of each of them . By now everyone knows the sad story of Bela: when Wood used it for this flic, he was probably looking for a further correction and he needed the moolah, but even for him this is a depth not yet reached. One of MooCow's favorite Wood moomites comes with the sequence of buffalo scenes that load the images - it's so demented sadly !! The MooCow says "Puuuull de schtriiiiings" and brings clogs on a copy of Glen or Glenda - you won't believe it! : ??
