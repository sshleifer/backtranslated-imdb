I'm a big fan of science fiction movies. So when I saw this movie in the EPG, I thought I'd spend a pleasant evening. What a disappointment ! A display so poor of "special" effects that I could not imagine in 1980, but in 2005? Come on, why would you do the special effects of a helicopter flying in the desert when you can film a real one at a much lower price (I imagine)? And those killer "muppets" ... well, I could do better in a couple of hours in the garage. You can expect to have a low budget for a movie, but I don't think it's reasonable to have a low movie for any budget. As for the "star" of the film (I use many quotes tonight ...), Lou Diamond Philips, the boy is not even remotely an actor. Maybe he should have stayed in martial arts movies. All in all, a terrible film. Maybe I'm in a bad mood tonight. Then again, maybe not. A sincere 1 in 10.
