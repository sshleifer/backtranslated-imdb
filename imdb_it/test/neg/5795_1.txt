In the last years of the reign of Ron Miller (son-in-law of Walt Disney cum Producer) he churned out a live-action bullshit on a stick, often starring the boring Dean Jones, whose entire career was based on that kind of light, tariff per head empty. Other horrible films from the same period include Pete's dragon, Noah's Ark's last flight, the unidentified flying Oddball and the feared conductor. I won't talk about Tron because I thought he was ambitious and Miller was just the executive producer, so he had little to do with actual production. However he was in full force when this piece of crap from god was ejected from the bowels of creativity. Herbie goes to Monte Carlo. The second sequel to the much-loved story Love Bug finds Herbie in love with another car that also has brain and heart. There's a race, some nasty shit, a diamond and Barney Fife. Shot in France, the film is actually well photographed and the countryside is enchanting. But the idea is that the film was made so that everyone involved can have a three-month vacation in France. The rest of the film is a disaster. Prat fall, bumbling thieves, bad German racing competitors and a beautiful bouncing feminist all fall into the inventory category. The film's biggest insult: trying to further develop Herbie's lover's personality through shakes, beeps, flashing lights and indicative movements of a horny seventeen-year-old, Disney writers do an injustice to our lovely little VW. Then again I would think it would be difficult for anyone to get past Helen Hayes to drive Herbie on a skyscraper ledge in the second exit.
