I kept watching it because it seemed the plot was going somewhere. When he arrived ambiguously, I was very disappointed. I'm going to tell you what happened in the next sentence. But maybe I won't. Maybe I'll just say something will happen. The writers lacked imagination. This is not even a "B" movie - it's a TV movie "B".
