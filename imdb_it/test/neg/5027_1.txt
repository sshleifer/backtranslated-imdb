Oh God! This series must be the worst anime I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> It started in a new, exciting and fresh way. And I really liked it then. Kagome was a good female role model for the show. And Inu-Yasha was fun and hot-headed. <br /> <br /> Then, he kept falling more and more downhill as the series progressed ... and I'll tell you all the reasons why. (Warning: SPOILER ALERT !!) <br /> <br /> Ok, basically they destroy Inu-Yasha's relationship with Kagome in the initial phase, reviving his 50-year-old girlfriend who is dripping, gooey and a total waste of time . <br /> <br /> They present a pervert named Miroku, who should be a sort of religious figure for the show. (Which really annoyed me, because it was out of place and stupid.) Then, they introduced a demon killer named Sango, whose only purpose in life is to try (and fail) to save his brain-washed brother. <br /> <br /> The big bad of the show, Naraku, as he started out as a good bad guy, lost his touch after a while. (It has become quite old rather fast and it bothered me that he was the only bad guy on the show to do something.) <br /> <br /> The characters have all become wooden and without emotion. And then, the end of this terrible series was a disappointment for any fan of the anime out there. Nothing happened. Naraku has never been killed or defeated. Kagome and Inu-Yasha never fell completely in love (because he was still in love with his daughter who died 50 years ago). The holes on the ground have been left open. Animation has deteriorated as the series progresses. And nothing has changed in the plot. (I mean, they dragged him into over 150 episodes, and nothing changed in the plot ... at all.) And they expected me (as well as other fans of the show) to be satisfied ?? I was disenchanted, disgusted and annoyed like shit. At least I had high hopes that there would be a good final for the series. Instead, all I got was a commercial for the manga. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you want to see a good anime on swords and things like that, I highly recommend "Rurouni Kenshin". This show progresses and goes somewhere, plus it also has very good animation. <br /> <br /> But stay away from this bland excuse for souls, in the best possible way.
