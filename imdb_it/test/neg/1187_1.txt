This review took longer to write than I took to watch this movie. It's just ugly. The plot is terrible compared to TV shows. It's flat, not funny and boring. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the GG ran out of ideas long before this film was lit in green. Viewers should read this as an example of not knowing when to stop. <br /> <br /> Bad editing, bad music, bad acting. Zero dynamism, zilch chemistry. <br /> <br /> A film that doesn't know what it is, made without any love for a mysterious purpose that leaves you depressed and feels a little angry about the loss of so much money. <br /> <br /> LoG obviously made an offer they couldn't refuse, or maybe their ego simply got the better of them. It's an unpleasant marketing push that might have been better when the GG was fresher and more inspired. <br /> <br /> However, I knew when to stop and I did it. <br /> <br /> Please! Someone tries to convince me of the most beautiful points of this film!
