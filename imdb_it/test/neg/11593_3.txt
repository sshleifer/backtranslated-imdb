Is this film exhilarating what's better than watching two creatures fighting each other? GIANT cgi versions of these fighting beasts! However I need one of the guns used in the film. Because apparently they are using tricks. Count the amount of shots they use before having to ... oh, wait, it's only fair that they should never recharge. Regardless of the shots ... it's fun. <br /> <br /> The sound effects used in the film for the Komodo range from a tiger to an elephant. Oh, and did I forget to mention that apparently these GIANT Komodo dragons are stealthy as hell? Because somehow even when the actors look in the direction the beast is coming from they are surprised when it appears. <br /> <br /> Whenever someone dies, you can say that it is coming because everyone is preparing for this, they put their arms in the air and cross them to save themselves ... it never works. <br /> <br /> The last jewel is that these writers' brains are just a gland full of knowledge. With "facts" like both of these creatures that are amphibious in comments like "helpless animals", they are just full of fun facts.
