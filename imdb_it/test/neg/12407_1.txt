Disclaimer: During my adventures in foreign cinema, I became passionate about a wide range of films spanning different genres that include horror, action, drama, comedy and romance, to name a few. So, I appreciated the thoughtful and serious tone of the dramas and the mindless and popcorn fun of action movies. With a wide range of Chinese, Japanese and Korean films under my belt, I am confident in my ability to recognize the bright spots in films to appreciate and complete them. Unfortunately, Ashes of Time has nothing to recognize. It's one of the worst Chinese films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> To begin with, this epic of sword overpower shows off the infamous sequence of "slideshows" in everything, which is nothing but an ultra-economic and pathetic form of action choreography. It is sufficient to show a series of close-up images of faces, swords, legs and / or arms that are losing weight, and therefore a corpse. Very good! You now have a sequence of actions for Time Ashes. The problem lies not only in its poor quality but also in the fact that the scenes are so chaotic and disconnected that the viewer has no idea what the hell is going on. <br /> <br /> The dramatic element of this film is non-existent, since it is based on the characters who tell the viewer that they love someone or hate someone instead of actually developing and showing those elements on the screen, which makes all the characters generic and colorless, leaving the viewer completely indifferent to their actions. In fact, the plot itself is a real disaster, introducing too many characters too quickly with too many plot devices. Tracing the complexities in films can be exploited in a very advantageous way (for example, A tale of two sisters), but Ashes of Time becomes an exploitative garbage when it does nothing but contort a very simple plot without a seemingly good reason. <br /> <br /> Indeed, this entire film acts as a series of smoke curtains to cover its shortcomings. The horrible action choreography is covered by "slideshow" tricks and chaotic camera movements. The development of the non-existent character is covered by the characters who openly say how they feel. And a story without thoughts is hidden, confusing the viewer with convolution. <br /> <br /> As if that were not bad enough, this film was extremely boring, looking more like 150 minutes instead of 95. <br br /> <br /> Rating = A 0/5 stars rarely at your place.
