I swear I didn't want to! I chose this just because it looked good on the back! This film was not at all scary and was actually very confusing. The demon wind has only been used a couple of times and people have been killed in a rather shameless way. The only major bright spot was to see Sherri Bendorf of Slaughterhouse. Seeing what had happened to her, however, I decided for this little turkey from a movie. A 3 out of 10. NEXT!
