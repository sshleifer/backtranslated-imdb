This is the worst war movie I've ever seen, perhaps the worst ever made. I find it incredible that some people rated it as a 10. It has a surprising lack of even realistic traces of realism. Almost all the clich√©s of the war movie appear in this film and are badly done. On the other hand, I wouldn't have looked at it until it was so extraordinarily bad that I enjoyed it.
