What a waste of great acting talent. This is a shame because with Catherine Deneuve, Mathieu Amalric, Emmanuelle Devos, Chiara Mastroianni and Melvil Poupaud (not to mention the other lesser-known ones in America) it is a lot of talent to play. This film by Arnaud Desplech was a terrible disappointment. After appreciating his "Kings and Queens" and this film he left me completely bored and frustrated to the point where I left the film before the end of the film. The film revolved around its central plot (which involved Catherine Deneuve's illness), distracted by every marginal plot and supporting character that appeared on the screen. The film also gave us too little development of the character to understand why the different characters didn't like it so much (this was a story of family dysfunction) so that the lack of a coherent narrative became even more critical. Finally, the soundtrack (which ranged from Bach's hip hop to Mendelhson's Midsummer Night's Dream) disagreed with the film's emotional temperature and further obscured any emotion that the viewer would have to feel at that time. Photography (the director often started scenes with a mostly dark screen, where our only view is through a small opening, making it feel like we were looking through a peephole, which then expands) was also pretentious and inscrutable.
