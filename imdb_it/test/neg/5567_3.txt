In the early 00's, production companies had a short-lived craze for supernatural genre films in France after "The Crimson Rivers" and "Brotherhood of the Wolf" turned out to be successful, so many movies were lit by green or saved by their "destiny" directed at the video. "However, France, unlike the United States, the United Kingdom or Italy, has a poor tradition of fantasy B films and it was quickly discovered that sequel" Samouraïs "," Bloody Mallory "or" Crimson Rivers "were malicious attempts to recreate a kind of magic that had never existed in French cinema in the first place. When they flopped, the producers returned to the usual stuff: derivatives farces or yet another tribute self-referential to the French New Wave by a former critic of "Les Cahiers du cinéma". <br /> <br /> "Brocéliande" could only have been lit green during this short window, as it serves no discernible purpose. It's your slash-by-the-book film mixed with mythological elements and vague horror references and you'll find bizarre female characters, a French university that looks like an American campus and such lazy twists that you don't even care why you guessed it from just an hour before, even before the film began. <br /> <br /> These elements make all the fun of a B-movie from the 70s or 80s and you expect them in a movie from the 70s or 80s. However, we are no longer in the 1980s and no one warned director Doug Headline, as this tribute to the slasher film genre is nothing more than a slasher derivative film. Headline is not a novice and has written criticisms of this kind of images since the early 1980s, but as a director on his first success he shows a lack of skill and ambition that makes "Brocéliande" a bore. <br /> <br /> When you put together clichés from a sub-category of films and deliver them to an experienced and inventive director like Wes Craven or Quentin Tarantino, you get a "Scream" or a "Death Proof", films that are imitations of old guilty pleasures but also magnifying these clichés and adding much to them. It's called "talent" and that's why you can't confuse these recent films with their original inspirations taken decades ago. <br /> <br /> "Brocéliande" takes the lazy path and reproduces only the worst elements of the films of the past (unfortunately for the male viewer, free nudity is mostly missing). There are some very strong (presumably unintended) similarities between the plot of "Brocéliande" and the insulted "Halloween 3: Season Of The Witch", as both deal with supernatural druidical evil rites and some silly attempt to conquer world on Halloween night. As the plot of "Halloween 3" makes more sense than this, it means that something seriously wrong went with "Brocéliande".
