Lance used to get quality support from James Cameron. Heck, he also had his TV show (Millenium) for a couple of years. Why are you doing this? Couldn't he find a better way to pay his bills? <br /> <br /> I love a good low budget movie. Some of them can simply laugh because of their ridiculous premises, their stereotyped textbook characters, or often times when the actors are related to the director / producer. But this film has no saving value. I didn't laugh. I didn't cry. I just had this sick feeling in my stomach. That feeling was soon identified as pity. At one point, Lance Henriksen was an A-list support actor. It was in Terminator (he was going to be terminator before Arnold showed up), Aliens, AliensIII, the classic B-Pumpkinhead movie, among many others! I wanted to send him money after this. Maybe we should start a support fund or something like that. <br /> <br /> Then again, for doing this ... maybe not.
