This is what happens when a franchise becomes lazy and no one can think of a new twist to add. Remember what happened to the "Childs Play" series? The first three were interpreted as horror films, with genuine fright (although predictable) that remained faithful to the theme of the film. Then they ran out of people for the stalk doll, and decided to play to laugh, with the next two being black comedies ..... <br /> <br /> Well, that's what happened here, but I think it wasn't meant to be that way. A bit like saying: "I wanted to make pancakes for dessert! I did it on purpose!" when your soufflé turns off accidentally. But the milk was poured, and had a certain value in the theaters like a mess. <br /> <br /> When the floor was ripped from under the passenger seats, I expected the passengers to stretch their legs through the hole, start running Flintstones-Style, to safely land the plane in the Alps. I did it. He would have entered the silly campy theme of the rest of the show. <br /> <br /> Instead of highlighting the obvious physical impossibility of the film, what about social implausibility? As if the character of George Kennedy reacted calmly to the news that his date was a whore? Back in 1979, a man didn't easily accept the idea that he had just poured his heart into a paid companion. He was supposed to feel in touch with a kindred spirit, who later proved to be a mercenary prostitute with a courtesy line. Who would NOT feel cheated by the experience? Yet he chuckles and wraps his arms around the waist of his companion as they happily leave. What an economic envelope of a squalid scene. Ouch. <br /> <br /> I have an appetite for the soufflé and served bland pancake cliches. And no, you did NOT do it on purpose!
