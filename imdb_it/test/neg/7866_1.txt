If this film were to be evaluated on a scale of 1 to 10, one would need to create a new evaluation system, as this should not even qualify. The film's plot, (if one can call it that) revolves around Charlie (Stephen Baldwin), a former special agent who is targeted by the brother of a man he killed while still working for the US government. If this sounds like an interesting scenario, please don't be fooled, as this film will not offer what its theme story suggests. <br /> <br /> Comedian Chris Rock once said that when you see an actor making a bad movie that makes you want to send the actor $ 50, since the actor must be desperate for the money to make a poor quality work. After watching this movie, you might want to send Stephen Baldwin for $ 100. <br /> <br /> It seems that Baldwin made no effort in his role in the film. In the film, Baldwin is forced to run throughout the city of Los Angeles to protect his "honeycomb" (his wife) from being killed by the brother of a man he had previously killed. However, throughout the picture it seems that Baldwin can barely keep a light run. His relaxed performance manages to subtract any suspense that the film could have represented. <br /> <br /> If you are the type of person who loves watching bad movies and laughing at their shortcomings, then this movie is for you. However, if you are looking for a well done action thriller, it would be better to look elsewhere than to rent this movie.
