Dracula 3000 or Van Helsing "Dracula's Revenge" (Economic collects another limping vampire film) because I saw that it is a master class in which you cannot make a film. A collection of rags from misfit's salvator's board a cargo ship previously lost "The Demeter" in the (cough) Carpathian System (which is later updated to the Carpathian Galaxy) and awakens a relentless evil (in this case the script). The film is a bizarre bastardization of Event Horizon and whatever the most famous vampire movie of all time is. <br /> <br /> **** Spoliers Follow **** After a plethora of production company logos and a sequence of credits that most of the budget has to be blown up, we open with a kind of speech of exposure by Casper (silly name) who plays Captain Abraham Van Helsing (sillier name) and instead of character development, goes on to describe the twisted, incomprehensible oddities that make up his crew. Van Helsing himself sports a spray on the stubble and wears a body warmer in a kind of 80s retro tribute to Han Solo (I guess). From time to time the Captain of the Demeter appears in a sort of crazy video diary to tell us nothing with a pronounced German accent (unfortunately the subtitles are not included). The Mina crew embarks on the abandoned ship (only ???) armed only with a torch in the shape of a gun and a thick East European accent as it converses with Van Helsing on his deck of ships (which is basically a single shining wall). Mina wears a gas mask with rubber tubes glued to the front, meets what can only be described as a skateboarder in a black cloak that keeps slipping continuously in front of the camera. Because this happens while the Vampire is not yet made flesh is never explained. This leads to a shaking camera that chases Mina down the corridors until she meets Humvee. It is possible that Will Smith was drafted to write Humvee's lines since most of them consist of Humvee which reminds us that he is black every ten seconds and that he says the word "ass" enough for a Guinness book of records while delivers all this in a "from the" cappa DA "accent (this is the year 3000, does it still exist" cappa DA "?) One of the main problems of this film is that it tries madly to pretend its set in the year 3000. Unfortunately, anyone with healthy eyes has won. "We buy this, as Demeter seems suspiciously like a Soviet-style tanker. Perhaps the film crew thought it would be right to leave hammer and sickle symbols and a sexy Lenin poster next to a bunch of lockers everywhere and explain it as a kind of futurist return of the special communist. The crew clothes appear to have been attacked by an Oxfam collection box (sealed since 1993) and are armed to the teeth with the latest 20th century automatic weapons (with the addition of 3000 zing when fired) which are obviously not absolutely against vampires. Health care is a thing of the past (in the future) because the professor has not only glasses but is in a wheelchair ??? My god, what happened to everything about genetic engineering. <br /> <br /> The professor is an interesting character as he is a direct exponent of Alien Resurrection who had his crew misfit with a boy in a wheelchair (who was strangely not killed). Fans didn't take the Prof as he looks scared in many scenes. If I had been buried in a wheelchair-free Soviet ship chased by badly acting vampires, and everyone left me because I was a whiny whiner, I'd be scared. <br /> <br /> During the dramatic scene of UN's pursuit of Mina, the professor informs us (with feeling) "this is puzzling". The rest of his jokes is also baffling "bugger", and "We will all die" X 100, follows. <br /> <br /> Erika Eleniak appears as Vice Captain (what happened to the first officers?) in what I thought would be the problem tired, standard, with a hard nose, meaningless, "don't look at me until I do I tell you too ", he beat 10 stuntmen at once super-babe, but this is a Z-flick so he practically wears a tight top and even tighter leather pants. Coolio's performance increases the ham factor by 90% and is the camper of a row of tents, but fortunately for us it dies quite early. Although he seems to keep his heart on the right side of his body. <br /> <br /> After a lot of running up and down the same aisle, using awkward Soviet-style commands, and sitting in Soviet-style locker rooms the crew members find themselves stranded as their own ship dozes off to find a more interesting crew (probably). The reason why Dracula is even mentioned is unknown, since the main villain is called Orlock, who is the Transylvanian space for "crimes against fashion" while he is dandy in a big bloated and voluminous shirt and an even bigger starched collar that makes Hammer Horror Vampires a cheeky look by comparison. Orlock stops to explain his whole story (off screen) to Erica Eleniak, but he can't kill her in another turn from Alien Resurrection. His retrospective is such a load of trite that it is not worth repeating. Given that the budget cannot afford coordinators of fights, special effects, original music, script (not written by a chimpanzee) and even adequate end titles (the first list of casts I've seen, they were the same characters but completely different and Italian names ) the film begins to destroy any sanity with which you started. Fortunately the crew is able to counterattack with the help of an on-board computer that contains obscure millenary references on how to kill imaginary creatures and some useful clues about the 20th century pool that they find in the ship's recreation room (on your " hologram bridge "). The ending is horrible and a little suspect, either they ran out of money or the ex-Soviets asked for their ship back. I joined this film knowing he was ugly but oblivious to how bad he really was.
