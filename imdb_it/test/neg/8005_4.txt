The circus could have been much better if they had reduced the number of twists and developed each one better the film presents a very gifted cast that mostly performs well, however it totally loses the audience practically everyone is back to stab the others and they didn't stab them at the same time because they were stabbing someone else in the back and working with ... I lost you? well, the film is even more confusing, clearly written by a first writer of timers, it has some qualities of redemption even if in the acting in particular Famke Janssen shines like Lily but unfortunately gets a lot of time on the screen USELESS simply standing there doing nothing. .... the dialogue is a bit rough and the accents sometimes irritating, but it's still worth watching if you're a fan of all the actors, especially John and Famke who get the most time on the screen, remember to watch it with a notebook so you can write who is double crossing every second ....
