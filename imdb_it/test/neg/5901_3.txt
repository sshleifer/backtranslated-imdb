When it was released, this film caused a sensation. I looked at it and it was electrified. Beautiful, usually young, naked women turned in the classy style we knew so well from the photograph of the director Hamiltons. His photographs never become pornographic and the same is true of this film. Today I saw him again and I was bitterly disappointed. The soft core in extremely slow scenes, all filmed with some vaseline on the objectives, is actually all there is. There is no real story, the characters remain beautiful and wonderfully filmed bodies, but they are not real creatures with a soul. In reality nothing happens. It is as if Hamilton were photographing using moving images rather than still images. And this gets so boring after a while. I didn't even look at it the second time, because I fell asleep. This is all that remains of this masterpiece: it is an excellent sleeping pill. And you will never become dependent on this! <br /> <br /> Then return 7 out of 10, now 3 out of 10
