There is a fantastic song in Killjoy 2 that tells how clowns are usually very nice and funny, but Killjoy is a killer. I don't remember the song from the first movie, but when the singer Olimpia Fernandez sings "Killjoy, yeah Killjoy 2" it seems that the 2nd could have been added for this terrible sequel. The film is much worse than the first movie and this was really bad. This time the cast, including the usually excellent Debbie Rochon, has stopped trying and the director Tammi Sutton does not create tension and presents only a boring and constant film. The images of the Full Moon produced this during their "Urban" phase, none of which was very good, but none as bad as here.
