Donald Sutherland, an American paleontologist visiting England, one evening meets a hiker. Two years later, after discovering the men's column in his car, he returns the book to the man's opulent house, only to find out that the man was hanged for murder. No one in or out of the family seems to worry that the hitch hiker could not have committed the murder (of his stepmother) because he was in Sutherland's car at the time of the crime. <br /> <br /> Sutherland is the man's alibi but he arrived too late. For guilt, track down the real murderer. <br /> <br /> The mysteries of Agatha Christie usually involve a number of different people, all with one or the other reason of the crime, all suspicious, and a puzzle that depends on the construction of a strict timeline. Often, not always, an assistant with whom the investigator can talk. <br /> <br /> Due to the ugliness of the situation, due care must be taken to explain every element of the mystery to the reader or viewer. Redundancy is perfectly in place. We need to keep the characters and time lines straight. Christie's films are of the rare kind in which the use of famous faces in subordinate characters is actually useful. (Jacqueline de Bellefort? Oh yes, it's Mia Farrow.) But this version of "Ordeal by Innocence" is a production of Golan-Globus, with all that it implies in terms of production values, a carefully prepared and skillful script behind room. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes, when Sutherland discovers that an innocent person has been hanged, are fine. After that, everything is thrown away by the viewer into disconnected pieces, often in sudden flashbacks or in confused off-screen voices that tell us nothing. The script has a slapdash quality, as if it were thrown together by two hacks during the night. Few of the faces are familiar and this does not help at all. Everyone leaves comments on everyone else and the names become a hopeless jumble. The soundtrack is composed of four instruments that make irritating atonal jazz riffs. Some nudity is launched to wake up the dozers in the audience. If Dame Agatha were alive, it would be among the spectators who should have been woken up. <br /> <br /> Dullsville.
