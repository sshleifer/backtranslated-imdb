I'm sorry, but this guy isn't funny. I swear I heard that 4-year-olds come out with better jokes and then some of his own. "Dee dee dee", for example, is perhaps the worst catch phrase I've ever heard. Missing any creativity and having to make fun of mentally challenged people when you have reached the level of having your show is incredibly obscure by Mencia. <br /> <br /> Even if everyone compares this fool to Chappelle, theirs is not a race. First of all they had very very different shows. I think that on average the Menica show only had about 2 short 5 minute scenes between its 10 minute lines about god knows what. The Chappelles show came out more as a sketch comedy, with 2-4 sketches that took up the whole show. All the chappelles made a brief summary of each scene before and after each of them. This is where Mencia fails even more. What would make Mencia think that having a show that is the same comedy that he talks about in his special offers would be a good idea? Does anyone really want to listen to George Lopez, a pioneer from Mencia years ago, but dragged beyond belief to the point where he died? The possibility of having snowflakes in hell. <br /> <br /> My point is that most people hate this guy for his racism, I can't stand him for his incompetence. Comedy Central was looking for a minority that could label it "controversial" and then let it follow Chappelles' path. The problem is that this guy made it clear he doesn't want to be Chappelle. So, instead, he leads his disgusting show like a shipwreck in flames right in the ground. Someone wants to see a weekly stand up of the same things every Thursday, I'm sure I don't. <br /> <br /> I cannot express my gratitude to Comedy Central. The spectacle of this idiot is over. Personally, after seeing his position, I don't know how he got his show in the first place. There are so many more deserving comics like Jim Gafigan, Zach Galifinakis, etc ... In fact, anyone is better than this fool.
