This is a Hollywood product that should never have left a movie. Dialogue without a plausible thought, plot without a point, staged without skill, direction without direction, and acting without the value of a high school freshman class game. The entire cast should have been arrested for playing excessively. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, okay!
