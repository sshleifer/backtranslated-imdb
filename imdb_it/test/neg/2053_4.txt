I just saw this movie just because of Sarah and I'm also giving these 4 stars just for her, on the other side. This film was undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Theacting was horrible. The script was not inspired. This was a film that continued to contradict itself. The film was sloppy and not very original. it's not like I expected a good movie. Just something to give me a jump or two. This didn't even do this. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that the more I think about the general plot, the less it actually makes sense and the more holes we keep finding. Really a pity, since I'm pretty sure there was a good idea lurking somewhere ... <br /> <br /> I'm maybe a little harsh giving the film at 4/10 but given the actors involved and still SARA obvious writing talent, this film really should have delivered much more.
