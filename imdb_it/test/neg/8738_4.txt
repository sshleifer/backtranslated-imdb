GENERAL PLAN: to have the winning team in a deadly tournament. One of the many images of martial arts that attempted to capture the flavor of the famous "Enter the Dragon" of '73, this is a South African effort. The villain's stronghold is a bit different, it looks like a castle-like white fortress in the middle of the desert from afar. The wicked himself, a baron or general, is a somewhat more perverse version of the "Dr.No" or master of Maestra of the master's wickedness, with strange flashbacks to the glory days of Nazi Germany. He wears the full Nazi uniform in some places. His main ambition in life is to organize an illegal martial arts competition / tournament against his Japanese rival, an extension of their complicity in World War II (my army is better than your army). It seems silly and it is, even if the suggestion of madness and crazy machismo almost works. The central hero, Steve Chase (Ryan), looks like a white character from "Bruce Lee", with a lean and lean physique, though obviously not at the same level of martial arts experience. I thought he would be a secret agent of the government here, but apparently not. He and his girlfriend joined the Baron's team of fighters, but decide to quit (what did they plan to do?). Of course, it's not that easy. There is a strange sequence of them escaping through the desert using a wrecked sail with a rigged sail - those desert winds can work wonders for traveling, apparently. <br /> <br /> The plot of meanders in the second half, as the hero joins the team of the villain's competitor and the girl is held hostage by the villain in a cell, under the threat of rape by the rival of the hero. The most interesting character is Chico, a dwarf who is the villain's assistant; he is faithful to the baron but is in solidarity with the situation of the hero. Much of the combat uses the hero's ballet skills, with lots of leaps and slow movements. FX sounds are also amplified and exaggerated in an attempt to add more impact to the shots. There are some good fights during the tournament towards the climax, but nobody really stood out. If we had to choose, I suppose the best regards the Baron's brutal man-stooge, introduced late in history (he raises the back of a car to a point). You wonder how the hero will take him out eventually, since the brute seems to shake off most of the punches. The acting is very mediocre, it goes down into the field to the girl, who tends to laugh without reason, as if she were in the grass, even though she is very pretty. Some training scenes are also campers, especially all those who run or roll down the sands of the desert. And, with a title like that, there are surprisingly few real murders. Ryan, like Steve Chase, has returned as a traditional agent in the sequel "Kill and Kill Again".
