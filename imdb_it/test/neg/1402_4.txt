I have just finished watching this horribly depressing drama and realized that, in light of recent dramas like these, the only ones that could be considered abnormal are those that are less aware that life is nothing but tragic. I would suggest how this conclusion is defeatist and counterproductive, even if the relationships and perspectives like those presented in this film are actually founded to some extent. But instead, I realized that these films have made the determination of the great "tragedy" trivial when the same boring situations, the same suffocating dysfunctional families and friendships continue to sound only if they have repeatedly been in a sort of groped to strip the previous distortions of family life (many of which existed in the 1950s and earlier, with increasingly subtle personality and aberration), replacing them instead with the "reality" of how things really are. In fact, what we are looking at is no longer dysfunctional, but in reality, a normal existence and a set of circumstances that has actually existed forever, but of which we may have previously been unaware and, therefore, ignored or at least denied. <br /> <br /> The only problem is that too many films have tried to clarify this point. And in doing so in almost identical form. When I read the synopsis of the film, I immediately thought of "Ice Storm". While watching the depressing lack of life of the Travis family, who seemed to endure repeated emotional reproaches, I immediately remembered "American Beauty". And, in some respects, the interactions between parents and the middle child, Tim, have drawn similarities from "Igby Goes Down". 'Imaginary Heroes' could be a new, perhaps refreshing experience for an honest portrait of the character who, as mentioned before, is often not allowed to exist in family movies (which is nonetheless idiotic to think anyway, considering we were already seeing this type of relationship shown in films like 'Ordinary People' as early as 1980 and which go back much further than that). But for the well-versed viewer, these films cannot offer anything new. In fact, they have become a rather tired testimony of too many filmmakers who might try to outdo the other with the amount of trauma and apathy they can put into one family (and here, it extends to neighbors and friends). In fact, "Imaginary Heroes", the last of its kind (I think there have been enough films to declare it precisely a "genre"), collapses so many disasters and surprises in a family, that it would make reward discoveries for a host of daytime talk show. It is the story of a family being tested by the suicide of their eldest son, a talented and decorated swimmer who hated sports with passion. The younger son knew it, the father was stunned and blinded by the drive for competitiveness of the all-star son. And it is not clear that the mother and sister had a very close relationship with the young man. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is no less fun (to some extent, for those who find this material depressing after a while), and the performances are quite good, especially from Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels. But I really hope that the directors who in the future wish to add to the comment of family relations in difficulty (which coincidentally or not always seem to be middle-upper class middle-class suburban families) intend to offer something new through material and intuition. I should not see any distinction (and consequently, no purpose) otherwise.
