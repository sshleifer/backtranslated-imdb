Ohhhh MAN this movie is horrible !! <br /> <br /> This type of tripe is what gives Canadian cinema a bad name, or no name. Well, to be honest, I think most Canadian movies give a bad name to Canadian cinema. <br /> <br /> Alongside the characters (there is a couple that is the most grotesque in the history of cinema), the most annoying thing is the modification and rhythm of the film. He's like a drunken snail about to die. <br /> <br /> Thank goodness Melanie Doane is nice to look at. It's the only thing that made me look. Unfortunately, the rest of the film continued to break. <br /> <br /> Good for a laugh though, if you have a bad night at Canadian cinema, though. <br /> <br /> Did I mention Melanie Doane? The only positive aspect (too bad they didn't have the sense to hold the camera over her for more than one blink at a time). Another addition to the Canadian Hall of Stinking Movies.
