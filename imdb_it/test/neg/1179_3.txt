This movie was really bad. Before they didn't even follow the facts for this. Half of the film was invented and it was more about the deputy, whose mother was one of the victims of Ed Gein. The acting was horrible, except for the guy who plays Ed Gein, but it's not hard to mess up a strange guy. even though I think it was horrible, I gave him a three because they started it with real photos. that was the best part of the movie. As soon as the film was introduced, the film went downhill. The writer of this film tried to revive it, but it was not necessary. Ed Gein's story is quite interesting without falsifying information.
