I had heard that this Japanese film is edgy, creatively interesting, a "new fantasy" in the Asian film scene ... maybe even something as innovative as "Ringu" by Hideo Nakata or "Oldboy" by Chan-wook Park, in particular the second . <br /> <br /> You can imagine my disappointment when, on the other hand, I found the film disconnected both narratively and cinematographically (though not in a way that a movie buff appreciates), a clich√©-ridden, even sadly foolish funny --- overall, a bad knock-off of the "Pulp Fiction" style. <br /> <br /> I stopped watching after 30 minutes, when I gave up on making it become something more than it is.
