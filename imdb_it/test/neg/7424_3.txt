An airplane carrying employees of a large biotech company - including the CEO's daughter - descends into a dense forest in the Pacific Northwest. When the search and rescue mission is canceled, the managing director, Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), puts together a small group of ragtag to carry out his search and rescue mission. But what is it that seeks and tries to save Knowles, and what is happening and observing them in the woods? <br /> <br /> Oy, what a mess this movie! It was a pity, because for one, he sees Lance Henriksen, who is one of my favorite modern genre actors, and two, he could easily have been a decent movie. He suffers from two major flaws, and they are probably both the fault of writer / director Jonas Quastel - this film (which I'll call with his Sasquatch alias) has almost the worst montage I've ever seen alongside Alone in the Dark (2005), and Quastel's constant advice for the cast seems to have been, "Okay, let's try again, but this time I want everyone to talk about each other, improvising non-sequiters and generally try to be as annoying as possible. <br /> <br /> The potential was there, despite the aspects to be fished out (any material related to the plane crash was obviously trying to lull The Blair Witch Project (1999) and any material related to the titled monster was Predator's crappbing (1987) ), Ed Wood's exposure and ridiculous dialogue the plot had promises and potential for thinner and much less gooey subtitles.The monster costume, once we could see it, was more than enough you for my taste. The combination of types of characters that trudged through the woods would have been great if Quastel and fellow writer Chris Lanning had rejected the 11 to at least 5 stereotype and spent more time exploring their relationships. The monster's "den" had a beautiful production design, in particular the decorations of the corpse as a more primitive Jeepers Creepers (2001). If it had been modified well, there were scenes with decent dialogues that could have been easily effective. <br /> <br /> But the most frightening thing about Sasquatch is the number of false steps made: for some reason, Quastel thinks it's a good idea to cut out the dialogue scenes that happen within minutes of each other. another in real time, so that instead we see a few lines of scene A, then some lines of scene B, then again A, again of B, and so on. <br /> <br /> For some reason, think of it as a good idea to use black screens frequently among dialogue fragments, if we need the idea of ​​an unspecified amount of time passing between irrelevant comments or if the irrelevant the comments seem to happen one after another in any case. <br /> <br /> For some reason, he doesn't care if the scenes were shot during the mornings, afternoons, in the middle of the night, etc. to them at random. Moreover, the scenes that are shown seem to be randomly selected. Important events never or almost never, and we are stuck with too many useless scenes. <br /> <br /> For some reason, he left a rock art scene in the film when he needs more exposure to justify getting there, or he needs to be cut off, because it's not that important (the intelligence of the monster and "humanity" could have been easily shown in another way). <br /> <br /> For some reason, there is a whole character - Mary Mancini - left in the script even though she is superfluous. <br /> <br /> For some reason we suddenly find ourselves in an extremely soft-core porn scene, even if the reason is never repeated. br /> <br /> For some reason, the characters continue to call Harlan Knowles "Mr. H", as if they were stereotypes of Asian servants. <br /> <br /> For some reason, Quastel insists on using the "Blurry" Cam "and" Distorted-Cam "for the monster attack scenes, even if the costume doesn't look so bad, and it would have been a lot more effective to put a little mist, a fine filter, or anything else than bad cinematography. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but you have the idea. <br /> <br /> I wanted I really liked this movie better than me. I am a Henriksen fan, I am fascinated by the subject, I loved the setting, I love hiking and this is basically a trip movie on one level - but I couldn't. I thought "it would have been better from this point to the end", Quastel made another terrible move. In the end, my score was 3 out of 10.
