I watch family affairs, the coronation and the east easters on uktv every week, family affairs are by far the worst, bad plots, bad sequences and the worst acting of any soap, even worse than the Americans and this is saying something. <br /> I find it very frustrating that all these shows on uktv Australia "are so far away from the UK and when trying to find out why they just discourage you with some stories that will show two episodes to capture needless to say that never happens , I am very happy that the family business is going, to make room for something of better quality, but at the same time I would like to know the basic reasons, they finally realized how bad it was "do people stop looking at it? Whatever it was, you can't leave us in suspense. Why do you think you have to keep everything hidden from your fans or is it that you don't care? should try to keep the public updated. Family affairs are known only for havi its characters disappear and reappear for apparently without reason, we get involved with people and enjoy ourselves by following their lives. <br /> <br /> I can understand why family affairs should end, even if we are so far back here in Australia, it is easy to see that the writers are running out of ideas for new story lines, so many plots are repeated and old episodes come back. I also noticed that while new characters are being introduced, many of them are really bad actors, as if you were scraping the bottom of the barrel and ending up with Drek's greetings.
