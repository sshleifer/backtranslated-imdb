Only in the world of Hollywood audiovisual fiction can anyone, including FBI agents, be so incredibly stupid. Good guys are so stupid that they take everything they're interested in, answering phones, going upstairs, all looking for a demolition expert who wants to do it all. Oh yes, and then we take Hollywood SUPERVILLAIN. He can be shot, even if he has a jacket, and then fall down a long flight of stairs and then still have the upper hand over his stupid pursuers. All the clich√©s that can be imagined in suspense movies have been used. I only saw it because Yuki Amami is so HOT. Oh, yes, it's nice to see how morally superior this FBI agent is, when he's pretty sure there's a bomb in an opera house, and she doesn't sound the alarm. Who writes these scripts ????????????
