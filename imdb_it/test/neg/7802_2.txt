While The Twilight Zone was a wonderful show, it was also very erratic - with some great episodes, some bad and many in between. Don't believe the diehard fans - there were some stinkers and this was definitely one of them. <br /> <br /> In a plot that is obviously meant to be an attack on Fidel Castro, a neighbor double (Peter Falk in a lot of make-up and beard) gets a magic mirror that allows him to figure out who all the his enemies so that they can be liquidated. While I believe that Castro is a thug and a dictator (and tens of thousands of refugees and political prisoners attest to this), it is amazing how this type of preaching episode makes the American efforts to marginalize the creep laugh and indeed does Castro looks okay !! Think about it: Serling and the company wanted to hurt Castro, but instead it seemed only obvious, beloved and foolish. <br /> <br /> It's really ugly, almost ridiculous when seen today.
