I had seen Rik Mayall in Blackadder and the New Statesman, so I thought I'd try this movie. <br /> <br /> At about 4:00 pm I bought it, at around 8 pm I started watching, around 8.15pm I quickly pushed the remaining film forward to see if there was anything left to watch for a human being with a brain ... but he wasn't there. At about 8.45pm I threw the DVD into the dustbin. And this is where this "film" belongs. <br /> <br /> What happened to British humor? Is the humor so refined and witty, intelligent and astute that you find in Yes, Minister, Blackadder, Vicar of Dibley, Fawlty Towers or The Fast Show? The black humor that Britain is so famous for? I don't want to insult anyone, but I assume that even stupid kids wouldn't find it so funny. They deserve smarter fun. And Rik Mayall, you can do better, so please!
