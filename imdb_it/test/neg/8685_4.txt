*** Minor plot spoiler *** <br /> <br /> I must confess to having a weakness for Wayne Crawford. I know little about him, but he seems to have masses of enthusiasm to make up for his lack of talent. In his films he usually performs multi-task activities - perm 3 between the male protagonist, director, producer and screenwriter - he tackles the stories from the piano sub-level. Despite this, the final product is usually fun and entertaining for the non-discerning. <br /> <br /> 'The Evil Below' presents Crawford as an unlucky captain of a ramshackle charter boat, a bit like Bogart in 'To Have & Have Not' - the similarities between the films end there though. <br /> <br /> The story begins with an underwater scene with two divers looking for a wreck, before being attacked by an invisible creature - a bit like the beginning of 'Jaws 2'. The wreck appears to be that of the 'El Diablo', which went down centuries before. The ship was manned by heretic priests fleeing from Spain, with a load of stolen Church treasures. This allows the introduction of various connections to supernatural forces with Lucifer and The Armageddon who both have a look. The film's title refers to this sunken ship of the devil, rather than to any evil sea creature. <br /> <br /> Whatever defect the film has (and there are many) it is fun to watch and done competently. You can't help but appreciate a film that, in the last 5 minutes, copies the famous beach scene in "From here to eternity" and the final line of "Casablanca".
