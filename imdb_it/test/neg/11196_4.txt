The summary was promising, but seeing the film was a huge disappointment. Nothing happens in this film. The plot is linear and without surprise. Normal characters remain normal until the end of the film, strange characters remain strange until the end of the film. There is not even an attempt to offend the observer in thinking that the bad person is someone else than the most obvious candidate. On the positive side, the actors perform rather well, and there is a bit of atmosphere in the film, but too little to be meaningful. <br /> <br /> People who vote 10 for this movie or not see it, or are members of the film production team! 4 is well paid.
