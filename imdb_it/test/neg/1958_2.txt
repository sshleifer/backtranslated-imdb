Why did I have to go out and buy (buy!) JACK FROST 2: VENDETTA DEL MUTANT KILLER SNOWMAN ??? Perhaps it was a temporary mental imbalance? But I guess it's because I liked the first JACK FROST. It was a stupid but fun horror comedy that had some positive effects from Screaming Mad George. That and the fact that on the back cover of the sequel was this beautiful picture of this boy impaled by this giant ice lolly (coming out of his mouth with a lot of blood and everything). So I thought: if she's as stupid as the first one and has some nice splatters / gores, it should be fun, right? Well, I was so wrong! <br /> <br /> I would first like to say that the film deserves some credit for having an immensely crazy and delayed plot. I mean, a killer mutant snowman on a tropical island that generates mutant killer snow mutants that can only be killed or damaged by bananas ??? As much as I love the premise, I really hated the movie. First of all: while the first JACK FROST looked like a real movie (apparently filmed on the real movie and everything), this sequel looks like a third category soap opera. In this way it is also a great shot-on-video aspect. The lighting is just awful (bright white spots for the appearance of the day and stupid colors like blue and green at night). The acting ... well, we don't even go there. The dialogues range from rigid to extremely senile (that Jamaican man was simply an idiot, saying "man" after each sentence). And when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman, all I could think of was a seventh-speed CHILD'S PLAY Chucky who spat silly and seemingly witty nonsense before he killed anyone. <br /> <br /> The best joke was a guy asking "Why are you talking to your watch?" And the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful Asian girl popping out of nowhere and taking a swim in the totally naked pool (thank God for that!). Oh, yes, and that skit on the credits with those two Japanese guys on a miniature ship that was nicknamed made me laugh too. But the worst thing about this movie was: where was the action of blood and spray that everyone is talking about? There have been many occasions to show decent bloody killings. Many people were killed in original ways here, but all off the screen. As I read in many other comments, there were really some nice set-ups for a head blast, a flattened body, uncovered eyes, a torn tongue, ... but at crucial moments the editor cut away blood splashes on the floor or nothing at all. That front photo of that British boy who was impaled (from the back cover of the DVD) wasn't even in the movie. I only saw that particular murder filmed from behind (which means I didn't see sh! T!). I was waiting for the whole movie to happen, and then I see nothing?!?! What a disappointment! Could it be that I saw a cut version of the film? It would be a shame, because only a good dose of splatter fun could have saved this film if you asked me. I didn't cut a lot of bloody killer snowballs for me. About those snowballs: they were very badly made. They made MUNCHIES similar to a cutting-edge 'animatronica'. But I guess it was the central point. At one point, the special effects crew even turned to an evil CGI. Boy, you really have to see it to believe it. The best thing is not to see it, actually, because this film is simply too ugly (okay, I made it laugh, because it kept getting worse and worse). Stay true to the first JACK FROST (1996) and you'll be fine (just keep in mind that it's a rather stupid but amusing horror comedy). <br /> <br /> It's fun, but the writer / director Michael Cooney somehow must have realized that he was a pretty bad director after JACK FROST 2, and so he focused on writing. It turns out that he then wrote two rather interesting thriller scripts for THE I INSIDE (played by Ryan Phillippe) and IDENTITY (played by John Cusack). So the man seems to have a talent at the bottom. <br /> <br /> Now it would be too easy to give JACK FROST 2 the lowest possible score. So I say a point for that naked Asian girl doing the skinny dive and a point for those completely delayed snowball children. Way to go Mr. Cooney!
