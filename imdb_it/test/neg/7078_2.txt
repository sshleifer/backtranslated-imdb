I saw the movie yesterday and stopped it at half-time because I felt it was a waste of time. The idea of ​​making a film through the eyes of a head man - one of the "bad guys" in most fantasy and medieval films - is great and offers many possibilities but ... the film failed to capture one. I didn't feel for any of the characters, the plot was too predictable (to the point that I followed it) and the second jump in the plot made me stop. Those who expect a profound vision of the emotional situation of a bandleader in the Middle Ages, a social outcast until then, could be disappointed.
