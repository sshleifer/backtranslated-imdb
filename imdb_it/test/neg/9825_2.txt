Although the trailer and poster for this film suggest that Sally Hemmings was an important character, I would not have been shocked to find that she was just a minor character (and I mean Minor) if this film were to be told by Sally himself. family! I mean if you are going to tell the story of a member of your family that was ignored by the story, would you really say it with the man who relegated her to darkness in the main character? Does his other lover (who seems to be white) like the current love interest? I know I wouldn't do it! I'm as pale as they are and I'm usually a big fan of Merchent ~ Avory movies, but I couldn't stand the treatment of this film by poor Sally Hemmings.
