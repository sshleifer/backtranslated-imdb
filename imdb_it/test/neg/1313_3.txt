"Flood" is a striking example of how throwing good actors and CGIs in a film will do little to make up for a junk script. The basic premise is fine: what would happen if an abnormal storm threatened to send the sea directly over the Thames floodwaters and swallow London so fast that most people would probably never get out in time? It's basically the New York segment of "The Day After Tomorrow", but it shouldn't be less a movie. However, the script is not there. It is simply functional, flat and without depth. Great British talents like Robert Carlysle and David Suchet to name just two, but their characters are two-dimensional cyphers, like something out of an old Marvel comic. and it would be frankly easier to go back to the tide. Not that all the actors are released - Tom Courtenay seemed capable of only one emotion throughout the film, but then he wasn't given much of a challenge. <br /> <br /> I congratulate you on the opportunity to see some of the Hollywood disaster strikes change for a change, and I expect millions of dollars to be spent on rendering ultra-realistic graphics. However, there is no excuse for shonky writing, especially from a country that has produced some of the best science fiction films ever made on an almost sold out budget. This is the kind of little polite fluff produced by the Sci-Fi channel, and this is certainly not a goal to be achieved. If like me you are a fan of catastrophic movies, you are still tempted, do yourself a favor and watch it with some friends. Even better; Do not worry
