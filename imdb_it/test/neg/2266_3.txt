As everyone knows, no one can portray Scarlett O'Hara as Vivien Leigh and no one can play Rhett Butler as Clark Gable. Everyone else pales, and Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whalley are no exception. One thing I could not overcome was that Joanne had BROWN eyes. The green eyes were the most endearing feature of Scarlett's good looks, and in this sequel she was deprived of them. <br /> <br /> The film, like the book, has had several moments of calm. The new characters weren't all that memorable and I found myself forgetting who was who. I felt that going to Ireland did absolutely nothing. It could be that I'm only 11, but I haven't seen any change in her attitude until the last word, 10 minutes when Rhett told her that she had grown up. If Rhett hadn't told him, I never imagined that there was any change in his attitude. He really loved Cat, his baby. She likes this child the best because she had it with Rhett, her only beloved husband. However, if you read Gone With the Wind, you would see that children make no difference in Scarlett's world. <br /> <br /> Frankly, it seemed to me that there was too much to do without Rhett. All that matters to everyone is if Rhett and Scarlett got back together, and Scarlett took too long to get to that. It is practically nothing compared to Gone With the Wind, but then again what is not? If you've read the novel, you'll like it better than the movie. <br /> <br /> I would watch it, just because it's the sequel to Gone With The Wind, regardless of whether it's worth it or not. It may not satisfy you completely, but it will take you a little beyond.
