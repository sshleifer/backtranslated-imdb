Anthony Wong is the protagonist of this and the original (far superior) Untold Story, but the similarities end there. Wong does not resume his role obviously, and instead plays a clumsy cop who gets involved in a rather suspicious female, Fung (1994 Miss Singapore, Paulyn Sun), which is a repressed repressed job, of course. But his jealous tame "you want to be with a boy who is with a girl" is not the most compelling place like the one Wong played in the first one. The film itself looks tired and numbers. Yeung Fan as an unfaithful girl of the whistle boyfriend tries to keep her away from total boredom by stripping her whenever possible, and Sun has a nice ass, but even that can't save this disaster. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D <br /> <br /> Mei Ah DVD Extras: interviews subtitled with Cheung Kam Ching and Paulyn Sun; Anthony Wong's Filmography; a very brief synopsis; Theatrical trailer for the film; and trailers of "Chinese Erotic Ghost Story" and "Twenty Something"
