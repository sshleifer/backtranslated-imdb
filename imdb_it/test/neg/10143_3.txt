Does anyone else think that "Reba" is basically a scam of "Roseanne"? Just look at the characters of the two families, Connors (Roseanne) and Harts (Reba); the eldest blonde bombshell daughter (Becky Connor and Cheyenne Hart) married to a moron (Mark Healy and Van Montgomery), the sarcastic and young brown daughter (Darlene Connor and Kyra Hart), the little brother (DJ Connor and Jake Hart), and the bizarre relative (Jackie Connor and Barbara-Jean Booker Hart). <br /> <br /> And then, of course, there's the greater similarity, Reba Hart and Roseanne Connor. "Reba" tried to copy the mother from the sarcastic and tender style without giving her the same amiable qualities as Roseanne. Or, perhaps, they made her * lovable * too much, because Reba Hart seems to waver between being mean and fearful (hence Van's phrase to his wife Cheyenne "I'm not afraid of you, I'm afraid of your mother!") And be sweet and considerate with little transition in between. Roseanne could at least understand that she was cruel for being kind, since she was always bad and sarcastic and, whenever she tried to open up, it was difficult for her. Inconsistent as Reba's character, it is difficult for her to be credible. <br /> <br /> But even if the characters weren't completely ripped from "Roseanne", nothing could have saved the show from being subtitles in the plot area. The writers try to give substance to the show, but they can't really dismiss the trivial jokes long enough to make an impact. And you'd better believe that the jokes are trivial; it's like they were written by a twelve year old who thinks every line is hilarious. While occasionally they come out with something funny (I don't pretend not to laugh in some episodes) these gems are too few and far to make "Reba" witty. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Reba" is a very mediocre show with obvious cheats of "Roseanne", sub-par comparisons and sub-sub-par humor, and (let's face it) terrible acting. The show could be a little better, actually, if they replaced all the actors, especially Reba herself, who is more quality in the theater community than the sitcom quality in prime time. <br /> <br /> I give him a 3 out of 10 just to be honest with the good jokes that get him in.
