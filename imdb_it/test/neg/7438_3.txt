This film is a great example of what happens when a studio wants to get a sequel to a good movie outside the gates at all costs. Only with this film, is it really a miss. Everything looks good for Robocop 2 as a worthy follow-up to the first revolutionary film. The complete original cast (apart from the victims, of course) returns and gives its best. Too bad a trite script and an incompetent director are able to neutralize their efforts. <br /> <br /> Irvin Kershner could have been the ideal man for George Lucas to direct the Empire Strikes Back. For a pedestrian director like Kershner there is not much to ruin in the film series without Lucas' charm. A worthy successor to a classic like Robocop would have needed Paul Verhoeven to return, or a director with enough brass to give his round. Kershner doesn't know how to give his turn to anything (Lucas has hired him for this) and surely he is not Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> So what we get here is a film that goes through all the movements to replicate the first film, but with none of the freshness, humor or boldness of the original. Kershner probably thought he could overcome Verhoeven by adding more violence and gratuitous violence, but instead reveals how much he was working as a director for hire instead of a passionate director. And this is a shame, since it was all right to make this another classic. As already mentioned, the actors give their best, but Phill Tippet offers some revolutionary stop motion effects and there are some great ideas in the story of Frank Miller, who was born to write a Robocop movie. If only the studio had hired a director competent enough to pass all the potential.
