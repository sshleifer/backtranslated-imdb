First: a warning. <br /> <br /> I recently saw this movie on DVD in the Universal series 'Hitchcock Collection'. The source print seems to be in perfect condition, but the image is a bit soft, suggesting that it could be a second generation copy directly from the video. The frame is too narrow, so all the compositions are terrible. The title of the film is also clipped. I gather from other IMDb reviews that there is a much better version available. <br /> <br /> Mr and Mrs Smith is just a footnote to Hitchcock's career. <br /> <br /> In the long interviews with Francois Truffaut in the 1960s, Hitchcock gave a complete overview of all his work, but all he could say about this photo is that he did it as a favor to Carole Lombard and who did not understand the characters, so he just photographed the script by Norman Krasna. <br /> <br /> Actually, there's not much more to say. <br /> <br /> It's a dejected comedy, outside the box of Happ Happed One Night, His Girl Friday and Philapdelphia Story. Carole Lombard is a typically feisty wife who learns that her marriage is technically invalid, falls with her husband with the minimum of pretexts and spends most of the painting being "adorably" unreasonable. Robert Montgomery does quite well as her husband, but it's hard not to lose patience with him. Long before the end of the film, the audience says: "Download the stupid cow, it's not worth it." <br /> <br /> Gene Raymond plays the best friend with whom he will get engaged. It should be a polite Southerner, "old family", although this is not obvious from his accent and becomes evident only in the drunken scene (which otherwise sounds very good). He is an honorable gentleman, generous, abstemious, so, of course, he is a victim of bullying and pedagogy on the part of Robert Montgomery and he has been the target of many of the jokes - even if he is not treated badly like the character similar to Ralph Bellamy in His Girl Friday. br /> <br /> This film seems to have been created by people who only knew the comedies screwed up by reputation, but who in reality had never seen one. For example, a good fuck comedy has a strong central idea with a series of ongoing comic discussions that continually intertwine and overlap. Here, all the elements of the play are barely hanging, like pearls on a necklace. This is a hit comedy for numbers. <br /> <br /> It is the same with the management. Typically, these comedies run at an ever-increasing pace that approaches the near-hysteria at the end. Hitchcock does not understand this. His direction is somewhat lethargic and the image becomes a majestic succession of scenes that all seem slightly overwritten (but not very nourished) and slightly too long. He has never been a particularly good actor director, so he simply lets the cast get along. They do well. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock had a good sense of humor, which he often used in his thrillers, but he had no sensitivity for the comic genre. His next trouble with Harry was also a bonfire, for reasons similar to this film, but at least he was involved in that photo. He's just doing things here. <br /> <br /> All the people connected to this film were good professionals, so it's not particularly bad. It looks a bit derivative, too familiar, too long and eventually quite flat. <br /> <br /> Mr and Mrs Smith is only one for Carole Lombard fans and only for Hitchcock's completers.
