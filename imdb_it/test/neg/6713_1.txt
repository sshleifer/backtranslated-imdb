I think Cockpuncher is the best work that has come out of Steven Seagal's factory for a long time. This film was the first I saw from that preview of the film. My point? He is done. Each film is the same. Maybe he'll be good at Machete because he won't be the star. We can only hope. <br /> <br /> P.S. Thank you for talking to UCSB when I went to college. It was a fantastic speech. You really did influence some people out there. <br /> <br /> So I have to write ten lines on this movie? Umm .... I like the smoker who killed a lot of crazy people. Whenever someone smells menthol, LOOK. Because there may be a killer with a silenced glock (and another noisy) who wants to kill you. <br /> <br /> That ten?
