The combination of Dan Haggerty (Elves) and Linda Blair (Exorcist) is enough to appeal to any horror fan in this film. And once you see the cover of this movie of a frozen zombie coming out of their cryogenic room, you'll think you've been to B-Movie Horror Heaven. At least that's the way I approached this movie. But boy, I was in a shock <br /> <br /> I love horror movies. I also love B-Movies. Nothing makes my day more than a little movie of about zombies, monsters, murderers, that kind of thing. But to say that this film was missing is an understatement. This film was pure garbage. You would think that the zombies look like the one showing the cover-art of the box, but instead, you get actors with masks clearly sold at any Halloween counter. Furthermore, the script is beyond all limits. Our main character, Joseph, suffers the loss of his wife and son and seeks comfort in the lukewarm Mary, played by Blair. Not once do you see any signs of sadness or discomfort from Joseph's character. Instead, we see the head of the cryogenic laboratories, a man named Dr. Miller, eager to take the bodies and experiment with their organs. There is no emotion or anything to make you believe that you shouldn't give a damn about anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, very disappointing. There were all the elements to make a great horror movie. You had your zombies, your decent actors and your story. But the lack of good writing and the poor sense of orientation ruined all this. Overall, 4 out of 10
