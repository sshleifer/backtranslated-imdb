Occasionally fun but generally boring. I recognized Robert Hegyes from Welcome Back Carter (aka Epstein) as the ex-celebrity criminal. There's a slap on the knee, a bribe scene with the French lady who has a bad reaction to American food. S. Baio, S. Kellerman and Tom Arnold are billed but have only minor roles. You never know the characters and it's hard to worry about what happens to them. Not recommended.
