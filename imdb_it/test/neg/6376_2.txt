First of all, the title "DAILY" is a LIE. <br /> <br /> Each "Daily Show" program opens with a screen display of the date it was created, followed by a break and the opening announcement. In the many days they are preparing a Daily Show, they slip the tape and OMIT the date and start with the opening announcement giving the false impression that the show is new. It's a lie. There is no mention of the fact that it is a retransmission. And that kind of crap is just a small indicator of how sneaky this show is. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, it is only for 4 nights a week. This is not entirely "everyday" - it means Monday to Friday - another inconvenience but I am grateful. <br /> <br /> It is sad to think that many incapable young people use this false news program as their main, often lonely, news source. This leaves them sadly ignorant and much worse - ill-informed. <br /> <br /> Even if it leans on the liberal left, politically, this show can be fun sometimes. However, its veracity is low. Facts and information are often skilfully distorted to fit the authors' agenda. It is often difficult to say where the facts end and the narrative and comedy begin. The result is pre-digested and reinterpreted information designed to persuade and influence. This is called "PROPAGANDA". <br /> <br /> The remote interviews are heavily modified. <br /> <br /> It really makes me lose when washing God and Christians - which happens too often. However, you will never feel anything vaguely anti-Semitic. <br /> <br /> If Jon Stewart and the company attack anyone but Christians, it would be considered an offensive offense. The names in the credits explain the source.
