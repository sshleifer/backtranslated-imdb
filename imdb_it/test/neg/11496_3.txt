I recently rented this promising mini series, I didn't even know I adapted it for television. I really didn't look forward to it, since the Icon book is one of the best spy thrillers I've ever read. What a disappointment it was. The plot vaguely resembles that of the book, the characters are completely wrong and there is a terrible recitation. Really a pity. Icon's story is perfect for the big screen, but I think television budgets are not big enough for a decent adaptation of this spectacular book. <br /> <br /> Forsyth deserves much, much better than this. Avoid and stick to the book, which is a must-read.
