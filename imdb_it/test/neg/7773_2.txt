if you're a brave movie sucker and you're trying to see something you don't need to pay attention to, it might be worth watching. the story itself is very unrealistic. dialogue is also not very credible. it is doubtful that you find yourself in relation to any of these characters because none of them is very nice. acting could have been much worse. Victoria Pratt is definitely out of place with the rest of the cast, as she seems to have a lot of potential and talent as an actress. while not saying much, this is one of the best acting performances I've seen since Tori's spelling. seems to be improving with age. overall, this extremely melodramatic film is mediocre at best.
