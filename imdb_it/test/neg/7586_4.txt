Normally I won't waste my time criticizing a useless film like this. Anyway, I'm out of work this week, so I have plenty of time to bask in trivial platitudes. To begin with, let me tell you that I often like non-commercial, non-mainstream and non-American cinema. (Feel free to click on my user profile for a supporting filmography.) That said, there are many bad movies that are released in countries outside the United States. Believe me, I was tortured by hundreds of them. "Lost In Beijing" is a particularly ugly film. <br /> <br /> The half-hour opening is an impressive display of non-stop moral degeneration. This film provides some classic costumes that belong to the same level of "Bad Guy" by Kim Ki-duk (2001). <br /> <br /> 1. women really enjoy being raped; 2. rape should be glorified, praised and respected; 3. feel free to rape any woman you like, because while you "make" her she will eventually start to like me and reach orgasm; 4. If the wife is raped, be sure to blackmail her rapist for a lot of money, but if she does not pay, she repeatedly beats his wife's bitch as compensation; 5. If the wife is raped, be sure to rub her and degrade her the next day while playing the rapist role, provoking her with phrases like "Did you like it? Do you like it?"; 6. If you are a rapist husband, accept it; 7. After you have been raped personally, make friends with your rapist and relax with him whenever possible. <br /> <br /> How can a sane person worry about any of these characters? They are nothing but a group of degenerates who not only live their lives in carefree ways, but actually delight in their lack of meaning and support each other. Don't get me wrong though. I am very capable of enjoying films that describe lifestyles and morals that are in contradiction with mine. "Ichi the Killer" (2001) and "Moonlight Whispers" (1999) are very interesting portraits of sado-masochism. "Strange Circus" (2005) is an extremely perverse game about child sexual abuse. "Marriage is a crazy thing" (2002) is a fierce accusation about traditional marriage. Even religiously based films like "Running On Karma" (2003) and "Samsara" (2001) entertained me occasionally. The difference is that those films actually have some interesting psychological content and character development for them, while "Lost In Beijing" has virtually none. <br /> <br /> It is known that people with an unorthodox mentality exist on this planet, but without some sort of character development or psychology behind the same acts, one ends up with a superficial exposure of contemptible behavior. Why, exactly, does Bing Bing eventually make friends and take care of his rapist? Why does a rapist's wife accept her behavior unconditionally? Filmmakers never bothered to tell us. Even the obvious juxtaposition of rich and poor classes was conceived in an inappropriate way and eventually served as a simple situational stratagem. Everything seems too trivial and forgettable after the half hour of dirty opening is lowered. <br /> <br /> The other reviewers seem to have a moral ambiguity confused with a complex characterization. The reason why you can't choose the person to root from is because they haven't been developed properly. Don't think that this film has complex characters just because they are not clearly defined. On the contrary, the reason they are not clearly defined is because we know nothing about them or what they are thinking. This is certainly not a positive attribute of this film. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the work with the camera and the acting are quite good, but everything else becomes increasingly dull and dull as the film progresses. You can place it next to "Turning Gate" (2002), "What Time Is It There" (2001), "Irreversible" (2002) and the nickname "Bad Guy".
