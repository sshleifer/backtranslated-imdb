The plot is a blunt claim jumper, made a deal with the devil to find gold, and is forced to protect it forever. A group of friends finds the gold and is chatted by the old miner and they are forced to blow the gold into a thousand pieces to send him back to hell. <br /> <br /> I mean seriously ... how does this movie NOT win the Oscar for film of the year? What a compelling storyline of late twenties escaping from a jumper of compensation dating back to the 1800s. I love how in other films you can't kill the monster but they can kill it ... this movie they write as completely indestructible. <br /> <br /> The opening of the film clearly rips Nightmare out of Elm Street part 4 but what the hell, not like that movie was a 5-star classic. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film is when we are introduced to a girl who has never been to school, never been out of the city, I never learned to read or write .... yet she speaks English perfect, smokes hot and wears the latest fashion. How did the Oscar fail? <br /> <br /> OK I ended up with the wrong jokes, this movie is pure shit and look at it only if you have nothing better to do and all the spices on the spice rack are already in alphabetical order. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
