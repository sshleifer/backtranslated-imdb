What? - Has been? Does the town sheriff (John Agar) blow up the mutant gorilla with a stick of dynamite hidden in a mannequin? Did I just write it? Have I just seen it? <br /> <br /> With the instrumentals of The Wildcats, "Night Fright" is a film that never deserved to be made until 1967. The gorilla's heyday was over, and anyone else but Ray Corrigan in a monkey suit is just asking for trouble. Resume this in black and white and set the story about thirty years before and you would have at least a rating of 4.0 on IMDb. But unfortunately, this should never have had the chance to see the light of day. Oops, there is another strangeness: one can never tell if it is day or night in history, since they seem interchangeable with one another. <br /> <br /> I'll give you this though, a couple of the first malt stores the scenes seemed to have been able to go on air as a Coca-Cola commercial. Thinking about it now, those were probably the most beautiful and illuminated scenes of the photo; Coca Cola must have paid them. If they had seen the full movie, they could have been better served to prevent its release.
