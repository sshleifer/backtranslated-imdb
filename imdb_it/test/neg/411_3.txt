An extremely fast, exciting, interesting book, full of details. It is a pity that the film did not have these qualities. not just the tender and gentle portrayal of Tom Hanks or Robert Langdon Laughable, but the name changes to key characters, huge deviations from the original plot and Carmalengo's poor Irish / Italian accent, played by Ewan Mcgregor, made for the worst book to film NEVER. <br /> <br /> Being a big fan of the A & D book, I had high hopes for a richer film, real to book, where it would start and finish just like the book, leaving me wanting more. <br /> <br /> The whole movie really did make me down within the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> what was impressive was the ... sorry! I couldn't even finish that sentence without laughing. <br /> <br /> in brief - Vittoria was the spearhead, a second to Audrey Tatou and there were some nice Alfa Romeos. <br /> <br /> I would recommend reading the book to understand that if Ron Howard were to insist on making ANOTHER book to be filmed, I would be happy to save my Â£ 6.40 for a KFC ginger meal and some chicken wings - much more fun and much more satisfying!
