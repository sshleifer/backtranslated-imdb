.... is where I assume this movie was born I mean, I've seen a lot of B-movies during my young life so far, and I wouldn't even classify it as a B movie. I remember watching movies in my class of high school media that exceed this. <br /> <br /> So the premise is ... a lot of dancing numbers and dirty nonsense happen. Women in bikinis, who are not even so beautiful to begin with, dance at the beginning and sing. Guys with furry cocks and fanged girls who are out in the sunlight. I mean, I can barely put together a coherent sentence thinking about this movie. According to most people on this site, Manos the Hands of Fate and Pod People are the worst movies (classic MST3K: -D) ... I was one of them. Then I saw this movie. I don't usually try to film a movie too much, but the people who did it really deserve it. IT'S THAT bad and THAT unbearable, and I assume the director or an actor in the film is the only person who rated this ten.
