Much praise has been lavished on Farscape, but I don't think it's that good. It certainly has a distinctive aspect, but lacks the rest: history, purpose, direction, excitement; call him. I'm a big fan of science fiction and I'm a point of reference to see all the science fiction shows I can. I have almost finished the four seasons of Farscape and, at this point, I am not very satisfied. The show has some positive things - in particular Claudia Black (who unfortunately is missing from the first episodes of the fourth season) -, but they are very few and very far apart. Overall the show is marked by a lot of very silly things (like Fantasy elements rather than SF ditto), and many many episodes, esp. in the fourth season, they are unspeakably messy and very badly structured. And it feels like it's not going anywhere. They are mostly only non-directional adventures with thin and long-lasting weft lines that develop very slowly. Well, sometimes it's a little tighter, but it lasts only a few episodes at a time. <br /> <br /> Effects-wise, there are some awesome things here and there (especially in space, occasionally), but the show seems stuck in the same style of effects, which quickly becomes old. Extravagant and unconvincing puppets mark the show very much, and I ended up preferring (by far) the episodes in which normal human-looking characters are at the center. <br /> <br /> I think the Peacekeepers are by far the most elegant and intriguing and interesting figures on the show; they manage to be a convincingly alien culture, despite their all-human appearance. There are some really fantastic episodes with them, esp. in the first season (IIRC), where Crichton masquerades as a Peacekeeper captain, and invades and eventually destroys one of their secret bases. These episodes can reach a score of 8 out of 10, but I cannot assign the show as a whole more than a score of "4". <br /> <br /> In addition to the Peacekeepers (which in turn are a bit too resolute totalitarian and militaristic to be really nuanced), the show simply offers nothing important or significant that you need to know or want to see . OTOH, contains some good ideas and is not a total loss. <br /> <br /> This is just my opinion, of course, but as a passionate science fiction fan, I think it's worth something, and can be of help to others. There are not many good science fiction shows out there; but Star Trek (any series) and especially the new Battlestar Galactica are definitely better than Farscape. But if you're a big fan of mediocre science fiction shows, you might also like Farscape. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4 out of 10.
