The director remained faithful to the most accurate account of the story published in 1894 which includes a 1846 manuscript by Richard Williams Bell (son of John and Lucy Bell and younger brother of Betsy Bell) entitled "Our Family Trouble". For knowledge this is the only testimonial story ever written. The filmmaker should be credited for accuracy, but there is little to say about the quality of production and acting. The acting was theatrical and the quality of sound and images was extremely poor. It seems that the director has simply filmed the scenes of the reported events that have occurred without incorporating them or weaving them into a plot or storyline full of stories. If you need to know the story, read about it, it's much more compelling and conclusive.
