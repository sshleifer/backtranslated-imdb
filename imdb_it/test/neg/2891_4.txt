Furthermore, entitled BURNING MAN and FLASH FIRE for its various releases, this film produced in Australia, shot in New South Wales, is problematic for its producers from the beginning due to numerous personality conflicts and prolonged shooting times that prematurely exhaust the budget allocated and the plot is at times pleasantly detailed, below the standard finish of post-production and, for the most part, the cutting of the scene. Tom Skerritt plays the role of Howard Anderson, an American entrepreneur with a "passion for building" who is going to build a tourist hotel in the Blue Mountains region, not knowing that his business partner, Julian Fane (Guy Doleman) has secured the incomplete structure for ten million dollars, much more than its actual value, and plans its destruction as a corollary to the normal summers fires in order to collect a good sum through fraud. In keeping with this illicit scheme, Fane arranges for an incendiary to carry out the arsonist, a young man who is also the boyfriend of Anderson's daughter, and since the future resort is in the middle of a critical fire hazard sector (one of the many inexplicable elements of the script), Julian has all the expectations that his vile design will arrive without serious obstacles. While the local insurance company victim of the crime is majority-owned by Fane, Lloyd's of London, naturally skeptical policymakers, deploy senior investigator George Engels (James Mason) to investigate the nature of the crime, made more sinister by cause of death, perhaps a murder, of an insurance investigator (Wendy Hughes) who, following the evidence, was apparently approaching the cause of the fire. The setting of the film is the week before Christmas, a milestone of the summer in Antipodes, a dramatic backdrop, but the links within the story are not mixed smoothly, with the consequence of presenting rather difficult events to follow for a spectator, a problem increased by the irregular modification, the heavy cut mentioned, the poor sound and the quality of the image. Skerritt's semi-comatose and droning style is fatally invalidated by this dim sound processing, but Mason is very effective, as always, and enjoys the best dialogue with Hughes, as impressive as the investigator written too soon; Doleman wins acting with his portrayal of the malevolent Julian Fane.
