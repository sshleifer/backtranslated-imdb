While I'm writing this, there are still no user reviews, but there are 17 votes with an average of 4.8, so apparently some people thought this movie had its moments. I hadn't noticed anyone, and even if I were, I don't think I could have stopped looking up long enough to appreciate them. <br /> <br /> A common debate among film buffs is whether the main mistakes science, police tactics and so on, so common in B movies, should significantly detract from someone's enjoyment. I tend to fall into the "Yes, it's a reasonable reaction" field, especially when errors are fundamental to the plot. With this film, I can't wait to read how anyone can defend this mess. They are completely unrelated to every aspect of military tactics and strategies, police tactics, weapons, science, folklore, common sense and human behavior (outside of the series B movies). In short, I can't think of anything trivial they are right. <br /> <br /> Each film should have its work cut out when its central premise is a supernatural spirit, impervious to all small arms, capable of disappearing into another dimension at will, yet seemingly vulnerable to a simple explosion. (They don't do ghosts like they did before). Combine this premise with every wrong detail and you have a memorable movie.
