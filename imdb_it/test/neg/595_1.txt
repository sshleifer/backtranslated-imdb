We see, cardboard characters like Muslim terrorists have forced a cardboard scientist to perform some tests of exotic drugs on some cardboard people who have been drugged and kidnapped. You'll be sure to laugh when these pathetic excuses for humanoids get their merits! It turns out that drug experiments have given them the opportunity to perceive another world ... the world of religious fantasy! - complete with cardboard demons that look like papier-mâché. All are dragged to Hell except for a poor boy who goes to Heaven, where he can presumably spend eternity with slaves who created this masterpiece of the absurd. I think I'd go for Hellfire too. Go see something else, unless you're stoned, in which case you might really like it! I could not hurt!
