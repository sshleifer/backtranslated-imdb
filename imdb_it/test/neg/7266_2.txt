What can I say about THE PLEASURE PLANET that I never said about thirteen other boring soft core porn movies? Very little . It's just another film with a very weak storyline used to create very unconvincing scenes between non-male actors who spend too much time in the gym and bimbos who obviously had silicone implants. Actually the sex scenes in this film are a little less convincing than those seen in this type of film while the cast members touch their hips together giving painful expressions as if they had constipation or something. No wonder many people claim that sex is overrated, they probably watched too many movies at nightly cable stations
