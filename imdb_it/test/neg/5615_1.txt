Despite an excellent soundtrack and the presence of the always surprising Rappaport and Woods, this is another of the idiotic comedies in which New York throws itself against the hero, in an effort by the writer and / or director to show what a strange place it is . Yes, there are other things in the movie that suck, but that's what's important. The tendency of independent filmmakers in New York seems to be "I don't need to be talented, I have NEW YORK!" Ok, to be honest, the film has its moments. The flashback on why the only guy called Wacky Jack was pretty funny. The script is not a story or a plot, it is a bunch of bad scenes related to each other with the same character. <br /> <br /> One of the worst things is that there is no reason behind what the characters do. Uncle Sam gave the child the drugs, why? If it's so important why didn't Sam do it alone? Then the main character lies his ass on stage after scene with absolutely nothing to gain from the lie. The boy falls in love with a flight attendant without either of them having reason to fall in love. Characters are a bunch of checkers to allow the writer to move to see if he can make something strange happen. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy yourself easily or you like watching indie bad movies because they make you feel smarter than watching bad traditional movies, watch this. If you want to see how a good-hearted crime movie looks, look at Takeshi Kitano's "brother". "Kicked In The Head" is the perfect example of why so many people hate unusual indie films: UN LOT OF THE SUCK. And a note to the director: don't be afraid to excite, entertain, enlighten or entertain the audience from time to time. Being boring does not make you a better director than those that may interest me.
