There is a special paradise reserved for people who make the world laugh. Next to Chaplin, Stan and Ollie, The Marx Bros and ..... (insert your special favorites) a space must be created for all those connected with "Airport 80 - Concorde, the movie". In particular, Robert Wagner exceeds all expectations by giving the comic performance of a lifetime. I never thought he had it in him. The only way it could have been more fun would have been to have a red nose and a swivel bow tie. English spectators will recognize Cannon and Ball's fat pretending to be a Russian athlete, a nice trick if he could take it off but, tragically, he couldn't. I have a more athletic and almost funny 14 year old labrador. George Kennedy - bless him - he has a part that requires him to speak and move at the same time, and my goodness triumphs! Brow wrinkled with effort utters a timeless dialogue, each word lovingly polished in Coward splendor. Only once every twenty years does Hollywood make a film like "Aeroporto 80". All the years of struggle and struggle, sweat, tears, lessons with Lee Strasberg, living out of suitcases, born in a trunk etc. Etc. come to fruition. A work of art is created that will last as long as there are films and machines to show them. I think I'm ready for my medicines now.
