Fortunately, I watched this movie on my own, allowing me to move quickly into the worst scenes (actually most of the movie, actually). OK, in part it's not all bad, with a partially good photograph (even some of the underwater scenes) and, sometimes, it's not bad direction. But he still doesn't save the incredibly poor script and the worst way of acting. Also, when I don't find "hottie" movies to be all of this, even the aspiring-sexy love that makes the scenes gets boring. Really boring! And for the drama: you know it's always a bad sign when you don't like all the characters so much that you don't care who lives and who dies. <br /> <br /> If you haven't gotten tired of the Survivor reality series yet, you might find something to your liking in this movie. Otherwise, you're clear!
