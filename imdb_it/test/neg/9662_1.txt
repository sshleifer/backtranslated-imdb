Calu ... now what? Yes, I thought it was also a stupid name. Chris Carter remains blissfully unaware of the scum in his staff of screenwriters. Starting with the usual teaser X-Files (a child who is hit by a train) this episode ... well, I can't really say that it goes downhill because, to be honest, it has never been uphill. <br /> <br /> Badly written, with us not experiencing any pathos for any of the characters (except maybe that child at the beginning) the writer makes us hate the characters before killing them brutally, it's the worst technique ever. Should we feel sorry for the characters to hate them? Don't ask me <br /> <br /> Not only is it boring and not scary, but it's like watching a really ugly Omen sequel with exaggerated and disgusting death sequences and rotten special effects (although to be brutally honest, this is the last of my concerns). <br /> <br /> Sara B. Charno started her career with X-Files with a whimper and luckily ended it with one. <br /> <br /> Verdict: <br /> <br /> words of my math teacher Mr. Laverack: "Horrible, terrible ..."
