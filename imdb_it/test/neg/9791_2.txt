Apparently SHRUNKEN HEADS was the last film in which Julius Harris played a role. I didn't see all his films, but Julius Harris was in many good films, and I remember him better than "Live and Let Die" where he played Tee-Hee and was full of Voodoo references, something that is common here in South Florida ! I always thought LIVE AND LET MORI was a great movie because it had an atmosphere and a mystique, unlike most 007 movies. In SHRUNKEN HEADS, Julius Harris is back in his Voodoo character! He has a great style for mystery and the occult, and his part in this film is excellent. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is a kind of comedy. SPOILERS: Three kids who seem to have been fired from the cast of THE LITTLE RASCALS are killed by a thug from the neighborhood who seems to have been fired from the FAME cast! or as a dancer on DICK CLARK's AMERICAN BANDSTAND. In other words, these guys give BUDGET BASSO another dimension. Julius Harris goes to the morgue-Funeral Home, cuts the heads of the three children (and nobody notices) and then takes them to his apartment block where he has a giant cauldron of boiling liquids. The three heads are thrown in, along with some herbs, spices and Voodoo objects. At some point, Mr. Harris has the ugly little heads on a table and pours blood on them, and they come to life as talking heads! They can fly, make jokes, look up and take revenge on the Evil. They are usually pretty funny, but the effects are not bad. For some reason, one of the boys always has a change blade in his mouth, and uses it to cut people's necks and cut holes in tires. This film is strange and funny, but only the first time you see it. Meg Foster is in this film and looks fatter than Rosie O'Donnell and Meg plays a male boss of local gangsters. Strange movie.
