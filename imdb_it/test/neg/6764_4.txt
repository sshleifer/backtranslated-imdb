Some nameless aliens on a ship far from a distant planet have sent the giant Kronos robot to rob the world of its energy. They have a prototype horn around Mexico for openers and if they can try more they will be sent. It would certainly take a long time for this Kronos alone to perform this task. <br /> <br /> For reasons I cannot explain to the aliens, first I capture the mind of the famous scientist John Emery who telepathically directs Kronos to his first goals. Since Emery is killed later and the monster seems to work quite well without Emery as a controller, because the aliens need him in the first place it's a bit bizarre. <br /> <br /> In any case the scientists Jeff Morrow, Barbara Lawrence and George O'Hanlon who work with Emery are not fooled by its nature. And of course they come up with a plan to deal with the furious metal giant. <br /> <br /> Kronos is a perfect movie for the fifties, the bad guys are never seen who have just come out of the goal of weakening humanity. It's a perfect movie for the Cold War. And Jeff Morrow assures us that we will be ready for them in the future. <br /> <br /> Players have the impression that they are amazed by a large number of clich√© lines that writers could include in the script. I have the impression that Kronos is the kind of film that Ed Wood could have done with a bigger budget with a little more attention.
