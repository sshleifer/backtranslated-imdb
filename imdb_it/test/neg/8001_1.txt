This film has not simply redemptions. The story is incomprehensible and the script is coarse, sadistic and stupid. Sex scenes are a joke, as is the inevitable car chase. The music is terrible. The acting is largely limited to growling and grinning. A half star. Shame on DirecTV for putting it on pay-per-view. In a theater, people may have thrown soda on the screen.
