"The Italian Job" is a film of capers made from numbers. Riding behind every cliché of capers, it does not rise to particular heights and will be a note of the film towards the end of the month. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is that "Italian work" has no imagination at all. I've seen it all before and done better then. Acting is fine cinematography is completely acceptable, but this film does not break any new ground at all. <br /> <br /> Let's tick off the clichés: <br /> <br /> - figure of the "old school" criminal father and his protégé <br /> <br /> - another member of the jealous band of protected <br /> <br /> - a double-cross <br /> <br /> - only villains use guns while good criminals don't have to <br /> <br /> - good criminals always manage to beat the bad guys <br /> <br /> and that covers the first fifteen minutes. Everything is so predictable. Even the robberies and car chase scenes, presumably the highlight of the movie, seem pretty ordinary. This is especially true since they appeared in the movie trailers so I already knew what to look for. <br /> <br /> For me, a film of capers works only if it has an element of realism - which perhaps, perhaps only, could be pulled out without relying on a deux ex machina or "just because" moments. Parts of "The Italian Job" throw him out the window, with computers doing things that computers can't do, good guys who don't hit anyone with their guide (especially coming downstairs) and not a single police car that responds to the road explosions, reckless minis or even a low-altitude helicopter. It must be a city devil for these things not to evaluate an answer. <br /> <br /> Acting is acceptable, with the crew (Seth Green, Jason Stratham and Mos Def) being at least fun to watch. Mark Wahlberg is simply too tipsy as the "good boy" hero while Charlize Theron talks about the only actor called to show some kind of range. Donald Sutherland is a class act as always and shows Wahlberg's shortcomings every time they are together. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a rather uninteresting film. Given the IMDb rankings, it's the girls who love this movie, which I can somehow understand, but there are better caper films out there - even the lack of energy from the recent "Ocean's Eleven" overshadows the non-event which is "Italian work". <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> At the end, take a moment to think about what will happen to the character of Norton. Are we going to cheer up the good guys for causing her disappearance, especially because it would seem to be long and painful? He didn't deserve it, it looked like what it was. <br /> <br /> *** END SPOILER ***
