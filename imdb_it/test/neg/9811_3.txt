The Slaughter Trail is a western B with some big claims. But he came down in Hollywood history for an ignominious reason. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie with its musical score that can be described as overbearing, I get the feeling that Howard Hughes was trying to do is recruit a Cowboy singer for RKO movies. They already had Tim Holt who was a reliable B-image cowboy hero like he never existed, but he wasn't a singer. I imagine Hughes saw what money Herbert J. Yates was raking in with Roy Rogers at the Republic and decided to have one too. <br /> <br /> So Terry Gilkyson who was a great performer and a much better song the writer was recruited and sang part of his material that was not his best and worse, it seemed they were included in the picture. But worse, there is this annoying chorus that has sung a lot of history and frankly has overwhelmed the actors, extras, even horses. Needless to say, Terry never became a singing cowboy. But he wrote classics like The Bare Necessities and the great success of Dean Martin, Memories is Made of This. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns a woman in a diligent robbery. That's right, the outlaws that are Gig Young, Myron Healey and Ken Koutnik plant Virginia Gray in the coach as a passenger who get word by bringing some precious jewels. <br /> <br /> It is a great deed that Gray and Young realize. Young takes her away from the coach to presumably a fate worse than death and they act right out of the scene within earshot of passengers, but what she does is slip her swag. The last place where the authorities could appear, if it doesn't get along. <br /> <br /> But when they escape from the robbery it is on tired horses, so they stop in a cabin to take replacement mounts and shoot three Navajos who object. This puts the Navajos back on the war path, but it doesn't help that one of the wounded was the brother of chief Ric Roman. <br /> <br /> This is the situation that Captain Brian Donlevy at the fort has to face when the coach and the outlaws arrive there for protection. The way everything works is predictable, but unfavorably. <br /> <br /> In fact this is the problem with Slaughter Trail. It is a simple, no-frills B western that has turned into something almost grotesque. <br /> <br /> But the real reason why Slaughter Trail has entered history is that this movie apparently marks the official start of the blacklist. Originally Howard DaSilva had to play the part of Donlevy and in fact he could have completed his scenes, when Howard Hughes officially dismissed him for communist sympathies. His scenes were completely republished with Brian Donlevy in the lead. <br /> <br /> Considering which fiasco has transformed this film, I'm not sure that Donlevy or DaSilva should have thanked Hughes or kicked him in his private reserve.
