I think "Bone Snatcher" should go after anyone who has joined this movie. Watching this will seem like the longest 90 minutes of your whole life. The plot is boring and stupid. There were no scenes that were horrible, even remotely. If you can stand this beautiful piece of film art to the end, you will either be very disappointed or you will die laughing hysterically. I bought this movie based on some other reviews I had read. I wish I had my money back. What a spiker. If you are looking for a horror film that holds your interest, look at "U Turn". It can be based on a kooky storyline, but it's full of those scary scenes that make you jump from start to finish.
