This film was basically set for failure by the studio. One, Anne Rice (author of the book) offered to write the script but was rejected by the studio. Two, they tried to insert 2 in-depth novels in a 2-hour movie. <br /> <br /> I keep the only way for these two books - Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned - to work in a form of live action through a mini series. First of all, the Vampire Lestat takes place alone from the 1700s to the 80s and has a plethora of vital character for understanding the plot of the main character, Lestat. The entire book Vampire Lestat organizes the events of the second part Queen of the Damned. Without this full understanding the premise of a film is destroyed. <br /> <br /> Lestat was not cruel and evil to everyone, he did not want to follow Akasha's plans, Marius had not created Lestat, Lestat did not love Jesse or do it, Lestat could not go to remain untouched by light, Marius did not he was in search of David, nor vice versa, every character was completely represented incorrectly, in an absolutely identical way to another name. <br /> <br /> If they wanted to make a vampire movie, fine. Even if I wanted to be inspired by these novels, well. But don't go back to the theaters from the success of Rice's great novels and characters just to destroy what his faithful readers have come to love. <br /> <br /> If you have not read the books you will not really understand the film, if you have read the books you will be insulted. That being said, I am such a big fan that I had to watch the movie knowing full well that this would have been the case and we lost it anyway. Take the 22, you have to see it, it will hate it.
