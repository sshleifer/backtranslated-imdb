It is rare to see a film that strikes in every aspect, but "Caligula" certainly must contain this title. I'm not sure what is more horrible; violence, sexual perversion, acting or plot (or its serious lack). <br /> <br /> The two and a half hours basically follow the ascension of the infamous Roman Caesar "Caligula" to the throne in 37 AD and shows the atrocities and perversion he allegedly committed while in power. Acting is lifeless and boring - but this is just the tip of the iceberg. Obviously knowing that this film was seriously lacking in something legitimate interesting, the directors decided to include scenes of nudity and orgy as many as were possible. But don't be fooled, these scenes don't fade or focus on the horrible of this movie. The camera work is poor, the dialogue is ridiculous, in reality you should congratulate Malcolm McDowell (playing Caligula) to keep a straight face through such far-fetching lines. And then there is violence .... <br /> <br /> If you are about to watch the film be prepared. Some atrocities are committed in the film (not only through writing) but through violent and disgusting actions that have little sense or other purpose than to reject the viewer. This is just the goal achieved by this film. One must ask how the creators of this film thought that bestiality, necrophilia and castration (just to name a few) would be interesting for everyone. When it ends late, after two and a half hours, you take nothing from this movie except some disturbing images and the knowledge that you may have witnessed the worst movie ever. <br /> <br /> You have been notified
