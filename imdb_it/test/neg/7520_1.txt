This movie sucked. From the beginning to the end it was predictable. There was absolutely no chemistry between Pearce and the Mumba chick. The plot didn't go anywhere, floating in oblivion. All this has led the film to be very funny in its stupidity. And I wanted to strangle Orlando Jones, the boy just needs to leave.
