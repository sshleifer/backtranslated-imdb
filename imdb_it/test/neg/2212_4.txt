Yes, it may not be for adults, and some adults may find it stupid, but if you don't think about it, it's not so bad. <br /> <br /> The story has Alvin and his band, crossing the world, looking for jewels for a bad person, and the mishaps they come into contact with. <br /> <br /> So the animation is good, and the story is nice, and the songs are forgettable but it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> I give him a 6 out of 10 or a *** out of 4 stars.
