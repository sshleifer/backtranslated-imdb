I'm glad I didn't pay to see 'The Wog Boy'. <br /> <br /> I sat there I hope to wait for something original and / or fun to happen. <br /> <br /> He recalled I really like those predictable English comedies of the 70s. <br /> <br /> I won't go into a synopsis of the plot, I suggest you do something else for 90 minutes <br /> <br />
