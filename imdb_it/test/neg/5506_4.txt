I can't help thinking that this is Franco's "passage" to the "Thousand Days of Sodom" of the Marquis de Sade. Are people (in this case women) abducted to serve as slaves of a privileged elite? Check. Vicious sex? Check. Torture including the frame? Check. Victims randomly chosen to be killed? Check it out. <br /> <br /> Thank goodness, Franco was not furious and introduced the cinematographic public to the delights of coprology (and in fact coprophagia), another perversion that is repeated repeatedly in the boring and long and disgusting saga of de Sade. <br /> <br /> I rather hoped that this movie would fall into the "so bad is good" category. But even the acres of naked flesh and numerous sexual encounters have not compensated for the dismal dialogue, the terrible acting, the elusive storyline and - just to put on the tin hat - the English and dubbing subtitles (an approach with belt and braces is missing women's costumes). The Alsation gave a very professional performance though. <br /> <br /> Obviously I could be wrong about de Sade's corner. After all, I couldn't understand that the actor who played the prison manager was a transsexual. I have to pay more attention to the size of people's hands in the future. <br /> <br /> According to another reviewer, the film was banned in the UK. Well, clearly it's not anymore, although I imagine the nipple scene was cut to satisfy the censors. In the DVD I saw, it was clearly visible only on the Spanish trailer (which, in case you were wondering, I looked to compare it with the English one). <br /> <br /> The DVD also features an interview with Jess Franco, although you will need a better Spanish to understand it. Unless I'm very wrong, it's neither nicknamed nor subtitled. And he emphasizes that the person who sodomizes the character played by Franco is Ajita Wilson disguised with a mustache. Kind of ironic, given that (s) he had removed the appendix needed surgically.
