Against my best judgment I went to see this movie today, and God I wish I hadn't. Terrible. The first AvP movie looks like a classic compared to this, it's so bad. These guys actually make Paul WS Anderson look like a master storyteller. In fact, this is what I would expect an Alien and / or Predator film to look like if it were made by Uwe Boll! This film really offended me, and Lord only knows what would have happened if Ridley Scott or HR Giger had ever been forced to watch this piece of shit. I can't understand how any fan of both franchises can like this movie. <br /> <br /> I really don't know where to start. I mean, the first AvP was poop, but at least a semi-interesting story, and occasionally real tension. He did not take himself too seriously and could at least be partially appreciated on the basis of a pure "leaving the brain at home". But this, I felt as if the people behind it thought they were doing the next masterpiece of horror. One by one it was a "suspenseful" scene invented in a dark room or in a corridor with creepy music that played, essentially hitting you over the head saying "be scared NOW". As James Cameron once said, you cannot be told to be afraid, you can only increase your senses. The guys who made this movie obviously weren't paying attention because they tried everything in the book to force you to be afraid rather than let yourself come to that level yourself. It's a clich√© for internet nerds to say "God, I was so bored with this movie and it felt like I had to leave", well, that's exactly how I felt, even in the middle of the action scenes. They took this film totally seriously, eliminating any chance of having fun. Even the gag about how governments don't lie to their people has been played without a touch of irony. <br /> <br /> As for the characters, I knew that the human characters would have been completely useless for this film but seriously if they are going to be on screen at least make them do SOMETHING which is relevant to the story. I don't care that this guy gets beaten by his dream girlfriend's boyfriend, I don't care about his mother who is "her daughter doesn't even know her, boo-hoo!" (a pair of night vision glasses for a gift? Give me a break!) or the criminal released just trying to make a decent living and set an example for his brother, what a boy. Hell, even the obligatory moment of hot chick-in-panties was more elaborate than usual. I have the feeling that they expected the public to be so shocked at the end, as well as to see the jackals getting out of the children, the expectant mothers who were being raped and the like, who would have compensated for everything. I don't think so. <br /> <br /> Then we go to the stars of the film, and still very little to write at home. Were the aliens well designed? I have no idea why you can never see the damn things. Everything you see is one of a really clever mouth, a head, a tail or a cg profile that goes up on a wall, and barely enough to actually process that it is actually an alien before Mr "I cut the music videos of Marilyn Manson and NIN, I think I'll do the same thing here "The editor uses it with the slice tool. Also, do you notice how hacker action directors always set their movies at night and in the rain? Hmmmm. The Predator could have fought the giant sea monkeys for all we knew! Yes, the Predator was more impressive this time, and I thought some of the new weapons were fantastic, but it was all about it. Also, since when does a Predator sound like a dinosaur from The Lost World? There were a couple of things I liked though. One was the use of sound effects and music from the original films (I even chuckled a bit at "Get to the chopper!"), Although other references were stupid (the main character's name is Dallas, give me a break). I also liked the visual FX for the Predator vision, as well as the appearance of the alien hybrid (surely beat that of Resurrection). But really, those are the only positive things. <br /> <br /> Overall I found this film inane, useless, offensive and above all offensive to the vision of the original creators of both creatures. That they left the door open for another they leave me almost depressed. <br /> <br /> If they had some decency, they would remove Dan O'Bannon, Ron Schusett and HR Giger from the credits of this movie. They did nothing to deserve this.
