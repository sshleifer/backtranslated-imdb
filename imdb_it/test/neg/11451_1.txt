*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** There is not much that can be said about this film from the era of early talkies. (I am reluctant to call "Cimarron" a "movie" because I feel the word is too esoteric.) But what can be said about it ... speaks mainly against it. <br /> <br /> Take, for example, the excessive use of portraying Indians as bad people. In one scene, the boy of the main character in the film, a bully and too ambitious family man who wants to create a newspaper, is playing outside his father's office. An Indian kneels before the child. "Hi," the boy tells the Indians, in a very polite way. The Indian gives him a feather, gets up and leaves. <br /> <br /> Yancy Cravat, Jr. runs excitedly inside the office. "Mum mum!" he shouts, raising the Indian's gift. "Look what an Indian gave me!" <br /> <br /> "How many times do I have to tell you!" she snaps to the boy. "You must never talk to those filthy Indians!" <br /> <br /> Yancy Yates, Sr. (Richard Dix) comes across a man who speaks with a forked tongue. At the beginning of the story, he seems to have a definite plan to give his family a better life. But, we soon find out, he is not a great man of action, let alone a man with a generic mentality. Isaiah (Eugene Jackson) is a telltale sign of this. <br /> <br /> During his family's first trip to a Sunday morning church service - a <br /> <br /> to which Strangely, Cravat must deliver the sermon: Isaiah tries to come, dressed as Cravat, long-tailed suit, holster, pistol and everything else. Cravat tells him to go home. "Ya 'all does not want me to come with your church?" Isaiah says with a pout. <br /> <br /> "No!" Cravat corrects him, giving him a pat on the shoulder. "You don't understand, I want you to stay to watch the house, and if someone comes ... you will shoot him dead!" <br /> <br /> The characters - not to mention the actors --in "Cimarron" could not <br /> <br /> make their way out of jute bags, despite their obvious efforts. And nothing in the script was too commendable. (Sure: the incomparable Edna May Oliver - known for playing the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland, which also came out in 1931 - can really look beautiful, showing off her interpretation of a pompous old woman who is also the best-I know for.) But, apart from that, well ... Yancy Yates is not popular in the city from the first week she arrives, <br /> and one of the outlaws decide to shoot the white hat of Cravat while he and his wife (Irene Dunne) are walking casually. Despite his anger with the man who shot the bullet, Cravat takes it completely in the pass. <br /> <br /> Not only was this story not "shot for realism", but it was very <br /> <br /> missing in several key areas: for example, Cravat's newspaper is never seen really. (Bulletins and posters, yes - but not all newspapers.) <br /> <br /> Perhaps even the strangest of all: it is set in a small town on <br /> <br /> Kansas. Yet for one reason or another, Yancy Cravat died on set <br /> <br /> calling his newspaper "The Oklahoma Wig-Wam." <br /> <br /> The really good westerns have always been few and far - the only exceptions are Clint Eastwood's so-called "spaghetti westerns" in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Western cliche, on the other hand, are a dozen dollars. <br /> <br /> If you like western clich√©s, "Cimarron" will make you proud - but, as far as I'm concerned ... it made me embarrassed. <br /> <br />
