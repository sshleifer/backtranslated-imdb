This film was strongly recommended by a friend and, being a big Brando fan, I ordered this film from Harrods and waited impatiently for it to come. I have rarely been so disappointed with a movie. Brando was good as a German officer, but the rest of the film was simply unbearable. You don't like or like characters (except Brando, maybe). The acting was OK. History, what story? Perhaps this is the point. After all, it's a war, but I've seen much better war movies. (Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now, also Star Wars) It was so boring that I kept checking my watch ... <br /> <br /> Overall, this is one of the worst movies I've seen. Please don't waste time and money on this. I can also add that this is the first user comment I wrote, I just had to make my feelings known about this movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, my all-time favorites are: Casablanca, The Godfather 1 & 2, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Pulp Fiction and Amadeus. If you haven't seen them yet, please save time to do it. And Amadeus MUST be in widescreen 2.35: 1
