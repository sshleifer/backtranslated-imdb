So I took this afternoon as "What's on it" and actually I saw it because the beginning was somehow promising. The heroine, Diana Pennington, is an expert on mountaineering ... but this doesn't help her when her boyfriend Brian gets hurt uphill. When he leaves for help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, never to be seen again. <br /> <br /> Two years later, Diana is still a climber ... but she won't go near Snowman's Passage. That is, until Curt Seaver appears and tells her he can find the body of his lost boyfriend with a new satellite program. She agrees and they get up on the mountain with Curt's two assistants: his "bodyguard" Hugo and the computer wizard Tyler. From the beginning, you know there are some ulterior motives going on, but unfortunately the twists and turns aren't good and lead to an incredibly bad sequence of chases that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> The main disappointments are the forgeries, most of which have supernatural nuances that never come to fruition. The object from the sky that fell into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), the story of how Snowman's Pass was born, and the most memorable of all: the sequence of Diana's dreams in the middle of the film. But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball. Most of the film revolves around Brian's research, which is why I can't begin to understand why the mystery of what exactly happened to him and where he was was never solved in the course of the film. This was the main plot. So the movie started! How can you not close it? <br /> <br /> I wouldn't tell too many people to worry about this ...
