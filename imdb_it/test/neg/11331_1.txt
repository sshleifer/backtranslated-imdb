it's hard to tell actors about non-actors. Bad American films can be identified by all the young people who precede each line of dialogue with "Do you know what?" Bad Canadian films can be identified by all young people who end each line of dialogue with "Eh?" Didn't we learn anything in a century of cinema? Isn't it possible that the entire weight of millions of aspiring Hollywood descendants with screenplays and reels in hand will save us from these horrible custom-made TV movies?
