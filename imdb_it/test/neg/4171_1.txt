Apparently I'm swimming against the flood of bright comments in this movie. I haven't seen it since I was 4 or 5 years old but there is one thing I distinctly remember ... <br /> <br /> The Bunyip was TERRIFYING !!! Nightmare that causes terrifying. With the disturbing music and the girl and the kangaroo running / jumping for their lives ... <br /> <br /> As a child I also remember the animated Hobbit ... don't worry. Watership down? Don't blink. Dot and the kangaroo? Continue to haunt my dreams. And I have several friends of the same age who also think it was extremely creepy. Maybe we can get a group rate on therapy. <br /> <br /> In short: a bizarre film for its time.
