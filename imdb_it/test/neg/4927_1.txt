waste of 1h45 this bad movie is one to be avoided, it's like a cheaply planned mismatch between the saw and some other recent kidnapping films, because the writer wrote this is obvious ... he has no soul and he did it for try me for money. The twists were obvious, when those in danger could escape they did the obvious and not etc. The only good thing is that I discovered 1 new actress that is worth looking at. Python list, don't look at the shuttle though, there are too many more beautiful films to look at than this that will make you unhappy and think less of the world. Spend your time wisely watching good movies, do some exercise, have a good meal ... don't waste your time in junk like this
