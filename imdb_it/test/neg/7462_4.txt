Slow and bizarre film that drags and trudges (I really mean PLODS) along with its disappointing climax. You could expect some sort of ending joke at the end, but there isn't. Both Milland and Snodgress give embarrassing performances; in fact, the strangeness of the film could actually be the only thing he is doing. The generally atmospheric soundtrack has some absurd parts (like the music that plays during the first appearance of a monkey), and there is a really terrible fantasy scene that involves .... a gorilla.
