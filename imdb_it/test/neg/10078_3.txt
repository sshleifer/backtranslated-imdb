It is clear that for this film they wanted to have the plot led by the characters. But immediately the plot makes you love the new main characters. The flight over the island and the dinosaurs below did not have any impact and seemed almost like cartoons. The entry of all the actions on the island is simply a remake of parts from JP 1 and 2. The plot is predictable to the point of irritation and the unsatisfactory end made me feel cheated. This gave me no chance to award the 3/10 movie!
