I wasn't very excited about seeing this movie in the first place, but a group of us decided to go and see it during the opening night. I wanted to get up and go out and try to get my money back 20 minutes in this movie. I felt that the film was very boring, uninteresting and not true in many aspects, including the "game". I did my best not to fall asleep during the movie while watching one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. The scary movie series was scarier than this movie. The sad attempt to involve a gothic girl, a overworked businessman and a 15 year old nerd, and a random guy in a video game that kills you is a bad story to start with. Then they try to throw a very horrible love scene in which the main character kisses another girl after saving her 10 minutes after her girlfriend was killed. The theater was full when the film started and in the end just over half the people left before it was over. If you feel the need to lose only 1 hour and 16 minutes of your time seeing this movie ... get ready to feel cheated.
