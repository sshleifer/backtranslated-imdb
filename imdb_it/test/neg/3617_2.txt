Do not waste time. One of those appealing-looking boxes that you find on Blockbuster on an intuition, but that isn't even worth that. You will NOT say, "It's so ugly, it's good." Only, "He's bad." The Greatest American Hero is a writer who rents a cabin on the African island, called Snake Island. Some other tourists are on the boat that leaves it, but they are not on the island. They stop here to let the writer out. Then the boat is stuck there, and - in true Hollywood originality - the one and only radio on the island has been caught. So they start walking and they see a group of snakes. Like hundreds of them, which became really annoying and you knew the plot wouldn't go anywhere. It's not like there's ever been a main snake. Like a giant mutated snake or a poisonous king more than all snakes. Instead, there are only a group of ham-and-egger snakes of all types of races. Their only goal, therefore, was to escape from the island ... as opposed to having to conquer the enemy. Because there were so many snakes, you knew they couldn't try to kill them all, and they didn't try. I saw a similar film in which a city was infested with snakes and they lead all the snakes into a cave and then blew them up. At least then you have the feeling that the good guys have killed the bad guys and it was a normal ending. A Snake Island (by the way, every single character was shocked to see snakes on the island ... duhhhhh, it's NAMED Snake Island for a reason), there was no other plan than trying to get gas for the stupid boat . Oh, they never get gas, by the way. They "just happen" to find another boat on the island already gassed.
