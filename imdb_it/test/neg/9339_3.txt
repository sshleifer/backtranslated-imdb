... if only Disney had stayed away from it. See, I think this film has potential. Well, the situation of the main character does it, at least. Eliminate the whole of Jordan Cahill and you have the start of a decent movie! Of course, you also lose more than half of the movie, but oh well. It is not a great loss. <br /> <br /> So here it is: take a typical, preppy, suburban teenage girl (Danielle Panabaker, who is a decent actress) whose best friends scream a lot, mostly a "pop feeling" ( I assume it's a direct quote from the movie, films like this almost always involve that particular phrase) named Jordan Cahill. Except, of course, TPSTG wants more out of life. Enter the character of Brenda Song, a sophisticated individual who is exactly what TPSTG needs (honestly, I don't care what the character's real name is, I like the best acronym). The two new friends go to see Jordan Cahill (one to drool, one to tease jackals), and they come out with his cell phone. The jumps happen and in the end everything is resolved. <br /> <br /> If only Disney, or any other major film studio, didn't have such a low judgment from 8 to 14 years. Or maybe if the 8 to 14 year olds expected a little more from the movies they were directed to. It's a sugar-covered shit like this that makes me more than a little insecure about who's more disgusted (I think of a little movie called "High School Musical" ...)
