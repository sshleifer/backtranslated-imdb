I really liked the game Far Cry, nice graphics, good level design, interesting and intelligent enemies, above average length and even a fairly decent storyline. I'm not defaulted on movie spin-off games. I thought "DOOM The Movie" was fun. But what Uwe Boll did here is to take the game and change all its positive aspects and turn them into something horrible (well, not the length, the movie only flows a merciful 90 minutes) The characters are even more stereotyped than in the game, which is a good result. The whole plot is told without twists or mystery. Several obviously ridiculous scenes tell you every part of the story. And from the "genetically modified soldiers"? they could have found a better name. <br /> <br /> However, this film should receive some awards for the most idiotic love scene. I've never seen anything like it. I couldn't believe they were trying to be serious "we have to get out of wet clothes" "I think I'll take hypothermia" (even if everyone is wearing t-shirts) "we need to cuddle together for body heat" "Is that your gun?" But ... but ... there were no people who did it consciously? There must have been a screenwriter, a director, actors, an electrician, an electrician, a food guy! Why hasn't anyone jumped into that scene to prevent this evil from happening? Has this film been made by devastating, inhuman and genetically modified people? I will not begin to rant about how many logical errors, inconsistencies and defects in script writing there are, but also for the passionate fan of the actions, this can only be insulting. <br /> <br /> I actually asked this movie to be rated 2 out of 10, so I will do this favor. But this lets me explain where the second star comes from. Special effects? Nah. To act? Not exactly. References to the game? Wishes. Wait! they used the game's character for the title and credits. It was nice. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie for a bad night at the movies, choose "2012 - Supernova", that's just - sad.
