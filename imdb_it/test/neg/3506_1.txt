*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> One of the worst films I've seen in recent years "The Village". An insult to anyone of any intelligence. Poorly written and surprisingly artificial. No one, especially in Los Angeles, talks like these characters do. Absolutely not. If the point of this film is to say that "we all have a little bit of bigotry in us", it does a horrible job to affirm the obvious. Not only was his point clearly basic, but every character in this film was AMAZING STUPID. The carjacking scene almost brought me out, along with the rescue and oh I don't forget the WHITE off DUTY Rookie COP that picks up a black hitchhiker and ... I could go on forever. Terrible, just awful.
