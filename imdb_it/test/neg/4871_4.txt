1st watched on 25/2/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-George P. Cosmatos): predictable action thriller in which any frequent film-goer could guess what would happen next. Charlie Sheen is the good old guy for the president who seems not to like the rest of the presidential staff. Of course, he gets involved in a situation where he is framed over and over again and has a friend at the White House, played by Sutherland, who of course doesn't stay that long. His other friend is a reporter played by Linda Hamilton (who has very little to do or say in this meaningless role), and of course his biggest and best friend is the President himself (Sam Waterston) who remains his friend until in the end despite everyone else being killed around him. Brain meaningless without brain but full of action, despite loads and loads of talent (almost all wasted).
