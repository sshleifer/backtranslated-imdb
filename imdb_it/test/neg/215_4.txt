A new guard at an armored truck concert is recruited by his colleagues to steal 42 million from the truck. They're not bad, so nobody gets hurt, right? Of course things go wrong and the new guard decides to have a conscience and do things well by saving the life of a dying man. <br /> <br /> I admit I had no interest in this film, but I had no interest in Fantastic Mr Fox, and that movie made my top ten of the year. Armored is still more of a disappointment, then I thought it would be. As a robbery film, it fails to deliver the goods, it is boring and full of holes in the plot and leaps into logic that it will hurt you to think about it. <br /> <br /> Despite this the film somehow has a really big cast, but the film doesn't even use it to its advantage. Everyone seems wasted on wooden characters who make stupid choices. Columbus Short is an uninteresting protagonist who is never charismatic and never makes the public want to give a shit. Matt Dillon is the mind behind the robbery and at first he plays the good guy, then when things don't go as he quickly becomes the bad guy. The rest of the cast are Lawrence Fisburn, Jean Reno, Skeet Ulrich, Fred Ward, Amaury Nolasco of Prison Break and Milo Ventimiglia of Heros. None of them does much and when they actually do something, it is without much reasoning. <br /> <br /> The film is relatively short, but even with its running time of less than 90 minutes, it felt dragged out. How long can you make a movie about a boy trapped somewhere? Phonebooth did a decent job and was even more limited. The leaps of logic concerning the plot here are tragic. 42 million and all the security they have are check-in every hour or so? The whole plan from my understanding was to drive the trucks into an abandoned warehouse and hide the money. Pretend to be hit and burn the trucks. Then they would go away with the money. Certainly something goes wrong, or wouldn't there be the right movie? Through a series of unfortunate events, the so-called hero is trapped inside the truck with an injured officer. The rest of the film is Dillion and his crew knocking on doors to enter. What an emotion. <br /> <br /> The script requires our hero to have financial problems, he could lose his home, which makes him lose his brother. See, both their parents are dead and it's just the two of them looking at each other. So now he has a reason to join the robbery. At first he didn't want to go in, but his money problems are the right push to throw him into the midst of things. How convenient. <br /> <br /> The whole Armored tour of the heist genre is that it comes from an armored truck, from the guys who drive it. After this basic premise, the film falls on his face. I found myself wanting it to end before someone spoke. About the ending, it sucks. <br /> <br /> Jump.
