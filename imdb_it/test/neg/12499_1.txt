This film was really bad. It wasn't even funny at all. Not even the sarcastic scenes were funny. Oh man, bad, so bad. Thumb down. Spoofed, Karate Kid, Teen Wolf, Footloose, Dirty Dancing, Some Kind of Wonderful, Soul Man, and probably another or two. Chris Kattan at his worst as a high school janitor who is a talented dancer, who runs a dance studio in a warehouse. She has a jealous girlfriend who breaks her ankle and her dancing place goes to the beautiful new blonde that Chris has eyes for. I thought acting was really bad. I like to laugh loudly at comedies, this was not one. "Not Another Teen Movie" wasn't funny, but it had much more fun scenes than Totally Awesome. "Scary Movie" is super fun. I always laugh when I watch those, super fun. This movie is not funny.
