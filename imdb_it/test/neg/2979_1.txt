This looks like a feature film treatment of a comedy that could also have been told in a ten-minute short film. Furthermore, the technical credits are sup. Par. The film really looks like a film school diploma project. <br /> <br /> The cast is a mix of seasoned and talented novice stage professionals, but the problems are the superficial Scriptures. Their lines feel built, just like the material on the television series. <br /> <br /> The director does not take his protagonists seriously, so we are not affected by their problems and conflicts. <br /> <br /> The film has been cleverly marketed and offers a unique selling point, but in the end the film disappoints at all levels.
