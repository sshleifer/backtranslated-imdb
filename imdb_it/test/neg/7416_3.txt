Hi everyone, I just wanted to give you some crazy information about this movie. Actually, I was one of the Make-up FX artists who helped create the "beast" for this film and I must say that the original creature looked absolutely incredible. I remember that when we received the first photos from the set we were all talking about how shameful it was that this creature was in a film that would probably be rather poor. <br /> <br /> What happened Jason Palmer did the original Sasquatch trick, but for some reason they had to go back and pick up most of the creature. The sad part was that Jason died a few weeks earlier and so the rebuilt creature was not as impressive as the original one. <br /> <br /> For me it was pretty sad because this was the final of Jasons movies, and he was mocked by his final fame due to the bad shots. Anyway, I thought you might find it a bit interesting, and if you want you can go to mmmyeah.com and check out some "behind the scenes" photos. <br /> <br /> Next, Jeff
