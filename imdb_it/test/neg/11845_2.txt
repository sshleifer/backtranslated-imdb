The biggest and most puzzling things about the movie Raptor were ending for the Tyransaurus is identical to the Carnosaur, except that the kid in the magazine was a little better acted and the action then of the adult. The similarities with Carnosaur's films were rather scarce in the plot. The only thing that came close was the beginning with the children in the jeep. Then the plot went downhill from there. It would have been nice if a different storyline had been created, rather than cloning the previous films. The raptor film was supposed to take lessons from the Jurasic park series in various plots. The only film that has recently approached a good dinosaur film is Aztec Rex. The scenes repeated as if they were taken from the Carnosaur films leave a person thinking about those films.
