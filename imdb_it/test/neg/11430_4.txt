Irvine Welsh's sequel to Trainspotting comes on the screen as three stories set in Edinburgh, all featuring some of the Welsh brands, drug culture, depression, working class and football club in Hermania. Hard to see in places, it's no less than very well written, 2 of the stories have a darkly comic touch to them while the 2nd story is a serious (and incredibly realistic) storyline. I will not like it more, including myself to some extent, but I will no doubt adopt a cult following.
