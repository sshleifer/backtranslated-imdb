I can't believe I actually enjoyed the whole movie! It was absolutely horrible and absolutely worthy, yet I sat there thinking it had to improve. It wasn't like that, and I lost 2 hours of my life. Will Smith is so much better in action movies - I loved him in I, Robot, Enemy of the State and Independence Day - and I don't think you can really think of bringing a whole movie forward as a romantic lead in the way Cary Grant could. Then again, the script was unbearably horrible, and the dialogue was so trivial. <br /> <br /> I don't like everyone except the character of Albert, and even the one I found was done with a heavy hand. If you want to watch a modern romantic comedy to feel good, look at something like How to lose a boy in ten days, or when Harry met Sally. The 40-year-old Virgin left a smile on my face. I even preferred music and lyrics above that - and yes, I know it's poor, but at least it didn't take itself seriously and it was sweet. I also didn't like the main female lead and I wasn't convinced of the chemistry between her and Will Smith's character. <br /> <br /> In all, I think there were two scenes that I liked (and certainly not the ending, which was nauseating and unconvincing!) - Hitch calls Sarah when she didn't give him her number it was pretty sweet and - no, I'm sorry, that's the only thing I liked about the whole movie. Do not waste time.
