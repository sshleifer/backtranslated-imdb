Shakespeare would have been indignant. The writers have mutilated Shakespeare's incredible work. Ariel is the only credible acting. The African voodoo, the secluded swamp and the character of "Gator Man" make the film a mockery of Shakespeare's true Storm. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your eyes on this movie.
