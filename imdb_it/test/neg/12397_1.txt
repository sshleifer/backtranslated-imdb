After a meteorite lands in "Boston" (actually somewhere in the Isle of Man), a horrible alien monster with fangs is released and is on the loose in a local girl's school, causing chaos and turning students into zombie-like creatures. This film is apparently a remake (disappointing and loose) of the 1986 film of the same name, as it presents the same monster but a different storyline. Both films are terrible, but thanks to the 1986 version, it was watchable. This is not. Let's start with all the problems, acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad. This film is supposed to take place in Boston (we know this because the directors had the ingenious idea of ​​putting "Boston police" or "Boston gas company" on everything), but everyone seems to have rather confused British accents (at least they didn't try to use Boston accents, thank God). The script is a big flawed mess. The best example of how stupid writing is when it is established that you can turn zombie students into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of meteorite. Is this what our brave heroes do? No, they run around shooting the zombie students. Beautiful. Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote / directed the weak 1995 film "Grim", clearly doesn't know how to beat his films. The film is terribly boring in some places. The lighting is horrible. The film looks cheap and tasteless. One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of noticeable gore. 99% of the scenes of death involve the creature that emerges from a dark corner and drags someone away, while we hear screaming "horrified" in the distance. This convention has never worked well in the past, and it certainly doesn't work here. The visual effects were REAL. The CG opening sequence in space seemed to have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake! The explosion of gas tanks at the end was just as terrible. Ok, I like to consider myself a loyal critic, so I will give credit to those who deserve credit: the effects of the creatures were really fantastic. You must love those close-ups of slimy and drooling teeth! <br /> <br /> To sum up the film, "Breeders" is a terrible and cheap horror film that should be avoided like the Ebola virus. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10.
