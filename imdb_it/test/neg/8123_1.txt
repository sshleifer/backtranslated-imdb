I don't care if this show supposes to communicate deep messages about human existence. <br /> <br /> The show is a crap ... how can someone get pleasure from watching it? Yet he was received so well. This reflects a sad state of affairs for Joe Moron out there. <br /> <br /> I tried to watch this program when it first came out while friends were talking about it. The silly laugh between the two main characters and the painful dialogue made me want to cry. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that people can watch this show. Yet I imagine that the creators had the last laugh ... becoming rich by taking the pss from the same people who would watch a show like this. <br /> <br /> I would bet they are laughing all the way to the bank.
