I saw the original Italian film. It must be said that acting and interpretation are more heavily polluted by the tendency generated by TV to speak with a severely muted voice, not with mobile lips, tense tones, as emerged in "That is real life" -productions and "Let's-raise" - our audience-with-a-few-tears -screen-playwriting. The late Massimo Girotti dominates the other characters for intensity, clarity of expression and intellectual honesty.The film has some interesting ideas, but ( as in another comment before mine) lacks a focal point and dribbles in many intertwining of lesser and lesser importance, another trend dragged by television productions, well known to Italians. Some drops of style could be saved to the public, like the patisserie drag (charm and aesthetics of the kitchen as well as a sensual load of candies, see Chocolat, Babette's lunch, Vatel etc.). The hammam and fairies are definitely more truthful, it seems that Ozpetek has learned got Italian music in the early 2000s and is humming ... I'll give him one last chance ...
