I'm tormenting myself, but I can't think of another movie like The Valley of the Gwangi. A western with dinosaurs? What could be more natural? You must know why John Ford and / or John Wayne have never tried it! <br /> <br /> The plot ?? While searching for a mythical miniature horse for his circus, TJ Breckenridge (Gila Golan), Tuck Kirby (James Franciscus) and the rest of the cast / characters enter a strange and lost valley. There they find not only the miniature horse, but also some other scarier creatures. Dinosaurs dominate this place. Now wouldn't that be an attraction to TJ's circus ?? a caged T-Rex? <br /> <br /> It's not like I find The Valley of the Gwangi a bad movie, I just didn't like it as much as many others who posted comments on the film. There are some parts that I actually find almost unsightly. For the first half of the movie, it looks like it's not happening much. I wasn't necessarily bored, but I wanted something to happen. Plodding would be an adjective I would like to use. Finally, the film presents a very invented love story. We feel obliged as if the writers decided that the male and female protagonists simply had to come together. But The Valley of the Gwangi is not a total waste. There are moments that I really appreciated. Who does not get a kick out of the scene of cowboys on horseback trying to lasso a T-Rex. You don't see things like that every day. Ray Harryhausen's creatures are impressive. There are some really interesting shots of Harryhausen miniatures that interact with people and horses. It may not represent the best of his work, but the effects are very beautiful. However, at least in my mind these good times are not enough to overcome the negatives. As much as I hate doing it, I have to evaluate the Valley of the Gwangi at 4/10.
