One of the worst movies I've ever seen. When I was trying to watch this I got the flu and was quite open to any mindless entertainment. Unfortunately this was too much. How, so many totally unedited actors can be in a movie? This film makes porn look like a European art film. The cast simply speaks their lines without emotion; Special thanks to Charlie Snows (Baldwin), the future ex-wife, who talks about her divorce like the rest of us talking about the weather. Simply awful (and fun). <br /> <br /> With lots of alcohol and friends this could be just a background entertainment and a few laughs, just like Ed Wood's movies. The plot is a joke and a soundtrack from a shameless soap opera. <br /> <br /> We hope nobody paid to see this movie. <br /> <br />
