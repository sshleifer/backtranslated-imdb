I must admit, as I am ashamed, that as an impressionable young teenager this cold-under-horror was one of my favorite movies of all time. Nine years after seeing Stephen King's scary story for the first time, however, I came back to myself and was able to evaluate Fritz Kiersch's work in a more reasonable way. <br /> <br /> In fact, the story of King of a small Nebrosian farming community that is turned upside down by a young demonic preacher boy and his sadistic companion is really disturbing on paper, but it's a medium and cheap horror show on celluloid. Much of this result can be attributed to the fact that Kiersch almost becomes the beginning of the film to become a hacker-slasher show, and thus transforms the ending into a nightmare of hocus-pocus special effects. <br /> <br /> The cast is reasonable, but they can only represent the credibility of this rather incredible, the most beautiful film will allow it, and the soundtrack of Jonathan Elias is more spooky than the images. <br /> <br /> A pity that George Goldsmith's screenplay turned Stephen King's haunting story into a shocking horror. Isaac, Malachai and all the other "Children of the Corn" are not so scary. <br /> <br /> Sunday, 7 August 1994 - Video
