This game is a good-looking first-person shooter. ----------- Wait ...... <br /> <br /> But obviously a story needs to be put around this genre, so a fairly innovative story about the soldiers now driven by drugs for save the world and kill the terrorist, Nectar is the drug of choice that creates a super soldier. <br /> <br /> Fantastic, now we give ourselves some fun and addictive missions, we launch some great new weapons and off-road vehicles that can be driven at will and I'll be pretty satisfied. <br /> <br /> NO !!!! <br /> <br /> The creators of this game decide to create a propaganda game, led by the army, which seeks to make sense of our fears of terrorism and embrace democracy. The game has twisted ideals that only reinforce the morals we learned when we were in elementary school, nothing new is said to us, but "Drugs are bad ... mmmkay". Then he pushed into a type of .... Yvan eht Nnnioooojjjjj! (join the navy) of how to defend yourself from the common good, given the rants about normality and abnormality, right and wrong ... GOOOOOOOOOOD WE GET IT! LET's KILL SOMETHING !!!! <br /> <br /> NO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> You can't, You have to endure extremely long gaps in completing BULLSH goals! T as "Run by helicopter" ....... "Go to the troop group" ... ... Then once this is completed ......... CINEMATIC takes control .... ..... You are sitting there for at least half the game looking at the small scenario played by the characters, you are you CANNOT jump, but sit and wait, sometimes when people don't even talk, we sit down and wait for the landing of a helicopter! <br /> <br /> Bad game, from a ridiculous group of programmers! Don't worry about making another one because I will prefer to see the movie!
