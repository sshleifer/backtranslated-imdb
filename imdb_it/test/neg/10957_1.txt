Unreal !!!!!!!! After reading the initial reviews posted by the alleged reviewers, I was shocked to find that almost all the initial reviews, 38, voted this film at 10. Compared to other great films, these reviewers felt that Quick and the Undead is a better film than, The 6th Sense (8.2), Save Private Ryan (8.4), The Lord of the Rings (8.7), Godfather (9.5), Gladiator (8.1) and Dawn of the Dead (7.8) to name a few. We hope these swarms will use their next discounted Lasik procedure, which they hear about, because it's completely obvious that these reviews have been falsified. <br /> <br /> I was led to believe that this movie presented a unique concept in the genre of Zombie movie production. Sadly looking at the Rapid and the Undead, it is obvious that these reviews have been generated by people who have been involved in the production, or who have a vested interest in the film's commercial / financial success. In my mind nothing bothers me more than hearing that a part of this film was shot in Texas, they were, by chance, the first posts that praise the film. The film culture of Zombie / Horror B as a whole is a forgiving group, but this film is sadly beyond redemption. The characters are recycled and the plot is poor. The quality of the film was not so bad as to be labeled as a video camera, and at least they used a cinema-quality camera. The acting is horrible, the star who tries unsuccessfully to go out as Clint Eastwood wants to be a clone. Christ on a bike !!!!!! Even the name of the main protagonist is Clint. It was simply terrible. The only similarity with Clint Eastwood is that the protagonist is using "wood" from the name of Eastwood in his acting style. The Zombie trick was above the quality of the Halloween party, but not completely applied to the cast members of all the undead. The number of zombies was not offset by their hands. The plot was so resounding that I was hoping for a power outage, a defect on the DVD disc, or that the zombies would have turned their attention to the director. Perhaps the film has value for some viewers, but not for my hard-earned dollar. Fortunately I used my free rental coupon to check this DVD. Perhaps this film will be saved by Nott's entertainment (rightly called) that will publish a special DVD for collectors, which will bind the defects and deliver the promised goods ??? Some like, I think NOTT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!! We only hope that their next release, The Flesh Keeper is really a "keeper" of a movie .. and not a recycled 5th generation version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The fingers have crossed people here ... but only if you care.
