This presents an interesting way to manage a camera, <br /> <br /> especially for a DTV movie - the version I saw was full screen <br /> <br /> - but it is not up to the scenario department. First of all get about 20 million speeches, talk, talk seductively, post- "Trainspotting", so it's a city by city. And then comes <br /> <br /> the most dishonest dishonest ending I've seen, much worse than <br /> "<br />" April 1st "- where at least it made sense. So, all in <br /> <br /> everything, it's the old song and dance: the interesting director looks for <br /> <br /> tough, but deserves a better movie. Funny: are usually the actors who desperately need something better ?? Skip anyway, for your time
