The basic genre is a thriller that links to an uncomfortable menage-a-trois. Fellowes tried to get a lot more out of this, using the lies of the title to make all sorts of little twists, invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the public. <br /> <br /> It's really pretty messy anyway. Fellowes doesn't seem interested in presenting the elements of the thriller in a way that will keep us segregated. Rather, his attention is paid to the same moral situations. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is inconsistent, theatrical here, vulgar there and with the constant surprise of realism canceled by the occasional terrestrial clich√©-mine. Although there is no shaking on the positions so that the actors can get along with the existing ones in their space, the terrible score cannot create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of certain pieces. There is also a very prosaic aspect, I would dare to say that it is English for filming. I didn't want to see a document of two successful middle-class people captured in an extraordinary situation, I wanted to see a kind of artistic story in history. <br /> <br /> It is finally, in fact, the story that makes you rest Just as the suspense elements are rather flat, so the story is an asymmetric sum of sub-frames of different shapes and sizes, woven as a vehicle for the examination of character. Wilkinson and Watson support this meta-essay with good performances and John Warnaby's exuberant colleague Simon at Wilkinson is a welcome gift to much of the forehead. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed; not that it's bad, but that it could have been much better. 3/10
