OK, to begin with, this film was not like the book at all. I read the book when I was 13 and it has always been my favorite ever since. When I wait for a different book to go out, this is the book I turn to to fill the time. I have 3 copies for god sake. anyway, I knew it wouldn't be anything like the book, but come on! They could have done a little better than this. I mean seriously if you wanted to see the American werewolf in Paris or London than I would watch those movies. They took a perfectly good story and turned it into a copy of a story that was told over and over and frankly I'm tired of watching it. I mean hi the best part of all the f ***** g (sorry) the story is that she ends up with Gabriel. He doesn't die. What was it? And he's old in this movie. Gabriel should only be 24 not 44 by ** it. Awww. And Astrid to the one who has it ** came to mind that Astrid is Vivian's aunt no no no no. Astrid and Vivian hate each other. Awwww. Anyway yes, that was my little joke seriously worse. I hope this helped.
