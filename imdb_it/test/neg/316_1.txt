Warning It may contain spoilers <br /> <br /> I only spent $ 5 on this movie on Amazon and I wish I had never spent it. I've never seen suck up horrible special effects or acting. I mean, Jack-0 is just a laughable monster and his costume looks like something you could buy at a Halloween store or make yourself. The acting is simply horrible, especially Sean Kelly, I mean he is so pathetic with his jokes "Let me take the PUmpkinman" low, I laughed so much so it's just stupid. I mean the film is so terrible that they had to put a few minutes of nudity in it just for the people who didn't interrupt it. I think the most laughable scene is when the woman sticks a butter knife in the toaster and is electrocuted. I mean, it looks so fake and the mannequin I could buy at any Halloween store or do it myself. Well, I recommend you not watch this poor movie because it will be the time you will never come back.
