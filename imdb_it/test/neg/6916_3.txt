(Some spoilers) Rapid PRC that has J. Carrol Naish who plays Dr. Igor Markoff who is actually not Dr. Karkoff but an impostor who has assumed his identity in Europe. <br /> <br /> The real Dr. Karkoff had a relationship with Dr. Markoff's wife that led him to kill the real Dr. Markoff and then to his wife Lenore infected with acromegaly that made her look like "l "elephant man" "sister. This was done so that no one would ever want to look at her and could keep Lenore all to herself; but the disturbed Lenore later even killed herself with her mad husband. <br /> <br / > This crazy, fake Dr. Markoff, then sees Patricia Lawrence, Wanda McKay, one night at the theater where her father Tony Lawernce, Ralph Morgan, a world-renowned pianist is giving a concert. Enchanted by the beautiful Patricia who died for the his late wife Lenore, Dr. Markoff becomes obsessed with her and does everything to marry her even if he wants nothing to do with him. <br /> <br /> After taking ridicule in his efforts to convince Patricia to fall in love of him, sending his flowers with notes of love in syrup attached up to five times a day, Tony goes to see the mad Dr. Mankoff to tell him to stop boring his daughter. That's when Tony ends up being knocked out by the good doctor who injected him with a dose of acromegaly that turns him into a slightly unpleasant individual. With his hands and body swelling and not being able to play his beloved piano Tony is told by his Dr. Dr. Adams, Sam Flint, that the only one who can cure him from that terrible disease is none other than Dr . Markoff! the person who gave it to him. <br /> <br /> The film has the usual sub-plots with the assistant of dr. Markoff, Maxine, Tala Birell, who is also in love with him, jealous of the fake doctor who makes a comedy for Patricia. There is also Dr Markoff's backbreaking butler, Glenn Strange, who, like his domestic gorilla, is just a big, clumsy idiot who can't even suppress Maxine, which is less than half the size. Strange ends up being tossed around and knocked out by Patricia's boyfriend, Bobby Blake, Terry Frost. As for the gorilla, it turns out to be a large hairy bump when he also tries to do to Maxine and is thrown out, and locks himself in his cage, from the dog Ace. Dr. Markoff, in his desperation to convince Patricia to marry him, promises to treat his father only to have his father escape from his chains and in the ensuing fight with him ended up shooting Markoff dead with his own gun. <br /> <br /> There is a happy ending to all this mess with Maxine, who knew so much about Markoff's care for the acromegaly he made, injecting Tony with a secret serum that made him as good as new . The film ends, as it began, with Tony playing the piano in a house full of applause at the local theater.
