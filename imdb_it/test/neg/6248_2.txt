I go to the blockbuster movie, I choose a movie at random, I understand, and yes. <br /> <br /> This ... was a good sexual porn ... the kind of sucked quality, and it gave me a damn headache. For me, this film was good for his sexual stuff, but not so much for horror and suspense. It was ... magical ... <br /> <br /> The suspense .. is not as good as I expected. I wanted to stay on the edge of my seat hoping to jump out of fear, but instead I lay down on the couch and didn't see much. <br /> <br /> The quality .. not really good. I mean, if you pay a lot of attention, during the time when people are in the COLD mountains, they hardly wear anything. It doesn't make much sense either. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for a shit, not exactly suspense, and a nice sex movie, you have this.
