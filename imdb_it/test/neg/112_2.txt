Now, I love Italian horror movies. The cheesiers are the better. However, this is not Italian cheese. This is the one-week spaghetti sauce with rotten meatballs. It's an amateur hour at every level. There is no suspense, no horror, with only a few drops of blood scattered to remind you that you are watching a horror movie. The "special effects" are to change the lights to red whenever the ghost (or whatever it is) is around, and a string that pulls the sheets up and down. Oooh, can you feel the chills? The quality of the DVD is that of a VHS transfer (which actually helps the movie rather than damage it). The dubbing is even below the lowest standard of the "bad Italian movie" and I gave it a star just because the dialogue is so hilarious! And what we find when it finally FINISHES to look in the attic (in a scene that is a day in the day and the night after) ... well, I won't ruin it for anyone who really wants to see, but let's just say it's not very "new"!
