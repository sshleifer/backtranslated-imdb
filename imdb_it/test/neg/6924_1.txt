Owen (David Krumholtz) and Chloe (Denise Richards) are a young couple living in Manhattan. Owen is a fairly successful magazine writer while Chloe is an aspiring actress. Fortunately for her, Chloe gets a big role in a sitcom and temporarily moves to Hollywood. Missing her, Owen books a flight to LaLa Land, as a surprise. When he arrives at his trailer set, however, the "house" is shaking, while Chloe and her hunky co-star are making a little romantic attempt. The writer and the actress have passed. Fierce and mad as a hatter, Owen returns to New York. Friendly friends decide to put him on a blind date with Nadine (Milla Jovovich) to get him out of his sulky funky. But it goes wrong, as the duo mixes like oil and water, especially since everyone has a strong personality and Owen's huge chip. Yet, in the coming months, surprisingly, Nadine and Owen become friends, who confide in each other and meet. Can it turn into something more? Well, who the hell cares! This film is so STUPID that most people will pull it out of the DVD player after the first ten minutes. The script is pathetic, sad and, oh, even stupid. Then again, Krumholtz gives a very hateful and offensive performance. Jovovich is not much better but who could look good with the lines he has to throw? Even William Baldwin achieves a low career with his rough and crazy sex role as Owen's brother. The only member of the cast that is good is Richards, but she must shudder when she looks at it. Ok, the costumes and production values ​​are adequate. Furthermore, there is A clever element in that, occasionally, the characters will pronounce their lines but the cartoons will appear over their heads with the words of what they are really thinking. This does not save the film from the "bomb" status. Don't be stupid, dear movies and Roma lovers. Don't rent, buy or borrow this giant turkey. I am the dumbest person on earth today to look at this THING until the bitter end.
