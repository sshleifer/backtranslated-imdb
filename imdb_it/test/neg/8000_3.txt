Enter the Ninja (1981) was the first of several "Ninja" films produced by Cannon starring or co-starring in the Japanese sensation Sho Kosugi. But the protagonist of the first movie "Ninja" was the legendary guy Franco Nero. Unfortunately not even Mr. Nero or Sho Kosugi could make this film watchable. When you have two bad guys in an action movie and it's neither watchable nor funny, something's wrong. But I digress. Skip this chapter and watch upcoming films in the series. They are more interesting and very funny. <br /> <br /> Next is Revenge of the Ninja. Instead of playing the "eastern evil" (I use that term tongue in cheek you mind). He is the star! Strange for a western movie. Look at that instead. <br /> <br /> Not recommended except for tough Sho Kosugi fans or Cannon movie fans.
