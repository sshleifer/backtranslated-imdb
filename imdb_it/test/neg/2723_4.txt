This may have been a good TV movie, but flashbacks don't make it easier to understand the movie. Since they give the viewer information during the journey (the film proceeds) I found myself wondering why he never said or mentioned it at the beginning. So the entire route probably wouldn't have been necessary. <br /> <br /> When the movie ends, you understand why he shot and, of course, he is not guilty. Too bad the producer / director used flashbacks this way, but on the other the film wouldn't have been worth it. <br /> <br /> Nice movie for a rainy day, lots of chips to kill in the evening.
