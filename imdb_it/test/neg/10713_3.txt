For three quarters of an hour, the story gradually develops towards a crucial point of some kind. Although it is overloaded with scenes that seem to be designed to blur the viewer and draw him away from the plot, there is something happening. It is not much and certainly not obvious. The combination of palace impressions and story-guiding scenes adds no depth or insight to the entire cast of characters. In fact, they keep them sterile because there is no development of character. Everyone keeps turning and focusing on their cliché and role - the pretty, kind and stubborn girl; the überwoman fighter, the snobbish aristocrat. The male protagonist does not seem to have any distinction, it is a superficial presence, which, in reality, does not even matter because it is there only because the storyboard required it - he seemed to be on vacation and captured on. When the time comes to turn the corner in terms of what is happening, the film shoots completely empty for a couple of minutes and then becomes ridiculous. It solves - or rather it dissolves - with Deus Ex Machina of a book, more clichés and some of the crudest devices and plot choices I've ever seen. It's history, all right. First the film is a drama even though it should be a comedy, and then it turns into a farce. The protagonists do what they have to do and there are no surprises. The first group of somewhat serious antagonists, however, is replaced by a couple who literally got bored. Perhaps it was a kind of nod to the public. <br /> <br /> This film does not receive any bonuses from me for the underlying philosophical meaning (as there is none) nor for its technical realization. The animation and editing are correct and also the sound mixing; but it is by no means exceptional or even higher than the average Japanese production of the late 1980s. Indeed, visual tricks seem static, uninspired and not original. <br /> <br /> Worst of all - it absolutely fails to entertain, even if you don't care about the characters and all these things. There is too little to do here, and the rest is quite trivial. Take a real Ghibli instead, have a feast and keep your fingers away from it.
