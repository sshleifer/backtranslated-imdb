To be honest, I've never been to the Congo or even to Africa, and after seeing the TV movie Heart of Darkness, I don't think I would. The film completely spoils the book to the highest possible level. Although the book was not the best I read, after seeing the film, I seemed to appreciate the book a hundred times more. Nicolas Roeg, the director of the film, did a horrible job playing the Joseph Conrad novel in a film. I give Roeg some credit for trying the impossible, turning the book into a movie, but this may not have been the job for him. The film failed to express any part of the story beyond the basics of the plot. The set and the setting also lacked the beauty that Conrad portrayed in Africa in the book. In the book Marlow had seen so many great wonders, but in the film you didn't have the same experience. No, I'm not blaming the whole director; the acting in the film was simply terrible. All the actors were boring and uninteresting. Throughout the film, I felt as if the actors had not aroused emotions, as if they were reading the script all the time. Tim Roth, who plays Marlow, did not interpret Marlow's sense of adventure for his journey to Congo well. Marlow's journey to find Kurtz should have ventured, but I didn't see it in the movie. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie, especially if you've already read the book. He does not come close to doing justice for the novel by Joseph Conrad. Conrad's words capture the reader and take them on a trip with Marlow, in search of Mr. Kurtz, where the film is not. A great novel, but a very poor film. Heart of Darkness, the film, is based on the book written by Joseph Conrad also called Heart of Darkness.
