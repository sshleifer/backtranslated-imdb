This movie starts on the wrong foot and never really does. The first scene shows a helicopter landing of the emergency flight and just outside the window you can distinctly see the mountains in the background. For those of you who may never have been to Houston there are no quota changes. The city is located just above sea level and a 5 foot slope is considered a large hill. To get on with that scenario, any shot outside the hospital immediately tells the viewer that I'm not in Houston. The trees are all missing leaves or are pine trees, none of which Houston has much of. Even the hospital itself, on the outside, is truly incredible. The Memorial Hermann Hospital is one of the best hospitals in the United States and sits in the middle of the medical district a few miles from downtown Houston, yet every external blow to the hospital makes it appear that the hospital is in the suburbs or even the countryside. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that anyone responsible for the part of the tropical storm of the film has been discarded because the numerous radar shots are all wrong. The first radar image of the film is that of Hurrican Hugo hitting South Carolina. We see later Kris Kristofferson leaving his job and one of his assistants tells him that Alison is returning south through Houston, but the radar image showing clearly shows Alison moving north from the Gulf of Mexico to Houston ... probably the initial Alison landing. <br /> <br /> As for acting, it's not so bad. JoBeth Williams, Kris Kristofferson and Rick Schroder all do a decent job, considering it is a TV movie. The plot's texture is decent and the fact that it's based on a true story makes it a little more fun. My only problem with acting is the representation of the Houstonians with large southern accents ... the actors all seem to be from Birmingham, Alabama and not Houston, Texas. <br /> <br /> The film has its point of view and to the general public does exactly what it is intended to: entertain. If you are looking for a factual account of what happened to the city of Houston in June 2001, you will be disappointed. One thing to keep in mind before seeing this film is that it is based exclusively on the evacuation of the Memorial Hermann Hospital and not on Tropical Storm Alison and the impact on the Houston subway itself. If you're looking for a factual account of the impact of Tropical Storm Alison on the Houston subway, I suggest you look at The Storm's Storm Stories for Tropical Storm Alison. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on *****
