With Pep Squad receiving an average of 4.7 on IMDb.com, it's no wonder that Steve Balderson slanders this site. But the fact is that the Pep Squad is a badly processed "black" comedy (both words in quotation marks for a reason). It's a film full of over-acting (Cherry, Beth's Mother), accompanied by a couple of lethargic shows (Beth and Julie's boyfriend). A movie where you can follow cars from a distance of twenty feet in a flashy red Jeep and never be noticed. A film full of shots and shots of nudity not so appetizing that make you think: "Does the director think it's funny? Or smart?" Above all, the characters are so thin and not very developed that the film becomes rather unpredictable, but probably not on purpose. Pep Squad can't decide whether to be a comedy, or a drama, or a satire (patriotic music, I understand ...). The film fails to be serious, because the idea of ​​killing for any school position (this is the Prom Queen) crosses the line to the point of madness (not to mention blows of bangs and car shootings, a poor attempt to be controversial and edgy), and fails to be a comedy, for all the forced and embarrassed jokes (big butt mama, "funky" black principal, and excessive imprecation delivered badly by the main cast). Watching the documentary "Wamego: Making Movies Anywhere" made this film even more deserving, with praise praised by the director and the director's father ... hmmmmmm. Not a black comedy, or anything like that. I imagine Kansas will have to wait.
