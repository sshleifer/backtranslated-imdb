(very serious spoilers) <br /> <br /> this film was a huge disappointment. there are so many problems that I don't know where to start. therefore, I will talk about what is beautiful about the film. <br /> <br /> The cast was great. Steve Martin offers a really fun performance of a middle-aged, upper-class and tired white guy. queen latifah plays a big, beautiful, urban, black girl. and eugene levy, well he practically plays himself. add betty white and smart jean and you have a fantastic cast - everyone played their parts really well. and if watching these guys for 1.75 hours is worth 8 dollars for you, then you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> but the film makes a lot of serious mistakes. first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone. all whites are bigoted theses. all black people are ghetto ebonici speakers. blacks are fashionable, cool, con-it and poor. whites are nerds, stiff and rich. (except eugene withdrawal, he is clearly caught with the latifa queen and "speaks the jargon" - so latifa calls him a "monster". So - if you are a white man and you like black women and you know street slang you must be a monster). the film is littered with racist insults against members of the black cast and in return the whites are portrayed as idiots and boobs. <br /> <br /> put aside the playing card, let us see the main flaw of the film: destroy the latifa character. he comes to Martin's house with a false pretense, but Martin likes her anyway. she should be wrongly accused of robbery, Martin takes her case. At 3/4 of the film we discover that the latifa character escaped from prison. therefore, our sympathy for her leaves the window. <br /> <br /> there is no real storyline. the film trudges from stage to stage with latifa appearing in a place where she "should" not be (like a country club or martin's house) and martin trying to hide it. this is the running gag. then in the last minutes of the film they decide that in the end they will deal with the latifa affirmation that was wrongly accused of bank robbery. martin goes undercover like a boy at home to extract a (confessed, unusable) confession from his latifa boyfriend, and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> finally (but there is much more wrong with this film) this film seems to be a web of clips from other films. the premise is clearly borrowed from another martin "the house-sitter" movie. where Goldie Hull comes to live with Martin and shakes his heavy bourgeois life. martin and latifa meet online - "you have mail" wing. the whole "bizarre nanny fixes the life of a rich man" goes back to the "sound of music" and "mary poppins". <br /> <br /> I would not see this movie again for free.
