Stay away from this movie. The fact that you're reading reviews tells me that you may have already been tainted by the terrible charisma. This is a really horrible movie ... so let's move on to the problems. Writing and directing: I wouldn't be surprised if these were run by a group of children of childbearing age who observed "howling" and "I know what you did last summer" a little too many times. Holes abound in the GIANT plot; While I can't congratulate them on this movie, it's nice to know that they were eventually potty trained. Actors (or lack thereof): Only the best for this film ... the best extras that never grace a screen, now the protagonists of their debut in the title role! As a disclaimer, I must note that I am able to watch and enjoy anything. I recognize a good movie when I see it, but I can still laugh and smile during Bubble Boy (yes folks, it's true); so when I say avoid something, you know I'm not kidding.
