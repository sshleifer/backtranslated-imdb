I got this movie for fifty cents on an outgoing sale. I want my fifty cents back. Bad acting, mediocre script, bad direction, historically inaccurate, even the sound of the film is horrible. It is not the subject that offends. I am one of many to find very interesting suspense films and real crime films. The topic could have been treated more seriously, with much more attention to detail and accuracy, and the lack of respect shown to the victims and their devastated friends and family is enough to question anyone. Furthermore, there is little or no attention to what could have caused anyone to start the bizarre behavior that Ed Gein exhibited in reciting these horrible crimes. <br /> <br /> Save time and health. Don't watch this horrible movie. If you bought it, you have my sympathy. It's not a total waste though ... you can throw the disc away and use the plastic case!
