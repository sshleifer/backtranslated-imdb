It is painfully clear that every effort in this film has been directed towards cinematography and very little attention to everything else. The most obvious mistake is the mixture of the entire female cast. Many of them are very experienced and capable, but they all seemed out of place, and having an amateur director certainly didn't help. The story is a very common geisha story, and the characters behaved very inconsistently, making it extremely difficult for me to connect with heroin. <br /> <br /> The theme of this film is "modern prostitution", but, anyway, it was annoying how the protagonist of Tsuchiya Anna continued to talk like a member of a gang of motorcyclists while all the others spoke in Japanese . This film has very beautiful vibrant colors, similar to "Hero" by Zhang Yimou, but viewers can easily say that it is shot in an elaborate and cheap set. <br /> <br /> The two sequences with the songs of the Shiina Ringo insert were really beautiful, in the mid section of the film. Actually I didn't like his music, but they adapted perfectly to this film. Although Ninagawa Mika is a complete failure as a director, he has an important potential in the production of PV (music video). I think the story was very clear because the director didn't focus on character development, and because Tsuchiya Anna's unconvincing interpretation as an Oiran. If this film had been directed by a well-known Jidaigeki director with any other actress known in Japan, he would have had the potential to become a masterpiece.
