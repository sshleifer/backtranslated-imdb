I was very worried about this movie, it was programmed to play at a Jewish Film Festival, and it was reported to be very hostile to Israel, using intelligent humor and irony. <br /> <br /> I was relieved that the film was not a diatribe, but as a film it was deeply disappointing. The film was full of random events, some of which eventually connected, many of which are not. Some of the events were very intelligent and fun, but some were simply random and useless. <br /> <br /> There are repeated scenes between two lovers sitting in a car, speechless, and playing some game with their hands. Perhaps in some cultures this is erotic, but it's like watching wrestling. After the third time, it has become really boring. <br /> <br /> I have always found David Lynch as bizarre for free, using strange stories and images to induce the public to think that it is SO sophisticated that it does not capture his work; in fact, there is nothing to understand. The same is true here, the stories do not add up to anything, and there is not much of a political point being made (in a scene a noisy Israeli soldier humiliates Palestinian drivers at a checkpoint.) "It's a novelty ?) <br /> <br /> I don't understand why this film has caused controversy, or why it has attracted attention, it's a minor job and seeing was a waste of time.
