The first thing I notice is music. It is not surprising how the disturbing theme of Cannibal Holocaust by Ruggero Deodato or the waltz of the A Tale of Two Sisters masterpiece, but I do not allow myself to stop so early in the film. <br /> <br /> It must be assumed that the woman who researches her hypothesis for her doctoral thesis that cannibalism as an organized practice has never existed, one might think that they should take into consideration that they are wrong and prepare themselves for the trip accordingly right? Or why go at all if you already believe the hypothesis is true before being tested? This is quite incredibly ignorant and makes the film seem much more unrealistic and poorly written. <br /> <br /> This is actually similar to the film by Ruggero Deodato, only totally ill-prepared. No guns, no decent trekking clothes, just nonsense. <br /> <br /> People don't travel like this to a college with no months of planning and preparation. <br /> <br /> But I ramble ... <br /> <br /> Things are not going very well for our brave and stupid adventurers as they walk away to escape a jaywalking iguana, and their ferret of pet falls out of the truck almost is collapsing, so falling into a mud hole, well I guess it's time to walk. <br /> <br /> Okay then throw a coin to see if they continue or forget it all. How does that scene make sense? Their whole belief is based on a coin toss? Then they must have spent time and money, and the preparation has just come out. This continues to get worse. Definitely some of the worst acting and screenplay and music ever invented for the film industry. <br /> <br /> Mike talks about how he and his friend were caught by cannibals and put in cages in mud pits with 3 inch long leeches sucking their blood. I found it interesting because if you remember the first cannibal they meet in the jungle, a man who mistaken for a simple native is sitting on the ground eating leeches ... I wonder if they are the same? Really this film is simply terrible because the script is horrible and the acting is emotionless considering the content. They simply accept to let go rather than get caught up in the cannibals as if it were not an important decision. <br /> <br /> Obviously Mike is crazy, but just as in the first film they treat the natives with such terrible behavior that it's simply unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The film by Ruggero Deodato easily feels that the Americans have achieved what they deserved, while in this film you can hardly blame the natives for what strikes Americans again. <br /> <br /> And for this reason the film seems somewhat useless. We've already got the point from the first movie, so why was the sequel made? Is the lieutenant called Rizzo?! Could it be worse? Often with films like these when you watch the cast you find that they haven't starred in many other films and their bios are almost non-existent, so you can imagine that I was surprised to find Giovanni Lombardo Radice in this film that was in Scorsese's Gangs of New York. Lieutenant Rizzo looked familiar and I discovered that in the 2002 film Spiderman was a very small role as captain of tugs. It reminds me of how William Shatner went from being the USS Enterprise admiral to a car cop. Irony, sometimes the irony works. Shatner has never managed to get the music until his recent album "Has Been" which is really good, just like Bono from U2 has never been able to cut his hair to the right, and Dan Marino has never been able to win any Superbowl. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the irony is just sad, like Christopher Reeve, Superman can't walk on irony. Man will always be a legend, even though he was a great boy, but I still enjoy myself. <br /> <br /> At this point you can say that I'm even bored enough to discuss Cannibal Ferox. <Br /> <br /> The Cannibal Holocaust message spoke of who the real savages are and what is really evil? What do savages do in natural life unknown to our moral records, or what do we do to others with malicious intentions? The message of Cannibal Ferox seems to be: "Be careful what you are looking for, because you could find it". I'll say it for Cannibal Ferox. When Gloria returns and writes her thesis, stating that cannibalism does NOT exist, it saves others who would be curious and go where angels fear to beat, but overall this film was really ugly. <br /> <br /> *** / 10
