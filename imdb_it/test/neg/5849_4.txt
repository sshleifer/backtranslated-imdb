This film received an excellent review in Blockbusters' "next attraction" "I couldn't wait for the release date to be announced, 07/08/02. The plot seems reasonable, the cast alone should have guaranteed a side splitter , but whoa there; aside from the "off the wall wagering events" this was pretty boring. <br /> <br /> This will never become a comedy classic, and I'm afraid it didn't help John's good comedic reputation Cleese, Rowan Atkinson, was now quite funny, in a sort of Rowan Atkinson!
