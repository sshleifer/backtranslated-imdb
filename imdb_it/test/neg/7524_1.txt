Worse. Movie. Never. I can't believe they had to hire Jeremy Irons to lend credibility to this piece of shit - and they still haven't succeeded. Did they think that if they kept to the plot of the book, their target audience wouldn't be able to figure it out for themselves? (probably). "Hey, let's blow up a lot of things and give Mina big tits, and we'll have them speak in a adorably false and broken English, which will make the morons look." "But sir, that's not how the book went, I think we're all true to Mr. Wells's message." "Fuck it, let's go to the box office here, no matter the ideas of a dead author on human nature. Let's also add Orlando Jones with a classic black attitude as a supporting character, and no matter the interesting conclusion of the book - Guy Pierce must get a bit at the end. "
