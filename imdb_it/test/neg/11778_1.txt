I like JAG type. It has its charm but lately there is a lot of propaganda in it. For a stranger (a non-American) the patriotic feeling can be a little too much. <br /> <br /> I don't like that Rabb and MacKenzie go from being lawyers (as they were in the early parts of TV show) to becoming super heroes that stops wars and saves entire continents. It's almost like watching a US Army recruitment video. <br /> <br /> I still watch the show, so it's not so bad. But I would prefer more episodes when Rabb and MacKenzie investigate military incidents and do not save the world in the future.
