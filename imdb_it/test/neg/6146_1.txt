Besides the fact that Skylar is a complete douche bag and its disadvantages are unimaginative, its patterns require a lot of preparation to make any of its scams worthwhile. Without giving away spoilers (as if it were important with this piece of shit) his cons are so fake because it takes the effort of days and days of planning, and the use of more accomplices and a whole crew of cameras, etc. Only to trick someone into a service that would cost less than a hundred dollars ..... moreover if you read in the credits they reproduce some of the phone calls etc. because they don't go on the air ... The whole concept of this show is bunk because all its cons have the cost both of the crew and of the effort of ten times the actual cost of the service that is trying to get for free ... what's the problem?
