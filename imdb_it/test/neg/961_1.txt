Great story and great main actors (Quaid and Ryan), but the film suffers from bad direction, bad screenplay and bad script. The main actors do their part but fail to save the film at all. Too bad because this could have been a good 80 Hitchcock suspense / mystery / thriller style. Ryan looked so young and fresh in this one though. Okay, look for the big Ryan fans ...
