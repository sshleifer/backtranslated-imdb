the only reason i bought this dvd is because there is cinthrothrothrock.ora everybody knows that she is the queen of martial arts b film.The problem is that this is not a martial arts movie. cynthia rothrock has about a minute of fight scenes in this stupid movie. Now if you were a director and you had the dog fence in your movie, wouldn't you like to have a lot of martial arts action? all he does in this movie is getting around as bored as I was when I saw this pile of crap.I own many of his movies and they are all b movies but at least they had some beautiful scenes in them. I'm a martial arts fan, I avoid this, no matter what. I'm still angry I wasted 4 dollars to buy this DVD
