Thank God I took a step forward. I think this is a movie about a guy who goes up and down. Whatever: it's a stupid clich√©. It makes no difference. There's this guy, Javier Bardem, who builds buildings or something. It does not matter. This Javier Bardem is beautiful. Who cares? I think there's a car accident, but I saw this fast forward, so ... who cares? The car wrecks and the beautiful heroes who struggle to come back from them smell like a melodrama for me. Javier likes someone, but instead marries Maria de Madeiros. It is beautifully, poetically beautiful, with a heart-shaped face. Then Javier has an oral interface with Maribel Verdu, who washes his vulva, in advance, for some reason. You'd think Maribel Verdu, with her hand-washed vulva, would be sexy. No she is not. This is a boring story about a group of people who don't interest me. Javier, Maribel and Maria have a three-way relationship: how boring. This film is annoying. I think this could be a minor TEMA of (some) films in Spanish: the rise and predictable fall of a kid who succeeds against the odds. Let me clarify this: this is a high-class melodrama or maybe a soap opera. Not worth your time, except a laugh.
