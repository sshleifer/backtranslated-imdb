If a copy of this film fell into the wrong hands, the world would be in grave danger. I'm a big fan of "B" movies, and I've seen my share of bad ones, but there's not a letter in the alphabet that can adequately describe this rancid piece of solidified vomit. This film surpasses even the "so bad is good" phase and goes directly to the "so bad your world will seem a little less significant to have seen it" phase. <br /> <br /> It's hard to say what's more disturbing: .1. The fact that the people who wrote it thought that their political satire (I use the term very, very, very freely) was witty enough to film. They were able to find so many other people who agreed with them enough to work on this junk for obviously little or no money. That someone thought it would be a good idea to grab this shit for distribution on a horror anthology DVD. <br /> <br /> If I were a weaker man, I would probably have put spoons of grapefruit in my eyes and then blindly looked at me blindly in the oncoming traffic after seeing this. However, as he is alive, I am forever marked by experience.
