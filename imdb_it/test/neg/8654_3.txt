I agree that this film is about sex without any seduction or love. In fact, it makes sex look so boring and I wonder why I worry. Actually, I don't think that this remotely remembers how the second generations of Indian Canada feel about sex. In any case, did you know that the first drunk hotel / idea was copied from a Korean film, Yopgijogin gunyo, made in 2001 or so? That Korean film was really brilliant as a comedy but at the same time it forces the audience to reflect on the complexity of man-woman relationships and on the difference between men and women in experience and in thinking. I mean that most of the Neal N Nikki hotel / drunk segment has been emulated to be taken. Bollywood filmmakers can't try to create only originals, please? Seriously, I never enjoyed a Hindi movie which is a script. Those that I like have always talked about Indian feelings through Indian cultural means.
