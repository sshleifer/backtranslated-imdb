I've never seen a movie that bothered me so much. It's a film about stupid people who are doing stupid and terrible things. This is not a funny movie. I must say that the plot is terrible. I didn't have the patience to watch it so I only saw half of it, but for me it was enough. The characters are not very inspired. Just terribly annoying. This film is about a guy trying to connect with his tyrant boss's daughter. When he finally manages to talk to her, he asks him to go to his house at his house to see his father's owl, and he thinks he invited him to go with her to a party and be at his house at six in the evening. He must be very disappointed to find that he only has to take care of the owl and that he has a boyfriend. After his father left home, leaving precise orders, taking care of the house and his beloved bird, a secretary appears, a renegade son and all sorts of things NOT funny happens at home. But in the end he connects with his boss's daughter. TRUST ME THIS FILM IS TERRIBLE !!!!!!!!!!!!
