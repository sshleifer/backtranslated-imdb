Lately the mockumentaries are proliferating so much that the approach therefore requires an injection of fresh and creative material whenever it is used to maintain its vitality. This film offers nothing but reconstructions of similar stories, an aimless script, weak advertisements, uninspired acting and unrewarding humor. <br /> <br /> The premise seems to be quite promising; the legend of the Loch Ness monster is tailor-made for one of these stupid mockumentary misadventures, with a vast array of stories and legends awaiting exploitation for outrageous satire. Filmmakers totally waste this huge potential, however. Let's take a crazy inserting a fake Nessie in the water. Damn, it's original. Another scene has an obnoxious idiot who threatens another hateful idiot with a gun. Sidesplitting. Some free shots of a beautiful girl in a bikini. Annette did it 40 years ago (and much better, by the way). Throughout the film, someone always seems to scream: I guess it was designed to wake up the audience who has been away from this point. <br /> <br /> The worst of all, though, is the inexorable saves of those realities shows the "interview comments" type made by the characters. Not only do they bombard you with this tired joke every five seconds, but apparently even the actors improvise; this is the only explanation for how humorous the jokes are. If lines like "I've never seen anyone write a book on non-evidence" were actually written, then the writer should be shot on sight and fed to Nessie. No wonder Nessie became violent; obviously saw this movie.
