"Stealing Time" dates back to 2001, when it was mysteriously titled "Rennie's Landing". Which explains how director Marc Fusco was able to afford this cast of established television / film actors in what is obviously an extremely low budget production. About ten minutes into the film you understand why this thing never had a theatrical release after touring the film festival several years ago. <br /> <br /> The recent distribution of Franchise Pictures probably reflects the perception that the growing popularity of some cast members may be milked to recover some of the modest production costs. Although it is not a great addition to someone's resume, the young actors did worse things when they were desperately looking for an acting job of any kind. <br /> <br /> Peter Facinelli, Ethan Embry, Scott Foley and Charlotte Ayanna play college friends who make a first "Big Chill" reunion and compare war stories about the failure of reality to measure themselves against their dreams. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately nothing else happens, absolutely nothing. Yes, Alec (Facinelli) dreams of a robbery at the liquor store and a bank robbery, which are then "cheaply and laboriously" staged with totally inappropriate music. Bank work is less suspense since W.C. Fields was the guard of "The Bank Dick". <br /> <br /> If someone can indicate any time in "Time to steal" where something "really" happens, I'd like to know, because, as far as I can tell, nothing happens in the whole movie. Perhaps Fusco, through incessant visual reflections, is trying to say something profound about taking control of his life before it's too late. Like "St. Elmo's Fire", the film is littered with every deep thought ever uttered by a young adult who has left the ivory tower to experience the real world for the first time. <br /> <br /> I heard that Fusco was going for some sort of Howard Hawks Young professionals in action "Only the angels have wings". Then again, I'm sure I was reading too much in the movie. After all, things really happen Howard Hawks movie. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
