This film was terrible, not only was the plot weak, but the acting was incredible, sometimes pathetic. Very unrealistic dialogues in real life people don't talk like that and there is no emotion or feeling in something very monotonous except for the almost indistinguishable whisper that constantly occurs. Even the assembly is bad, the cuts are terrible. The camera work was sloppy and flickering in close-ups, even swaying back and forth during conversations. There is nothing positive about this film and George Katts needs to work on heavy machinery or anything he doesn't have to talk to other humans because he clearly doesn't know how to do it. How he won / received this movie for the awards oh my god !!
