******** NOTICE SPOILER ************** I lost 85 minutes of my life watching this "movie". first of all, we think it is exhilarating that the producer appeared in the film as the autopsy doctor with a horribly incredibly incredible accent - what the hell was Romanian anyway? And how is it that in Denmark no one speaks Danish except the marsh creatures? (Note, the director of the Scottish camp ...). ? And who is shopping for swamp creatures? Their pants seemed to have been purchased from Banana Republic. Very well dressed to be 1200 years old. This was worse than Scarecrow (we didn't think it was even POSSIBLE). Basically we quickly advanced 75% of the movie in search of goral / mortal / scary moments. No one found. Rent the DVD only to see the 2 hours of "Behind the scenes of Bog Creatures". Who are these people? Are they serious? And the filmmakers are 60 years old. I think this is their Holy Grail and this is quite pathetic in itself. <br /> <br /> BEST LINE from the film, hands down: "Not bad for a girl who never went to school ..." My blind grandmother who has alzheimer could make a better film.
