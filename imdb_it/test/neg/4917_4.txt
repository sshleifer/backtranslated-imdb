At the speed with which these films are going through the artifacts of the Amityville house, it won't be long before we get to the floorboards, but for now it's a mirror that is causing problems for more cardboard characters in this sixth item of the series. A homeless handing him over to the hairdresser of the artist Ross Partridge, who then has strange visions and discovers some unpleasant revelations about his past. This horrible horror drags on at a boring pace, leaving us waiting for an accumulation that never comes when the various "ghostly" events lead to a stupid ending. Bland is lifeless, with acting and Partridge's huge hair that doesn't help things.
