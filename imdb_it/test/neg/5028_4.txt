Could there be an end to iping movies that talk about social conflicts or other human disasters? Okay "Care" talks about childabuse, "Care" talks about perverts who abuse kids in a school and how disgusting it can be, if it's a film with a poor script and made with evil actors, then it's a bad movie. "Care" is a film that could have been, but it is because it was a TV movie I don't know, but everything seemed so limited that it looks like an economic film that will be seen by some housewives and fathers who decide not to do it go to bed. There are so many unanswered things in this movie ... the relationship with his mother, for example, or the death of an abused boy from whom we know nothing more. "Care" should have been much better.
