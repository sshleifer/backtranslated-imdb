A very silly high school / teen movie that tries to prove itself better than the rich brats. Does it sound familiar? This television movie by director Rod Amateau ("Uncommon Valor" and some episodes of "Dukes of Hazaard" believe it or not) says nothing, does nothing and surely will entertain very few. <br /> <br /> Notable for his "who is who" of the television cast, including Michael J. Fox, Bob Denver ("Gilligan") and Todd Bridges ("Different Strokes"). This limping effort limps just beyond the line. He also plays Anthony Edwards ("E.R."). <br /> <br /> Saturday 5 September 1998 - Video
