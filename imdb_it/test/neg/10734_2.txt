"While sporadically compelling (including some delicately tender moments) and humorous, the satire of the clumsy" Homecoming "imposes itself as forced and, in the end, unsatisfactory. With a material like this, timing is everything (Michael Moore knew how to release" Fahrenheit 9 / 11 "before the 2004 elections), and the real tragedy of Dante's film is that it did not come out 2 years ago, when his message would have brought an energy that would have further stimulated the dissidents. hardly controversial (or imperfect) like then. <br /> <br /> frankly anyone can be convinced of something from a handful of zombies with a handful of ham has a questionable intelligence. <br /> <br /> and if not you noticed, michael moore didn't exactly help defeat Bush. <br /> <br /> there was nothing compelling about this film, I just felt the disgust at how blatant and frankly stupid the film was, it's state doloros or to watch. if you're going to do something like that, you need a little spirit. unfortunately this has none. a badly made satire actually has the opposite of the desired effect. as they say, with friends like these who need enemies.
