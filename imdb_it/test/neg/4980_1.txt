I was browsing through the movies on demand and saw Underdog for free and it was only 82 minutes long, so I decided to watch it. I didn't expect much, but it exceeded my expectations of being terrible. Everything about the film was worthwhile. The dialogue was atrocious, including many terrible puns. Even the jokes were terrible. I found myself screaming and throwing my screen while I was suffering in this garbage. It hits its target audience very well, but I don't see how anyone else can appreciate this movie. It made me very angry and almost crying because of all the terrible that this movie has had. <br /> <br /> The only fun thing about this movie was the chance to give it a 1/10 after seeing it. Please avoid it at all costs. I understand the fact that it is made for children, but there is nothing sympathetic about it.
