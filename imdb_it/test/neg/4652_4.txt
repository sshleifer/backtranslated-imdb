Along with his turn in the super-squalid "classic" THE TOOLBOX MURDERS (1978), this is considered to be Cameron Mitchell's worst horror effort. He's a little too slow for my taste, he doesn't have cute characters and doesn't have much action until the end, but Mitchell's psycho-central performance as a witch victim of revenge Vincent Rinard is fun. Not Anthony Perkins, mind you, but sure enough fun. As a parody of the superficial idea that is Hollywood, it's just so-so; as a horror movie, it's just right. And even as a simple image of vintage exploitation, that's fine. I'm a big fan of the useless free dance sequence, so I was also grateful for the appearance of the Gazzarri Dancers, who have just reigned. Five of them perform a crazy go-go dance routine, floor slippage, hip-dance and "Do not Cry, Look For the Rainbow" by T-Bones. Watching these ladies bounce with big smiles on their faces at the top of the fringed bikini and in the parachute pants is a decisive reason why I give them a slightly higher score than usual. <br /> <br /> Make-up of the previous film Vincent Rinard ("The best after Lon Chaney!") chases the people of the Paragon Studios. A flashback shows how Max Black (Berry Kroeger), a jealous and drunk studio executive, threw wine on Vinnie's face just as he was about to light up a smoke. He is engulfed in flames and plunges into a puddle, but not before healing on one side of his face and losing an eyeball (not to mention his sanity). Now employed by the world famous "Movieland Wax Museum" in Buena Park, California, Vincent uses a special serum (described as a mixture of truth serum, nervous medicine and special "vitamins and minerals" ... Attention Centrum!) paralyze the victims. Disappear and the dense detective on the case (chaired by Scott Brady) are disconcerted while new "statues" are exhibited in the museum. Vince speaks to himself ("I am a terribly kind man!"), He smokes a chain, he mumbles, hisses and describes how he "gets excited" by the sound of a woman's scream. <br /> <br /> has to do with a pack of charlatans and self-absorbed witches, most of whom will deserve what is coming from them. There is also Nick (Hollis Morrison), a heady and brash tourist guide who sees a "statue" beat, but doesn't go by the cops. Except for Max (a true grade Grade idiot ... who doesn't even die!) And the stupid cops, the other two main roles are women and both are pretty atrocious. Marie Morgan (Anne Helm) is not the typical innocent heroine; this tramp has been engaged no less than five different characters in this movie (!), including Vince, Max and two of the missing male wax / star mannequins (I believe he never had time to try the missing girl). For some reason, she begs and even begs for her irritating childlike voice for Vince to give her a "copy" of the head that is planning the last missing actor (and boyfriend number 5) Tony Deen (Phillip Baird). He doesn't know that Vince has already stuck a syringe in the back of his neck, but I like it when Mitchell sharply accepts his requests "so you can withdraw completely for reality." He also wants her to "pose" for him, which means that she will eventually be held in a box. Unfortunately, the box has a hole where its head fits, so we must continue to be attacked orally by its high-pitched moans. <br /> <br /> The other "woman" is Theresa (Victoria Carroll), one of the go-go girls mentioned above. He saw for the first time that he was completely rhythmical jumping on stage in a lime green fringed bikini. Theresa is tolerable before you speak, but when you realize that his grateful presence combines the abrasiveness of Lorena Bracco with the airy mentality of the Landers sisters, you want Vincent to inject her with the serum as soon as possible. Unfortunately, for the first time we are undergoing a scene in which she is making endless requests to the head of the studio and going around the museum trying to avoid Mitchell. She and the rest of the characters are completely indifferent, but they work as a way to make fun of the Hollywood system in general, I guess. And I'm probably giving this movie more credit than it deserves. The advantages are few and far between, but include (in addition to Mitchell and the dance routine), slightly stylized colored lights and a bizarre ending that seems to suggest that Rinard will be severely punished for his crimes by spending the rest of his life in his personal hell ... Married to Marie! ... Yikes, now it's scary. <br /> <br /> The cast also includes director John "Bud" Cardos (also the production manager) as police sergeant, James Forrest as director, Virgil Frye as a statue, Rini Martin and Kent Osborne as bartender . Many of the people who worked on this (including executive producer and screenwriter Rex Carlton) also worked on the Al Adamson movie BLOOD OF DRACULA'S CASTLE and other atrocities. <br /> <br /> My score: 4 out of 10
