This is probably the only worst film I've ever seen - it has no good features at all. <br /> <br /> It looks like it was done in about 20 minutes with the other full-time title graphics. /> <br /> The male protagonist has transformed from a door of death into a superman - eh you what? <br /> <br /> In addition to the totally predictable and not at all interesting. <br /> <br /> I let the cinema feel cheated. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I could not recommend this movie to anyone.
