This film aims to show the attempt of a bourgeois family to understand what is "going down" in America in the late 60s. Their trip to a rock festival has come up to their old renovated bus. Without exception, the characters are superficial stereotypes. <br /> <br /> If you want to know which established Hollywood actors were desperate for a salary in those days, just look at the credits. Sal Mineo, I had forgotten how bad his career had hit the skates! Thank God, his career bounced back before his untimely death. <br /> <br /> The writers of this television turkey were in the dark. Outside of making grass, their insights into the "hippie movement" were ridiculous.
