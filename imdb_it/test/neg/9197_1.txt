I'm sorry, maybe this is part of the wave of praise for firefighters since 911, maybe it's an old fashioned story, maybe it's not meant to throw away socks but I'm sorry, this movie is horrible. As in the title, cliché 49, I think it has at least so many clichés. It's a depressing story (awesome to be able to be sad when there are dangerous fires and lives saved) on a fireman. And his squalid life, told in a useless, "scene from now", flashback to the style of the past. We start the film with the hero in danger in a collapsing ruined building. The whole film is about trying to make us love this guy and then squeeze a few tears when he meets his end in the end of the scene from the beginning of the movie. I found it difficult to take care of and I wished it had gone up in smoke before. The clichés abound like: the death of the best friend, love at the first site, hazing in a new job, the firstborn, a wife worried with a husband with a dangerous job, a boss of a father / superior figure, 2.4 children ( well 2 but close enough), sacrificing your life to save others, rewards for courage ... and so on. It is the life of every fireman, every police officer, nurse, doctor somehow. He was lazy, if he had been thought of as a "life that flashed before his eyes" as he died, so God helps the poor boy, I'm surprised he didn't suck more smoke to go faster. The flashbacks are mostly trivial and predictable, dully recited and with a soundtrack that could put The Laughing Cow out of business, it was so poor, it actually sounded like muzak or stuff for lifts without copyright !!! Avoid at all costs unless you need something to watch with your grandmother on a Sunday evening. Or maybe if you're related to a fireman - warning - your life will end horribly or you'll be marked forever if you're a brave fireman according to this movie. Unless it's your John Travolta (strange velcro-style hair in this !!)
