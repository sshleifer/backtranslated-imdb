Oy vey ... Jurrasic Park has become Cormanized. As usual the plot is very thin, from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave larger traces of them, to the inexplicable science that uses lasers to control the dinosaurs and poultry trucks that have free hens in enough cages great for big dogs (I've seen chicken trucks all caged the size of shoe boxes). And all this is in the first 15 minutes of this movie disaster. All the male actors are fools (thinking that a grizzly could be free in the desert, dropping objects constantly to give the raptor an easy kill) and the female actors all seem to have just come out of a modeling service for Fredrick's of Hollywood. The raptor itself is the worst thing about the Hobgoblin (from the movie of the same name), it seems they had a version of puppets and a plastic model for "moving" shots. If you want a good movie to sit around and highlight the MST3K style, this is gold. If you want to make competent films and act well ... don't watch a Roger Corman movie. Acting gets a 4 out of 10, some of the players at this stage have tried. The story gets a 2 out of 10, it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone awry. The special effects get 2 out of 10, I've seen worse, but not many.
