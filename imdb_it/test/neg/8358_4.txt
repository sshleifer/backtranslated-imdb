I found it almost impossible to empathize with the character of Ricci in this film. If she were to be depressed, I think the writer and director neglected to do research on the depressed before making this film because the character of Ricci was more a representation of a victim's centered and useless ego that survived depression. /> <br /> The forced attempt at introspective storytelling was as ridiculous as the interactions suffered between her and the people around her. <br /> <br /> Sorry but I couldn't buy it This is directly to the video schlock. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this.
