Even with the low standards of a dedicated horror fan, I found this film superfluous. It was a huge disappointment as it was described as one of eight Horrorfest films. I can only hope that the other seven are better. I was really embarrassed about the friends I had managed to convince to see, and these are the same friends that I made watch the remake of The Wicker Man. It has every cliché in the book. In fact, he did everything to include them. Let's start with the characters. Instead of a young damsel in difficulty, we take three: the only one, a hot mother with two daughters ?? a teenage girl in bloom but without a brain and a cute but at the same time creepy little girl who is known to have "special" abilities including supernatural knowledge and the ability to communicate with the dead. The girl is the same as the remake of The Amityville Horror. It was a little annoying but not as irritating as Dakota Fanning. Overall, these characters seemed like the fugitives of a LifeTime movie. I thought maybe the horror movies had moved from scenes where the female characters went to bed completely made up and ran in the dark announcing their presence to anyone with ears, but not this one. I also find it inconceivable that none of them could be bothered to secure the front door by arbitrary opening day and night. To give you an idea of ​​how much I wasn't involved with these characters, I spent most of my time thinking about how cold it must be on the set because everyone wore a coat even in their homes and how white their teeth were. /> <br /> Despite all the plot machinations, the film does not create any suspense except to wonder when it will be over. There is more atmosphere at the local Giant in the middle of the more banal weekday afternoons. As for the dialogue, I could have sampled the quotes from ten other films and put together a better and more credible speech. The level of gore, the eye candy of a horror fan, was minimal at best. Without their small weapons, the "zombies" were not at all threatening. You could probably throw a couple of kicks in the room. <br /> <br /> What really kills is its banality. Horror films, more than any other genre, cannot survive uninspired mediocrity. Give me a horror movie that is comically inept or outrageously exaggerated in cold blood. I can even take new ones with their torture-inducing anger. From time to time I would really appreciate a scary one, all except this one.
