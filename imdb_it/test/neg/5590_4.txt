STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> David (Johnathon Schaech) and Tish (Lori Heuring) are a couple in Budapest, on work commitments and staying in a luxury hotel. One evening, they meet an attractive woman in a nightclub and invite her to return to their home, where they end up in a trio. Everything is fine, until David gets some negatives in the mail and he and Tish end up being blackmailed. But when some people involved in the deception are found murdered, things get complicated and they are forced to enter the underground world of pornography and hardcore slavery to track down the woman who could have the key to everything. <br /> <br /> While the original film dealt with the concept of tobacco films, this DVD-directed sequel deals with the healthier (!!!) subject of threesomes and unbalanced sex. Play as a porn movie, a cheap titillation piece with lots of T / A hot action going on. If it sounds like your idea of ​​a good movie, you'll probably like it, but you'd probably be more at home in a porn store than in a video store. <br /> <br /> Try to copy the original the dark and voyeuristic feeling of the film, but while doing a good job of it, it cannot yet hold that of the original. It has an apathetic history, with a dark narrative flow. And compared to Cage, Schaech appears as endlessly of wood. <br /> <br /> Better than I thought it would be, I suppose, better than your usual one of these direct DVD sequels that seem to come out a lot these days, but really, haven't we seen enough? **
