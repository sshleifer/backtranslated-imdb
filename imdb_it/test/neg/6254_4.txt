CHEERLEADER MASSACRE (2003) <br /> <br /> with: Tamie Sheffield, Charity Rahmer, Erin Byron, Leonard Johnson, E. Eddie Edwards, Samantha Phillips, GiGi Erneta, April Flowers, Nikki Fritz, Tylo Tyler, Brad Beck, Summer Williams, Brinke Stevens, Melissa Brasselle. <br /> <br /> storyline: a group of cheerleaders, along with their coach and three boys, are on the road for a game when suddenly their van breaks down and take refuge in a nearby cabin. Soon, they drink, have sex and are brutally murdered one by one by an invisible killer. <br /> <br /> the good: some laughter, a surprising identity of the murderer, a cameo by Brinke Stevens, my favorite scene from THE MASSACRE DEL SLUMBER PARTY used as a flashback. <br /> <br /> the villain: I was excited about this movie, I loved all three Slumber Party Massacres because they were so funny, and I expected a lot from this "Slumber Party / Sorority House Massacre with Scream tones"), but he simply sucked! They exaggerated with the phrase "We are dozzy but proud" and basically they did soft-core porn but with a good who-dun-it. <br /> <br /> **
