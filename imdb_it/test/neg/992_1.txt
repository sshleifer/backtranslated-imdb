on Saturday matinee in my hometown. I went with an older friend (he was about 12) and my mom let me go because he thought the movie would be OK (it's rated G). I was attacked by loud music, STRANGE images, no plot and a stubborn refusal to make no sense. We started halfway because we were bored, frustrated and our ears hurt. <br /> <br /> I saw him 22 years later in a revival theater. My opinion had changed - it's also PESSATA! Basically everything I hated was still there and the movie was VERY 60s ... and it's badly dated. I had all the little jokes on the table ... pity they weren't funny. The constant changes in tone are quickly annoying and there is absolutely nothing to grab. Some people will like this. I found it frustrating ... at the end of the film I felt like throwing something heavy on the screen. <br /> <br /> Also, all the Monkees songs in this SUCK movie (and I like them). <br /> <br /> Only for ex-hippies ... or if you have been stoned. I give this a 1.
