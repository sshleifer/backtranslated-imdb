****************** SPOILER SPOILER ******************** ********** ********** This film stinks. Let me say that I totally agree with what the carissaphillips have said about this. What was Sam thinking? He was with a guy who told her he loved her (3 times in total), he was EXTREMELY HOT, and he was stuck with her despite his difficult times (Josh Hartnett). But, he decided to break up with him, no, cheat him with a snobby, ugly, spoiled, rich, bratty loser who never said he loved her in the whole movie (oh wait, did he write it on the wall, does it count?) , and left her in her time of need because she was scared (Chris LOSER Klein). Who would you like to be with? The only reason I sat during the whole movie was because he had Josh Hartnett and hoping that maybe he would eventually die. I wanted Jasper to have another girl who was really worthy of him. The whole "your mom" thing was fun. I liked it. I hate it when people around here say it, but I think Kelley deserved it. Jasper should have told Sam too, he needed a good slap. How the love story started is a mystery to me. They never said anything to each other, so I don't understand how they got together. "I was thinking about the cheese sandwich you gave me ... it had mustard or mayonnaise or ..." Oh what happened. The seemingly romantic lines were so stupid. Moreover it is sososososososososo UGLY! I have to admit, I cried in this movie. For a long time, really difficult. Not because she died, but because she broke Jasper's heart. He cried in this movie so many times ... he tried to smile for her but he couldn't stop the tears. She cried when 1) He told her he loved her 2) She got sick 3) Chris Klein came back and saw how happy he was with him 4) she died. I cried when she cried because she loved her all her life, and I told her, yet she was so stupid that she didn't worry and love a boy who had left her in her time of need, and who didn't cry at the funeral. 1 1/2 stars only because I LOVE JOSH HARTNETT! Oh by the way Chris Klein, YOUR MOTHER! - Wiley's sister
