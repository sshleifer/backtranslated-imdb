I watched this movie by mistake on TV and it was so incredibly terrible that I couldn't turn it off. Every single piece of intelligence and intelligence has been removed from the story of Oscar Wilde by an inept scriptwriter. It hardly matters because the acting, the clich√© with the camera and the cloying music would have ruined something similar to a decent script. The worst performance comes from Patrick Stewart, who presents himself as the most foolish, without talent, Nincompoop's lesser Shakespearean fake-like ghost. "Get out of here!" he screams at one point while waving his arms like a pantomime villain. A really terrible film and why he wonders why Stewart, who can act when he did it, has tainted his reputation by making useless pieces of shit like this and XMen.
