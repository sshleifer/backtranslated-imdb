What a disappointment. The plot is so simple - "good guys sometimes do bad things and bad guys sometimes do good things" - dressed in a racial environment to make it look smart, sophisticated and meaningful. It is not. Missing subtlety. <br /> <br /> Everything that happens is wired and then repacked in case you lack the explanation. <br /> <br /> For a film like this to convince and move the public must represent the ambiguity of the characters and their motivations and actions; don't simply present it as a series of 180-degree changes in each character's actions. <br /> <br /> I really didn't want to waste any more time on it halfway, but I thought I would continue to use it if it improved; big mistake I should have stopped then - it just got worse.
