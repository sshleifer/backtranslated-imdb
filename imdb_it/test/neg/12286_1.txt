Adventures in Dinosaur City, although a creative idea, was a nauseatingly atrocious attempt to make films. Being sucked into a TV and into a new world is interesting. It is not true that three teenagers obsessively obsessed with semi-automatic dinosaurs. Don't waste your time or brain power to see this loser safe. I wouldn't even let my children look at him.
