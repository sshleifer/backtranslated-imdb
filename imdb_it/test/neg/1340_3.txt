I went to this film with some trepidation; the original is a masterpiece of writing and acting and unfortunately my fears have been realized. This is a job without humor and I sat in the theater waiting for humor and humor to start - I'm still waiting, apparently. The updating of the plot at the present time did not work and the alteration of the characters was a real travail - because they introduced the character of Bette Midler when she disappeared with the same rapidity with which she arrived; the related character in the original 1939 was an integral part of the plot. The women at the cinema laughed a few times but nothing touched me as amusing, except for a joke by Meg Ryan who spoke to her mother about her situation and told her that "it's not like a movie from the 1930s" - I craved that I was looking at the 1930s version. It was too moving, "sister sisters" and really need a little witty and witty dialogue from the original game - I still watch the original film and pick up a phrase I've never seen before. There is no sense of closure for this new version, and while the 1939 film is politically incorrect by today's standards, every thread has been tied and when the film is finished, it did so with such force. This remake should be labeled with a warning to any viewer, if you know the original, don't worry: I felt cheated by losing some of my life in a movie theater to watch this piece of non-memorable madness. Door on the Jungle Red !!
