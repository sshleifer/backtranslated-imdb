El Padrino: The Latin Godfather - while this seems to be a direct DVD / video movie - my fullframe copy seemed obviously cropped - so maybe this movie had a limited theatrical run. And the title character looks more like a Gringo than a moi (I'm half Honduran). Pretty typical rise and fall of a drugdealer movie with the list A of the B-list actors: Robert Wagner (drug lawyer), Kathleen Quinlan (cross judge), Tiny Lister (band performer), Gary Busey (child rapist) ), Brad Dourif (white power jailbird), Stacey Keach (grieving governor), Joann Pacula (in mourning Milf), Faye Dunaway (crusader lawyer) and Galo Make Canote as an uncredited guest. This movie is pretty lame. I only saw him kill Skins' game - the only thing that saved her was Jennifer Tilly as a drug smuggler for the Latina - she was exaggerated and sexy -skanky that was fun watching his scenes. It is not worth renting or searching. D +
