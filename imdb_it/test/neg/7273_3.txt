I decided to watch this very low budget film from the "Poverty Row" studio, PRC, why was it the co-star of the exciting lead actor, Lionel Atwill ?? I also really liked the title. Although Atwill often played in these cheap films, his excellent acting style always made films look much better, since his on-screen character was exceptional (his real life is also quite interesting, a bit like a bizarre soap opera ). The reason I use the term "Poverty Row" is that this was a nickname given to the cheapest and worst production companies of the time. Many of these were not even real studios, but production companies that rented spaces and sets from the main studios at night! Yes, there is a good chance that this film was shot after normal working hours, a common thing for these studies. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Lionel Atwill telling his friends a story about something he was involved with years ago. A doctor falls in love with a lady but is afraid to tell her about himself. Is this because his job is putting people on death row to death? it's not exactly a fascinating job! The Doc asks his friend (Atwill) for advice on how to do it, but in spite of not having the man. Later, you realize that it's because his own parents were criminals. <br /> <br /> Subsequently, a man is killed and the woman is implicated, although it is obvious to anyone with a brain that her sister is involved (and is a little crazy) and the evidence against the lady was scarce. But apparently the jury was full of mindless people and was sentenced to death row. Even more brainless is that his old boyfriend was the man responsible for his execution. Don't you think someone else might be able to handle this case ?! Until this fatal hour, her friend (Atwill) spends most of the film trying to prove her innocence and shows that the deranged sister knows a lot more about the case than she will admit. <br /> <br /> the film is only slightly interesting and a bit silly. While it is watchable and Atwill is good (as usual), the rest of the film never rises above the banal and part of the acting is rather dreary. It's sub-par and about what you'd expect from such a low budget movie and nothing else, despite the good title.
