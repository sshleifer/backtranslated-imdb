It's easy for a film that tries to be suspenseful to end up being simply uninteresting. It happens quite often. Dark Harbor is not interesting, but it is bad. Scenes after scene are attached to an otherwise exaggerated premise. A couple in difficulty gathers a stranger in difficulty only to find more problems. <br /> <br /> Some films create tension by building history. Dark Harbor continues to add its story, but it never believes it. I was hoping that like other movies, the suspense would finally explode. He never does. Furthermore, the characters have no continuity from one scene to another. They can act in one way only in one scene, but then act in a completely different way in another scene. At first, you think you are simply out of the character, but eventually you realize that they are not really characters. They are just props for the final touch. The last ten minutes are trying to be shocking. Instead, it is rather lame and uninteresting. The only thing that shocked me was the end of the film. At less than ninety minutes the film still seems too long. <br /> <br /> This is not one of those low-budget jewels. It's more like a fake watch that breaks as soon as you take it home.
