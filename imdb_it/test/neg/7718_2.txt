Terrible, boring sequel of zombies is only marginally better than Uwe's first horrible film. It consists of a group of soldiers who go to a zombie-plagued university campus to find a certain type of blood that could help find a cure for the infection. These soldiers are your typical lambs for the massacre and none of them is the one pulled out (or at least they are not very interesting) so as not to feel sadness in the pit of the stomach when they are eliminated. The film has the typical zombies that bite humans and blood splatters. He also has the same crunching of guts. It simply does nothing for the zombie genre to give it memory. And the climax of the story is rather anti-climatic and ridiculous. One wonders how two people can dive into an army of zombies and not get bitten (because they are the main stars that seem to always manage evasion) while others seem to get a little easier. The only motivation for the film is to show people that they are becoming myths ... no one else. Just watch a Romero movie for a lasting effect.
