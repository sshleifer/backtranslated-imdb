Nothing to look at here. It was all done (and better) before. Who cares about this woman - lacking in every respect - as a mother as a wife and as a friend? In an instant when he could have taken the high road - he jumped into re-dependence with both feet and held his breath - for no better reason than "me too!" If you weren't the beautiful and young person you see on screen - but it seemed more like the real human wreck represented by our family, neighbors and friends who really suffer from additions, we would change channels in a nanosecond. /> <br /> This film starts at the bottom and goes downhill. No redemption, no lessons taught - nothing uplifting in any way. None of the main characters even evokes sympathy, not to mention empathy. (Well, maybe the snake.) I would have enjoyed it more if I had closed a door on my hand. Who needs drivel like this?
