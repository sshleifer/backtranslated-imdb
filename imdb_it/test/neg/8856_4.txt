Well, this movie is really "DISCOUNTED" HAHA Take it? This is a bit like the attitude of this film. The plot is only a copy of Pulp Fiction, ok this is acceptable, but to make this piece if "PLUMP" (haha)! it's really amazing. The plot is so pathetic, and the whole thing has only a few laughs. He tried to make a few jokes from various other films, and failed most of the time. I mean, I have a sense of humor, but this is not really the way to laugh. Most of the supposed "funny" moments are completely ironic. The film is of short duration, with a duration of about 75 minutes. They could have done a much more fun job, looking like they were making fun of a hit movie, they were gambling, and hey! I think they lost! <br /> <br /> Overall PLUMP Fiction, it's "PLUMPABLE" but you won't collect much more! <br /> <br /> Is it worth watching over and over again?: No, once it's enough, actually it's more than enough! <br /> <br /> So is it worth the rent? Ummm .. As I said, it's "PLUMPABLE", but you'll only collect some "PLUMPS"! <br /> <br /> Total out of 10: a 4 out of 10!
