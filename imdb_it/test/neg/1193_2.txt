I'm a big LoG fan. I thought the first two series provided some of the best comedies that this country has ever seen and the third series, although different, was wonderfully dark and imaginative. The thought of seeing Tubbs, Edward and Briss on the big screen made July 3 something to look forward to. And yet, somewhere, everything went terribly wrong. The writers had no real stories and ideas. The part set in old England showed the glimmers of genius that we know the League is capable of but these scenes do not fit the film well. Geoff provided the best of too few jokes, mostly poor and the performances of Lipp and Briss were great disappointments. If you love the League, save time and money and watch TV series episodes again. It is again. A big disappointment.
