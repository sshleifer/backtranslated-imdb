"Oh, the pilots are such men." "They don't call it the cockpit at all, honey." Dialogue like this is just one of the many reasons why the Concorde ?? '79 Airport (or, if you saw it in the UK where he dragged his heels out of there, the '80: The Concorde airport) was the last and by far the least of the series. The catastrophic film was in serious difficulty in the late 1970s, with The Swarm offering an involuntary hilarity and beyond the Poseidon adventure, When Time Ran Out and City on Fire simply offered a lot of boredom and the desperation to find a new spin in the genre is all too obvious here. This time it's a conspiracy plot, with Susan Blakely's news host who discovers billionaire boyfriend Robert Wagner sold weapons to terrorists and northern Vietnamese. Of course, he decides to tell him everything, rather than make the story public, but he baffles her by explaining "I'm a very rich man, I have everything in life I could wish for, why should I jeopardize doing something? So incredibly stupid?" not buying that line, rather than, for example, hiring a hit man to kill her on the ground, she decides to do things intelligently by planning to destroy the Concorde while flying to Moscow via Paris. "I did a lot of things that I was ashamed of, but I'm not a murderer," he insists indignantly on his way to reprogram a guided missile to destroy the plane. So, nothing incredibly stupid there. And when that fails, send a fighter jet after it. And when does it fail? <br /> <br /> We don't even think of looking for something similar to logic here: this is a real bargaining stuff that even the studio has given up and marketed as a comedy in the United States after the critics laughed off the screen . In cases where the previous three entries all had the appearance of big-budget glossy shows, this small friendly effort (the only one not to be shot in 2.35: 1 widescreen) is not even able to make the Concorde look good, which is rather an undertaking. TV veteran David Lowell Rich presumably got the role of director because he was fast, cheap and had directed the TV movie SST: Disaster in the Sky where Peter Graves' supersonic plane found himself unable to land because of sabotage and Senegalese influence (which was not, at least intentionally, a comedy despite the presence of a young Billy Crystal in the cast) and seemed the natural choice for what looks like a 14 million dollar TV movie that somehow is managed to escape to theaters when no one was watching. <br /> <br /> Cast as a bad episode of Hollywood Squares, the stars are in very short supply this time, and most of the few vaguely familiar faces seem to have been collected by rehabilitation and sit-com busted clinics. Alain Delon gives the Hollywood career a last scene as a pilot, "Happy Fish" (don't ask) George Kennedy moves from the executive suite instead of the co-pilot hoping to remind people of the other films, while the rest of the group includes a pair of veterans of The Towering Hell (Wagner and Blakely), a soft-porn star (Sylvia Kristel, who tries to go respectable), a regular by Ingmar Bergman (Bibi Andersson ?? and she is the one who plays the prostitute!), David Warner's navigator has a diet that has nightmares about being chased by bananas, the Devil's voice (Mercedes McCambridge), Charo and his Seeing Eye Chihuahua ("Dohn makes me fail"), Martha Raye and her weak bladder, Jimmie Walker who plays the sax in his place and smokes weed in the john (in a few moments is not occupied by Martha Raye), Cicely Tyson kissing his belief goodbye as a forced mother with a critically ill child and a heart frozen in closet above the head, the owner of the airline Eddie Albert and wife trophy Sybil Danning who holds the best spot at home, Ed Begley Jr in fancy dress, and the Russian Olympic team and their lovable trainer Val Avery and his deaf daughter (ahhhh!) on a tour of good will of the States (who knew of the boycott? ). Just to add a touch of The Simpsons to the works, Harry Shearer highlights a news bulletin with the same tones that he would use later for Smithers. <br /> <br /> Highlights? Despite the impromptu wedding ceremony during a landing, it must simply be George Kennedy who deflects a heat-seeking missile by opening the window, pulling out his arm (at almost twice the speed of sound!) And firing a glow ?? while the plane is upside down! And then Alain Delon turns off the engines so there won't be a "heat source" for the missiles at home inside ?? Yes, someone was paid for writing this, and someone was the future Oscar winner and screenwriter of Monaco and The Insider Eric Roth (hey, everyone must start somewhere), although in his defense it was producer Jennings Lang who to invent tracing. Still, what do you expect from a movie that attributes balloon stunts and ends with a shot of the Concorde flying towards sunset? Surprisingly, in one of these they will not admit the moments of defeat to which scholars were accustomed, Universal filmed another 20 minutes or so of shooting a couple of years later to include them in network TV broadcasts (not included in the DVD). Unfortunately the box office failure led to the fifth entry of the series, the laugh that would have been 1984 Airport: UFO, never taken off. Even more genuinely tragically, it was the Concorde used in this film that crashed in France 21 years later. <br /> <br /> (Oh, and if you're wondering what Charo says to his Chihuahua in Spanish without subtitles when it's not allowed on board, it's "What do you think? Don't worry. When the revolution comes, I promise you that you will fly on everything you want. "" What a shame, my love. "What do they think they are?")
