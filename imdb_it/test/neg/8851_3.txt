I saw this film because every review I read said it was one of the scariest movies of the new millennium. I really don't understand what all the fuss was about. First, the dialogue in this film was ridiculously evil ("What if something strange is happening?" ... what ????). Even the acting didn't blow my socks. It could have been because the script barely gave the actors anything to work with ... the characters are purely two-dimensional for me and I never gave a damn. Another thing is that the film is extremely boring. Extremely. Of course, there are a couple of "jolts" here and there, but for the film's 112 minute duration, it certainly didn't use its time wisely. Most of the film contains characters that talk about things that have almost nothing to do with the plot. For what? <br /> <br /> Finally, the film makes no sense. Yes, I think I understood the intentions of the ghosts, but like what fits into the events that actually occur in the film is beyond me. Furthermore, much of the film takes place in small vignettes, which makes the story difficult to follow at times. And don't even let me start with the ending. What exactly happened there? <br /> <br /> I can give credit to Kurosawa for putting some really scary pictures during the movie. There are very disturbing shots of ghosts and other disturbing images. If they reflected more on those images and processed them on them, it would have made the film much stronger. But they didn't, and instead elaborated more on social commentary, which was interesting, but again, retracted in an extremely boring way. Yes, it's a message movie. Ok, fun. I've just received the message of my review out here in the open: finding a better way to spend free time than watching this.
