This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life (I'm approaching 47)! The description on the back of the cover was the same as the scrolling text at the beginning of the film. The further plot was nothing and even a pile of corpses would show more life in their "acting". I saw the whole length of it and was really relieved when the death of the final character marked the end of my suffering! The location was either a sort of vault or a dirty beach. I suppose the home video equipment served as a camera and the lighting was below standard. The dialogues were uninspired and meaningless. How the actors were faces. Which brings me to the "make-up" topic: judging by this, they took it as a trick in some teenage magazines "my first personal trick" or similar. What made me buy the DVD was the name "Lovecraft" printed on the cover. The only connection with the works of this brilliant mind was the use of the name "Necronomicon", which was erroneously translated as "Book of Light". The 4.70 EURO I paid for this DVD was a complete loss, because the DVD entered the recycling box without further ado.
