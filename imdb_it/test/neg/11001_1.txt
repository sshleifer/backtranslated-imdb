I had to suffer this movie three times while I was an extra zombie in the new film by director After Sundown. The first time I saw this movie, the director was standing next to me and a fake-looking hand turned out of nowhere and grabbed one of the characters. I couldn't take it anymore, I caught myself laughing in front of the boy. The film has no direction and the only thing that could make this film decent (Female Nudity) was not found anywhere. I'm a fan of low budget horror movies, but this was too much for me. The worst part was that I had to watch it so many times. Also, don't expect the new movie to be better.
