Dark Reality is a film similar to a Saw that is slightly decrepit. While the plot and the plot are good, there is a little too much useless nudity. While I feel the film was technically well done, the acting was unpredictable, it was just a little too dark for my mood while I was watching it. In practice, it says that there are many missing people who will never be found and who could be tortured by sick people. I feel that some information about the kidnappers and their reasons for being so sick would have helped some. It came as a snuff movie, made for violent content. If you like seeing women beaten, tortured and killed, then this is for you. If you're looking for something a little liter and more expressive and reasoned, skip this one.
