with this film directed by Roger Avery and Quentin Tarantino in the script I was sure it would be a gem. I was wrong. I don't hate this movie, but I don't like it in any way. <br /> <br /> I love Roger Avery for his incredible direction in the rules of attraction and his scripts for fiction and silent hill, but he made a mistake in doing this. I really need to comment on Tarantino, we all know he's a genius. <br /> <br /> this film is set around a gang that robs a bank but fails due to stupid people participating in the robbery <br /> I am disappointed by Tarantino and Avery for doing this film, but I won't change my mind about how surprising both are. all make mistakes ......... 3/10 ........... j.d Seaton
