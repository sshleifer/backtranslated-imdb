Yes, I did everything until the end. It was quite difficult. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wondered if there was even a director on the set. Acting ... well, I don't even know what to say. I thought that the girl who played Emily had done her best with the boring dialogue, sometimes extravagant and sometimes predictable. <br /> <br /> I know it was low budget but the empty sound and the lighting unfortunately made it look like a 100 minute audition tape. <br /> <br /> I won't even talk about the ending ... <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie was the music. <br /> said, I don't recommend this movie to anyone. Even for lesbians who don't have many movies to look at as a whole, it's nothing to waste your time on. If you're looking for a sad lesbian-themed movie, check out The Children's Hour, Lost and Delirious or High Art. Everyone will leave you depressed and sad, but you won't have to undergo the cinematic hell in the process.
