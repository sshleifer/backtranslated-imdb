Remember those old kung fu movies we watched on Friday and late Saturday nights when our babysitters THINK we were in charge? Well, this movie sounds exactly like one of those movies. Patsy Kensit's biggest claim to fame was her love for Mel Gibson's character in "Lethal Weapon 2", and this performance was one of the reasons she never grew up: she's a terrible actress. <br /> <br /> "Lethal weapon 2", I thought it was pretty. Cute enough to take a look at some of the other films she had been in, including "Loves Music, Loves to Dance", another big disappointment, which of course didn't impress me. But, as attractive as it is for my eyes, my soul screamed at me to turn it off because it played another economic and predictable role, and it did very badly. <br /> <br /> In this film, Kensit plays a comedian (and not even a good person) who works in clubs in France (she couldn't cut it in her homeland, so she's making her ears bleed), which it is unfortunate, but, worse still, the French government wants to throw it out due to an expired visa (or perhaps they have just taken note of her). But he marries this Casanova (Freiss), which is equally unfortunate, and predictability begins ... terribly! Is there a way to give this film a NEGATIVE evaluation? 1 out of 10 stars has passed the evaluation!
