I saw "Fuckland" a long time ago. I lied if I said I remember it in detail; what I remember most vividly is the irritation that caused me and the feeling of a total waste of precious money and time, not just the time and money invested to watch the film but also those of the director. <br /> <br /> "Fuckland" is a critic of the Argentines, who introduces us (I too am Argentinian) as small people who take credit and also boast small and ridiculous victories, and think we are the better thing than God (which is also a Creation in Argentina. I have no intention of discussing it. It is probably a true statement on a fairly large part of the population (the part that I despise, by the way). And even if this were not true That's not my point. The worst "Fuckland" sin committed was to make such a claim about your director. <br /> <br /> The continuous impression I received was that the director was too busy in an attempt to impress us for hiding a camera inside the islands to worry about making a good (even mediocre) film. Many of the outlets made with a hidden camera are useless.The director chooses to show off a silly edition of old battles of gue rra and those of his. And there is no plot at all. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, this film proudly presents a Dogme certificate before the opening credits, only to disrespect its principles later (for example, including the director in the credits - another sign of his pride?). <br /> <br /> I found the film offensive, not as an Argentine, but as an observer. I felt undervalued. "Fuckland" is simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
