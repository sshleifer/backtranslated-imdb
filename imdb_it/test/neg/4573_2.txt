I love strange animation, I love many Asian movies, but I don't like this particular product from Japan. The Fucconi are presumably an American family (they are all mannequins) who have moved to Japan, and are somehow a sitcom type family of the 50s, with slightly more modern sensibilities sometimes. The DVD has several very short episodes (like less than 5 minutes each?) And I didn't find it funny or fun, not even in a strange way. I'm not sure what the appeal of this is. I did some satire here and there, hell, who doesn't, but satire is usually a bit funny, isn't it? And nothing I've seen or heard has even a smirk. I used it used and definitely SOUNDED appealing, but I suppose I miss the point or it's just LAME. The box also says that it is exhilarating Fuccon, right in front of it, but I dare to disagree. 2 out of 10.
