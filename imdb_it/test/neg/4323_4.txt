Lon Chaney Jr. returns to cheat while the mummy Kharis looks for his partner, Annanka whose soul now resides in the wonderful host of descendants Amina (Ramsay Ames). Andoheb, High Priest of Arkan (George Zucco) leaves Yousef Bey (John Carradine) in charge of the Kharis to continue their evil methods. Tom (Robert Lowery) must find a way to save his beloved Amina from certain future terrors of mothers. <br /> <br /> The predictable routine and entry into the Kharis series shows that almost all films follow a specific format / formula. The city is threatened by an unbridled corpse, with a single masked arm, which appears to have been endowed with a superhuman power to suffocate the life of able-bodied men who are relatively easily restrained by a simple Kharis tip. Frank Reicher, who saw Kharis in action ... and knows a lot about Egyptian history ... in the previous film (The Tomb of the Mummy), shows that anyone who survived a previous encounter with the mummy is sure he will die if he returns to the next shot. Well produced, but lacking in originality that would distinguish it from other films in the series. Unfortunately, Carradine sleepwalking through his role as evil Yousef Bey. An embarrassing screenplay mistake has Kharis, who is known to have worn a crippled and crippled right arm, carrying an unconscious Amina with both arms for long distances with no ill effects. One aspect, the shocking climax in which Tom's attempt at heroism does not go according to plan while Kharis holds his maid of honor hostage, slightly lifts the film from depression.
