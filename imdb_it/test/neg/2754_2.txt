Make no mistake, High School Bigshot is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> High School Bigshot talks about a geek who makes a plan to get rich and get the girl. However, everything goes wrong, and of course at the end of the film he ends up dead along with other people, fortunately including the girl. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story is all about caring about women is wealth. Even for us men, I suppose we should just agree to "have it" or "we don't have it"! <br /> <br /> I could easily see how this movie could be rated at 1, however it is higher than the worst movie. Acting is not entirely horrible, and production values ​​are not ultra-terrible. Overall it's a bad movie and it's not worth seeing for many reasons. If you insist, of course, on torturing yourself, look at the MST version. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe a 1.5 / 10)
