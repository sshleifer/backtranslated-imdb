(spoiler) could be the worst movie you see, you might like it like you really like it. It's one of those chance films. <br /> <br /> There is a man who has seen a day in life. Rats are rats for how they feel sorry (which I think was a good idea). The murdering rats become friends with the man two great men come to feel unwanted so the man sets up the rat murderer on them and on the floor cry both bodies covered with big black mice not so much blood. <br /> <br /> but think of big black rats all over your body) but start killing people but rats get bored until rats kill their friends and girls, <br /> <br / > There's a scene where we sat on the toilet while the rats go into the pipes leading to the bathroom and the mouse goes over and comes out of his mouth, (which means rats I have to eat everything inside my body) made to laugh for weeks <br /> <br /> because I liked this movie, yes it's different from the rest, I for UNO like it when little creature faces humanity. <br /> <br /> if you have seen one of these film bullets, strip, Them, spiders, snakes, tremors, Cujo, crocodile, shark, octopus. <br /> <br /> If you liked them and check out the Hood mice, <br /> <br /> it's better then that Toon Terror than all I can say! 4/10
