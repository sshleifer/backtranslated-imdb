The film disappointed me for many reasons: first of all the description of a future that at first sight seemed realistic to me was well built, but it had only a marginal role. So the story itself was a weak copy of Lost in Translation. The Middle Eastern setting, the man with the family meets the new girl abroad, the karaoke bar, the camera movements and the images - all this was a terrible imitation of the excellent Lost in Translation which also had credibility. This film tries to be something ingenious and cultural: it is not. I wonder why Tim Robbins even thought of making this movie! The female lead actress is horrible - did she interpret the precog in Minority Report? And why do you have to show the vagina in a movie like this? Lost in Translation did not have to show excessive love scenes. R-Rated just for this? This film is not even worth watching from a video store!
