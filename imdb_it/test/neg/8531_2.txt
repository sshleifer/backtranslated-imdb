Well, at least we have to recognize that the big Hollywood horror producers are becoming smarter and more perceptive. Instead of waiting patiently to buy the rights to Asian horror hits and then re-doing them in America, they have now discovered that they could simply hire Asian directors and assign them to make their new ghost story directly in the United States. It's like killing two birds with one stone; way to go guys! "The Messengers" is practically identical to all the other supernatural chillers that have come out of eastern countries since "Ringu". Roughly translated, this means that it is a boring film, too long and entirely bloodless, but it has a copious amount of false scares and embarrassingly weak "have we already frightened you?" moments. The Pang Brothers (Danny & Oxide) previously created "The Eye" extremely overrated and for them it is a tradition to build a story with clues and hints at a point where it becomes almost impossible to meet the expectations of their curious audience, but not they seem eager to change their formula anytime soon. And they are also scrupulous enough to repeatedly recycle the same old and repetitive phantom arguments. Uneasy spirits of the previous inhabitants trapped in the walls of a remote country farm? The family of the protagonists torn by unprocessed traumas of the past, so must they first restore faith and mutual trust? Give me a break! Throw in a videotape and a seven-day curse, why not? Even the attempts to make you jump on the seat are too déjà-vu and will not scare anyone over 7 years old. The slamming doors, the dirty and gradually larger stains that grow on the walls, the ghostly appearances, the noises coming from the cellar .. The infinite excessive use of cheap tricks like this is almost becoming an insult to the fans of horror. "The Messengers" revolves around a family on their way to a new life in the countryside like sunflower growers. The family situation is rather dysfunctional as a personal tragedy (which is not revealed late into the night in the film) has forced the younger son to stop talking and the parents to be wary of their revolting teenage daughter. Shortly thereafter, the children experience strange presences on a remote farm, but they cannot convince their parents to leave. This is pretty much the whole movie. Little Ben sees things but cannot speak and Jessica is repeatedly attacked by supernatural forces, but nobody listens to her. The basic premise of "The Messagers" is very much derived from Stanley Kubrick's immortal classic "The Shining", lacking only the constantly disturbing atmosphere and the disturbing tone. The script takes itself too seriously even if it is easy enough to foresee the final epilogue and the total absence of violence and bloodshed is unforgivable. At least "The Eye" has produced some genuine shocks at the end, while the happy and joyous joy that ends with "The Messengers" is simply pathetic. The only positive elements I can think of are the beautiful rural settings, the appropriate editing work and the promising young talents (and beauty) Kristen Stewart. And there is a disturbing, but sadly underdeveloped supporting role for William B. Davis.
