I was pretty lost to most of this film, and I'm usually the one who understands the works of enigmatic big names in movies like David Lynch (Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me) and Darren Aronofsky (Pi). Not to mention that Northfork doesn't make sense at some level, it just doesn't combine to form a completely coherent film. As time passes by watching the film, its themes and intentions become clearer, but during my initial vision, I was really confused, and I find this to be the main flaw of the film ... its lack of direction. The plot focuses on the city of Northfork, in Montana in 1955. The city has been emptied and will soon be flooded to make way for the creation of a hydroelectric dam. The main problem is that not all its inhabitants are willing to be evacuated and transferred. A group of men is hired to force the residents left out of the city before they can drown, and for the most part they succeed in situations and quite strange citizens. At the same time, the film tells the story of Irwin, a very sick boy (or is he a fallen angel?) Whose adoptive parents returned him, due to his illness, to the Northfork orphanage from which they adopted him. Father Harlan (Nick Nolte) takes care of the dying Irwin, but Irwin imagines (or perhaps?!) That a group of angels (including Daryl Hannah and Anthony Edwards) have arrived in the desolate and empty city in search of a fallen angel . Irwin has scars on his back and his head, and tries to convince the angels that his scars are where humans have amputated his wings and halo. Oh yes, and during all this there is an animal that walks strangely surreal on stilts that wanders all over the bottom of the landscape. There are many other small events happening in the film, but none of them ends up being much more than a temporary intrigue. You can appreciate the artistic quality of the film (it is obvious that the filmmakers were deeply concerned about this film) and its rich cinematography, but the film still tries too hard to be different and then surrenders and whines at the end without doing much of a statement. As I wrote before, it becomes clearer, long after seeing, what probably happened in the film. Irwin is dying, and so is Northfork, and in coping with his own loss and death, Irwin has probably created characters, from the ideas he gets from the objects that surround him at the orphanage, to comfort him as he is abandoned and his life approaches his end But then again, maybe he really is an angel, and he found his kind and can now go home. I must point out that there are some really beautiful moments in the film, heartbreaking, vivid and full of loneliness and sadness. Unfortunately, the film as a whole ends up feeling disconnected and somewhat incomplete.
