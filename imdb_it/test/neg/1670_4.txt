This film looks a little awkward around the edges, as if the madness weren't enough when it should have been. But I especially liked it. <br /> <br /> The plot is more than a little absurd, so no expectation of "something real" should be included in your viewing experience. Check your brain at the door. It will not be necessary and could otherwise be an obstacle. <br /> <br /> I really liked Clennon's performance as the real Dr. Baird. His role was perfect to give Aykroyd's character a protagonist. What putz was the real Dr. Baird. <br /> <br /> And Matthau was pretty good as the protagonist's companion. At first annoying, but ultimately lovable. A type of. Guy. Or at least something that the use of a soap and lots of water would have been more than useful. <br /> <br /> Is it really worth looking at? If you're in the mood for a parody of the psychiatric profession, of course, why not?
