I saw it as part of a marathon of vampire movies with research intent, otherwise I could never have looked at it all the way. The first scene in which a group of vampires in very bad wigs seems to be electrocuted by various slow-moving weapons held up by an aspiring Van Helsing even slower on the move ... in black and white ... with a voice above, set the pace for the rest of the film. The fighting scenes look ridiculous, the dialouge would be funny if the acting wasn't so bad, what goes through the plot doesn't make sense, and the production values ​​bite (from the plaque that comes off the Spike coat worn by the hero to I've seen some bad movies (check out The Magic Sword with B. Rathbone, or the Raven with a very young Jack N.), but this is my vote for the worst of all times.
