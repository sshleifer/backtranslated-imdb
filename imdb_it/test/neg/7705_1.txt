This fake documentary is imperfect on many points, it is badly done, it has uninteresting characters but the biggest problem I have is the basic premise. <br /> <br /> This film uses the idea that H.P. Lovecraft traveled to Italy and some of his works are based on real supernatural events that he witnessed. I am willing to go on with the idea that he traveled in Italy (only to suspend disbelief) but that some of his works are based on reality and that Insmouth exists is a total nonsense. <br /> <br /> First of all, Lovecraft did not believe in the supernatural, in his letters he clearly states that he considered himself a mechanical materialist, his monsters where to show that humans were not so special. Another myth used in this film is that Lovecraft was an expert on the occult, he was not, all his knowledge on the subject came from the most basic sources. <br /> <br /> So we end up with a movie about people masturbating each other very often and when we finally see the monster, it's so ugly that you can't even laugh, you just feel a pain in your love of horror. <br /> <br /> After watching the film Frankenstein Lovecraft said he felt sorry for Mary Shelley because he felt that his work had been slaughtered. I'm sorry for Lovecraft.
