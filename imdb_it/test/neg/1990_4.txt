I am surprised that "The Hospital" has been received so well by critics and the public. I found it sad, visually ugly and generally meaningless. After the first 40 minutes practically unwatchable, the film does not improve (relatively), but it remains TRUE too far-fetched (not to say funny) to be successful as a satire, and has too little substance to succeed as a drama. The uncertain tone of the film is his biggest fault, even overshadowing Scott's extraordinary performance (as usual).
