Uwe Boll again slips into his ability as a director once again to offer a ghostly tale of mercenaries and reporters who run into super soldiers on a remote island. A good cast led by the excellent Udo Keir is driven out by Boll, who does the worst of the script that was supposed to work. The mad scientist investigated by a reporter was killed but this script is funny enough that the plot should have worked, besides the effects and design of the super-soldier with their lifeless eyes have a certain degree of uneasiness, however Boll in some so he manages to film everything in an obfuscated way. It's as if he couldn't be bothered to really understand what would work and instead he rattled off camera placements and walked away. Also, the montage of the scenes has no spark or life, I imagine that Boll only shot one or two takes and simply used what he had. It really stinks. Clearly Boll is in one of his periodic retrograde films in which anything he has ever learned about the film blushes. The last film he made was a serial killer movie that is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's not that bad, but it's close simply because it should have been better. So, once again, Udo Keir is good enough to make it worthwhile watching his scenes and making the movie so good. I'd make a ride unless it's late at night and you're taking it on the cable.
