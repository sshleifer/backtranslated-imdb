I'm really sorry to say, but this movie was horrible at every level. It's not all Van Damme's fault, as you can see he did his best, but let's face it, he's almost fifty, how much more can you ask him about him? I find it so hard to believe that the same people who put together Undisputed 2; probably the best (western) martial arts film of the last few years has created this. Everything, from the plot, to the dialogue, to the editing, to the general acting, has been put together in a horrible way and in many cases decidedly boring and meaningless. Scott Adkins' fighting scenes seemed more like a demo reel, they were also terribly underused and not even the main villain who is such a sin because 1) He is more than capable of playing that role and 2) The real main villain wasn't alone not intimidating, but also quite annoying. Again, not blaming Van Damme. I will always be a fan, but avoid this.
