Is there a fire department clich√© that is NOT used in this movie? From the opening line "I'm getting too old for this" through the "antics" of the firemen, to the "worried wife", to the loss of his best friend in the fire station, to the final funeral for the fallen brothers, this film seems and seems that it was written by Disney's marketing department ("Our studies show that the public really likes it when ..." and then locked it in). <br /> <br /> There is nothing original here. Every emotion we feel for these guys is brought to our admiration and our feelings for the firemen. <br /> <br /> Go and look at Rescue Me if you want to see the real heroes: everyday kids with flaws who don't think they come across a burning building to save strangers.
