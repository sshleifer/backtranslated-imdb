yeesh, let's talk about craptastic. this thing is brutal. Horrible vocal dubbing, even more horrible acting and no recognizable storyline. Seemingly there are some hunting scenes, but the problem is that first you have to get to that point, and I couldn't. that a movie. I suppose I can send it quickly, and I advise you to do the same, unless you have an extreme pain tolerance or a masochist. do not fall into either of the two categories. I still have a migraine from this thing, so I'm about to perform a dental surgery without anesthetic, as soon as I relive the migraine.bottom line, horrible. 0/10
