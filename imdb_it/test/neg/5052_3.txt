You know, I'm really getting tired of all the generic music used in this kind of movie (see Jawbreaker, Disturbing Behavior, etc.). Every scene of genuine tension here (and there are some) is immediately undercut by some pop melody, which completely dilutes the suspense. Why do they do it? To sell some soundtracks, of course, but in this case, unfinished mission - did anyone buy the CD? <br /> <br /> And yes, Mrs. Mirren attacks her role with joy and taste (with some cheez-wiz for add soccer). But what are Molly, Leslie and Vivica doing here? Their roles (they are so little used that I can't use "characters" here) have no purpose in the plot, so I can't understand why three famous actresses were cast. <br /> <br /> Oh and the ending is so incredibly banal and irresponsible. Children come down without hurting themselves and behave as if nothing had happened - everything smiles at graduation. They are criminals, people! No consequences for their actions (kidnapping, aggression, tampering with rank) - nothing. <br /> <br /> Little things - is Tingle's story about her husband true? What's with the crossbow? Would Katie's virginal character lose her cherry on such a whim? (Great message, boys.) Why did McKean go to his house? How did Kate's academic nemesis cross the door at that very moment? How do students also get teachers' home addresses? WHAT WITH JEFFREY TAMBOR ?? On what basis did McKean shoot Tingle? It's bloody, abused and held hostage by students, for God's sake! <br /> <br /> Oh well, I'm spending a lot more thought on the script than Mr. Williamson apparently did, so I'll stop here. <br /> <br /> 3/10
