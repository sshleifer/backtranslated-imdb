My tolerance for shlocky leadership has been overwhelmed by some of the choices in this could be-really-good-loser. <br /> <br /> When "romantic" intervals were of a nature to take me out of history and into "How-and-why-did-the-movie-maker-do- / that /?" mode, you have to understand that something is missing in there; retention and good taste, I think. <br /> <br /> Brian Brown is usually a capable, empathic actor. I think he doesn't like the project or the people, and he shows. I don't remember anything about the other guy. He can't even imagine his face. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it must be nothing good to entertain; some of the cartoons and twists are fun and even brilliant. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie ($ 2.00 purchase at the video camera rental) against the screenwriter's advice; I understand that he was tempted to remove his name from the credits. A matter of pride, I bet.
