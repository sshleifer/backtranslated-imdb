the man was so hard to watch! it wasn't funny at all, not well done and had no reason or plot for anything. the acting was horrible. it was not at all well done. it looked like a bunch of kids my age that were filming and making a useless movie. is by far the worst lizard film ever. if you are a film of broken lizards like me, you will be disappointed and bored by death. please skip this useless movie about ugly looking chicks. you will not regret. by the way, don't say that you didn't find this review useful just because you disagree. it's stupid, like this movie. the only OK scene was when the main player played rugby and was busy. I liked it because I found his character damn annoying.
