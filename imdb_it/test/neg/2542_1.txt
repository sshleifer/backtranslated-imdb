I just finished watching this movie, and for me it takes ages because it's so boring ..... and the plot is extremely ugly. <br /> <br /> now ... where should I start .... Or .... the film is called "sinking of Japan" .... yes yes ... shows that Japan is actually sinking, but the part relating to the action is very bad. Compared to the movie "the day after tomorrow" I would rate it at least 8/10. <br /> <br /> The "sinking of Japan" does not show much about the disaster that is really happening right in front of our eyes. there's not much excitement ... boring ... all I can say ... <br /> <br /> another point ... I would recommend this movie to have a better title ... maybe something like " the romance of the sinking of Japan "because this film has a lot of talk (waste of time ... nonsense) and the love story is extremely boring and drags on too long ... honestly ... almost i get frustrated. <br /> <br /> In general ... this film does not show enough details of the disasters, for example many people run crazy to avoid death ... the part of the story was extremely not enough touching for me. <br /> <br /> but hey ... there is one thing we should appreciate for this movie though .... & it has some good songs!
