The television crew was charged with covering a hockey team from a small town school that runs into a serial killer wearing a black mask and a hooded sweatshirt. A lot of interviews in which the crew members (and some of the locals who live in the city of White Plains where most of the film is set) talk about each other, the ones they meet in the city ​​of White Plains, their current situations and the show side of their lives. The script is often sour, cynical and caustic and Killer Movie essentially enjoys watching TV shows actually, with a cast of characters that can be found on The Real World. If this plot attracts you, throw yourself out. I found the characters boring and satire is an old hat. Outside the cast, Paul Wesley, the director who needs a great break, meeting more than he is able to bargain, Jake Tanner, is a good guy, very likeable and tolerant of the shit he has to deal with , considering the first donnas and immature people in his entourage who often cause nothing but migraines. Particularly annoying is its producer Lee (Cyia Batten), a tyrant who constantly barks orders at all, his poisonous attitude creates a lot of tension..is the kind of producer who wants to capitalize on a city eruption regarding the murderer, using coverage of the history hockey team as a front to exploit the tragedy that occurs in White Plains. Those who are familiar with Kaley Cuoco know that at this point he perfected the spoiled princess, he teased her because it is the only role we see her most of the time. Like Blanca, she is polarizing the way she demands attention, milking that state of small celebrity that she has to the end, producing a lot of friction while becoming a source of frustration, and she has a rather dark mouth (Cuoco may have taken the part just like her could escape his usual roles in a television sitcom, he allowed to explode the vulgarity without restrictions). Cuoco, along with the entire cast, assists the Killer Movie like a feast for the eyes, but it's hard to find a character you wouldn't want to see cut into pieces with a meat cleaver. Jason London is the sound / equipment technician, a real creep with a harsh attitude, which often haunts others with his unpleasant comments that are not required. We are witnessing many personality clashes, observing how these types of Hollywood who absorb themselves in the cast collide with each other. The identity of the killer should not surprise anyone, it is quite obviously obvious. Some minor irritation, but most of the violence is fired off the screen. Despite some domesticated lesomicide, this is not satisfactory either. Leighton Meester appears in the film as a nice victim. The director / screenwriter Jeff Fisher assembles a rather attractive cast, but I wouldn't be able to distinguish him from the countless cuts that filled the shelves of horror over the last decade or so from SCREAM. Although I never liked any of Cuoco's characters, I never tire of looking at her, but in the end she needs to find a role that does not consist in her modesty, with arrogant arrogance, always plaintive and plaintive.
