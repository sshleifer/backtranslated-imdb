I don't find this show funny at all. Actually I think it's much worse than any other terrible Disney channel sitcom right now. Charlotte Arnold is an interesting choice to play Sadie because she can't act. The jokes about this show are terribly unpleasant, and make it even worse when the only cast member who has a little (and I mean a little) of acting talent is Justin Bradley as Sadie's brother, Hal. Jasmine Richards and Michael D'Ascenzo portray Sadie's friends. There are both really stupid and simply terrible actors. Two words that can really describe this show are terribly trivial. It is the banal humor that only girls find funny because their brains have not yet developed. Now I have explained my hatred of acting and horrible humor, what are the prospects? The whole premise of the show is a stupid idea. Has she changed again (not so silly and a lover of Ben) and suddenly no one recognizes her? He's an idiot. In summary, I hate this show, but girls who don't have a concept of fun will appreciate it, so I guess that's what they are going for quality. Although I can say how much, the first season is clearly better than the second. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: DO NOT WATCH ANYONE. <br /> <br /> My assessment: Terrible to show. TV G. 30 minutes.
