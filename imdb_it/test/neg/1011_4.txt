"Death Wish 3" is the cinematic equivalent of a shooting gallery. All the characters (apart from Bronson's Paul Kersey, of course) exist simply to be killed, either as "provocation" (the good guys) or as "punishment" (the bad guys). The director simply pours out senseless violence (people are even burned alive and blown up), turning this into an urban version of "Commando" (and Charlie, like Arnold, rarely worries about protecting himself from enemy gunshots). Fans of this short of things (and, apparently, there are many) will appreciate it, others ... be careful. (* 1/2)
