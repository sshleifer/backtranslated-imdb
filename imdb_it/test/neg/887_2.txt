In all honesty, I haven't seen this film in many years, but the few times I tend to be a part of it is in my memory, as anyone who has seen it will understand. I saw it for the first time as a child during a YMCA Halloween party in the early 1960s, and it scared us to death in a fun way. I remember feeling real anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze. I can't risk giving away the ending, except to say that it was surprising, to say the least. I vaguely remember the whole audience of young boys who gave a great scared shit, followed by a laugh when the terrible secret was revealed. The ending was seen by most viewers as one of the biggest, involuntarily funny, climaxes of a film in the history of cinema, yet strangely moving, in a sense. You have to see it for yourself, which is not easy these days. I don't know if it's available on home video or not, but it would still be a great Halloween feature for kids and adults.
