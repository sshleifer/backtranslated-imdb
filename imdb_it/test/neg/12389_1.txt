I find it puzzling that in an age where satisfying and satisfying spirituality is unknown and we are all scattered throughout the spectrum of possible beliefs, that it is a charlatan and a scam of the caliber of Gurdjieff (like a charlatan, he is exceptional, one cannot denying it had a special gift. It is a pity that he misused it, however, because the enlargement of his wounded ego, feeding on the adulation of reckless sheep that were at his complete disposal and in subjection to him) can inspire a such extreme adherence and credulity. This film presents an idealized version of Gurdjieff's largely fictitious and imaginative tale of his training and "awakening" (which I would rather describe as his discovery of how much he could influence the mind and will of certain kinds of sadly disoriented people). You see, if you dare to have an unpleasant eye on how sadly deprived we are of true religious leaders, to the extent that a clown like Gurdjieff could inspire such devotion - and be careful to keep your blood pressure at hand if I am one of those who still hope in a healthy religion to emerge from the ruins of Christianity, as a supreme example of cinematography to the whole service of the locals and claims of a dysfunctional cult.
