I give a 2, because of the beautiful Mediterranean Greece, otherwise it would be 1. When Nicholas Cage entered with his first lines, I thought he was just joking. Cage like an Italian ?? I'm sorry, but the very wrong actor who plays is also BAD, not to mention his Italian accent. The story is very slow, it may have been good, but with other actors and obviously with other scripts. The camera is fantastic, even photography, but why the hell did you choose Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz for the role. Please don't get me wrong, I have nothing against Cage, he has some really cool movies, but obviously it's not for every role. It's really a shame that the cast hasn't been set better, because the plot has potential.
