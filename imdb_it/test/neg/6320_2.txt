In the opening sequence of "Where's Poppa?", George Segal gets out of bed one morning, shaves, takes a shower, puts on a gorilla dress and goes to his mother's bedroom, we realize later , to give her a massive heart attack that will kill her and get her out of her life forever. This concerns the level of humor that can be expected from most of this image: madness, mixed with what could be considered a bold morbid. <br /> <br /> Segal plays a New York lawyer who lives with his supposedly senile mother (Ruth Gordon), whose life is further complicated when, while hiring a nurse to take care of the old bag, he meets the girl of his dreams, the pleasantly primitive Trish Van Devere, decked out like Florence Nightingale. His dilemma: how to integrate the adorable nurse into his and the annoying life of his mother. <br /> <br /> Segal's performance is the only thing that holds the image together. His frustrations, his reactions, his comic times are almost incomparable (whatever happened to that boy?); where the film fails is in other areas. The characterization of Ruth Gordon is as terrible as the mother. At the beginning, you can't tell if his character is senile or simply deliberately vague to prevent the child from moving. In the end, it is clear that she is simply mad. When Segal takes Van Devere home to meet her, Gordon's eyebrows rise and she takes on a nasty, sinister look. He wants the intruder in his son's life to be removed; she is calculating. This is not the mode of a senile person. There is no consistent performance throughout the image, which is probably as much the fault of the director (Carl Reiner) as much as that of Gordon. Ruth Gordon's old lady in "Rosemary Baby" is much more successful because with the kind of ungrateful and rude person that Ruth Gordon generally plays, the public responds as boring. But when Mia Farrow is too shy to fight back, Gordon gets more tired, his fangs dig deeper and deeper and we're afraid for Farrow; this kind of imposition is really terrifying. Here, we are asked to laugh at what we would normally find boring, and if Gordon interpreted it as an impotent core to the end, we could. But she is selfish and bad, and dampens the little humor there is. <br /> <br /> There are some good laughs though. The scene of a courtroom with Barnard Hughes as military officer and Rob Reiner as counter-culture punk is rather amusing, and Vincent Gardenia makes a nice breakthrough as a Lombard soccer coach. There is also an inspired piece in which Segal's brother (Ron Liebman), after being stripped naked by robbers on his way to Segal's house, asks him something to wear at home - and gives him the gorilla dress. <br /> <br /> But much of the script is ill-conceived and simply doesn't make sense. Why does a New York lawyer even live at home in the first place with his practice? Because Segal, if his mother is senile, tries to reason with her logically: "If you ruin him for me, I'll punch you in the heart." Why does Liebman continue to cut the park if he knows he will be robbed? Why take a taxi after leaving Segal in a gorilla dress? Why wasn't he taking taxis all the time? A little more fun would have been Liebman, like the gorilla, terrorizing the robbers. Why does Van Devere keep coming back, after her first husband was an idiot, why does she want to be involved with this group? I suppose if I put it to Carl Reiner, he'd say, "They're crazy, they don't make sense." Which is a convenient way to excuse a lousy script full of holes. The behavior of the moment from the moment of the characters may not make sense, but their motivations do it, and it is here "Where is Poppa?" It falls apart; situations are created just to have a gag, and gags are mostly one-shots, they don't build at all. <br /> <br /> Carl Reiner is the most guilty of all this fiasco. How he gained this fame boasted as a pillar of comedy embarrasses me; after all, his career has been to hold a microphone in front of Sid Caesar and Mel Brooks while talking with funny voices. His son Rob has ten times the skill and intelligence of a director. In show-biz terms, Reiner pushes the buttons; a monkey could do his job. And this is more evident in his definition of action. Because all of New York is in the foreground and in the foreground, but are the scenes in the country all distant and panoramic? This is the mentality of director Carl Reiner, claustrophobic for the city, spatial for the country. In the last lunatic scene at the old people's house, the camera is so far away, you can't even understand what's going on. The abrupt ending suggests a resolution that Segal could easily reach ninety minutes ago; it also suggests that Reiner could not figure out how to finish the image. So he just cut it, like another example of "madness". Reiner seems to think that mute is the same as madness, and logical madness is always fun. It is not, and the creators of "Where's Poppa" are as demented as Ruth Gordon who puts Pepsi in her Fruit Loops.
