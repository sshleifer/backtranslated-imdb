Being a fan of hospital and medical shows, I found this compelling and sometimes amusing (especially the scenes with Dr. Whitman) that brings some light. However, I was looking forward to the last episode because I expected the bad guys to be punished and the good ones restored. Instead of this, the hospital management is making it even more crazy than themselves in an incredible way and it's getting worse and worse for the good ones. Can't you help wondering what the unions are doing or Rob, Donna and Maria don't know what the unions are for? Moreover, by never seeing the outside, the trees, the grass, the sunlight is a bit overwhelming. Has anyone understood what the last words were? that is the answer that Rob Lake gave to the question of Mrs. Strawberry's children "Why are you telling us all this?" It was very frustrating not being able to understand him.
