I was wondering when someone would try to turn that whole mess of Matamoros into a gorepornata photo. Anyroad, here are some things I learned from Mexico watching this movie. <br /> <br /> ~ All Mexican women are super hot - Remember that little deserted town in Unearthed? Yes, well, it must be the Mexican sister city. Don't even worry about prostitutes, just put some smooth moves on the hot bartender. It will be just as exciting as prostitutes and probably has no children! <br /> <br /> ~ Half of Mexico is controlled by crowd cultists from Palo Mayombe who worship Satan. Ay, caramba! The other half, as everyone knows here in the United States, is run by drug dealers. Fortunately, this does not interfere much with the tourisim sex trade and our ultra-low-wage factories over there. <br /> <br /> ~ Mexican cops are useless. Don't go to them. Go to the nearest hidden book store and ask the chick behind the counter what happened to your missing friend. It will be much more helpful than the cops. <br /> <br /> ~ When you are macabre tortured by these bloodthirsty cultists, don't recite the psalms or any other part of the Bible, really. You'll ruin your mojo.
