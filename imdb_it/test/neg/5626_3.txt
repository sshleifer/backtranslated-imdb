Let Freedom Ring be made with the best intentions, but send a curious mixed message into the final product. <br /> <br /> People in a western city where the railway is coming are overwhelmed by the arrival of workers from the immigrant railways, working on the railway that is financed by baron robber Edward Arnold. There are some farmers and farmers whose land is on the railroad track and these people are treated summarily by the men hired by Arnold. A man who does not give up is Lionel Barrymore, whose son is returning home to a Harvard lawyer and ready to take the cause of the rancher. <br /> <br /> Only Nelson Eddy decides that the best way to fight is to go to Zorro on the bad guys. But apart from Charles Butterworth, no one knows it's Wasp (a very interesting choice of names, by the way). <br /> <br /> What Arnold did is used the tried and true methods of the political leaders of the east, making immigrants vote. Nelson's idea is simple, if immigrants only know the truth about what a bad Arnold is, they will vote with the original settlers and knock the alien urban political machine into their midst. He kidnaps newspaper publisher Raymond Walburn and brings him and the press to a mountain cave where some subversive newspapers are printed and distributed. <br /> <br /> Railway workers are a real mixed group of immigrants, not the Irishman working in the west or the Chinese working in the east like history has it. It's a real United Nations working on the Arnold railway. The workers are kept in line by the master builder Victor McLaglen and Nelson has the unenviable task of defeating a little sense in him like John Wayne in The Quiet Man. <br /> <br /> Of all the films that they played with Jeanette and Nelson and they definitely went down in history as a duo, this was the worst of what they did to MGM. Nelson is going to be hanged along with Barrymore for crimes that at best are not defined, but certainly not worth hanging. And Virginia Bruce, who plays Nelson's girlfriend, saves the day with a surrender of My Country Tis of Thee with which immigrants unite. Faced with a revolt by his immigrant voters, Arnold packages himself rationally and leaves the city to build his railroad somewhere else. <br /> <br /> No kidding, this is the ending here. What's the message, vote with the settlers and lose your job with Arnold? But somehow will you go from here? <br /> <br /> I sometimes wonder if 20 years later the incidents of this film take place and the city has settled in a quiet stagnation of the west, while some cities where the railway has passed are now cities that good citizens of that city did not think back to what Nelson Eddy did. If they did, they will probably run it. <br /> <br /> Nelson is obviously in good shape and has a variety of concerts and popular pieces to sing including a ballad for immigrants written by Sigmund Romberg, where else but here. The song is a tribute heard by an immigrant who did well in his adopted country. Too bad he didn't have a better venue. <br /> <br /> The almost platinum blonde Virginia Bruce I am sure is nicknamed here. And I'm sure Jeanette MacDonald was just as happy not to have accompanied Nelson on this journey to the west.
