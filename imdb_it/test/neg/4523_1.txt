I've never seen the previous TV series or movies. That's probably why I didn't like it very much. Boring and simply not fun, it sums it up well. <br /> <br /> Considering the budget the film seems to have, it's embarrassing that they can't do a job that is also passable. <br /> <br /> We went to the cinema without exception and hoped to see a movie that was a bit funny and not too strenuous for the mind. My friend fell asleep in the middle of the film and I spend the next 2 hours hoping he will finally recover. A hope, which died with the credits.
