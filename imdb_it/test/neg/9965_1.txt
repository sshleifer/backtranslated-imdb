This must be the most terrible piece of cinematic shit I've ever seen. By comparison, Mel Brooks' films are worthy of an Oscar. Jim VanBebber needs to be slapped publicly for trying to get all of this into ANY form of entertainment. <br /> <br /> While some may say that this film is true to the low-budget genre of classics such as "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" "or" The night of the living dead ", the value of production is not in question. "VanBebber's ability to present and present a plausible plot. The casting is regrettable. For the role of Charlie, he must have chosen the first actor he saw with a beard and long hair. It doesn't matter that this actor's hair comes in the middle of his back, (Manson never went far beyond his shoulders) this actor spoke in a hideous monotone without even a fraction of the personality that Steve Railsback or even Jeremy Davies lent to their portraits of Manson. The actor chosen to perform " Tex "Watson had curly blond hair instead of straight, dark hair, a fact that anyone who has shown even the most remote interest in the Manson case knows. He looks like a Minnesota farmer in" Little House on the Prairie " The actress who plays Susan Atkins has a wider ass than Oprah, while those familiar with Family members know that "Clem" was considered a bit retarded, the actor who portrays him did it in Era one way so rural and chaplinian to look at an old Vaudevile act. Instead of Sharon Tate, who looks like a beautiful pregnant woman, the actress looked like a junk stuff that was alcoholic and bloated. VanBebber accelerates the shooting in some places for artistic effect, but this technique has not proved entirely useful from "The Munsters". The credits list all known members of the family, but we have never been introduced to most of them and those to whom we have been introduced are not sure who they are sometimes. <br /> <br /> The facts are also destroyed in this film. "Lotsapoppa" didn't die in real life, Steven Parent was killed four times, not twice, Abagail Folger didn't have his throat, where were Mary Brunner and Bruce Davis during Himnan's murder? Patricia Krenwinkel never sported a "Dorothy Hamill" hairstyle. <br /> <br /> The most disconcerting aspect of this film is what the "freaks" of modern times have had to do with this film? Why did the girl wear a rubber mask with a dildo attached? What was their problem with the journalist? What was the meaning or purpose of the final battle? Why were they included, period? The viewer never knows! <br /> <br /> Holy Mackerel, I could go on forever, but space prevents it. Don't try to eat popcorn during this garbage because your hand will be too busy scratching your head while repeating over and over, "What f ---?"
