The only good thing this film has created is that it has made me hungry for ice cream, without the parts of my body dead. The film is one of the poorest I've seen in a long time. When the "Ice Cream King" dies at the beginning, I was laughing so hard because the boy took the ice cream and started eating it. His mother asked him to say something and he should have said "Leave me alone and let me eat ice cream for free, so I can see my acting career go down the drain at a young age". Sounds right for a sentence. Then I wondered why the ice cream prince was behind the bars of his truck. Would anyone have robbed him of his twenty cents? I've never seen bars on an ice cream window. He looked pretty stupid. You might even forget acting because it's just awful. Forget this movie and go to the queen of the dairy and get an ice cream.
