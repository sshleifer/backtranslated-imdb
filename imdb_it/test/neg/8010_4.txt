Years ago "MA2412" the film tried to be a sort of "regional blockbuster" in Austria. One thing is certain: I hope no one outside will ever see this. Perhaps if you are familiar with the original sitcom it might be interesting to see what the Sicheritz director did in his series. I think he lost his chance and lost time and money. <br /> <br /> So far many directors and screenwriters have failed to make a standard concept compatible with a 90-minute movie (consider Alf, Inspector Gadget ...). You can see how difficult it is by looking at "MA 2412". The result of this attempt in my opinion has the flavor of an endless (and not good) television episode. It fails to provide a plot, humor strives too much and the direction seems very fuzzy - as is true of the visual style. <br /> <br /> So to summarize clearly I would not recommend this ...
