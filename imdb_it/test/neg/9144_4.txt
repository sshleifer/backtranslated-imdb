This is the answer. The question is: what is the only reason to watch this movie? I loved it in "My Name Is Julia Ross". This is one of the best noir films of all time. Noir or whatever you can call, is a very shocking film. <br /> <br /> It's fun even in one of the worst major studio versions of all time. That would be "The Guilt Of Janet Ames". This has a spooky and promising title. He has a good cast. He has a good director. I was expecting something dark. Maybe something a little gaudy. Instead, it is a routine, uninspired spy film. It's practically a bore. At least it was for me. Mrs. Foch is endearing. And that's it.
