The concept of this film is unique, however its execution is less than special. When I arrived at the cinema and realized that there were only about 15 people in the crowd, I thought I had made a mistake. However the real mistake was made in shocking details when the film ended and I knew I had wasted two hours of my life. Without the cruel recordings of the old man, and the stupidly amusing friend, this movie would have voted 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> This film is special, special because it is probably the worst movie ever released on public. <br /> <br /> There is also the question of whether you can call a movie or just an advertisement for the "Northwestern" probably poor. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking of watching this movie for the plot, the humor, the filming, the movie positions, then don't do it. On the other hand, if you like to experiment with both aspects of the film's production spectra then go, get a book, or a little game or just some novelty.
