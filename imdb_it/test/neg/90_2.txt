The only reason this film doesn't have a grade 1 (horrible) is that the acting of both Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan is superb. Ida Lupino, who is adorable, as usual, becomes increasingly upset as she searches for various ways to get rid of a madman. Robert Ryan is terrifying as the threatening stranger whose character, guided only by his disturbed mind, changes from one minute to another. Seemingly simple and docile, it suddenly becomes intelligent and threatening. Mrs. Lupino's character was more dangerous than the house she lived in and her stupidity than anyone who had arrived. He couldn't get out of his house: the windows didn't open, both front and rear doors locked and unlocked from the inside with a key. You couldn't have designed a worse fire trap if you tried. He did not take the precaution of also having an extra key. Nor could he figure out how to ask neighbors for help or get out of his basement while he was locked in and out of sight of his captor. I don't know in which war her husband was killed, but if it was the second world war, the furnishings of his house, the styles of the clothes, in particular the children and the machine of the telephone company repairer are clearly anachronistic. I recommend watching this movie just to see what oddities you can find.
