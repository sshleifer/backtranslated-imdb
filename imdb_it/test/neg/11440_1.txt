WOW, I'd hate to be a commentator, but anyone who has rated this film higher than me must have an IQ. that reaches unimaginably low depths that go beyond time and space and connect to the "Hopper-is-a-retard-for-making-this-movie" planet. WOW this movie STANK. Fred Ward's haircut looks like SSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPIIIDDD! In fact, I considered sending money to Fred Ward for that miserable haircut he had in this horrible movie. Jodie Foster obviously didn't have much to work with, but continues to run a terrible performance. Joe Pesci, oh my ... Joe Pesci (who is mysteriously not the cast) plays the character of Joe Pesci's stereotyped movie, the outfit, with mass killings and constant use of the word F. You won't believe your eyes. Dean Stockwell, watching him in this mess made me feel bad for him because I thought he was either intoxicated or temporarily delayed during the film. Jon Turturro must have been intoxicated by himself when he agreed to be a part of this, along with Vincent Price, Bob Dylan and Charlie Sheen. I know what you're thinking, BIG CAST! I know, and it was the WORST BIG movie cast I've ever seen. Dennis Hopper directs and stars, and does equally badly in both areas. How the man could have run EASY RIDER and then this is FAR beyond my excellent imagination. His accent of character OUTRAGEOUSLY bad-man is beyond the kingdoms of horrendous, and is only equaled by the hilariously evil ending. They (Hopper and Foster) are the most disinterested couple that I believe I have ever seen in my exposure to the world of cinema, and you will be rooting for them to lose and then be enormously crazy from the end. Which are exactly the two of which WEAR in that action full of conclusions? I don't know, but I know that if I ever meet Dennis Hopper, I'll tease him immensely to be responsible for this celluloid waste. Join me! IAN
