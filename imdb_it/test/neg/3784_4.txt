If Corky St. Claire in WAITING FOR GUFFMAN had directed Blaine's citizens in a horror movie with comic subtitles, the result would have been very similar to THE MILPITAS MONSTER. <br /> <br /> To be generous, this was the longest one-hour and twenty-minute film I've ever seen. Defining the glacial rhythm means being kind. <br /> <br /> Almost no one associated with this project has ever made another film with the exception of Ben Burtt, who made the really special admirable effects (considering the budget). He continued to make sound for films like MONACO and several other big budget projects. The narrative is by veteran Paul Frees, who probably donated his efforts. <br /> <br /> When you look at the opening titles and see the unified Milpitas school district listed among the producers you know You're going on a long and strange journey. <br /> <br /> Pollution in the Milpitas landfill, in California, becomes so toxic that it creates a monster. Remember that this is 1975 and ecology has been a hot topic. Only a few years before the spectators had been treated for GODZILLA VS. THE SMOG MONSTER. <br /> <br /> So far so good. The monster is a winged creature at least fifty feet tall and has the ability to destroy the city. Instead he steals trash cans. <br /> <br /> At the center of the premise is the idea that this monster may be lurking in a small town and leaving eight-foot-long tracks behind, but not be noticed by anyone. There is a well-designed scene where you walk during the carnival at night but somehow no one notices. <br /> <br /> The only person who sees the monster to the final scenes is George, the drunken city. The whole movie I was hoping, I hoped, I was hoping that George would have been torn to shreds by the camera, but it didn't happen. Drat. In reality, nobody is killed. George is supposed to sacrifice himself to save Priscilla (he's tied to a helicopter to lure the creature - George smells worse than trash and the monster is attracted to the scent). <br /> <br /> The nominal leads are a group of high school students. There is the beautiful Priscilla and her anonymous boyfriend and some "bad" guys who (surprise, surprise) get in shape to help defeat the monster in the final scenes. <br /> <br /> The monster is involved in four main pieces. He attacks a Browning-Ferris garbage truck and leaves it next to an elevated highway, but nobody notices. Walk through the carnival, again unnoticed. He tears a building (a nice miniature work) and no one sees him except George. Then he attacks the school during a dance and grabs Priscilla and takes her away like a certain very tall monkey did several times, the last time last winter. <br /> <br /> There are ideas for the plot that come out of nowhere and have fallen. Local citizens beat at the town hall because they want to get their garbage cans back. A secret weapon designed to track down monsters has flown by a private, examined and forgotten jet. <br /> <br /> So why did I look at everything? Because these people were having so much fun. I had the idea that firefighters were firefighters, that businessmen were turned in their offices, Priscilla could live well in that suburban home, and scenes of people on their sites might have been on their yards. <br /> <br /> They may not be great actors, but they are real people. No one is extraordinarily beautiful. In fact, I would estimate that four out of five of the adults on the screen wear glasses. Since this is the mid-seventies we see some really bad clothes and some of the men have incredibly bad facial hair. A dignitary interviewed before a Ciry Hall meeting has a tie and a jacket so strong that you think he is on the way to playing Marcellus in THE MUSIC MAN. <br /> <br /> And this gave the film two more stars. Zero for the story. Two points for sometimes decent special effects. And two points for the fact that the people in the community actually got together and did it. They can actually say that they performed in a movie; despite so much theatrical experience and working behind the scenes on live television, I can't say, and I'm happy for them. <br /> <br /> Do you remember those great old movies with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland? At some point someone would say, "Let's do a show! Aunt Edna has all those old clothes in the attic and we can use Uncle Ned's barn!" So they would do "neighborhood shows" with sets and costumes that would cost seven digits if duplicated today. <br /> <br /> This is the spirit that the good people of Milpitas have had for this project and bless them for that.
