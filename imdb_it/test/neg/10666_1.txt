I have been watching films for 10 years, I think, and I must say that I have never felt so bad, that I felt after seeing this film of great boredom, it was ugly, very bad. There were songs and songs. No one should watch this movie. The director showed that the Germans speak English and that it is so lousy. The Germans do not speak English and in one scene there was a white girl who asked Himesh for the autograph. (It is necessary that he gave some money to her) In the promotion they showed they are preparing for the Laughing uprising. But I could say that there was only one scene in which Himesh laughed for no reason, he can think it's funny. Hansika is very good. she is like an angel. But too young, only 16 years old. If you have a lot of time and don't know what to do, you should watch this movie or waste money
