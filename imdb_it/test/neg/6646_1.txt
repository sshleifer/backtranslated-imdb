I saw this movie but not in one sitting. What happens that you play on TV, I watch for a few minutes, I find that I have taken everything I can take and then leave the room. During those few minutes I don't laugh once, I don't feel any pleasure in what I'm looking at, and I find myself more depressed than angry. It is interesting to note that psychological states are incompatible, that is, one cannot be angry and depressed at the same time. This film tests this theory. <br /> <br /> I think part of the problem is that I spent almost ten years in Chicago, just as I'm watching the scenes I'm thinking about my experiences in that rotten city and so I'm clearly bringing a lot of my luggage to the piece . It is quite possible, I am willing to concede, that if you are not a Chicago resident, you will find the funny piece. If so, I envy you. <br /> <br /> Yet. John Hughes made his films in Chicago and those films worked for me. I think the difference is that Hughes was a first-rate writer. I think it's obvious that he knew how to balance his situations comically, as well as make his characters both understanding and credible. In a comedy (distinct from a farce) this vital balance. And it's not easy to reach. If everyone was making great movies and we shouldn't worry about how we do in the real world to ask ourselves when genius will ever appear. In "Adventures in Babysitting", this is not the case. I hated those characters <br /> <br /> There is a difference, deep and real, between sympathy and simply pathetic. <br /> <br /> For me, every scene in this film is a clunker. There is no humor, humanity, people that can be recognized. Only actors who read their lines as if they could do everything they could to prevent themselves from shouting at them, certain that in the end the hilarity will ensue, this time for sure! It's like watching the antics of very bad comedians. It's embarrassing and after a while, usually the moment I get up and leave, I start to feel pity for everyone involved, which is kind of an emotional connection, I suppose. Elizabeth Shue is terrible. She does not act, certainly does not act comically, and it is quite possible that she cannot do it. But sir, he tries. He is over 17 years old and behaves as a young man like a seven-year-old girl engaged in a certain school play that this is how you get a prize. And she is not alone. It's like everyone can't relax and let the story flow. As if everyone simply had no idea what they were doing. <br /> <br /> Now, this was an initial effort for Chris Columbus and clearly would improve and having better writers (eg John Hughes himself) certainly helped, so maybe a little bit of forgiveness is a must. But the film smacks of despair. And yet, as I said, it could work for some. If any of the aforementioned appeals to you, and clearly did some of the reviewers, then go get the DVD and get thrown out. Otherwise, avoid this mess as if you were a dark alley in Chicago where, as you hurry, you can only see shadows and hear murmured threats.
