I did it in the middle of the film, and at that point I realized that I really didn't care how it ended. It's basically a bland teenage comedy that I've only seen because I like Helen Mirren, who is actually very good as an incredibly cruel teacher. <br /> <br /> The basic idea of ​​the film (or let's say the first half of the film, since I don't know - or I care - how did the second part of the film go, first, especially in 9- 5, and a comparison of the two shows how wrong Tingle is. You have to feel that things are failing out of control in a way that makes you feel inevitable events, and you need well-defined and interesting characters that you care about, and You don't have this, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it never grabbed me for a second.
