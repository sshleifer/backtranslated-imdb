this show is very nice and fun to watch, it's a great Disney Channel show and sometimes fun. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the first season, but I hated the second and third season. This show has completely changed around. In the first season it was more about science and animals, all that went into the season and the third season. It's more about his life and encounters. Since that gay guy arrived (Ben), this show sucked. The writers made a wonderful show for children and turned it into a crappy comedy for teenagers. Disney has taken a bad turn. I can no longer watch the latest episodes, they are all junk.
