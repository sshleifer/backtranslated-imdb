It's really a shame to see so many talented people involved in what is a real waste of talent. The plot is clich√©. The director is too aware and the characters are almost caricatures. One of the most disappointing aspects of this film is the performance by Gerard Depardieu in the English version (this film was shot in French and English at the same time). Although he is one of the best actors in the film, he gives the worst performance of all of them. I must say that Bianca Gervais came very close even though ... <br /> <br /> On a more positive note I must say that the newcomer Juliette Gosselin offers an exceptional performance in both versions. Unfortunately that one good thing I remember from this movie ... <br /> <br /> By the way, I have to apologize for my not so good English ...
