The Other Boleyn Girl - not to be confused with the book on which he claims to be based. This film is not even close to a faithful adaptation. I could understand them by changing or processing some things. The book is not perfect, but it was well written and became very popular. I could understand if the BBC wanted to make this a little more faithful to what really happened, who Anne Boleyn really was - but it's not even close to being historically accurate. It's just a stuffed animal. Senseless fluff, made-up. Such a pity. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the writer and director thought it was a good idea to set the story as if it were a reality show. Seriously. They have the Boleyn sitting in front of the camera, confessing how they REALLY feel about what's going on in their lives. Anne Boleyn sits in a confessional (not the church type, the Real World type) and chooses what she wants to say and who just wants to sit and smile. It seems silly to have to use such a modern cinema device in a 1500s movie set. It's "The Real World: Tudor England!" <br /> <br /> Jodhi May is a very good actress and after "The aristocrats" and "A turn of the screw" I was becoming a real fan of her. But it should never have been interpreted as Anne. Actually I think it would have been a better Maria. Natascha McElhone was the wrong choice. She is a good actress, of course, but she has very modern characteristics and does not seem convincing in period costume. (Honestly, I spent the first half of the film trying to figure out if it was "that girl" from "The Truman Show." It was.) She's too old to play Mary as a teenager, so for some unknown reason she made Maria the bigger than the sisters. It doesn't make sense, I know. It's like the BBC seems to forget that these people actually lived. They are twisting the story and arranging things right and left. I feel ridiculous about having to correct the BBC on historical inaccuracies, but REALLY! <br /> <br /> In addition to the two sisters, the rest of the cast was very well chosen. Steven Mackintosh struck me as a brilliant choice for George, and his casting was the real reason why I decided to look for this movie. Big mistake. He does a great job, of course, but he can't. How can anyone pretend to adapt The Other Boleyn Girl and barely mention George Boleyn? It is simply absurd. Philip Glenister was another great casting decision, but again, it was almost out of the finished product. <br /> <br /> The real problem with this is the script. There is no way around this. It's bad. It's really, really bad. It's too melodramatic and not engaging. Anne is depicted as a head of air, Maria as ringleader and George as a follower. Mary's first husband is just mentioned, her relationship with the king is never explained - it simply does not tell the story written by Phillippa Gregory. Everything looks like a great waste. I do not wish to see this a second time. I think I'll just have to read the book again and hope that the release of Natalie Portman coming out next year will be much better. <br /> <br /> * Note: at the time of writing, the only way to get this miniseries in the United States is on the last record of the miniseries "The Six Wives of Henry VIII". It's a fantastic miniseries, but it can cost from $ 50 to $ 60 and that's the way to spend a lot if you're looking for this piece of junk.
