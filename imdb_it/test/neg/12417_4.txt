"Wild Rebels" was probably a second hilarious movie in a triple movie 40 years ago. It has not aged very well, but it has never been thought to age well; it was obviously destined to be disposable, forgettable fun since its inception. Taken at that level, it's a good example of the kind of biker movie. <br /> <br /> Different elements help to distinguish it from dozens of similar films that are baked at the same time. The 'hero', 'Rod Tillman' (Steve Alaimo) stands out as an insignificant 'Everyman' - he is not particularly brave, tenacious, talented, or handsome (although he wins a fight with a member of a biker gang halfway movie, and the girl's gang member chooses to help him get past his band mate at the end of the movie). The soundtrack is pretty well done, with a nice riff of low style and "Ventures" style that keeps things moving and saxophones and brass graphics that make things stand out a bit. And even if the script is rather superficial, all the actors live their cardboard characters convincingly and with a good dose of energy. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of careless technical gaffes: terrible "day by night" scenes that occur in broad daylight, screaming tires in a swamp, fire sirens mistakenly blocked on the soundtrack instead of sirens of the police, a bank sign made of adhesive tape on a ceiling panel, a Luger that sounds like a Winchester 30-06, rifle shots that cut people down 100 meters away, a detective who kills a motorcyclist on a 3rd floor landing from the ground with a gun with a 2-inch barrel. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of extravagant elements: Linda (gang member) deactivates a bank guard with a syringe full of drugs, the final shooting takes place inside a lighthouse (!) , police checkpoints don't actually block roads, apparently the police never heard of ducking, and police officers apparently never heard of planting insects or having their boyfriend undercover ring a wire. <br /> <br /> But the plot comes forward, the cameraman knows what he's doing, the pace in most of the scenes is pretty good, and there are some nice, zippy one liners and dialogue exchanges here and there that keep the energy level high. (My favorite: "Friend, you're kidding with private actions!" (Ex. Linda) "So no, don't look for this or anything, but if a copy of the MST version falls into your hands, you should have some fun good and superficial to watch it. Vastly superior to "Five the Hard Way" or "The Hellcats" or even "Girl In Gold Boots" (three more films on the MST counterculture).
