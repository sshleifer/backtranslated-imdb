From watching the trailer, the film looked pretty interesting. The production of the film is also pretty good: they seem to have a good budget and it doesn't look like a cheap movie. The acting ranges from the good (Joe Morton as Professor Simon) to OK (Kelly Overton as Eve) to evil (James Haven as Don). <br /> <br /> The content and the plot of the film are weak. The film begins as it could become interesting and ends with a poorly executed, disappointing and boring twist. Watching the first 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes of the film would have made this film OK, but this makes this film absolutely boring to watch. It is as if they had made a short film, then they tried to force him to spend more than an hour filling the center with an hour of filling. <br /> <br /> If you want to waste a good hour and half of your life, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay away from this extremely boring movie.
