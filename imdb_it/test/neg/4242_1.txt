Playmania is extremely boring. This is the basis of the show. Mel or Shandi make extremely easy questions that a 2-year-old could respond at an extremely slow pace. This show lasts 2 hours and will probably only play 10 games during that time. People might appreciate this show because the hosts are fanciful eyes, but their hotness is completely destroyed by the fact that they are so annoying. <br /> <br /> During the show they say we need more players a million times. The first 5 surveys they do probably take around 20 minutes from the show. This show is probably one of the worst game shows ever made. One of the reasons they probably don't have callers is because the show is so cheap with money. The most money I've ever seen was $ 210. I wouldn't be surprised if this "game show" was canceled by the end of 2006.
