The beginning was decent; the ending was fine. <br /> <br /> Sadly, this film suffers from total and total superficiality of characters, unrealistic comparisons / fight scenes, lack of someone intelligent outside the shuttle. This makes a mediocre script. <br /> <br /> Things to look for: overly obvious foreshadows, rapid healing cuts, excessively smoky fires, amusing seat belts, delayed reactions. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 4, not a 0, because the beginning of the film had some elements of happiness and a development of the basic character. The relationship between the main girl, the dark-haired girl and her girlfriend is treated briefly, and the placement of the blonde friend's impact on that relationship is present, albeit in an embarrassing way. The discovery activity in the end is becoming more mainstream and decently concluded, although, as another commentator pointed out, it is not unexpected. <br /> <br /> ~ viper ~
