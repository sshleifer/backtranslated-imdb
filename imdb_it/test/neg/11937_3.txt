I had high hopes for this film when I saw the listing and decided to watch it on TV, without commercial breaks. I liked Lee Van Cleef in many films, but I fear that the fact that the other characters call him Chris repeatedly does not turn him into a reasonable facsimile of Chris of Yul Brenner. <br /> <br /> I found this the film a complete disappointment - the soundtrack of the music tried to convey the magnificence portrayed in the original but failed to bring the film to the standard of the original. The plots rich in characters in the original were mostly missing from this film. I guess if you didn't see the original it would be okay. Too many clich√©s and too little depth for the characters. I lost humanity and compassion and the three-dimensional characters of the original.
