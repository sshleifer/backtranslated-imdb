Perhaps the time has come to declare 2007 "The International Year of the Cinema Crocodile"! The ridiculous "Primeval" came first, on a croc named Gustave (!) Who ruled the marshes in Burundi. Then there was "Lake Placid 2", a low-profile sequel made for the TV of an original that forgets. Third, there is this incredibly derivative and soporific piece of Australian horror and, finally, I have yet to see the promising "Rogue". The last one is probably the best, considering the involvement of the next Australian horror talent Greg McLean ("Wolf Creek"). "Black Water" is certainly not a complete waste of time and films, but it is another rather pointless survival blow that confuses the agony of real life with horror. Forgive my frankness, above all because I honestly feel sorry for the people who have gone through this test, but painting three characters sitting on a tree and whining for more than an hour is not my idea of ​​pure suspense! Three young people travel through northern Australia and decide to spend a day fishing in the remote areas of the marsh. It doesn't take long before a giant and fierce crocodile capsizes their boat and devours the guide. Grace, Lee and Adam can barely escape the reptile's hungry teeth as they climb a tree. Even though it remains invisible most of the time, the crocodile is patiently waiting and makes it impossible for them to leave the swamp alive. Yes, it really looks very similar to the "Open Water" plot. Replace the numerous invisible sharks with a gigantic invisible crocodile and the open sea with an Australian marsh just as inescapable, and that's it. Oh well, "Black Water" features at least some rare moments of excitement and an awesome water design monster. It must be said that the crocodile looks fabulous and anxiously counts down every time it emerges wildly from the water. The three-headed cast does everything they can to keep their characters interesting, but how do you do that while sitting on a tree all the time? The concept based on real events obviously causes a series of restrictions, such as the limited images of the fantastic shooting locations, the dialogues and the drawings of lovable characters.
