This is not a good movie according to a standard. It is very badly written and the acting is just a little above average (some performances are well below average, but Swayze and Gray do a great job with little to work with). <br /> <br /> What was good: <br /> <br /> The dance sequences were very well choreographed and, as mentioned above, Swayze and Gray were the best points. <br /> <br /> What was wrong: <br /> <br /> The script. The "bad guys" were simply too evil to be credible. The best villains are those who are not so obviously bad. These guys (the grandson of the owner, the waiter who imbues the girl) do and say NOTHING that would let me believe they could be real people (maybe there are guys like them, but I certainly don't want to see a movie about it). <br /> <br /> Another scene, the first in which Gray and Swayze meet when the resort's employees are "dancing". Swayze and Gray dance together and seem to have fun. The next time they meet, Swayze is hostile to her. Why? What happened in the meantime to make him disapprove of it when they danced well together? <br /> <br /> And some of those lines, I mean HOW TO COME (I shuddered at the end when Swayze muttered the joke "No one puts a child in the corner". How come he has ever done this with a straight face. <br /> <br /> Something else wrong, the setting of the 1960s. Everyone looked and dressed like the 80s! Who was responsible for the costumes and hairstyles? <br /> <br /> The music (the original music for the film) was ridiculous (with the exception of "I Had the Time of My Life" which was a good song). <br /> <br /> It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but certainly the most overrated
