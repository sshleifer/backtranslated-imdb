Watching this film, several words come to mind: "sophomoric", "ridiculous", "unlikely", "self-indulgent" and finally (and fatally) "boring". The film, poorly directed, poorly photographed and misinterpreted, is a mess confused with the lines of the plot (if you can call them that) that turn in all directions. Someone may have used a painting of a five-year-old finger as a model. As a punishment for this childish movie crime, this "star" cast should be spanked and sent to their respective beds without dinner. . All in all, it seems that George needed an excuse to get together with his little friends for a paid summer vacation and we are the suckers who pay for it. Bad George! Bad!
