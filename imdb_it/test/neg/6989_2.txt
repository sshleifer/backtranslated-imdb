If the films in which the characters of virtual reality come to life and they are all two tough guys or a pleasure for female eyes, this film might not be a total waste of films. Needless to say, the vast majority of people will find this a real bore, with little acting talent and even less script. Yes, Athena Massey is nice to look at, but that's the only positive thing I can say about this disaster.
