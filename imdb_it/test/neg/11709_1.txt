This film was included on the DVD of the six wives miniseries of Henry VIII of the BBC. I loved those six movies. They were well recited, well scripted and historically accurate. I read Gregory's book and liked it enough, despite the HUGE historical inaccuracies (I mean the whole homosexual fiction with George Boleyn in particular), but this film didn't even mention this. That corner was one of the cornerstones of the book. <br /> <br /> Above all, this film leaves me wondering "WHY?" Why do we see, as someone else rightly puts it, "The Real World: Tudor England"? Why are camera angles so bad in general? <br /> <br /> Why is the script so ugly? I mean, I know he was improvised, but come on! Actors currently stutter and stutter on their lines and it is obvious that they are inventing them as they go along. <br /> <br /> Why are sex scenes so embarrassing? The way they were made in the book made them at least somehow interesting. In the film they are just bad, almost shameful. At one point, the actress who played Mary Boleyn was having sex with the actor who played Henry VIII. He is pushing away and he has this look on his face that says "Hm .... Do I have to go to the store, is he still done? Maybe if it ends, I can go and get some cheese very quickly ..." simply bad. <br /> <br /> Why does Catherine of Aragon have such a small role in this film? His refusal to divorce was one of the main causes of the scandal that shook Christianity. This is why Henry VIII and Anna Bolena could not marry immediately. Why isn't she present here? Overall, this film is just bad.
