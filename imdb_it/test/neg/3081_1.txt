From what I remember seeing this movie, it wasn't good. I always say that if a film is good and can attract attention in the most difficult moments (for example: a war by Tylenol Cold & Sinus) rather than a film that has done its job. The fact that I was sleeping for most of this film shows that he couldn't keep my attention, and ergo, he didn't complete his work. Why did I fall victim to Tylenol Cold & Sinus when I had a film in my arsenal? <br /> <br /> To begin with, Committed made no sense. The acting was poor and the general story left more doors open that could not be closed. I'm thinking of the moment when I swear I saw Affleck and Graham (brother and sister in this movie) kissing. It didn't make any sense. Then there was a scene with Affleck and his roommates indicating that he was sleeping with one of them, almost destroying a perfect lesbian couple. I suppose this was to show that most are not engaged in a relationship like Graham, but for me it was nothing but filler. I have a suspicious feeling that the director of this movie slept with Affleck. His acting in this film was atrocious. I mean, I've never seen him play "well," but this was by far the worst. Oh, I just had another moment during the battle that came to mind and I confirmed it with IMDb.com ... what was John Stewart doing in this movie? This was yet another moment when my eyes were only opened for a moment in one of those battles that seemed to last forever. <br /> <br /> And frankly, it's Heather Graham - we could care less about her after a while. It's not interesting - it's just bland, boring and basically stops acting after a while. While they are desperately starting to throw extravagant characters into the mix to revive the movie, it doesn't work and instead of just calling it a day - they start throwing more characters into the mix so now it's just weird, boring, boring and really, really long Luke Wilson's slow slows down an already creeping film to a stop - why exactly did these two get married? Committed is a really terrible film - the kind of "comedy of the hip" that lets you wobble depressed and bored. <br /> <br /> Vote: * on *****
