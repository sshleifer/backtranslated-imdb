I'm a gang / gangland movie suck, so I rented this movie. This film is a complete train disaster. With all the great actors in the film, I can't believe how bad it was. It was so bad that I started laughing hysterically towards the end of the film. The actor, better known as Zues or the great guy in the Ice Cube movie "Friday", does an incredible superb job throughout the film. The first thing I said to Blockbuster when I returned the film was to remove this garbage from their shelves. Don't rent this movie unless you want to waste two hours of your life. If they come out with a sequel, I wonder if it will be twice the first. I will be more cautious when I rent the so-called "mob / gangland" films.
