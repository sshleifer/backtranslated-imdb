Wow, I haven't seen a movie so bad since "Fire Down Below". Wait, this is also a Seagal movie. Like "On Deadly Ground" and "Fire Down Below", Seagal centers the film around its environmental awareness message and how the military, FBI and CIA are incompetent idiots. The problem is that both reality and a sensible storyline are secondary to any deceptive social commentary that Seagal is trying to overcome.
