This is really a waste of time. I'd probably prefer to watch documentaries besides this one; it's really so ugly. <br /> <br /> Acting is really terrible, and you can say that the producers have a low budget due to the terrible quality of the image. It is by far the lowest of the scale; don't waste your money on this. <br /> <br /> I really find it hard to believe that the person who made this film would have gone well. I had to watch it with the kids when my mother rented it because she thought it would be nice for the kids. Even the children (3, 4, 6 and 8) all thought it was rather boring. <br /> <br /> I agree with the other commentator, Spongebob would be much better to see than this. <br /> <br /> Overall: don't watch it Don't do it. Do not do it.
