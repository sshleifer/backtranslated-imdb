I'm not sure what the director and editor thought when they were editing this excuse for a movie, but whatever they thought didn't help this movie, it did nothing but hurt him, and it hurt this movie. Acting, for once, is not the problem, it's the horrible editing, the scenes will end up for no apparent reason, while in the middle of an action sequence or people will be cut off in mid-sentence. I'm not sure what the story was, but it didn't really matter, since what I saw was pretty uninteresting. Too bad all around, a huge "Jaws" rip-off and not good. The MST version was still fun. 7 for that, none for the movie itself.
