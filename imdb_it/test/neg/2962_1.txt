This film was produced by Producers Releasing Corp. (PRC), among the so-called "Poverty Row" film studios of the 1930s and 40s. So you can imagine how little money was spent to make it happen. <br /> <br /> Music is forgettable. Cast member Gerra Young exhibits a voice of operatic quality, but it is a kind of discount Deanna Durbin. The IMDb database does not show any other cinematic appearance for her, so we hope she was able to switch to some kind of position in Grand Opera. <br /> <br /> The opening credits for the recently broadcast classic by Turner Classic Film indicate that this film has been preserved by the National Film Museum. This immediately raises the question ?? WHY? <br /> <br /> Are their resources so abundant that they can afford to preserve the junk? Some low-budget or B musicals of that era have redeemed the features that make them useful. This film has none. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, skip this movie. It is REALLY wasted an hour of your time.
