Matthew Aldrich. This is a name worth remembering. This is the individual who got his fingers on the keyboard and invented one of the worst scripts of all time. Cliche. Predictable. An insult to public intelligence. <br /> <br /> Is he the only beneficiary of the fault? Obviously not. Renny Harlin took this abysmal excuse for a screenplay and turned it into a movie. Sam Jackson and Ed Harris actually read it (or not) and choose to act in it. The guilt abounds. <br /> <br /> This is Denise Richards of film scripts. There are not enough Razzies in the universe to give due recognition to how truly horrible this writing really is. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, Samuel Jackson's profession is incredibly new and the way it is presented is highly creative, but at the end of the day, it's all just trim. Pretty embellishments. <br /> <br /> Pack everything the way you want: garbage writing is still junk.
