The Net is a film I have never seen since the release, I remember giving a lift to mediocre reviews and since then maybe I noticed a snippet here and there when it was on TV. Seeing him now, fourteen years after his original version, I am a bit stunned by how time flies. Being in my mid-20s, it made my childhood feel ancient. I felt like I had to do a little exercise before my body started to stack fat in all the wrong places. Reduce fat and sugar. Too much coffee and cigarettes. <br /> <br /> However, this was the best part of this cinematic experience for me. I would say that the first 30 minutes of this film really kept me busy with the retro paradise. Look at those big cans they call computers. Look, they chat in chat rooms! I remember those vests! They look ... stupid. And, hey, he also has Sandra Bullock stars. First charge! Would you see it <br /> <br /> As a film, The Net is just a puppet and pragmatic thriller by Hitchock. Nothing archaic about that, they did it as much as they do now. Bullock plays a lone computer nerd who has the job of repairing the software for people who don't have "all that computer". As it happens, she stumbles upon some sensitive information and after her vacation trip ends with her almost being killed by a sexy lay person who turns out to be a killer (played by Jeremy Northam, and she should have been suspicious of the fact that they are in an American movie and the guy smokes and has a British accent!) gets his "identity erased". His house is empty, for sale, and upon his verification, it turns out that he now has a new identity. A condemned prostitute and impostor, no less. <br /> <br /> Now you could say it's unlikely. How could they do it to her? Even in 1995, it's impossible! True, but in '95 many people didn't even know what the Internet was. I can see how it is a hole in the plot that you could have accepted then. What is far more disastrous are the inconsistencies that have nothing to do with technology. The film obviously owes a lot to Hitchcock's movies (it's one of those thrillers that characterizes a night carousel) but Hitchcock has always made sure that his films were plausible. The characters did not behave like confused maniacs when they tried to prove their innocence, and the plot did not conveniently fit into a structure in which an inevitable obstacle leads to the other. The characters also tried a little before giving in to the whole rouge chase. Does the character of Bullock really have friends like that? Can't an old high school teacher confirm his identity? Or how ... your closest pizza boy? Oh right, she orders pizza from the Internet. It does not matter. Calculate the film fairly quickly. There seems to be hope in an ex-boyfriend. Do you really think that? You should always count on at least ONE surprise. The Network does not offer anyone. <br /> <br /> The Internet poses a great danger, this film seems to predict. But, if the film had been made today, imagine the troubles that the wicked would have to face to ensure the cancellation of the identity. Not only do they have to do all those boring literary things, she would still have her Facebook membership, with at least 100 friends around, and photo tags, not to mention she could be on YouTube or Linked-In, and what about her video blog with 150 daily hits, or the webcams from her home and the video recorded on her in mobile phones, webcams, other people's web downloads ... her membership in IMDb?
