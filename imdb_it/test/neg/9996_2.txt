This is a boring, inert, self-important boredom. When the only thing that suddenly gives life to a film is hanging, you know that the business has failed. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Truman Capote as a narcissistic, tic-ridden, self-indulgent caricature, in the shape of a cartoon, like an insect. Because he is this way is never explained and we get poor basic information. The script focuses on Capote's writing of "In Cold Blood" and his attachment to the injured brothers who murdered a family of four. The acclaimed writer of "To Kill A Mockingbird", Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), accompanies Capote in his first investigation into crime, and his presence immediately suggests a much more interesting topic for a biographical film. Unfortunately, Lee is quickly pushed aside for endless scenes of Capote complaining about his painful existence. Watching it is like watching Dr. Smith from "Lost in Space" complaining about his "delicate back" to anyone listening for two hours. The difference, however, is that Smith was fun to watch while Capote is not. The film's precious self-importance kills him, as does director Bennett Miller's reluctance to add any kind of nuance. Like the girlfriend piano score, the film is a marvel of a note, without contrast, without emotional coloring and without intimate drama. If Capote was really irritating, why shoot a movie about him and expect the audience to look at him? Although the secondary roles are well performed (Chris Cooper is his usual brave), they have such a dramatic purpose because, ultimately, it's all thanks to Capote (!) Director Bennett and screenwriter Dan Futterman can't emotionally engage the expected public because they were clearly overwhelmed by the cultural baggage of Capote's "legend". Their product was born from an Oscar bait ... and it is more evident that a large genre photo has more "truth" in it than a dozen piles of such-sincere shit like this.
