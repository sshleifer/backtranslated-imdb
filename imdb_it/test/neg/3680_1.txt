If they had a zero out of 10 I would like to enter it. All those involved in this film should be ashamed to take money from the public. I don't know how movies like this are published on Video or Pay Channel. I'm disappointed with Vincent Gallo. Val Kilmer worked on it for about 8 minutes, so I can't make him angry with him. Only the person who listed it to be the star in it. He's like Marlon Brando in Superman. There is no plot except Gallo who seeks and finds his friend in the catacombs. Because they were looking for the gates of hell that only the director knows. They should keep this movie in Moscow and burn it for the fire to keep all the extra homeless in the heat for the night. There is nothing else to say about this film that all the other reviewers have written. I wish I could forget this film hurts my brain.
