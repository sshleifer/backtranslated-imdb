I found it difficult to take care of these characters, who were annoying or insipid, everyone lived their fabulously hilarious urban lives. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was escrescent at times, and at other times the narrative seemed difficult to follow - was it me or were entire scenes deleted? <br /> <br /> I felt like a poor sitcom somehow turned into a movie. Stereotypes and jokes about "male groups" might have been fun in the early 1990s. As it is, it is from there that much of the film's humor comes - and boy, it gets old fast. <br /> <br /> Apart from the fascinating Irish man - this film was a real disaster. And even in a "so bad it's a good way". The last 20 minutes have been particularly painful. Maybe if you've never met gay people or you've never thought about homosexuality before, then this movie could have something meaningful to say. Otherwise, dear ones, you'd better rent The Boys in The Band or Beautiful Thing.
