... He said the continuity announcer while TACTICAL ASSAULT was about to be transmitted. After seeing the first two minutes I started thinking that Rutger might want to get a new agent. After watching the next ten minutes I started thinking that Rutger could have retired, thus saving a potential audience from any other performance. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a really terrible film. I didn't expect much and because I should do it if the name Rutget Hauer appeared in the credits, but within seconds of the opening titles that included NATO aircraft with USSR markings bombing Bosnia, I realized that I would be fed with the strength of an inedible turkey three months after Christmas. <br /> <br /> Attention to detail does not exist. NATO planes bear the marks of the USSR, then it was said that the character of Hauer spent six years in an Iraqi prison that he would do on 1997. Which NATO was bombing the Serbs in 1997! I guess the producers didn't think the public would notice this ridiculous inaccuracy, but I know I did. Probably the producers also hoped that the public wouldn't notice the lack of continuity like the aerial fights with the Iraqi jets that suddenly went from Migs to F-4 Phantom and then again but I did it. Even stranger characters would take flight in the F-16s and when they return to base, the jet has changed to a Soviet Mig <br /> <br /> Oh and if you're expecting a stupid action movie you're only half right because it's stupid, but most of the plot focuses on a BASIC INSTINCT revenge storyline. I'll give the producers some credit (maybe the credit is too strong a word) because after seeing the conspiracies of nannies from hell, cops from hell, roommates from hell now we have a combat pilot which means every single occupation of the twentieth century the century appeared in a plot of infernal type with perhaps TATICAL ASSUALT which is the worst film of the lot
