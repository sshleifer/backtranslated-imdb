This is what my friends and I kept asking each other for this whole movie. We couldn't believe how stupid he was! I think someone took this picture with the video camera at home and put it in the movie store and put it on the shelf like a joke to see if anyone would ever shoot it. Well, I guess the joke is on us. I think I should have come to this site first and read all the reviews he got, every single one says that this movie is HORRIBLE, STUPID and again and again. And boy are they right! Even though he gave some good laughs (my friends and I were pretty drunk) because he's so stupid. We can't believe anyone is stupid enough to make such a lousy movie! I swear this had to be done in the 1970s before they had good film and stuff technology because every scene looks really crap, but when I looked here did it say it was made in 2001? What? It certainly doesn't look like a movie that would have been made today, but I guess it's what you get when you use a camcorder and shoot home movies using really fake strobes and lasers, and instead use people from real life from your hometown of actors or aspiring actors. By the way, some of those chicks (or they were drag queens, we couldn't tell!) Were so fleeting, even my horny and drunken college friends wouldn't touch them with a 50-foot pole. <br /> <br /> So there is absolutely no appeal for this film, bad acting, bad writing, bad direction, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. Don't waste your time or money on this, you will be completely disappointed!
