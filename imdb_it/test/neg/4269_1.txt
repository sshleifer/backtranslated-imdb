This horrible action ?? science fiction film is crap. I've just spent 90 minutes of my life watching one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story makes no sense, there are many flaws in the script, the characters are poorly developed, the unknown cast is horrible, the leading actor seems to be too old for his role. I was led to buy this VHS, which has a magnificent cover, and see this crap due to the illogical IMDb User Rating and some reviews of "ten stars". I just checked the authors, and each of them has only a brief review (of "L.I.N.X.") published on IMDb, and nothing else. Why are they promoting such garbage? My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "L.I.N.X. Conex√£o Letal" ("L.I.N.X. Lethal Connection")
