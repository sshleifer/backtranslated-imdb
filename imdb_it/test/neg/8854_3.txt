This film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead. There's a lot of mumbo-jumbo on the Internet (for example, if you install a program on your computer, see dead people - very similar if you play a videotape that you will die in RINGU). Frankly, most of this seemed pretty silly and lost me. What I found interesting is the idea that the dead live within their own separate existence - to be totally alone for eternity. This has been sobering and fascinating. <br /> <br /> I love Japanese movies and have seen a huge number compared to most Americans. However, a genre that has become popular in the last few years and that I cannot connect very well are these horror films. I know they are super popular, especially since they seem to be redone so often in the United States. I saw both RINGU and THE RING, JU-ON and THE GRUDGE and it was rather ambivalent despite their popularity. The only recent horror film that I really liked from Japan was SEANCE - a reworking of the great British film, SEANCE ON A WET AFTERNOON. And what, I think, has made SEANCE different? Well, unlike the other films and KAIRO, the tears and drops of money weren't spent on special effects or trying to scare the public - instead, the emphasis was on the story. The bottom line is that these other films are very similar to American films like HALLOWEEN or Friday the 13th - with scary things that come out just to scare the public and the plot is purely secondary (at best). For me, I want the plot - not chills or cheap ghosts as the main focus of the film. <br /> <br /> With a relatively high rating, I know I'm in the minority, but I just can't find this is a very satisfying movie. Too often minor things happen that could make someone jump - but the characters start screaming, crying and behaving as if to say "this is the scariest film ever made, so it's best to start shaking". Well, I think it's too hard and I hope it focused more on the afterlife seen at the end of the film and on the progression of the plot - not on intimidation tactics.
