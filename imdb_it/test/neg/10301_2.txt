I work at the Memorial Hermann Hospital (TMC) and also worked at the Texas Children's Hospital, Women's Hospital and West Houston, during Allison. First the hospital shots are sadly suburban. The Texas Medical Center has a diurnal population density similar to Wall Street !! There are huge buildings and professional hospitals for skyscrapers. TCH was the largest hospital for children before it doubled in size, TWICE! Methodist, with its 1500 beds is one of the largest hospitals in the world. The skyline of the Texas Medical Center is larger than that of Memphis. Yet, the best photos that Hollywood could collect are those of a run-down hospital in the middle of nowhere (in addition to the real picture of the hospital taken decades ago). In addition, they united different characters from real life and portrayed them all in one (super-nurse). Actually I know the medical technicians who work in the blood bank. Two in which he actually works at that moment, but the film only shows a pregnant MT. There was a TM in pregnancy and another MT who took the patient's precious antibody rolodex (search for "alloantibodies" for more information). I will not mention their names (privacy). There wasn't a nurse in the real-life lab scene. Hollywood has combined these two technologies (probably to save time and money). In the film, (real) military helicopters had to transfer our children (NICU and PICU) to the UTMB up to Galveston! Why would you ask, when do we have the biggest children's hospital down the street? Because the Texas pediatric hospital refused to take them. You read that right, they REJECTED !!! Being hired by them, I was ashamed. Needless to say, I am no longer affiliated with that facility. Any other comments would be repetitive for those already published by people who actually live here or have lived the experience.
