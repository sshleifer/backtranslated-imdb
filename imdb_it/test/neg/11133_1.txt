Whoa, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The film packaging is better than the film itself. My girlfriend and I watched it last weekend, and we kept looking at it only in the hope that it would improve ... not ... <br /> <br /> Image quality is poor; it looks like it was shot on video and transferred to film. The lighting is not exceptional, which makes it more difficult to read the facial expressions of the actors. The acting itself was poor, but I guess it's acceptable for "yet another" teenage horror movie. The sound was a big problem: sometimes it is necessary to rewind the video because the sound is not clear and / or muffled. <br /> <br /> It has no real value; trying to ride the "Sleepy Hollow" tails. Do not worry about it.
