Wow. Not because of 3D images, which have sometimes been used well to provide good deep images, but what a lame end! The end of the film seems to implode on itself. This film must be one of the most clumsy monsters in the world of cinema and one of the most pathetic attempts to try to explain it. Even the misogyny of this film is painful. If you're looking for a cheap 1950s science fiction movie (aka 'bot fodder'), try it. Otherwise, look for better films.
