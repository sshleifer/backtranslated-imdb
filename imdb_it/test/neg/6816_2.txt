"Dogmatic", as another reviewer described this film, is a suitable word. The director's idea was to present Bach without plot, acting, entertainment, theatricality, dialogue, fiction or drama. Mission accomplished, Mr. Straub. "Pretentious?" Yes. "Cinematic?" There's no way. This is anti-cinema. Nobody moves Almost nobody talks. The camera holds static shots for 10-12 minutes at a time: very very occasionally the camera turns on. One can see the fingers of Gustav Leonhardt moving on the keys. That's all. <br /> <br /> If you like the idea of ​​fixing the back of a harpsichordist's head for 7 minutes while listening to Bach, this is the movie for you. I prefer to listen to Bach on my stereo with my eyes closed.
