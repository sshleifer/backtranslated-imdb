I was completely misled by the comments on this film, mainly from someone who said he saw it at a film festival and loved every minute of it. Waiting for this to be a nice American pie style movie, I was deeply disappointed. <br /> <br /> First of all the work with the camera is very bad, I don't think the director knows that the cameras can move around scenes rather than stand still and make the actors move by themselves and far from them spontaneous. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the scenario! My God, I've seen more furnishings in a bird's nest. The club was not at all convincing with about 3 extras who danced underground at any time. The apartments were bare and lacking in personality. <br /> <br /> Third the actors. Wow. The director obviously opted for the typical "Reaper" character set, a main wimpy character with a "I don't put an f ** k" character that takes pot shots on the main. All that the main character said and did was a chore, so it made me jump. <br /> <br /> Overall, the plot, the supposed great theme of revenge, lasted for about 30 seconds and lacked any real motivation. The characters acted irrationally and did not seem to have any real relationship with anyone else. No character has had depth for them, they could also be pieces of cardboard that pass in front of the static camera. <br /> <br /> A truly horrible piece, worse than a 2-minute first year youtube student. Advice to the director? Change your name and deny any association with the film that will probably sell a copy on a site in Ohio.
