Tycoon will never be listed as one of John Wayne's best Stagecoach movies. It is good on the points, has some beautiful action sequences in the cave and also in the flood at the peak. But the plot leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br /> What we have in Tycoon are two men who do not like each other completely and dislike prevents them from working as a team. The multimillionaire Cedric Hardwicke has hired John Wayne and James Gleason to build a railroad. But then he refuses to give them the necessary funds to do the right job. <br /> <br /> Things get really complicated when Wayne falls in love with Hardwicke's daughter, Laraine Day. After a night of spending time alone in an Inca ruin, by convention in South America, Wayne and Day they get a shotgun wedding even if nothing happened. <br /> <br /> What should have happened is that these two should have been locked in a room for 24 hours together to resolve their differences in one way or another. Their little spite causes some fatality among Wayne's crew. <br /> <br /> But for Tycoon another piece of pettiness is better known. Laraine Day was married to Leo Durocher, the director of the Brooklyn Dodgers, when this film was shot. It was a constant presence on the set, madly jealous of John Wayne who he thought might have a relationship with his wife. Nothing to do but made his wife's life miserable. <br /> <br /> Not one of the Duke's best efforts.
