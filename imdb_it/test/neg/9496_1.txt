I have never felt the need to add a review to this website so far, but having just watched the movie I felt it necessary to warn parents that they might consider showing it to their children. Please don't do it! This is not a Disney movie. This film tells us that "life is cruel" and if you show it to your children, in my opinion, you are too. <br /> <br /> The videotape describes the film as a "delight for all ages" and the IMDb script describes it as a "family movie". I just had to find a definition of "family film" and came across the following: "Usually composed of comedies or adventures, these films are often based on children's literature and can involve any number of useful animals, friendly supernatural beings and worlds fantastic, all aimed at stimulating and attracting the imagination, whatever the situation, there is little or no offensive material and generally a lesson is learned along the way. "Not an apt description of Tarka The Otter, which contains scenes from the all unpleasant, totally unsuitable for small children, and an ending that qualifies the film as a "feel bad" film. Has the lesson learned? As I said: life is cruel. Family fun? I don't think so. Unless you hate your family, this is it. <br /> <br /> Another review, more revealing than this, but worth reading, can be found by following the "external reviews" link.
