I don't understand why some of you (or many) gave this 8-star movie out of 10. Do you understand that there are low grades for a reason? Of course, this could be a hit of zombies with some spray, but that's all. I'm not a hater in the zombie movies, but it was terrible. Really, actually, I should call it more like a zombie soap, because that's how acting is. Production is ... well, that's fine. Barely an attempt at plot development, horrible acting, stupid effects, clich√©s and an abrupt ending. Go ahead and like zombie movies, but never give this over a 5.0. Honestly, the only reason you should want to watch this movie is to laugh. Seriously.
