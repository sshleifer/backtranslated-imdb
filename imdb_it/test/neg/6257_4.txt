"Based on a joke once told by Jim Wynorski" ... this is what I read at the end of the credits. Well, Mr. Wynorski must have a terrible sense of humor then! This film is terrible, really. I loved the first two chapters of the series The Slumber Party Massacre; the third movie was pretty useless, but completely watchable, compared to this piece of shit! There is not even a Driller Killer and the plot, the acting, the characters, the places, the events ... everything is boring, absurd and ridiculous. The only good reason to watch this turkey are the girls: if this movie were porn, I think it would have worked a lot better! Even the film lacks blood: the first scene (the one in the tent) could be more bloody and the scene with the headless boy knocking on the door lasted a second! Some moments of slight excitement cannot save a non-existent plot. Buzzy (Lunk Johnson) seems to be the only real actor here: I found him the only bearable character in this movie! Oh ... there's a nonsense part with Brinke Stevens, who sang "Linda" in the first Slumber Party massacre: the police annoys her to learn more about the killer; but what we get is just a video of the first movie! Not a dialogue, nor a monologue, nor anything of this traumatized adult girl, who is forced to revive the worst 30 minutes of her life (as she says), giving us clues about the murderer! <Br /> <br /> Look at your own risk.
