This could have been great. The voiceovers are exactly right and fit the characters to a T. A small problem though; the appearance of the characters, mostly the supporting or guest characters seem exactly the same. The same look bored on every face only with small changes like thin lines or weight. It seems strange to see a really great guest star's voice coming out of a lifeless form like the characters here. If I'm not mistaken, Kathy Griffin made a voiceover for this show and it seemed too weird to be funny. <br /> <br /> There are some other problems, one of which is the family plot. The Simpsons have done it much better where you could actually buy most of the situations the characters entered. Here we receive too many annoying deviations, like someone who has a strange fantasy and therefore we should find it so funny, but for some reason the delivery is a bit off. As you can probably tell, it is difficult for me to put a finger exactly on what is wrong with this show because in practice it is nothing more than a clone of the Simpsons or even more "Married with children". <br /> <br /> If you had to point to what is totally wrong with this, it's probably repetitiveness. Peter Griffin is not a brilliant character, but none of the others. Lois should have been called Lois Lame because it's a bit one-dimensional. Seth Green as the kind of retarded child is the best thing about this show and this is the most stereotypical part of the show. <br /> <br /> So what can I say more. There is nothing exactly wrong with this show, but in the long run you have to admit that it takes a lot of work to do what the Simpsons have been doing for almost two decades.
