Having seen all the episodes of the Star Trek TV series many times each since the 1960s, most of which are quite good at superb, and only a very few are mediocre, my opinion is that this is the worst of all. <br /> <br /> In fact, I think it is so poorly executed as to be an embarrassment to the series. It is not that the story is so ugly, even if it is not particularly exceptional in any way, but the acting is simply abysmal by the two main characters, that is to say those different from the usual customers in this case. Barbara Anderson gives her weakest performance ever as the daughter of a mass killer, and who is on a mission in a certain way. He practically calls the role from a telephone and shows no real emotional capacity here. Although it has usually never been used as a pretty face in most of its film / TV roles, usually small parts, it has done much better. <br /> <br /> Arnold Moss as his father gives new meaning to the term 'Ham' and is the only actor ever in an episode of Star Trek from the 1960s that surpassed William Shatner in this area, and indeed makes Shatner superb in comparison. And he manages to play a Shakespearean actor no less, which gives him more impetus to exaggerate, and he does. <br /> <br /> In addition to these two leads they are so weak, the story is such that anyone who makes sense can tell everyone who the murderer is within the first 15 minutes. I say this because I told my brother the whole plot that ends at the first commercial break when we were watching the original 1966 broadcast as pre-adolescence. His answer was yes, you are right. <br /> <br /> Skip this and watch the much superior Menagerie episodes that were originally shown on TV shortly before.
