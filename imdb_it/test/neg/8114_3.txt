I'm sorry, but for a film that has been so impressed as a semi-classic movie and a scary movie, but seriously, I think when the director makes me laugh unintentionally, it's not a good thing. The characters in this film were so exaggerated and incredible. I just couldn't stop laughing at Issac's voice, it was just like an English voice of a whiny sharp girl. Not to mention the dramatic character of Malicai, his ass-like character. <br /> <br /> Children of the Corn speaks of a city where all children have killed adults and worship a God who commands them to sacrifice the elderly of at least 20 years old people. When a couple has a bad car accident, they come to the city to ask for help, but obviously they are caught in the trap of children and are sacrificed! But Malicai has other intentions when he is tired of following Issac's orders. <br /> <br /> Children of the Corn could have been something great, but they became a bad movie that you could easily tease. As much as I love Stephen King, I'm sure this is not what he meant and it was a pretty lame story, or at least the actors destroyed it. As I said, for a good laugh, look at it, but I warn you, it's rather pathetic. <br /> <br /> 3/10
