This film runs on a very familiar terrain: the confusion between art and reality in the life of the actors. It has nothing particularly new or interesting to say about this subject and is actually rather boring. The final scene in particular is interminably boring. Seeing the audience crying over the "moving" acting they are seeing on the screen made me wonder "who do they think they are joking?" <br /> <br /> However, there are some good performances and interesting scenes, especially from some of the minor characters. Ben Gazzara plays an old and slightly touched actor, who gets a whole group of policemen who applaud his performance when they come to arrest him. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken still plays an exaggerated wacko. Remember his character "The Continental" on Saturday Night Live; an elderly eurotrash satirist chasing a young woman around the furniture and trying to get her to bed? She makes an identical turn in the film, chasing her young prey (male) around an antique table and showing off a champagne. <br /> <br /> Overall this film was both enchanting and irritating, but above all irritating.
