There is no character in this sitcom with no saving qualities. They are all egocentric, unpleasant or two-dimensional. My husband looks at him, claiming there's nothing else, but I'd rather not look at anything. <br /> <br /> The only sitcom I can think of as worse was Yes, Cara. At least that didn't have 9 seasons. <br /> <br /> Being overweight doesn't make a comic genius, and Kevin James doesn't have the talent of John Goodman, Jackie Gleason or John Belushi. Leah Remini may have talent, but if so, she is wasted on her cunning wife. Jerry Stiller is as convincing as an old bore. Perhaps there is a reason for this. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect example of why sitcoms are derided.
