For the Mongolian native speakers the film lacked emotion and emphasis. Used too many non-native speakers, especially Jamukha. Too many deviations from current history. Terrible terrible subtitle !!! I wonder where and who did that subtitle. It was both in English and in Thai. I wonder how bad the subtitle in Thai was if the English subtitle was really bad! He described the life of the greatest leader, very uninteresting. There are better films made by Mongolian directors with very low budgets from the 80s. Honestly, I wonder if the Academy Award film critics are so lenient or what? The only good thing was some good CGI in some fight scenes only moderately ... not above the best CGIs
