This film is a bad example of uninspired narration, which seeks to hide behind an "artfilm" fa√ßade, trying to amaze the public with unprovoked violence (against women) to cover the lack of psychological depth of the characters and internal conflicts. Everything in this film is pretentious, from thanks to Bela Tarr to the beginning, to photography, acting, music, history and editing. When suddenly, for no reason, you are forced to look closely at "charismatic" Hungarian country people in their boats, while the soundtrack is trying to convince you that this should be a dramatic moment, even if they are just on the road to the funeral of the local alcoholic, this is one thing. Putting rape scenes completely groundless as a shock is a different thing, for which I have absolutely no understanding. This film is really trying to get into a certain genre of artistic films (Eastern European films), but it lacks subtleties, observation skills and "soul" of other directors.
