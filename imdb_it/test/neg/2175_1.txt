This terribly boring and unpleasant film made me think that Chaplin was the real Hitler, since only someone as evil as he could torture people with this tripe. I saw this remastered movie, which only made the suffering inflicted by this more serious atrocity. This film is nothing but a pathetic and repetitive film that, instead of inducing two hours of laughter, has induced two hours of suicidal impulses. After the first 10 minutes of this, I started to want the gas to start filtering through the theater speakers. <br /> <br /> If I could assign him a zero out of ten, I'd do it willingly. Avoid at all costs!
