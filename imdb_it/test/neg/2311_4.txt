The users' first comments are very detailed for a very vague film. I'm not saying that I don't agree, but this summary can be written in a few sentences. To get straight to the point, this is more or less like watching the making of a really bad amateur porn movie. There are some funny points in the film, but with the kind of things that happen in today's youth every day is actually a little lame. The main actor of the film is a stupid fool and both the boy and the girl in the film are too modest to be in a movie like this. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE. The only reason I gave a 4 and not a 1 is that they used at least one pretty attractive girl in the movie and near the end you almost saw the girl's full frontal nudity, that's the only thing that is it's worth watching for the end
