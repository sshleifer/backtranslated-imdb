Humm, an Italian film starring David hasselhoff and Linda Blair, I didn't expect much, to be honest and in fact, I took even less than I expected. It doesn't mean this film is the worst I've seen because I've seen things worse than this, but the plot has often been confusing and uninteresting and some good blood scenes are the only thing that saved it. Besides that, you will like some special effects, they are really cheap and bad. Now I just want to watch "Troll 3" from this same director, sure it won't be worse than that.
