I completely forgot that I saw him within a couple of days, which is quite revealing by itself. The umpteenth version of Gaston 'Phantom of the Opera', the mystery of Leroux's country house, I had heard that it was a captivating and witty update. Thus appeared from the nice sequence of the title and some clean touches in the opening scene, but the film stopped very quickly and became vaguely boring and totally unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> As a mystery the main problem is that it is basically unsolvable to the public: like the worst Agatha Christies, it depends on a character that appears in the final act with a wealth of basic information that we have not been aware of . As a film, whether in comedy or in the thriller, the crucial problem is that the characterization is almost non-existent. With the exception of the killer, everyone is a valuable version of the typical suspicions in the typical story of a campaign murder - journalist, heir in danger, suspicious boyfriend, desperate father scientist (a surprisingly poor Michel Lonsdale), etc. depth and little interest, and performances that are often too mature or misjudged do not help. Frankly, you don't care about anyone, so there's no danger or suspense. Only Claude Rich and, in the last reel, Pierre Arditi has something to work with, and only in the last reel does the film approach a sense of resonance too elusive to be really effective. <br /> <br /> For the rest, we get endless exposure and a couple of ineffective comedian aspirants (a promising one with a photographer trapped in a pendulum clock is too little thought to pay), with Dennis Podalydes reduced to Irving the Explains the last third of the image. I don't like country house movies or Agatha Christie style whodunits, so those who could talk about them are much slower, but I found a poor show. As Rich says when the mystery is revealed, "It's all rather something of a disappointment."
