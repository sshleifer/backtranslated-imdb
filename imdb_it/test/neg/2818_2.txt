It could easily have been better. Indeed, perhaps it is so much that if the director had not tried to do as hard as he, it could have been better. <br /> <br /> On a good note. The lighting was reasonably in place. But practically everything else was missing. Wobbly camera. (Yes, yes, I know, this should be the style now.) Audio recorded badly. And the editing looked like someone watching too many Ulli Lommel movies (which are some of the worst modified movies). To sum up, the film seemed to be a rationalization for the director / writer / protagonist to get naked young women, put them in fake slavery, and grope, while you say "threatening" things.
