It's hard to believe that anyone can take such a beautiful book and make such a terrible movie. Imagine that King Kong is transformed into a butcher monkey and the part of Fay Wray played by a boy. What about Elton John like Rambo !!!! This film is even worse than the TV remake of The Hunter's Night. <br /> <br /> Using the Watchers name and Dean Koontz the creators of this film should be sued for fraud by readers of the book who expected a reasonably accurate adaptation of the book. <br /> <br /> Read the book, I've never talked to anyone who didn't like it. Another good book is David Baldachi's The Winner.
