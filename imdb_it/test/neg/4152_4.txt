Those born to Vietnamese mothers and gynecological fathers often did not find either of them. The Beautiful Country is the story of one of these children, Binh, rejected by his rural village, who struggles to find his American father. The film begins with a green and wild land, but descends into a grim ugly ugliness and boredom. The remarkable talents of Tim Roth and Temuera Morrison are wasted in useless and ill-conceived roles aboard the rusty freighter that carries Binh and is dying brother across the ocean with what appears to be a stormy sea shoot. New York City offers slavery and clich√© characters. While it is very uneven from the beginning, the great curiosity of this film is the final segment. Nick Nolte receives the best reputation in the cast. I joked suggested that it probably would have been in the final scene only and was not far from the truth. While the journey takes Binh to Texas and his father, the film takes on a serene and austere simplicity. A tenuous cohabitation unites these two men in a family of father and son. The ninety odd minutes of garbage we have just seen are rewarded with a slow and subtle performance by Nolte that interacts slowly. The closing credits turned and I was surprised to see the names of Badlands executive producer Edward Pressman and West Texas native Terrence Malick.
