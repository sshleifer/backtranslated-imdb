It is a pity that so many people "love" the family boy, because it is easily one of the worst shows on TV, there are many points to be addressed here. <br /> <br /> The Flashbacks: Now, in the first and second season, which I think is exceptional, the flashbacks were quite frequent, and actually somewhat related to what the story was about and were even fun. Now the fourth season and beyond, the flashbacks are even more evident and they have NOTHING to do with the plot, they are not funny, and really long, boring and meaningless. Family Guy thinks that a long dragging scene that isn't going anywhere is fun, when it's actually bad writing. <br /> <br /> Stewie: Wow, a child who plays English. How fun can it be? It is not. His character is so unstable that it's incredible. Remember at the beginning of the season when Stewie was in charge of dominating the world and killing Lois. Well, now he only has scenes that are awkwardly gay with Brian. From the desire to dominate the world to being gay = bad writing. <br /> <br /> References: How do they continue to make bad references to TV shows or 80s events? Well, they only use the same old garbage. You know, in 20 years, I hope Family Guy will be canceled by then, if they're still making jokes about 80s shows, it will be even more irrelevant than before. Because he will have forgotten. This keeps asking me why they can't just write good episodes with quality jokes. <br /> <br /> Voice Acting: My God, the voices on this show are so poor. Seth McFarlene should focus only on his nasty writing episode and stop making voices. All the extras of the already ugly episodes of Family Guy are all the same. The Simpsons make 6 or 7 people to do ALL the voices. Some of them express about 15-20 characters ... they all look very different. But why can't Guy do it? Oh, right, it's a lousy show. <br /> <br /> The Stuttering: Usually done by Peter, Stewie, Brian and any extras, whenever they talk or are offended by something, they must stutter the phrase to try to get a cheap laugh. I can't believe that Family Guy can't even talk normally to get people to laugh at their "jokes". <br /> <br /> Offensiveness: OK, short and simple, Family Guy tries to overcome the barrier and be at the cutting edge, but in reality they fall flat every time. Go look at South Park ... <br /> <br /> Terrible Plots: Plots and textures are just garbage. The Simpsons have started their 20th season. STILL have better plots than those of family members. About a total of 8 or 9 minutes are flashbacks and drag scenes that are not relevant. <br /> <br /> Popularity Many children have Stewie shirts and think it's so funny, when in reality they don't even make terribly written sex lines. They just say "oh, ha ha, stewie!" when they don't even understand it, Family Guy has been canceled twice and reported by DVD sales, how sad it is. They were canceled the first time I think after the 2nd or 3rd season, and honestly I think it would have been so. those episodes were superb then, they had to be left on a high note. <br /> <br /> Drag scenes and fall There are scenes that go on too long. One that was just broadcast on the last Sunday, Peter went to an executive bathroom, where about 2 minutes were spent imitating the intro at Jurassic Park, and the plot of that episode was also stolen from an episode of Seinfeld. Even a scene in which Chris works in a shop and talks to the employee for about 5 minutes about a movie, which also presents stuttering. The fighting chickens are so stupid, 3 of them, each longer than the last. Useless writing, little fun, thinking that people enjoy long scenes of repeated fights, between a CHICKEN, yes a chicken. now, whenever someone falls and, by the way, NO GUY FAN FAMILY CAN DAMAGE THIS, that every time they fall, it's under a split second, and they ALWAYS land with their arms on their backs to make them look funny I guess, it's been used at least 30 times. <br /> <br /> Herman Oh jeez, everyone thinks that the old pedophile is so funny when it's really a bad racing gag. they also did everything to allow him to sing scenes (which are very poor) and basing ALL the episodes around him, they did the same thing with other characters, like the doctor, who I know had an episode based around him. <br /> <br /> The Simpsons Well, there is no need for much explanation here. There is so much evidence that the family boy steals Simpson's lines. How the family boy is just a poor Simpson. <br /> <br /> so I'm sure I've forgotten some key points somewhere, but I'm sure this is enough to show that that kind of family is really a terrible horribly written TV show that everyone seems to love when they really they should go see Simpson, Seinfeld and Frasier.
