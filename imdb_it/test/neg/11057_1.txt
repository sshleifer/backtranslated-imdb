I found this film for a dollar ($ 1.00) and the film was a complete waste of time. Reb Brown, (Mark Hardin), served as a military adviser in South America and was successful in capturing the leader of the rebel soldiers operating out of the thick jungles. However, Mark joins the opposite side after some horrible tortures have been inflicted or women and men. In a scene while Mark is drinking something in a hotel bar, his eyes capture the intimate of the long sexy legs Sandra Spencer (Shannon Tweed), "Dead Sexy", 01. Mark and Sandra have extremes on each other and even they make love with passion on some very hard rocks, timeless for the comfort of a bed. This is a horrible movie and it's not worth wasting time to even watch IT.
