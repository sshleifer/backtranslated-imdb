I'm a big fan of MDs. But, I call it as I see it. This film went limping. The plot was absurd. Getting access to heads of state in this film is easier than accessing the local grocery store. Come on! Tone Loc has the thrill of a wooden board. Loosen! The assembly is irregular. The actors, and I use the term freely, sound like they're reading their lines on the valium. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been better. Dudikoff has potential, but chooses screenplays that shout "Stinker". <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good Dudikoff movie, I can suggest Crash Dive or Avenging Force. If you've never seen one of his films, this is not the case to introduce yourself to his work. You will leave with a bitter taste in your mouth and think that all his projects are so bad.
