I wanted this film to like it, and certainly there is room for a character-based psychological film that is not suited to cheap thrills. However, for the pleasure of a film, a credible storyline, a bit of rhythm and editing and a sense of involvement are needed. In The Clearing, what starts as an intriguing mystery, with a kidnapping and unknown reasons, turns into a slow and useless useless exercise. Not much happens, and the so-called "character-driven angles" (as expressed by the director in his commentary) do not really do much. <br /> <br /> Good actors are wasted here. Robert Redford does his best to try to deceive and defeat Willem Dafoe. Dafoe brings a little nuance to his character, to the extent that you can try something nice about him. It is unfortunate that Dafoe was abused as a villain, he entered the Christopher Walken Hall of Fame of Typecasting. <br /> <br /> Wendy Crewson is usually good but her character's entry into the film was short and forced, and I was wondering why they took the time to present her character. By far the biggest waste of talent was Helen Mirren. In the director's commentary, all I heard was his incredible talent. I agree, she is a great actress. So why wasn't it used correctly? Only towards the climax of this film can he show himself, but at that point the viewer stopped worrying. <br /> <br /> Too bad, I liked the parts of this film, but as another reviewer wrote, once ... halfway through you know that the film won't improve much.
