Romantic comedy films are certainly the most fertile genre for "average bellow" films and a source of frustration for viewers. This is a perfect example of this and finds a place in my "worst top ten films". <br /> <br /> The story is far from creativity and the jokes are weak. I found no reason for a single laugh throughout the movie! The characters are simple and the performance of the actors is simply good. History develops slowly, is boring and predictable. The end is also predictable and coated with sugar. <br /> <br /> This is one of the movies you watch on a rainy Saturday afternoon when you have nothing better to look at in my humble opinion.
