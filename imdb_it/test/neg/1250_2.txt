How does this movie suck? As a fan of Michael Imperioli's work on The Sopranos I discovered this at Blockbuster based on his name and a story that seemed to promise. He still does, but this film doesn't satisfy him. <br /> <br /> Every turn in history is completely predictable; I kept looking for the Lifetime bug in the lower right corner of the screen. It's all there: the noble woman who comes out of difficult times, the boy who can't live up to his potential despite his best efforts, the child who gets stuck in the middle, etc. Etc. Etc. The identity of the mysterious stranger is what really made me want to throw stuff on TV - I would have been happier than the little Stuey who was waking up and I realized that it was all a dream. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers may have also had a "The moral of the story is ..." a little before the end credits, since as another reviewer pointed out this thing really rolls like a special afterschool. Don't play, don't drink, don't do drugs, stay with your wife, spend time with your children ... come on, how about a little nuance? What about some interesting villains? Writer / director A.W. Vidmer should be singled out for a special notice: not only is the dialogue plenated, the rhythm (within the dialogue and at the two ends of many scenes) makes this film at least 45 minutes longer than it should be (and believe me, it is as if longer). The talents of Imperioli, Renee Faia and some of the supporting casts (Steve Schirripa, natch) are the only things that keep this score from "1". All their good work is almost compensated, however, by the atrocious work of portraying the Stuey boy. I'm not sure it was a mistake in the cast (hey, it's a movie for the mafia, so let's launch someone from Blue's Clues who can't do anything but exaggerate with a big fake smile ... so let's throw the sullen and gloomy child into the movie Disney) or just horrible directing, but those scenes are really painful to watch. <br /> <br /> I would be interested in another director about this character and his story; it's a shame that Imperioli has already been used by this film. Terrible, terrible, horrible.
