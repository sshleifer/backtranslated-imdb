This show was rushed, and relied heavily on surprise cuts to commercials (when he came back from the spot, the noise or "surprise" was something as simple as a mouse) This is a pure rip off of Ghost Hunters and tries to go " beyond "them, and fails miserably. Also, what's with the administrators' records? Is this trip a star? It only ruins the novelty of this show, which quickly runs out. The only reason it has been observed is that people want to laugh at the sheer anti-climatic nature of it. They never find anything and most likely never will. Strangely, they always emphasize something that is the thing that "hunts" and guesses what ?! It is the light of the tower of the local radio station that flashes red!
