Our story: Two US Navy divers are looking for silver coins hidden under the ocean off the Philippine coast. Our test: extremely boring entertainment at its best, without a plot in sight. Jim Brown is completely wasted, he assisted in the production of this 1970s war turkey. Richard Jaeckel is in his usual form. Don Cornelius and Richard Pryor are among those who particularly thanked their contributions! BOMBY AWAY !!!
