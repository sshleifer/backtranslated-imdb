The film starts in Mexico where a girl was cursed, she spits the snakes through the green jello and her friend tries all these crazy spells to lift the curse. All he does is sing a horrible language that does nothing, so they decide to cross the border by getting on the train to make their way up to L.A. to see his uncle raise the curse. Comic hilarity follows. This movie has the same snakes over and over again! It has garden snakes and pythons that will never bite. They all make the sound of rattlesnakes that makes no sense. The whole film has funny lines, some weak effects, but the most important thing is a fantastic ending that leaves you WHAM BAM WHAT THE NECK HAS BEEN WELCOME !!!!! The whole movie is about a 1, but the ending is a 10, so with my crazy math he gets an overall 3. When the blockbuster has nothing else you want, take this for mindless entertainment!
