I felt compelled to write a review after seeing the only review that gave this film a suspiciously high 9/10 rating. I suspect because it seems less like a review, but more like an advertising statement. Did the filmmaker himself, or one of his companions, write that "review"? Bad, bad. <br /> <br /> I saw this film on the Propeller channel on Sky TV expecting it to be really horrible. The special effects used were very honest, very good for a low budget film, and even acting was not so bad, but most of the acting was really terrible, but well done to try, as I expect most friends of the director. <br /> <br /> I think the director did really well trying to punch his weight. I found the movie a bit funny because he was trying to be super cool when he wasn't. <br /> <br /> If you don't take this movie too seriously and watch it while you're drunk with some friends, you may also have a good time, but probably not in the way it was intended. This film is certainly not a 9/10, but it is worth looking for a laugh keeping in mind that it was made with a very low budget and in all honesty is due to the merit of those involved in its production.
