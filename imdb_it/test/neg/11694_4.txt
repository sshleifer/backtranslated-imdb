From the applause obtained I expected more from a Korean horror film if it will be seen in the same caliber as A Tale of Two Sisters, as some other reviews have stated. This film is not of the same caliber, except in the budget spent on special effects. Think of the horror Amytiville. With a tree and scattered dialogues. <br /> <br /> If you intend to have a movie with limited dialogues, the plot and the characters must bring the movie. This film could have been told quite well in a 30-minute short-film concept, 2 hours with a lot of fixed trees and terror scenes that make you not only not scared, but belittle "What the ... it's not a good horror movie. <br /> <br /> Those people who claim that this film gave them lasting impressions must literally have a heart attack when decent horror movies hide it.
