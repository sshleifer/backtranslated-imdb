They say that David Duchovny took six days to write the script for this film. It seems legit. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I saw Gigli. It's not as bad as Gigli, but it's like saying that Saddam Hussein wasn't as bad as Adolf Hitler. <br /> <br /> Tom Warshaw lived in France with his French wife and 13-year-old son. He pretended to be French all this time. It reveals to his wife that he is actually American. For some reason, this is a shocking revelation for her, despite having always commented on her husband's American accent. Furthermore, their son - he remembers, was born in France and never knew his father was an American - he speaks perfect English without a hint of French accent. This is just one of the many holes in the plot of this film. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is a flashback to Tommy's youth in New York in the 1970s, as he explains to his wife why it was hidden in France. His best friend as a boy was Pappas, a retarded adult played terribly by Robin Williams. I assume that Duchovny thinks that "retarded" is someone who is simply stupid, because sometimes Pappas exits slightly slowly, while at other times he comes out just like Robin Williams. Yes, Williams really fits his tired impromptu slap even though he should play a mentally slow person. <br /> <br /> Tommy's mother, played by Duchovny's wife, Tea Leoni, is a nurse full of pills who is upset over her husband's recent death. Leoni does a good job, but mostly he smokes a lot and shouts at Tommy for things that don't seem to be too important. The script didn't give her much work. Tommy also makes friends with a lady (whom he calls "Lady") who is in prison and offers advice through his prison window (this detention house is called "House of D" in short, then the title). Tommy has no problem screaming his personal problems aloud on a city street, so this jailed criminal can offer advice, and he does it so often without care. <br /> <br /> I don't want to bore you with the whole film summary, but in this film there are plenty of holes in the plot that try too hard to be moving but it turns out like, well, bad. Really very bad. Really very bad. Towards the end of this railway disaster, the script becomes thicker and cornier and ends with a ridiculous and lousy ending. <br /> <br /> The critics ripped "House of D" apart and rightly. I can't believe some people like this movie. It's a painful movie to sit in and I felt weak after - not for emotion, but for how terrible it was.
