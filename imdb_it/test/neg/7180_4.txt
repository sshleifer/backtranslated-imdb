This movie doesn't work. There are no two ways to do this. I saw it for the first time in '98 when it was released and I didn't like it. I just bought it for sale a couple of days ago, because I thought "heck, I'll try." I don't regret the money I spent on Hamilton, but the fact remained the same .. this film is useless, boring and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Stormare is usually a pleasure, but that's when it's making movies in the United States. Back home she doesn't do the trick. Of course, the film is well done (if you forget the strange movie here and there), but in the end the only thing that REALLY raises Hamilton over a star-shaped garbage, is the time of Hamill as the bad Hawkins. He was seriously amused with the character and is also responsible for the only two good moments of the film .. "The Swedish intelligence, eh? Now there is a contradiction in terms" and when he allows Hamilton to have a word or two with his wife the phone towards the end of the film. And this is really enough. <br /> <br /> ** / *****
