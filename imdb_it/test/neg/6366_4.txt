Tom is about to slip into a delicious Jerry sandwich when a huge bird of prey swoops down and flies off with his snack. Not at all happy to have his sarnie stolen right under his nose, Tom launches himself in pursuit, determined to retrieve his piece of mousy. <br /> <br /> As much as you love Tom and Jerry, I have to say that this is a bit smelly: the story is rather trivial; introduces a peripherally ill-conceived character without charm; and plagues the old 'dressed cartoon character as a woman' gag to death. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the rivals of 'Flirty Birdy' 'Fraidy Cat' and 'Mouse in Manhattan' for the title of Tom and Jerry's weakest boss so far.
