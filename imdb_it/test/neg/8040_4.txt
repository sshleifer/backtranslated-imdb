1st watched 29/10/2006 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Stephenson): A pleasantly amusing story about a group of five children forced to live with their eccentric uncle while their father and mother fight and work in the first war world England entered the war. They are told not to go to the uncle's villa, which they obviously do over and over again, and discover a sand fairy who wants them every day until the sun goes down. This is the "IT" referred to in the title, created by the Jim Henson group and voiced by Eddie Izzard. The problem is that their desires usually lead to other problems they should learn from. This part of the film is not done very well because it is obvious that children, first and foremost the character of Freddie Highmore, do not learn from them but instead return to "it" to solve their next big problem. "IT" is not as fun as it could have been with comedian Eddie Izzard has not really had many opportunities to improvise and Kenneth Branagh is wasted as the eccentric uncle, even if he is the best character. The children are fine with regards to their acting skills, but the story probably would have been much better to go into the realm of fantasy, but they also had a human story to tell, which probably caused confusion with the directors. So all in all, this was an OK movie, but it could have been a lot better.
