Since Roger Corman attached his name to this production, I had high hopes for this film. Corman has directed many memorable low-budget horror thrillers in the 1960s. I particularly liked his adaptations of Poe stories like "The House Of Usher" and "The Pit And Pendulum" and "The Raven" which played the late great Vincent Price. These films had a solid acting, atmosphere, suspense, strong characterization, intriguing plot development and offered some chilling moments. Unfortunately, "House Of The Damned", for the most part, sacrifices these qualities instead of the special low-cost style effects, free nudity and carefree blood spiced with clichés of fast changes and camera angles. <br /> <br /> Of The Damned "begins in an interesting way with some beautiful shots set in Ireland, but it's directly downhill from here. Unfortunately, instead of spending some time creating atmosphere, create characters whose we might worry or create suspense, the director opts to start calculating the number of victims.After a brief introduction to the protagonists, a young couple and their daughter, the public spends the balance of the film bounced from a "spooky" event to a other than, in this film, it replaces a coherent development of the plot. The main characters are so ill-conceived and are so poorly interpreted: the public don't care what happens to them. convincing due to special effects with low technological budget The soundtrack was removed from "The Omen". The plot, what little there is, borrows heavily from "Poltergeist" and "The Legen d Of Hell House ", but lacks all the qualities that made these films convincing. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in seeing the haunted ghost movies well, I suggest you take a look at classics like "The Haunting (1963)", "The Innocents" (1961) or watch the first American films of Corman and pass on "House Of The Damned" unless you are masochist or unreasonable. <br /> <br /> 3 ½ on 10. <br /> <br /> Rob Rheubottom <br /> <br /> Wpg, MB.
