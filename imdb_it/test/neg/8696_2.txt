For a truly wonderful film, you can also try watching the film on St. Francis of Assisi - good for any audience. The best thing I liked about this film was the Mexican landscape, and the film comes to 2. I was surprised that these actors did not have a terrible burn, they were not desert inhabitants. And it is said that Moses has an obstacle to the word, but certainly not here. Even the "miracle" scenes were invented and not credible. And what's the point if you can believe something in a television story? Speaking of stupidity, I thought this Hallmark movie was pathetic, and I can understand why others hate Hollywood. Not me, just some of these business profits entrepreneurs. You don't have to be any type of religious to benefit from "Jesus of Nazareth", but for this waste of celluloid you have to be bored, with nothing to do, without words and religious. And for a real cinematic experience, try "Short Cut to Nirvana", a much appreciated film.
