EVAN ALMIGHTY (2007) ** Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennett, John Goodman, Wanda Sykes, John Michael Higgins, Jonah Hill, Molly Shannon, Ed Helms, (Cameo: Jon Stewart as himself) Ripped 'sequel' to "BRUCE ONNIPOTENTE" with the eccentric tyrant of Carell Evan Baxter who leaves the TV to begin his freshman period when a congressional representative has his hands full when God (Freeman resumes his sacred role , Jim Carrey wisely avoided the "call") demands that he build an ark like Noah and the hilarity follows (or should have). The script by God Odekerk by Steve Oedekerk, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow is absolutely lame and only the lovable person of Carell transcends his vain Evan into something resembling a human being. The end result is a lot of bird poop gags and a swollen general (referring to $ 175 M for CGI F / X). Sykes steals the show as Evan's sarcastic assistant. Sacrilegiously unfunny. (Dir: Tom Shadyac)
