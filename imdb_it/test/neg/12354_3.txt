Charlie Chaplin responds to open auditions at Lodestone Studios. The rival Ben Turpin arrives in the same studio, obviously another unemployed comedian! Turpin tries to buzz on Chaplin's action after the studio's head hollers, "Next!" Chaplin still manages to get past Turpin. Charlie is amused to compromise the work as an actor and carpenter. In the end, can you take a big break, but will a star be born? <br /> <br /> There are lots of jokes involving the buttocks. The initial scene involving Chapplin's and Turpin's slapstick is a relative highlight. Note that Gloria Swanson is the typist in the far left background on the screen, in the opening of the film. Agnes Ayres also appears. <br /> <br /> *** His new work (02/01/15) Charles Chaplin ~ Charlie Chaplin, Ben Turpin, Charlotte Mineau
