Both my wife and I remember that this film is much better than it is. When we rented it last weekend, we wondered if we were watching the same movie we had seen 22 years ago. We both agreed that we were probably remembering the TV series, which, in its one-hour segments, had been forced to finish the lines of the plot. This film leaves many hints, as has already been said by others here ... in practice, the plot of each main character is not resolved. <br /> <br /> I like how the title song, though.
