Sacred Heart combines glossy cinematographic effects with a texture that leaves much to be desired. With a script that the writers of "Touched by an Angel" could have revealed too impudent, Ozpetek sometimes keeps us interested. In fact, I wanted to focus on the positive aspects, but I found the last act so bafflingly bizarre and terrible that I think the couple who died at the beginning may have been the lucky one. <br /> <br /> This film is about (pun intended) a story built on a big twist style ending. This kind of tenuous foundation can result in a huge success like A Pure Formality of Tornatore or immense garbage like the films of M. Night Shyamalan. Sacred Heart falls a little closer to the latter. I found cinematography in general above the average. The photos of Irene who diligently followed her daily laps in the pool were very impressive, as was the atmosphere created from inside her mother's house. For me, the grotesque parody of Michelangelo's Piet√† when Giancarlo enters from the rain and Irene poses with him was a little lengthened. A big problem that I made an exception in this film was Ozpetek's method of simply turning the camera directly into the face of his protagonist and recording the emotions that occur. This worked with fantastic effects in front Windows, but when used here it seems that Bubolova is not a noon. In fact, in addition to the ridiculous story, the main problem with this film is the extraordinary performance of its main character. It made the final scene even more inconceivably bad. <br /> <br /> In this film, Ozpetek continues his crusade against our company-led societies pushing us to be more spiritual (not necessarily religious) and more selfless. And while I'm certainly one who is very sympathetic to this point of view, I felt like the audience was hit on the head with a blunt object. Could the characters be more two-dimensional? I tended to find this film very unnerving and soulless. Was the "bad" aunt Eleonora more than a caricature? It also applies to people on the "right" side, such as the "good" Aunt Maria Clara and the elderly goalkeeper Aurelio. And in case we had lost Ozpetek's point of view, he decided to dress his opposing forces with their liveries. <br /> <br /> This brings me to an interesting point about the use of color by the director. He dresses the married couple who for a moment takes off in black, like Irene (when we meet her for the first time and after the conversion of her life), the wicked aunt Eleonora and, of course, the good but confused Father Carras . Black is a color that suggests a defined path, the mind of the wearer is set and without emotions. It is the color chosen for that essential piece of modern armor, the suit. It is also the color of mourning, like the fake funerary outfit of the suicidal couple. Finally, black is the color of piety, like the simple clothes of priests and nuns that Irene emulates in the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> The other main color, and a very appropriate choice for a film about the sacred heart, is red. It is a color that has an extreme intrinsic emotional component. The character wearing red is bold, emotional, receptive to new ideas and indulgent. Red is a risky color in modern times; challenges our perceptions of the wearer and at the same time makes the wearer vulnerable. Yet red has an enormous weight of history and mysticism, since the first members of the Cro-Magnon man buried their dead in red ocher and in fact the first man named in the Torah, Adam, takes its name from the Hebrew word for indicate red. Red also has an anachronistic flavor, looking to the past where red (and by association a less direct attitude towards life) was more accepted. So when we meet the room full of red (the mysterious wall covered by a frieze complete with red accented menorah and a red painting by a Rotating Dervish!) Of Irene's mother, the "good" characters Maria Clara and Aurelio wear bright red dresses , and finally the painting of Irene's mother in a formal red dress we can see where Ozpetek's sympathies are. <br /> <br /> A word or two on the soundtrack, I found the original musical themes to be perfectly suited to the story. The almost baroque theme that characterized Irene was great for its monotony and its feeling of restless malaise (the best use of a constantly repeated Baroque theme like this should be in Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, with his masterly repetitions of a 8-bar sarabanda attributed to Handel). An absolutely inspired choice was a couple of seconds of an opera aria that we hear as the power flickers as Irene chases Benny through the house. It is of the famous aria "Ebben? ... I will go far" from Catalani's opera "La Wally". The air is sung by the main soprano who is leaving the house forever. Since Irene's mother was a dramatic soprano, we can assume that this is a recording of her singing and is saying a moving farewell to her daughter, since in the film Irene is soon destined to never see Benny again. I just have a little question about the soundtrack, why include the famous Yo Soy Maria tango? I love the song and personally I always felt it, but it didn't really fit here.
