Despite all its marvelous images, for all its good intentions, this is presented as another disgustingly one-sided, excessively glorified and self-promoting propaganda. <br /> <br /> The message is simple, "All Japanese fighting on the Kokoda Track were sadistic and mischievous sticks that amused themselves by gutting every Australian troop, cutting their throats before beheading them." Kokoda not only notices the imperfection of "Gallipoli" (which the enemy is faceless, nameless and apparently inhuman), but manages to demonstrate exactly the opposite of Weir's masterpiece. Instead of giving us a perfect movie with only one flaw, we have a horrible mess with a ransom function. <br /> <br /> Let's start with this: we are, without any comfortable adaptation to the characters, presented to these apparently quite relaxed, two-dimensional people that we never ... NEVER get to sympathize with. We are kept at such a distance that even when we could easily relate to the characters, they find a way to keep us away. Only this is a disgusting aspect, because it pushes us from the plot itself, helps the horrible rhythm to leave us a lasting impression, and makes it much easier to see the contrast between an openly sentimental ending and an otherwise dull body of a film. <br /> <br /> In other words, it takes us on a painful journey (not just for us, but apparently for them) and just as it should end, we are thrown into another eye-roller of a skirmish that ends faster than it began. So, for the moment still uninformed: when it should end, start again, only to finish when we expect more. S ***! It's just a confusing and distressing rhythm! <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the ultimatum: this is meant to educate us about the events of the Kokoda track. It doesn't come close. Not only does he detail a very small and insignificant part of the campaign (spreading some "mateship" on the top in an attempt to make it relevant), but he manages to do the only thing a film is as important as it should be, it doesn't worry us . <br /> <br /> Honestly, my eyes were constantly glued to my watch all the time. The public around me, all proudly Australian, arguing as it was the film, moaned, moaned and whimpered with disappointment as all the painful ninety-five minutes kept playing (for a short period of time, it seemed Apocalypse Now: the difference is that Apocalypse Now was a good film and deserved the three hours obtained) and to the point that suicide could be an alternative, if it were mandatory for this film to be seen. > <br /> Although, considering how much TV has advertised this garbage, I would say that it is mandatory, in a subliminal sense. <br /> <br /> See if you like beautiful images. Even if you better watch The Constant Gardener or Gallipoli anyway, since they have a superior cinematography and ACTUAL plots. <br /> <br /> Overall: *
