I never intended to write a review of this film. Actually I was just looking for the name of the movie star and then I started reading reviews ... I guess I'll never learn. This movie is horrible! I'm not going to justify my comments with specific reasons, because I find it really hard to believe that someone with some taste actually LENS this. A guilty pleasure? Ok, I guess. But such a bad film that has wasted so much talent (Caine, Gelbart and Donen) is a cause for mourning, not a pleasant diversion. A low point for all the involved parties except perhaps Bologna, who has to get up at night trying to figure out which bomb was the bomb that destroyed his career.
