There is something in a film that sees female bodybuilders putting me in front of the screen every time. <br /> <br /> I saw "Pumping Iron II", "Aces: Iron Eagle III", "Raven Hawk" and even the TV movie "Getting Physical", which saw some big names in sports. They were tolerable in their own way (especially because Rachel McLish, ROWWR !!) were present. <br /> <br /> Then I went to look at "Nemesis III: Prey Harder", based on the fact that he presented luminaries like Sue Price, Debbie Muggli, Sharon Bruneau and Ursula Sarcev. I love girls, I will always do that, but after this I'm a little happy to have lost the first two "Nemesis" movies. <br /> <br /> Well, the first one, anyway. Most of the footage here is raised physically (and kicking and screaming, I'd say) from "Nemesis II". In fact, that seemed marginally fun from the evidence provided here. <br /> <br /> But even if Price and the company behave flexibly, they don't have much chance of doing something else (like, for example, ACT!). In fact, this entire film is an exercise (Get it? Ha-ha ...) in stories of oblique stories, ambiguous characters and film-making indefinitely (in terms of shooting and story-line). <br /> <br /> Nothing makes much sense, but even if it did, there would still be problems, such as making such small parts for women as big as these. What a crime. <br /> <br /> Of course, it was written and directed by Albert Pyun, so what did you expect: cohesion? <br /> <br /> A single star, considering all the hard work that Price, Muggli, Bruneau and Sarcev obviously put into their bodies, NOT the "artisanal" work done in the film itself. <br /> <br /> Thank you, sir.
