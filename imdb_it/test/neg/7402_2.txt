Dresden had high expectations because of its spectacular theme and its high budget. I really didn't look forward to it and I really wanted it to be beautiful ... but it's not. The only positive thing is the special effects that are very well done, but, like in a bad Hollywood blockbuster, everything else is missing. <br /> <br /> It is poorly written, the script tries to satisfy the rules of the genre with standard elements of suspense / love story, but there is no depth or originality. It is far below average. The next thing: it's also misdirected. It has this style of uninspiring television direction with lots of close-ups and wants to be great action with a fast editing where in reality no action or suspense is. The actors are not bad, but there is no performance that touches in any way. <br /> <br /> I don't know ... obviously they try to make a typical TV movie and not a movie for the cinema, where it's always nice to have some edges and a clear visual style. But why are they trying to fulfill the typical Hollywood trade rules? it really looks like the writer did a weekend lesson with an American scriptwriter guru and then he made this mess. Isn't there a producer who is responsible for the project that has an interest in dramaturgy / visual style or simply for this magical cinematic moment that makes TV-Movies fantastic?!? Do they think a TV audience is stupid and doesn't need to get a high quality movie experience? The Downfall was a great example for a good TV movie, but there was probably a manager or producer who knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time with this, rent "ruins" instead of ...
