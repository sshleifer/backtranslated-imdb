"Marathon" has a very interesting premise, excellent ambient sounds and a good scenario. Unfortunately, the film, apart from these aspects, collapses on his face. For a woman who tries to complete so many crosswords in a day, she spends a lot of time hanging around, pouting and not doing riddles. I believe that in the film there are more paths of his work on these puzzles. Also, while I understand the point of showing so many scenarios, there is simply too much too much. The film is incredibly boring and blurry. It is not worth buying it, renting it, watching it on television or viewing it in any imaginable way. I lost interest so quickly that I'm not sure why I listened to the whole movie in the first place.
