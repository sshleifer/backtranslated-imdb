yes..this is what the statement of non-responsibility of the station states after the advertisements of this show "some scenes can disturb some spectators". <br /> <br /> It is beyond all limits. The validation of all this demonstration of ego fragmentation and chauvinism is in the fact that it is on the COMEDY channel. Yes .. a real and true comedy. A JOKE. Seeing these "playas" go through their rigid farce really means what's wrong with society. Especially the bar scene in the meat market. Both sides, the male and the female, are equally weak and desperate to mix in this superficial atmosphere. The club is obviously one of those plastic coke scenes sponsored by the Cigarette corporation. These people have a choice, and that's what makes it even more a joke. <br /> <br /> These slick ricks try too hard. They shine with their own groove fat. All right. It's a videotape lesson for the new generation of how NOT to focus on a potential interest of the heart. We hope that that facade crumbles together with the Bush / Harper administrations. The problem is, who is in line after these characters have vanished? Are the bastard children of a night?
