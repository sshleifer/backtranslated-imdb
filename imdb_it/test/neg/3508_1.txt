The slogan of the film is "You think you know who you are. You have no idea." I reject both the suggested idea that I have no idea who I am and the inferred suggestion that this film tells me who people really are. If people in real life are really like that, then buddy, we're screwed. <br /> <br /> A bilious film in which I entered late and left prematurely. A film that is so committed to the goal of becoming The Race Film of all time that it loses sight of the same tools that a film must use. <br /> <br /> The rules of Hollywood are such: if you show something in the first half, it must be used in the second half. So the gun the daughter cares about buying her father will somehow find her way into history in the second half. The rules of Hollywood must make dialogue "real", a concept that changes every decade. Is this "real dialogue" somewhat less ridiculous than Kevin Smith's "real dialogue" ten years ago? The Hollywood rules state that we set the scene, and as the action goes up, the camera approaches the faces - in this film mainly so that we can see the supposed shame, humiliation and transcendental realism of the characters. The strings increase, the frame rate slows down, and our heart is bound to break. <br /> <br /> This film is as manipulative as it is casual. I have my prejudices against L.A., which I freely admit, so to combat this prejudice I will not say that this is a natural situation arising from the place, but probably from the author and the director. The writer, Paul Haggis, has already shown a taste for the controversy over humanity in his Million Dollar Baby, which at least had a director who understood how to make the vision of the film bring out the best ideas from a script. Now that Paul Haggis has his hands on the camera, it becomes obvious that not only does he not know how to write a natural human drama, true, he does not know how to photograph it or direct it. Paul Haggis comes from the land of TV, let's not forget: the land of reduced expectations. <br /> <br /> Everything is obvious as a TV movie, presented simply for simple minds - Haggis drills us into, over and again, that while on the surface people may seem terrible, they have hidden secret pains. This is a good idea, but presented so instinctively that the whole juxtaposition of bad / good looks amateur. Structurally the film is broken, in the tradition of Magnolia and in other previous films. Editing is as typical and conventionally "cinematic" as it could be - if there is a dramatic movement, such as a door opening or a car passing between the subject and the camera, publishers use that extreme movement to give the cut that happens there a more kinetic quality. The problem is that in addition to the drive to keep things moving, there is little intelligence and thought behind the cuts - everything is kept by the books. Not only do the puppets of this horrible fist and judy show inept gestures, but also the curtains are lowered and raised with incompetence. <br /> <br /> The film tries desperately to present reality, but there is really no talent at all. Some of the actors are good, some actors are bad and all the performances are mixed up, caused by the low and low aesthetics of the film. We have a cinematography that is technically clear: we can see the scene, we have a clear understanding of what is happening. However, not only is cinematography irrelevant, but it is a camera and a carefree shot that believes it is actually inspired. The result is small stylistic motifs that can be recognized, but in reality they add nothing to the drama or pathos. For example - and this is a spoiler - like a father holding his dying child (even his father could be killed, I didn't watch) the camera sees his face and gives us the famous Vertigo track / zoom. The Vertigo shot !!! It was at this point that the film became hysterical and I had to leave. I had to leave because it was so bad. I left because I was in the middle of a crowded theater, and I wanted to express to the public that I was tired of Hollywood "art", full of sounds and fury, but that meant nothing (according to the same words as the Bard). I hate to waste such good Shakespearean references on something very serious.
