Ok, I thought it would be horrible. But when I saw it ... I proved wrong. Emily Bergl did a great job as Jason London. Sue Snell was underutilized and under-written. The meanies were ok, Dylan Bruno and Rachel Blanchard are definitely the protagonists. As for the things kids do and how people say it's all wrong. Everything. My friends and I use the term "Swank" a lot and I drove a car and drove someone while I changed. It's practically all there. I've never been to an after-game party in such a big house with its very own light show .. Deaths are good. The best is about a pair of glasses, an underwater gun and a swimming pool .. all in this order. I must say that there will be people who hate him ... but I'm not one of them.
