What was Wes thinking doing this dribbling? It doesn't work well with any of his other jobs, but then again it seemed to fall into a slight decline after making an A Nightmare On Elm Street. This can be seen from his sequel 1.Invatation to Hell 2. Chiller 3. Hills Have Eyes II 4.Deadly Friend 5.Serpant and the Rainbow 6.Shocker all these films were or mediocre our crap was not until the People Under the stairs who gained his momentum and started kicking again. Chiller has none of Craven's regulars and none of his suspense. The only positive scene in which the old man has a heart attack on the stairs after making a popsicle for his work.
