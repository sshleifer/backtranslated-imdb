Having had more than a few friends suggested I check out Rise of the Footsoldier, which I eventually caught up last night. Undoubtedly the story that Colton Leach has to tell (and he did it in his autobiography) is a compelling story of a man's rise from the Terrace boy boot to the evil connected villain. This film is sadly compromised in terms of quality, misconceptions, scary accents and painful acting. Curious Harnett in the lead role of Leach does a reasonable job of conveying the shift from criminal to serious criminal, but his accent is everywhere. How his voice provides storytelling is something that after ten minutes was driving me crazy. Terry Stone in the role of Tony Tucker gave the involuntary comedy a mismatched dialogue (or the worst Barnett in progress) that was so exaggerated and riddled that it bordered on the juvenile and an excessive vehemence in line that reduced Tucker to parody. What upset me the most about this film was that the events that led to the Rettenden, Essex, and Leach formative shootings are of genuine interest to crime fans and football hooligans, so that they have this story sabotaged by a lack of credible accents and by the acting that left me feeling missed an opportunity. Roland Manookian and Frank Harper provide films with only a source of authenticity. On the positive side, some stimuli and construction of the film flowed well and attracted attention. The violence was well choreographed and, apart from an excessive reliance on the red bullet syrup for blood splatters, was overall realistic. If you enjoyed the movie, it's worth taking a look at the Essex Boys which tells a similar fictionalized story and also features Billy Murray.
