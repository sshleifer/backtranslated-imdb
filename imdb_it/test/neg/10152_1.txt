I'm not going to comment on what piece of garbage this movie has been since it was already created. Anyway, watching this with my friends, we all laughed loudly when the lead girl referred to Shelley Hack while she was on the phone. We sat there trying to figure out why the writer would throw her into the mix. We can only assume that he had a fixation on Charlie's Angels at one time. Based on this reference, we thought that this film was made around his Charlie's Angels in 1979 or 1980, but from what I read here it was made around 1987. Certainly it cannot be said from the low values ​​of production. It looks like it was made by a university student for a film class. And although in no way would I expect that a low-budget waste festival like this is politically correct, the rednecks in this film have certainly been pleased to exchange contemptuous comments about gays. Even so I would classify it only as the second worst horror film ever made, second only to "Nail Gun Massacre".
