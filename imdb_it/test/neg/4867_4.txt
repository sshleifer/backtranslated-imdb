Everything seemed quite promising. A promising presidential adviser is framed for a series of murders, as he was informed that there is a conspiracy inside the White House. The excellent Donald Sutherland is the protagonist among several capable actors. Yet very few people have a good word to say about it. <br /> <br /> The whole thing really needed a certain depth. You can take the idea that the President is too leftist with his ideas, and some within the government want him dead to prevent these ideas from being carried forward. Conrad simply seems to want the country to be governed in its own way, rather than the way of the elected leader. <br /> <br /> However, the action scenes had some logical holes - the sewers and elevators already mentioned, and the rather random killing method - and Linda Hamilton's character is completely uninspired. The "diversion" of "President my father" was ridiculous - this would have made the President about 10 years when that happened. The worst thing was still his predictable final scene with Bishop. <br /> <br /> They could have made a stimulating and inventive political thriller, but they either bottled it or failed. They could have gone to town with special effects, but the good ones were wasted. They could have achieved much more in general. This was barely worth the Â£ 1 it cost me.
