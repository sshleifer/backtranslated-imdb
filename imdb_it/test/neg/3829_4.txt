Alice Dodgson, a New York doctor gets her license suspended when she treats one of her patients with an unapproved drug, causing the patient to die. Without work, Alice is forced to go to Jamaica, where she takes care of the brother of a rich white landowner. The brother thinks he is a zombie and is deeply involved in the voodoo practices and rituals of the local people. "Ritual" is a mediocre horror film. The action is pretty boring, the twists are stupid and there's no suspense. a little blood like someone is killing whites with a machete, but not too much. Cinematography is decent, but acting is really painful. Definitely one to avoid.4 out of 10.
