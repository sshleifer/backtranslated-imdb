1st watched on 24/06/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Stefan Rujowitzky): an OK thriller, but a little too predictable. This story is based in Germany, which is also where the film was shot. This is a young medical student who gets a chance to go to a first-class school in Heidelberg and gets to see strange things that occur. Someone he met on the train there and saved, shows up on the school's experiment table and is suspecting incorrect play immediately. He makes some inquiries and the disappearance of his friend leads her into a secret society called AAA (and is not an alcoholic anonymous) that has something to do with the anti-Hippocratic oath and is used to perform experiments on real people that the doctor would not want normally is able to do. He discovers that his grandfather (who was a school principal) played an important role in putting it into practice and is quite easily filled by school members. It is an interesting story, but the problem with this film is the speed with which the public is told what is going on and then it is a kind of horror film with the heroine who fights the bad guy in the group that takes things to the next psychotic level . Although this film was made in Europe, it plays to a young American audience with its focus on gore, sex and the premiere of the horror film (which is really a great ruin) and explains why it probably made money and gave birth to a sequel but does not necessarily do it to make a good movie.
