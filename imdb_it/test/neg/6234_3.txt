I'm sorry, but I don't understand how the studio goes up in smoke with this. The film is not worth it. Maybe like a theatrical performance but certainly not like a movie! And why do they call it a thriller ??? Offcource acting is good but I did not expect anything less from these perfect actors. Robert Redford plays very well and Willem Dafoe is quite convincing as the "bad boy". Helen Mirren can play almost all the roles and always (still) she seems to me beautiful;). I'm also a fan of his British detectives. They still can't save this boring movie, I'm sorry. I hope that we will no longer get to many films from this director "Pieter Jan Brugge" because obviously he doesn't have the meaning of the words "suspense and thriller".
