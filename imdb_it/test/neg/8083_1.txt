I thought it was an Ok movie after seeing the advertisements about it. It was fun in some parts and some very bad. The only person I felt sorry for is Horatio Sans who has a hot wife who betrays him with other women. But he never had the chance to have a threesome until it went well, but they would have to get bigger through the film.
