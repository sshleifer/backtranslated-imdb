To this day, Malcolm McLaren is telling someone stupid enough to believe him that the Sex Pistols were his idea and that the band members were his puppets to use to make a living. There is a good reason to do so, which is that he is a liar. <br /> <br /> Here are some real facts. <br /> <br /> * McLaren was actually contacted by the band to be a manager, not vice versa. <br /> <br /> * The Pistols were a proper band, organic and not created by McLaren or anyone else. Jones and Cook were childhood friends. Rotten and Vicious has also come a long way. This is something that has brought unjust criticisms of the Pistols over the years as they have been compared to groups of manufactured boys. <br /> <br /> * The band and no one else wrote the songs, recorded them, played live, created the ad and released the interviews. <br /> <br /> * McLaren did not instigate the Bill Grundy incident. The guns only appeared on the program because the queen had retired. According to the band, McLaren was huddled behind in the event that arrests were taking place. <br /> <br /> * Johnny Rotten left the band. He was not fired. <br /> <br /> * Far from complying with the Sex Pistols, John Lydon (Rotten) actually mentioned him successfully in the 1980s for control and a considerable sum of money. Some of the evidence used by Lydon's lawyers was from McLaren who boasted in "The Great Rock & Roll Swindle". This would suggest that McLaren is not too bright despite its influences. <br /> <br /> * The layoffs and subsequent payments of A & M and EMI were, once again, not designed, it was simply the way things went. <br /> <br /> * McLaren has the money she earned from the band. If he had been competent, he could have done much more. It seems he hasn't even organized the concerts properly. <br /> <br /> * McLaren's statement at the beginning of the film that invented punk rock can be denied in about ten seconds. The Pistols were not the first punk band, only the highest profile. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible film. The only parts worth looking at are the original footage of the band, later used much better in "The Filth And The Fury".
