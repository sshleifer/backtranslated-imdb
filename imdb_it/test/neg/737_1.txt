We really don't know where to start talking about this movie. But we'll start with the plot. We sincerely suspect that anyone who has written / produced / directed this film has never read the book. Because they lost the whole point. SATIRICO, not horror. Just a suggestion. Second, the bathroom scene. Enough said. Third, the added characters. The sketchy gothic French lady and her black page that enjoys holding hands and making the wheel. We don't understand where this comes from. And then there was the casting. Everyone was really unlikely. We were very disappointed that Catherine and Mr. Tilney ended up together because they were so unlikely that no one would ever want to see them happy. And the music. We think the BBC producers have run out of money, so they broke into their grandmother's attic. And they found some old records. Saxophone, plaintive female vocals and an occasional electric guitar. * shudder * <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the best line ever: "Since you left, the white rose bush died of grief". If anyone has any explanation, we'd love to hear it. Because it makes absolutely no sense. <br /> <br /> We're still wondering what everyone was thinking about when they cruelly released this pathetic excuse of a movie about the public. We think it should be considered a federal crime. Torture is illegal. <br /> <br /> This film is by far the worst we have seen to date. And I've seen a lot of movies. <br /> <br /> Our recommendation: give this movie who hates you. They will watch and want to kill themselves. And we agree with a previous post, we would give this 0 stars, if possible. DO NOT LOOK!! And we strongly suspect that all those who have commented so far in favor of this film have been involved in its production. Or they were mentally crazy. These are the only reasons why we were able to provide that they would give a favorable review.
