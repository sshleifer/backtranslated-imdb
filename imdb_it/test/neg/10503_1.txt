OK, normally I'm fascinated by Z's films. Some actors, directors, writers, etc. In those films they have a bit of talent. They want to unleash that talent so unfortunately for them, they have to associate with lousy people to make their films. But some Z movies have at least one thing that can be remarkable about them. <br /> <br /> Not here. <br /> <br /> As soon as I saw it I thought ... "Wow, a Blade knock-off." Believe me, if this movie could live up to that label that would make the movie a movie best. <br /> <br /> Instead I was subjected to some of the most horrible performances I have ever seen in my life. Master Kao was mean, so bad that I think some of my neurons in my brain exploded trying to understand his acting. I'm still trying to make sense of his enunciation and why he would have raised his voice to utter certain words ... to add a dramatic effect, I'm sure ... but it was for no apparent reason. Simply stunning. <br /> <br /> Oh and then there's the black guy in the purple cape near the end of the movie. The purple cloak fights the hero for about 30 seconds, but it's so bad that he really looks like he's afraid of fighting. <br /> <br /> The main hero and the main villain have done decent jobs. The main hero (Derek Washington) really seemed to know martial arts.
