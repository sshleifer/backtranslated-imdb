Okay, this movie could have been good if there was a plot behind it. the title did not fit even after the first ten minutes. the wind didn't have much to do with the rest of the film. the acting was sub-par and the writing reminded me of something you would read in a children's book of scary stories. <br /> <br /> regarding horror movies, this should not even be classified as one. this was a shame for fans of horror and thriller around the world. I hate being so hard but I felt the need to spend time watching this movie. hopefully there will be no follow-up to this. this film should be locked in a safe and never released to the public for viewing.
