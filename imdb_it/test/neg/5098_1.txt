Set in the mid-1800s, when the British are liberating New Zealand from the wild hinterland to establish colonies. The daughter of a British army surgeon, Sarah (Samantha Morton), falls in love with the son of one of the Maori leaders. The Maori is an indigenous tribe and a dangerous people with whom Europeans must confront. When Sarah's baby, whom she calls "Boy", was born, her father died. At the age of six, "Boy" is kidnapped by his father's family and Sarah will begin his search for him with a man (Kiefer Sutherland), who is deeply in love with her. <br /> <br /> Twice The Oscar nominee Morton is definitely the star of this film. Sutherland is a total waste. Also present are Cliff Curtis, Stephen Rea, Temuera Morrison and David Rawiri Pene. This film is voted R for some sexual content and violent battle scenes. I find the title RIVER QUEEN very misleading and the DVD cover with Sutherland alone and making you believe he is the main star should be a crime.
