This film is a cyborg in and of itself: half nonsense / half Lifetime Original Movie. <br /> <br /> Like a cyborg, this film has only one goal: to make you wish you had spent the movie in a dark room with fists in your testicles. <br /> <br /> Unlike most people, I didn't rent this movie because of Angelina Jolie (I'll explain why I rented it soon). I'm not a big fan of Ms. Jolie, although I'll say that her performance was stellar! His blank stare and his robotic acting made me believe he was an android prostitute. If anyone has a clip on "Inside the Actor's Studio" explaining how they prepared for this role, please send it my way. I'll make sure to use it when I'm looking for James Lipton for Crimes against Integrity. <br /> <br /> So what prompted me to rent this movie? You might think it was the hope of seeing Angelina Jolie's nipples, but it wasn't. No, the reason for this rental was based exclusively on one of the images on the cover of the DVD; that of Jack Palance's face! THE HALF OF HIS FACE HAS BEEN ROBOTICS! When I saw it, I imagined that legions of "Palances" marched slowly through a fiery earth, devastating any foolish man to resist. In my mind, every member of this Unholy Army of Palances had a fiery red eye; a bright red eye that looked at humans and saw only "flesh". They must have been the architects of Oblivion ... a cold and steel Apocalypse ... a nightmare from which humanity would never have awakened. It is a beautiful image that I will keep until the end of my years. <br /> <br /> Like most things in my life, the film did not live up to my expectations. No, there was only one "Jack Palance" and the only visible cybernetic improvements he had were located on his legs. Unfortunately, these improvements have not really "improved" anything. This unless you consider WALKING LIKE A POLIO VICTIM as a superpower. At least theirs was a scene in which Jack - grinning like an Alzheimer's patient - managed to shoot some people to death. I was waiting for him to shout "I'm damn tired of paying too much for prescribed drugs!" Unfortunately, any outbreak of geriatric anger was small. <br /> <br /> What the film had in abundance was an undeveloped love story about a man (Elias Koteas, aka De Niro of the poor) and a cyborg (Angelina Jolie, aka Demon Spawn of John Voigt ). Oh man, can the love between Romeo of Flesh and a Giulietta of Silicon ever last?!?!?! If you follow the simple advice of Jack Palance, you can do it: "You have to TASTE the TIME each other". <br /> <br /> Yes, I'm not sure what it means. However, I'm sure I don't want Jack Palance to be the only one to explain it to me. I'm sure he doesn't want him to show me! As an experiment, I suggest you ask your significant other if he / she "thinks we have reached a level in our relationship where we can begin to KNOW each other TIME?"
