Lets be realistic here. This is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. My Wife and Kids showed a true promise in its first season and only then did it go downhill. It is so ugly that words do not describe. The acting and writing are so terrible on a consistent basis I wonder if Damon Wayans is producing an atrocious show on purpose. From top to bottom every show is ridiculous. Damon Wayans calls him completely and George Gore II is so horrible that I shudder at every overly recited line. Can anyone really watch this show and find it to be fun and fun? Please, I beg you. Don't watch this show. As soon as TV affiliates stop collecting it in syndication, we can finally get rid of this absolute garbage.
