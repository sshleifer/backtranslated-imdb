Waters' contribution to the world of cinema must be sought with a telescope, and therefore when / if something is found (purely by chance and very fortunate) it must be analyzed under a microscope. <br /> <br /> And after being analyzed, it would have been discarded in the "laboratory dustbin for totally useless things". A single atom of that microscope is worth all his films put together. <br /> <br /> CB is ethereally campy, and intentionally so. The usual JW stuff: comic dialogues, simplistic plot, morally cheerful characters, chewing-gum pop, excitement etc. Waters knows he is not capable of making a quality film, so he hides behind the mask of the "intentionally poor" -maker "film - which presumably makes him a special type of" anti-artist. "But in the world of cinema, being an anti-talent is often mistaken for talent, which is exactly what Waters had hoped for - and eventually achieved. It's a scam. Charlatans infest the world of cinema and modern pop art, it's a plague. <br /> <br /> Maybe we blame John Waters for inspiring Baz Luhrman to make all those horrible and stupid dudes.It's like a virus: a Waters creates five new bad directors, and these five each create more, and so on. With "Dancer In The Dark"? Can that bomb really be overcome?
