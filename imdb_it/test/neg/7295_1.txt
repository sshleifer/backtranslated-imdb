If you saw Atlantis 1, then you would know that what made this film truly exceptional was a brilliant animation and a good script. This film was so drawn and animated in a dislocated way. History is also boring. I was so disappointed by this half-baked braggart that I couldn't get over the first hour, and MAN tried! The only thing this film had was to expand the "mole" character, making it more likeable and three-dimensional. Take it from me, judge this garbage from the cover of the video box. The cover is poorly designed by Disney Schlock, clearly grabbing for an easy dollar by an unsuspecting parent. If this were a film in its own right, it wouldn't be so bad, but riding on the shores of a brilliant piece like Atlantis makes it absolutely unforgivable.
