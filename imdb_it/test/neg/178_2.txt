I don't understand why this film received such good ratings from critics - I saw dozens of documentaries (on TV) about the world of wine that were much better when (if) you look at it, please think of two very annoying aspects of Mondovino: first place, the filming is simply horrible and terrible and upsetting: for me, it seemed that the guy behind the camera had just received the material and was playing with it: a lot of zoom (for no other purpose than to press the button in / out) for example - - I almost stopped watching it for this! secondly, the interviewer (the director I believe) is not very pertinent: he looks and asks questions like a boy scout, not a journalist, even if the general idea and the themes would have been interesting, too much conclusion: the overvalued documentary, maybe only for guys who know nothing about wine => not recommended at all (2/10)
