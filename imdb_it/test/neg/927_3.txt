The third film based on the play by Charles Belden entitled "The mystery of the wax museum" (1933) aims at the X-tasy generation. The two screenwriters, Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes, spend more time developing the main characters of other slasher films: a promising start. Their conditions guarantee an authentic point of view. The role of Paige (Paris Hilton) was not much for the world's favorite heiress. He writes "In Style", a striptease, boys, chatting on a cell, and agitates about a badly conceived pregnancy. His regular routine has been irreparably changed. Hilton reached the pinnacle of her performance - not so hot - during the parody "1 night in Paris" (2004). While the pimp-my-ride is moving, she seeks zealous "lip balm" in her boyfriend's (Robert Ri'chard) womb. Finally, the actress "atona" for using the word "N" on the sex tape. The director Jaume Collet-Serra shapes his interpretation of the twin thing contrary to the theme of the past. Each showed opposite characteristics, then, while a pair of good or bad can leave the uterus today. However, the latter does not exclude the former. Childbirth is the luck of the draw. Viewers can hardly consider Vincent (Brian Van Holt) a contemporary Quasimodo. Of course, inmates share some similarities like art, disfigurement, submission and murder. However, a small variable between the two makes the difference. Vincent is even uglier inside him than outside. The "House of Wax" by Collet-Serra pays tribute to actor Vincent Price from the first remake of 1953. The film leaves obvious Van Gogh games to the public's imagination. However, the choice to divide the antagonist into two eliminates a vibrant turn at the end. Professor Henry (Vincent Price) The unmasking of Jarrod receives the runner-up, but the most terrifying one in the history of horror film belongs to Lon Chaney in "Phantom of the Opera" (1925). As for the new competitor, the consequences of separation surgery minimize the effect. A surgeon should know that they operate on Siamese twins, healing them - physically and psychologically. Their father needs to call in a couple of colleagues - Dr. Phil to consult and Dr. McNamara to cut down / fold. Despite what the trailers said, "Wax" is not forever. In fact, you can get rid of it by burning it.
