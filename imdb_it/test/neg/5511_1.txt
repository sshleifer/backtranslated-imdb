I tried to remember the name of this film for years (not consecutively, of course). I saw it at the local dollar when I was 11, and it was so atrocious that I almost went out; I think I didn't realize that it was allowed to leave before the movie ended. However, I have remained in my mind as the worst movie I saw growing. I can finally give the vote it deserves. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (which was strangely satisfying)
