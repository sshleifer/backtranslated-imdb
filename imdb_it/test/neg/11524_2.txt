I rented this movie because I'm a big Dudikoff fan. I thought it couldn't be that bad. Boy was I wrong! At the 15 minute minute, I was begging the others to have the DVD ripped off and sent back to the rental shop, but they refused. They swore he had to improve. <br /> <br /> They were wrong! This film lacked everything. The actors expressed their lines with the same emotions of a coma rock! The plot was ridiculous and it offended me that Hollywood thought people were stupid enough to enjoy it. None of the characters interacted very well with each other. Ice-T gives one of its worst performances here. <br /> <br /> After seeing the shots of the wrong plane, the bad guys who got up to get shot and the clips that emptied and lacked everything, I wanted to scream and slam my head on concrete. The film touched its plateau of ignorance when people on the space station used an elevator to travel. Spacesuits are not necessary and there is gravity in space, regardless of what the real astronauts might say. <br /> <br /> I didn't finish this movie and I hated it. I don't want to finish this movie. This is a slow suicide. I could feel my cerebral cortex planning to avenge the torture I put in place.
