Well, finally a vision of this undervalued film. But you can't find a good copy, a terrible copy full of green drops, the montage is not synchronized, the sound sometimes has that terrible hiss and sometimes you can even hear the camera recording. Overall it's too dark, a lifetime of time you should say but it's not. It's a bit slow, the first half of the movie talks and makes love to each other. It is still strange that girls in 1960s movies never wear a bra. When they enter the bedroom it is full glory. However, banned in the UK since 84 and still on the video nasties list. The reason is simple, it is bloody for their time. It really has some ugly dismemberment and somehow it is creepy due to the fact that it is filmed in a handycam mode. So every shot the image is moving, the things they do these days with steadycam. The Ghastly Ones could have been better if the quality of the film was better, but still better than other films of the time like Schoolgirls In Chains.
