Sometimes when a movie is crumpled by the critics, you just have to see it to see if it's as bad as the complaint, well, in this case it was. I think it was meant to be a sexual comedy but it was neither sexy nor fun, I think I giggled once when Johnny Vegas couldn't get over a fence by the wayside and that's it. <br /> <br /> The film follows the lives of four men who deliver potatoes to live, each of them has a problem with their sex life; Dave left his wife and looks for an old flame that had once invited him for a trio a few years earlier, Ferris lives with his mother-in-law who treats him as a sexual object, Tolly has an obsession with involving strawberry jam in his Meetings and Jeremy claims to be in a loving relationship but in reality he is persecuting a poor woman. <br /> <br /> The tone of the lines varies from tasteless to "I don't think anyone can write that" an example of the second is when they tell a small child that his father died in a car accident, then for the final joke when the boy asks how his mom is telling him he is in a coma. The fault of all this lands exactly at the feet of the writers, the actors obviously made a wrong choice by agreeing to be in this film, but I didn't think their acting had been so bad ... not that it was all so good. Surprisingly for a rather shabby movie about sex there is no nakedness and sex is never erotic. <br /> <br /> I certainly wouldn't recommend seeing it for any reason other than morbid curiosity although judging from other reviews this seems to be a love or hate movie, I suspect it would be better looked after a couple of beers and with your friends.
