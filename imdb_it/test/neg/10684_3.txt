Following a double 19th century pistol that goes wrong, a charming young woman becomes a vampire. Not only does he become one of the undead, he uses his goth, a tempting character to support his talents as a cold-blooded murderer. This is a low level B feature that should have been transferred directly to the video. Violence is vicious and bloody, but actually quite mild. The plot is so weak and the dialogue so haphazardly that it is difficult to arouse much interest. Eileen Daly is the protagonist Lilith Silver. Also in the cast are Mark Caven, Kevin Howarth and Isabel Brook.
