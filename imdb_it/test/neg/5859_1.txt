I turned it off for about 50 minutes! Anyone who was the moron who decided to steal the idea of ​​Koushun Takami's book (Battle Royal), and turn it into a pathetic reality show, deserves to be shot! <br /> <br /> It made the film industry a good turning point though. Now directors like William Malone (Fear Dot Com) can say "well, at least it's better than the 7 series". <br /> <br /> Be careful that this is not a movie "So bad is good"! <br /> <br /> This is a shame for film producers around the world! <br /> <br /> Never see this movie!
