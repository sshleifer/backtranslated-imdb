This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. The three main cast members didn't seem to be clicking well. The character of Giovanni Ribisi was rather annoying. For some reason, he seems to like repeating what he says. If it was the "Rain Man", it would have been fine, but it is not. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
