Produced by International Playhouse Pictures, it appears to be filmed in a dollhouse. Everyone is a liar, everything is like a dream, like a toy without a good reason. I'm not saying that everything in all the movies should be totally realistic, but the incredible fantasy things and situations in a movie are too much. How did these good actors - actresses in particular - play this film? It's good to see Mia again; if we were to understand why her husband wants to kill her, Mia does it well. It's not funny, it doesn't move, it's just false. Stephen Dorff appears briefly at the end, suitable for a game perhaps, less for a movie, but this is not one to measure things about. Terrible.
