This movie amused me with lots of laughs at the actors who kept the film moving in all crazy directions. If you like suggestive language and sexy-looking girls, they were all in the picture and girls and boys seem completely destroyed before they even graduate from high school. There is a scene where teenagers drive their car into a very fake deer and then proceed to throw it into a lake or ocean, which is repeated over and over again. There is no horror in this film except the word Horrible for the whole photo and Arnold who plays a plastic cop is really a sick character. Please don't waste your time watching this movie.
