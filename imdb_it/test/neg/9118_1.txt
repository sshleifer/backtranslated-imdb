American Graffiti is one of the best films ever made. I've seen it at least 30 times and I'm emotionally impressed every time I see it. (I graduated from high school in 1962.) <br /> <br /> However, More American Graffiti is one of the worst films ever made. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe than anyone associated with the great original film was involved in this terrible sequel. The part of the film set in Vietnam was extremely inaccurate. (I served 18 months in Vietnam with the 101st Airborne Division.) <br /> <br /> The entire movie had nothing useful in any part of it. <br /> <br /> If someone ever wants to make a case against making sequels of great films, More American Graffiti would be the first example of what can go wrong.
