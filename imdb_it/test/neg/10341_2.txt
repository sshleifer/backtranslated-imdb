I participated in a screening of this film. It has been beaten with clich√©s and jokes and very little amusing assumptions. I think the other comments were made by people who must have worked on the film or be members of the cast family. I am amazed that this film costs $ 3- $ 4 million without real stars. Where did the budget go? Obviously he didn't go to the writers for rewriting. Nice thought to grab the success of Big Fat Greek Wedding, but an important miss. There was little or no spark between the main characters and the triggering incident was a bit fragile at best. The management was not inspired and looked like a student film. <br /> <br /> I don't even know what it means Everyone wants Italian. It is a true saying. I never heard it
