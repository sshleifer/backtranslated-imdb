**** SOME SPOILERS **** <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this movie that you haven't seen while surfing the net. Nothing is shocking for this movie. In the film a man sodomizes a goat, there is a beheading of a bulldozer and a lesbian's face is burned. All these "extreme violence" scenes are so fake, one wonders why anyone would ever want to resurface this piece of garbage. I simply can't believe I spent hard earned money on what is surely the worst movie ever made. Don't be fooled by the reviews, this movie would be a shame for ANYONE to own ... except maybe the prisons that want to torture prisoners. For a true classic of exploitation, look at Bloodsucking Freaks or even the most recent Doom Generation. The island of death descends to the bottom of the toilet of the film and must be erased from existence.
