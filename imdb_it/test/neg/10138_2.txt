Reba is a very stupid show. You can predict practically everything that is going to happen. Barbra Jean is simply too stupid. It's like he's not even a character. A show like this should have at least SOMEONE that looks like a person in real life. I imagine that Barbra Jean represents a retarded person. Keira or whatever it's called, Reba, Brock, they're all stupid! Keira is like the smartest person on the show, and she's still stupid. EVERYONE IS STUPID! This is my opinion on Reba. Since I've said all I can say about this show, I'll take the next lines of text saying what I'm saying at the moment and do it until there are 10 lines. There. Reba gets 2/10.
