(The beginning could be a spoiler ...) <br /> <br /> "The Eye 2" is the sequel to "The Eye". It's about a pregnant woman who is able to see ghosts and spirits after an accident happened to her. <br /> <br /> The sound effects scared me to death even if for a moment, but this is the only scary thing. Some scenes of the prequel are relatively similar and repeated, so the chilling effects have cooled down. <br /> <br /> "The Eye" has a rather terrifying and indelible impression while "The Eye 2" is an unforgettable horror-cum-drama film. Omit looking at this. Watching "The Eye" is pretty good.
