I really liked The Wrecking Crew (1999), which was the last of the three films in this series (the first is Urban Menace (1999) that I haven't seen yet). I know it was baaaaad, but the three protagonists have done a pretty decent job, after all. <br /> <br /> This, however, was really atrocious. Ice-T was terrible, and it's the producer! I can't say I've ever heard of Silkk The Shocker (who apparently never learned how to spell), but his performance was one of the worst I've ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Miss Jones did very well in her small role, although she later continued to do some atrocious and racist "jokes" on her radio show after the Asian Asian tsunami (plus other occasions unfortunately ). Well done, girl ... <br /> <br /> No one else comes out with any credit. Strangely, TJ Storm and Ernie Hudson (both of whom are pretty mean here) are far better in The Wrecking Crew, which was created, along with Urban Menace, in the same period as Corrupt. How it works, I don't know. <br /> <br /> I'm going to try the Ice-T comment now, to see if you apologize for the movie, or try to make us think it's a great piece of cinema.
