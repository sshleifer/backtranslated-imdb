Granny is certainly one of the worst horror films ever made in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> The script was diabolical, so bad in fact that I was almost crying with laughter for some of the things that came out with. The acting was almost bad, it would have been better to throw street cones to play the roles (they would have done a better job). The murders were ridiculous, the suspense was non-existent, the camera work was ineffective and the "big" twist in the end was disgustingly inappropriate, getting worse and worse. <br /> <br /> "The Granny" is perhaps one of the most menacing "villains" captured in the film, it seems that he is wearing a cheap supermarket mask (nylon hair causes endless laughter) and a voluminous nightgown. Would you be scared of that ??? I certainly wasn't. <br /> <br /> If you like watching bad movies (see Manos, Troll 2, Michael Bay's movie ÔÅä) then this is a must see. Those who do not like bad movies and do not like to laugh at shocking dialogues, avoid it like the plague.
