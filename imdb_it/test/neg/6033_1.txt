This has some of the most stupid fighting scenes of all time. If I were a war veteran, I would cry when I see this film, not because I would remember being in Vietnam, but because it's a poor representation of every veteran of that war. Even though the troops carry M16, that movie doesn't look like anything from Vietnam. The uniforms of Viet Cong look like old Japanese uniforms advanced by a film of World War II. The setting is obviously a bit of Hollywood shit. The worst scene contains an American soldier who fights "hand in hand" like a bad martial arts movie. After sending several enemy troops, he says: "Hey, come here and kick a kick!" to a helicopter in the air. Then he is shot. This movie is rubbish.
