When this series aired, I looked at most of them. I think it should have been a long series in the series "The Fugitive" and "The Incredible Hulk", in which the protagonist is chased around the country in search of a solution to his problems. In this case the hero's problem is his progressive aging in reverse. I liked what I saw of these shows. The acting was good especially the painful relationship between the protagonist and his wife. The problem is: they deleted it before it could finish. (or that or I missed the last episodes). <br /> <br /> They never had the chance to end the story, knowing it had been canceled. Poof was just finished. However, as I said before, I may have missed the last few episodes. But my opposite is this: I rented the tape. Where I left the series. The main character's wife dies in a fire started by a chase involving the famous King's organization. As he runs away the hero is kidnapped. He ends with his friends realizing that they have to go and save him from the store. The end. Last episode. In the video: His wife does not die but escapes fire with him. Just when he should be caught by the store, he and his wife share a strange moment, then they leave existence. Abrupt, foolish and inexpensive to the extreme. They just wanted to put this video and decided to tag on an ending that didn't care how bad it was. They could even just show some footage of the first atomic bomb detonations. Almost Pythonesque. <br /> <br /> The show had a sequence of opening titles to the David Bowie song of the same name
