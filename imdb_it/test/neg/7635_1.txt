This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a thriller with a rather ridiculous ending. I watched this film hoping for the best and instead I found something really bad. the film starred in two actors that I really like, Rebecca DeMornay and Antonio Banderas. Of course they had decent chemistry together but for what? The premise of the film was bad at the beginning and the execution made it even worse. <br /> <br /> Miss DeMornay plays Sarah Taylor, a psychologist who tries to analyze a convicted serial killer whose defense depends on a multiple personality disorder. This will give you a clue as to where the film is going and the identity of the killer. At the beginning of the film he receives an unexpected visit from his father. This was done in the 90s when bad dad was the Hollywood in-the-thing is another clue to the final conclusion. <br /> <br /> Banderas plays a mysterious man named Tony Ramirez, who enters Sarah's life. The whole first meeting and first meeting between Tony and Sarah is so badly done and so unconvincing that you wonder how he was shot. And there is a sequence in which the two are supposed to know each other and be so weak that it does not seem to belong to this. One thing I would like to admit is that there was a very hot sex scene. However, the gruesome things start to happen after it arrives, strange packages arriving, things falling off the wall that could kill Sarah, an incident that says things are no longer normal. <br /> <br /> Overall the film was poorly conceived, the editing sometimes looks nervous, and the conclusion was ridiculous. Another thing that bothered me about this film was the whole orchestral music that played in the background. A thinner soundtrack would have been better. I have to say that, as bad as the ending was, Miss DeMornay was very good in that sequence. It is sad that he has never had top quality materials in his career. It is the rare combination of talent and beauty.
