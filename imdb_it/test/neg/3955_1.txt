Apart from Frankie Muniz, who talks too quickly to understand (Malcolm's flashbacks in the Middle?), This film still fails to stir up fear. The idea with the "Countess" and the story that surrounded her in the story was fun, but the plot, and many side plots, simply didn't come together. Synopsis plot: assassinate the ghost attracts victims through the video game. Toss in some blood splatter and a special effect and you have yourself another bombarded would be a horror movie. Ghostmusters look too much like the ghost of "The Ring Two". The acting and the constant and dramatic change in everyone's emotions are incredible. Save your money.
