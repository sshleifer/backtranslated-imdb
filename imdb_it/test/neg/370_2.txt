If you take the movies, Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome and the movie Steel Dawn with Patrick Swayze, you'll get a good idea of ​​what the film is about. The only problem is that the film lacks the production values ​​of both and represents a mainly economic copy of the first two. True, the film has a lot of action, but asks the viewer to suspend the faith. No one can shoot with a 50 caliber machine gun in his hand - and lose everything to boot, nor can you shoot a group of people with an automatic weapon and lose the whole group. There is also a problem with poor editing, when the school bus turns upside down, it is easy enough to see the cannon used to do the job. And the lady who drives the truck through it is superfluous, since she had more than enough time to stop the truck. If you are only interested in senseless action and violence, then the film is easy enough to watch. But don't expect anything about Paar with Thunderdome, or even about cheap and tacky Steel Dawn.
