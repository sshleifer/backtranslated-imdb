With so many horrible spoof movies, this is sadly a breath of fresh air in the genre. Compared to classics like Airplane or Naked Gun, this is terrible, but compared to recent parody movies like Meet the Spartans and Disaster Movie, this is very clever and original. Don't get me wrong, though, this wasn't a good movie in any way. I've laughed a few times, and there are some inspired gags, but any reference to pop culture falls on his face, as does most of the jokes in the film. <br /> <br /> Lambeau Fields (David Koechner) was a bad coach in the past, but now he is back to teach college football, and this time he will do a good job. His wife (Melora Hardin) feels far away from him and his daughter comes out with a big kick to spite her father. Spoofs of various recent films come into play, as well as a lot of gag sight and non-stop stupidity. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the film are the gags that do not rely on reference to recent films. Radio, Rocky, Dodgeball, Friday Night Lights, Invincible and many other sports films are not funny. It is mostly the smaller gags that make a few laughs, like a bizarre horse scratch scene, or a tobacco chewing joke. These little disposable giggles can't carry the film, and in the end it's hard to watch. The last 20 minutes are exhausting to sit on. <br /> <br /> The characters are surprisingly developed for a sports spoof movie, however, I'm sure the characters were built on clich√©s like that. Nevertheless, they are not too bad. David Koechner can collect the protagonist in a film. Too bad they gave him so much poor material to work with. Matthew Lawerence has a good comic timing in a role not always as comical as a ballet football player with a cross dressing father. Carl Weathers completes the cast, once again in a sub-par sports movie (Not the Rocky movies ... Happy Gilmore!) Overall, this is a wacky comedy. Sometimes, it's fun, but more often than not, it's just very annoying and predictable. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 on ****. 90 minutes PG-13 for language, sexual humor and drug humor.
