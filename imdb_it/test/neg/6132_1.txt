Here is a fantastic concept for a film: a series of meteors crashing into a small town and the resulting alien infection is captured by the cam of a deputy's camcorder as the city slowly takes over. Forget about Albert Pyun! Don't enter less than 100 feet from this movie! Holy shit, what a bomb ... it could be the worst Pyun yet! The crazy thing is that there is the germ of a creative idea here - a whole of an epidemic told by the POV of a dashcam. When I knew about it for a while, I imagined that the car crashed into something, people would crash and infected guys broke the windshield and surrounded the car in chaos. It would be nice, right? Instead, we have the advantage of running in circles all the time in a wooded area, occasionally encountering the three infected types standing there. The last part is literally a 15-minute shot in which nothing happens in front of the camera, but only off-screen noises are heard. Stay away!!! With a somewhat lightened note, I think I officially defined the end of my Pyun looking ... it took me only 20 lousy movies to realize that I have better things to do.
