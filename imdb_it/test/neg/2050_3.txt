Pretentious horror film that looks like a soap opera turned goth on a drug that sends you to a fantasy world where strange creatures are hiding. The film has some good images but its strange mix of what is real and what is not goes nowhere. Worse still are the vague statements made by one of the characters. It seems to announce a more serious, more significant film, but I don't think they have even begun to occupy a serious or significant territory to start trying to sell the meaning. There is not much to say, people talk, drugs have visions ... they still talk about it. Not bad as useless and boring. Boring is the sin here and why you want to avoid this.
