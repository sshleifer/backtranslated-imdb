Code 46 is one of those scifi movies in which the government controls who you are allowed to love, and in fact will punish you if you try to procreate with the wrong person. The haves and the haves live in completely separate territories, the powers that can remove your memories, etc. We've seen this stuff before, but that's fine, no film is 100% original. This kind of premise is always fun to contemplate. Unfortunately, just imagining such a future is more interesting than looking at Code 46. The characters are boring and rarely say anything interesting. Perhaps this is a comment on a dehumanized future, but it is still boring to watch. It's sloooow. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the images are beautiful, but usually (combined with its "evocative" soundtrack) it just looks like an advertisement for a glorified perfume. Code 46 also sometimes uses the kind of television camera I find annoying. You know, two characters talk while the camera "floats" to one side. Two seconds later it floats on the other side of them in a vain attempt to attract your attention. <br /> <br /> My friends enjoyed this movie. If they tried to convince me to watch it again, I probably wouldn't do it unless they agreed to pay me $ 50.
