the people who invented this are SICK AND TWISTED FREAKS how the hell can you take advantage of people like this? causing people to think it's real? which I probably don't doubt it is ... I saw this for the first time today in the 7 series and it gave me stomach nausea that I almost vomited. I could not stop crying with empty eyes for these poor people and if that woman had really had that baby, you MUST ALL BE REPLACED BY YOURSELF !!!!!!!!!! I have a 4 month old daughter and it is absolutely scary to put a "real" pregnant woman in SO MUCH DANGER! you are cursed PETS and you should be locked up for life allowing something like that to put on t.v. if this so-called "reality show" is real, then why no one is put in jail to allow people to die and not do a damn thing about it. YOU ALL WANT TO BE FRIGGEN HUNTED DOWN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
