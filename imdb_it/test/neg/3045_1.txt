What should have been a routine babysitting job in a secluded lake house turns into a night of terror, while student Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) receives threatening phone calls from a sadistic stalker as she tries to stay one step ahead of he. br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes of the original film were quite good but it was all downhill from there. The remake takes those first 20 minutes and stretches them into an 80-minute feature. This is a good idea because it eliminates everything that made the original bad. However, if they wanted this film to work more effectively they would have to hire a better actress, a director, a writer, etc. There is no suspense, everything can be understood long before it happens and it is a boring film because not much happens. At least there isn't much to sit in for less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> If this premise should work, the leading actress must give a realistic performance. Camilla Belle offers one of the worst performances I've ever seen and throughout the film, she seemed to be reading her lines. You have a leading role in a Hollywood movie that will be seen by millions of people and you will not make any effort! Why did they hire this girl? Sure, she's pretty but can't play at all, but I suppose this doesn't matter to the target audience who will most likely eat this movie. The rest of the cast is bland and forgettable especially the woman who plays the maid, Rosa. Even the stranger was lame and his jokes on the phone were not at all effective. <br /> <br /> This film reminds me of the last years of disappointing Boogeyman horror films. That movie was a lot of economic fright and false alarms and When a Stranger Calls is pretty much the same. Jill enters a room because she hears a noise but it's just a false alarm like a cat or a maid. This type of scene is repeated ad infinitum until, after about 50 minutes, the stranger appears. It must be one of the deadliest killers ever. He did not carry weapons and did not seem to pose a threat. The finish is ugly but corresponds to the rest of the film, so it doesn't really matter. The film is directed by Simon West and he is really bad at creating suspense. He was using all the clich√©s he could think of and the results weren't very good. The house was fantastic and I will give credit to the film. It was an isolated house, so it was pretty scary, but it's the only positive thing this film has to offer. In the end, if you're not a teenager, you should skip the movie. Rated 2/10
