This joins the endless line of shocking and predictable nonsense of the 1950s. As usual, it's pretty ugly. There isn't much of a plot that I can detect and the excessive exaggeration of the derivations adds only involuntary laughter. Even the title is misleading. Catching on MST3K is probably the only way to view it, and it is better to leave it that way.
