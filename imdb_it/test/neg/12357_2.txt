I saw him on a boring Sunday morning this morning. Well, I was attracted to the fact that it is an outdoor movie .. I was hoping to find some beautiful scenery but the views were limited ... They always go back and forth in the same place. I hate it when they're using this so-called hi-tech stuff like Motorola's bluetooth headset they are using to eliminate the use of a walkie-talkie that was so fun ... they look like amateurs. And they like the publicity of those badly designed alien design laptops that could connect to a satellite to find people .. I could not say more about this TV movie .. The ending was bad that seems to have interrupted it briefly eliminating the use of rescue helicopters and etc. * / **********
