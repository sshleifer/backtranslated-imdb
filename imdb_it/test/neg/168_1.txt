This is one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen, probably surpassed only by the terrible and utterly meaningless Blueberry. How can Harald Zwart put his name in this shit too? I feel every ounce of respect I had for him that fell quickly. <br /> <br /> So what is this film that makes it so poor? And the story? Yes. Are they the actors? Yes. Is it all the "look and feel" of the film? Yes. <br /> <br /> To start with the story, my god! It's almost a clich√©-ridden and predictable like what you'd expect from a 14-year-old drunk who is writing his article on "What I did this summer" late. The positive atmosphere that the producers try to achieve is completely drowned while we undergo another embarrassing turn in history. <br /> <br /> Actors are amateurs, I know, so we can't expect them to be of the same quality as professional actors. But to make it work, the characters MUST be fascinating and / or fun (preferably both), so that viewers don't worry about blatant acting, or maybe even add to the characters. In this case, not even close to baby! You begin to dislike the characters, and at the end of the film (I think it lasts about 90 minutes, even if it seems like 4 hours) you have a strong desire to hurt someone to make you think of these boring and stupid boys! It should be impossible to find this film's humor success successful unless you are really yourself like these stupid jerks. Their previous lack of talent and credibility with regards to acting, makes only silly and overly simple scenes fall more to the ground. Even the family of the people involved will have difficulty finding all this, but very, very embarrassing (I would prefer my sister to make fun of herself on American Idol). <br /> <br /> Finally, why cram into a group of Norwegian celebrities out of place? They seem even more out of place than the actors, if that is possible. These celebrity cameos are added to the inexpensive feeling of the film and it is in itself a nice transparent blow in the darkness in trying to improve something broken even before the beginning. <br /> <br /> I can't even begin to point out how much I'd rather watch the dry paint than ever watch this movie again ...
