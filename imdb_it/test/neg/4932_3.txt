I hate guns and I've never murdered anyone, but when even half of the events that take place in "Shuttle" happen to you or the narrow ones and you find a gun, CHOOSE YOUR ATTACK. THREE TIMES. FIVE TIMES. Whatever makes your wrist stop on them and increases on you. I think even God would say, "Good call". In a "hostel" type film, but more realistic? like this could really happen to anyone, well, if you're a pretty girl, is it ?? 'Shuttle' was a decent film, even if on the long side. Some good shakes (always call AAA even to change a tire), basically just a surprise, but for the most part, you might see things coming. And apart from the typical "tie it up" instead of the one I mentioned earlier, the most annoying part was the revelation towards closing from one best friend to another. Overcoming those, it's fun for what it is. Basically, we have two unsuspecting women traveling alone from Mexico at home (wow, it's original) and one lost their luggage by preventing them from leaving the airport until late. And after an obvious sign language scene foreshadowed, they enter a "too good to be true" shuttle ride at half price. The Clich√©d athletes, previously introduced, head for the shuttle, to join what appears to be Alan Ruck's "Speed" double. From here, it's obvious what happens (I said it was a "hostel") but, anyway, I didn't find it too horrible, yet nothing spectacular. However, it would have served the public better with about 15-20 minutes canceled, I would recommend you if you have almost 2 hours to kill and you are in sick horror.
