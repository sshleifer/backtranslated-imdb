This TVM seems to have polarized opinions among the commentators on this page, so maybe I can fix everything by saying that this is a very stupid television movie, not very well done. How bad is it? It's a teleplay that can't even decide what its name is because while everyone in America calls it LINDA it's known in the UK as LUST FOR MURDER and it's usually a bad sign when a film has to change its name. And I can also point out that it is not an ironic parody as someone has said <br /> <br /> I will be honest and I will say that the plot is quite healthy. Linda and Paul Cowley meet another couple called Jeffries who get along very well. They go so well that they go on vacation together (decide if there's a wife exchange going on) and Paul sees his wife kill the Jeffries. After that the plot takes a shock fold <br /> <br /> Writing the previous paragraph I suddenly realized the great amount of potential of the story and I won't say anything to get away from the premise. It's just that when the story continues after the events I've described, things become increasingly unlikely and bizarre. Not only that, but the production values ​​are rather insignificant with the actor who plays Paul Cowley with a very biting voice that irritates while most of the scenes - Exterior and interior - seem to have been filmed on a foggy day
