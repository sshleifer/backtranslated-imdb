This film tries to cash in on the success of the Richard Curtis films, in particular "Love Actually" (which I loved) - a series of disparate scenes that follow the love life of various couples. <br /> <br /> It's a bad idea. The script tries to be a little too clever and simply doesn't resonate. Most of the acting is written, which is more a reflection on the director than on the actors. <br /> <br /> The version I saw (on a plane) was called "Scenes from a park", which is a more appropriate title since not all scenes were of a sexual nature. <br /> <br /> I couldn't wait to see this movie, but in the end it's disappointing. Do not worry
