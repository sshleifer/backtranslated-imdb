Well, first of all, excuse me for the lame pun in the title. I was looking for movies to rent the other day and I saw this. I heard something about this, so I took it and looked at the back and there was a brief review on John Fallon, AKA Arrow in the Head! At that moment I thought "Well, if he likes it, then I like it!" So I rented it and I finally managed to watch it last night (the college keeps me so busy). Oh and I might want to add that I read some of Arrow's review and it turns out that on 4 stars it gave him 1 and a half. So my expectations from this movie have gone from very high to uncertain. Well, after seeing this, I once again agreed with Arrow (and discovered that the quote from the review was the only positive thing he said about it!) Wow, did this movie smell or what? Where do I begin to understand why he did it? Well, the film was so boring in my opinion. Not even the pieces of cold blood excited me and when a beheading doesn't turn you on in a movie, it's bad! The characters I hated a lot and from the beginning I could tell who would die and who wouldn't. In reality the film has wronged me in some places, but the worst thing is that a particular character that I wanted to die didn't do it! What the hell? And the chemistry between the main girl and the boy she met? I didn't hear it. Obviously it was just there to be a pleasure for the eyes and give it a love interest, otherwise I thought it was a waste! And as a horror fan I should know that sometimes the "silent film of horror" must happen or that there wouldn't be much of a movie, but those in here have taken my head off! Hello? Why are you peeping into the murderous nun's room when you should be looking for her? And it was made by presumably more intelligent characters no less. The twist ... ah, it would have been right, if it hadn't been done a billion times and I wouldn't have had to go through this film to get to that point! My main point: the stupid film that sucked me in with some words from my favorite (my only favorite) film critic. Jerks!
