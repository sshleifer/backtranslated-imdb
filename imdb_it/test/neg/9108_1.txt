This is so serious that it will be my contribution to the next bad party I go to. It is clear from the beginning that Steve Gutenburg was taking this role seriously ... the other principles were walking in their lines. I think they had a whiff of how it stank early and were making proposals for their salaries. Sean Bean "starred" as usual but was spared sharing the screen space with any of the principles until the final scene where he was like an actor walking on a high school stage which is how he was defined the contrast. Some actors don't look sloppy. Some actors should not aggregate for a part. These two statements apply to "Police Academy" Steve. His unkempt appearance translates into tramp and destitute and his piling up makes him look like a lumpy, not funny potato. Match it to one of the most scripted dialogues in Hollywood history and you have a BAD movie. I can only assume that all the princes really needed the money for the remodeling or something or that their agents had signed them before the writing was written by the monkeys they had to type. I would like to know the previous history of this disaster.
