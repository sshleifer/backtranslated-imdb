French cinema sucks! Down with all these psychic visions with their distinct attitudes cultivated by my God-am-I! Pestilence to the alleged symbolic cinematic language and impenetrable chiffres! I won't have a mind for that anymore! Léos Carax, have you ever thought, that a dialogue in a film could be natural and vivid ??? Maybe I'm too common to understand you? Or was it your job to confirm all the clichés of a Frenchman the world can have? Guillaume, the guilliottinato, comes to his house, the lady. Deneuve, not in the picture, plays the flute: "Here I am, darling!" Right now, I knew she was in the bathtub, and we'll soon see her lying in there. Don't get me wrong, I'm not demure, and the incest sex scene was the climax of the movie. But this is, in Berlin, we say "etepetete", which means something like "être-peut-être", a snobbish, self-satisfied and, the worst, since I can often say in French films! Another example: she, beautiful and willing, looks in the mirror, combs her hair, and the young bearded and bearded guru rushes into the room, shouting breathlessly: "There is no escape, there is no escape!" Forty years after Sartres and existentialist consorts - what's new, what's exciting? My God, there's that woman and she loves you and admires you, what would be more natural to be happy with your life? And when you're not, please explain a lot better, why !! Born in French means that you have to live a life in extravagance, with no escape, is this the point?
