Here is another great film that critics will appreciate. The problem is that it's not a good movie. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is simple. Nine detainees flee a prison after the tenth has gone mad and tells them where the treasure is. <br /> <br /> The first half has a lot of slapstick, some of them very large, while the second half is a descent driven by the character in fantasy and melancholy. <br /> <br /> The two halves simply don't mix. The individual scenes work very well (the guys who crash into a friends house that has a new Filipino bride is hilarious while a subsequent scene with the guy working in the restaurant's tugs on the ropes of the heart). They simply don't relate to each other. br /> <br /> Even the film lacks whole set-ups. A scene shows kids desperate for a change under a desert vending machine to buy a snack. The next scene has the entire crew dragged into a restaurant. Where did they get their clothes and wigs? (The crew includes both the big boy and a dwarf) How did they get all the clothes and money to buy the meal? And the most puzzling is why are they dragged? Are they clearly boys in the resistance and let me face something more memorable for the witnesses of a big man and a dwarf who eat a meal dressed as women? I mention the great and the dwarf because, apart from the old, all the others seem to blend into each other. (Actually they wear white suits combined for most of the film) The film has a very poor character development in the first half and consequently the second half really lacks an emotional punch. Because we are often trying to figure out who is who in their individual payoff scenes. <br /> <br /> Speaking of resistance, the second part has all those wonderful camera shots and great emotional moments and a great symbolism that makes a great film. It's also terribly slow, which makes the movie boring. <br /> <br /> 9 Souls is a big disappointment, the reviews talk about a great movie and it's there somewhere, good luck finding it alone.
