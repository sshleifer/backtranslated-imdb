First of all, this film is gross to the point of nauseating, and my advice is to avoid it at all costs if you ever want to eat ice cream again. I tried to watch it because it seemed fun, but it soon became quite annoying with the ice cream made of body parts and surprisingly graphic effects. It opens with a boy named Greg who witnesses the gruesome murder of an ice cream vendor (later Greg becomes crazy and grows up to become the main character) from those who appear to be Mafia killers. There is no explanation for this murder, making it the biggest WTF moment in the whole movie. Other minor moments of the WTF include the surreal asylum that Greg goes to (with evil clowns), a woman who speaks in tongues because she was possessed by the Holy Spirit (what has to do with what I don't know), and the fact that Olivia "The crap of his career has gone bad" Hussey is in it. <br /> <br /> None of these is reason enough to watch it. The only reason is for the character Tuna, who is a skinny little boy with pillows stuffed under his shirt so that he looks like a fat little boy. For some reason this seemed hilarious. I stayed much longer on the night than I should have seen this movie just to see if there was any reason why they couldn't use a real fat boy for the role. Even though I fell asleep before the end, I gathered from other reviews that Tuna ends up losing the "weight". Ok, so they didn't have the budget to do it realistically. Suggestion for the director: what do you think about making the character ... not overweight? <br /> <br /> Here we go; if Tuna's perspective does not interest you enough, there is no other reason to recognize the existence of this film. If disgusting horror movies on ice cream are your favorite source of entertainment, take a look at "The Stuff" far superior.
