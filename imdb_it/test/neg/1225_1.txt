Wow ... as a big fan of the western stories of Larry McMurtry and the Lonesome series Where in particular, I was s-o-o-o waiting for Comanche Moon. What a terrible disappointment. Maybe my expectations were too high because of the excellence of Lonesome Dove ... the story, the characters, the cinematography, the music ... everything worked. <br /> <br /> By comparison Comanche Moon comes across as a bad Saturday Night Live scene. The characters are completely colorless, the dialogue is stuttering and the plot meanders meaningless everywhere. It seems that all the actors are reading from TelePrompTers. I couldn't identify myself with any of the characters, good guys, bad guys, not even secondary characters. The performance of David Midthunder stands out in particular. It appears to have been torn from a middle school performance at eighth grade. I'm sorry, I'd like to find something positive to say about Comanche Moon, but I can't do it. There is nothing there.
