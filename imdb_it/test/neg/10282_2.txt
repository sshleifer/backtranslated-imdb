The show is at least partially Faked (so it's not reality, just pretending to be reality), which makes me believe that at least no one with a faceless face is a fake. <br /> <br /> Demonstration in the episode where he pretends to be stabbed There is already a crew on the boat, before it gets there, it can be seen as its boat approaches. <br /> <br /> Actors who play "ambulance officers" didn't take off their shirts or hurt themselves anyway, so they work there, which would never happen in reality. <br /> <br /> They also parked the ambulance in the parking lot and did not drive to the emergency entrance (which makes no sense unless it is false and would not be allowed to go there)
