I just watched National Lampoon's National Vacation 2 on DVD, hoping to see something similar to the original Christmas comedy, "Christmas Holidays". I haven't seen anything like it. It can be said from the start that this film would not be up to par. Too bad it has a title that links it to the original Christmas holiday. It's really sad. The film cannot bear its merits. I think too many people will see this film on the strength of the title and it doesn't come close to that level of comedy. In addition to the title, there is very little that links the film to the original "Christmas Holiday" and even less to the connection with Christmas. The comedy is very simplistic and the plot is poor. The kids might find some humor here, but most adults just giggle here and there. This film is a flop. Don't waste time with it.
