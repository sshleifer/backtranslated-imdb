This was just a horrible movie. I saw it once when I was about 12 years old, now I'm 19 and I don't think I'll ever forget this movie. <br /> <br /> I still feel bad every time I think about it, it was just all that could be horrible in a movie. I really don't understand what kind of person can enjoy this total garbage. It's not enough to just turn off your mind to enjoy this movie, I can enjoy the most stupid Disney movies made for TV as much as the next person, but this is completely different. <br /> <br /> I usually don't like judging a movie until I've seen it alone, but trust me, I'm doing you a favor. Don't watch this movie.
