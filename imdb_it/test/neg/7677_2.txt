All the airport films are smelly, but this is the biggest turkey of them all. The formula was different for this because it concentrated on TWO disastrous flights and a lot of twists occurred on the ground, while the other films focused on a single disastrous flight and less plot on the ground. Acrobatics with the Concorde are worth watching for laughter, even if the special effects are not as terrible as I would expect for a film of this quality made in 1979. George Kennedy's sexist remarks are disgusting and his rendezvous with a prostitute in Paris it is absolutely useless (and made me gag a little). Poor Martha Raye was relegated to a role where she did nothing but raise her intestines over and over again in the Concordia bathroom. There are no big stars in this film compared to the previous films, giving you one more reason not to watch this.
