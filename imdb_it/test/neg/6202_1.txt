If you're going to watch "Partners" and read IMDb reviews on IMDb, you've already lost too much time in this stupid, idiotic, horrible movie. <br /> <br /> It's a horrible, horrible, horrible copy of the movie 'Hitch.' I chose to ignore all the other warnings and negative reviews I had heard about this movie, and wasted a precious 20 minutes on it - I thought that his David Dhawan doing it, and Govinda - how can this be bad ? But after 20 minutes of watching this nonsense, I couldn't take it anymore and turned off my computer. <br /> <br /> To exaggerate from everyone in the film, stupid dialogues, waste of total time - I gave him a 1-star rating because it is the lowest you can do. If I could go lower, I would have given a vote of -100.
