This is on my TV right now ... but only enough time to complete the overview in this comment. The previous comment lets me know that this film will not improve, no matter how much I hope and pray. I agree that this film is a colossal waste of my time and it would be your time ... it will not improve! I can't believe this writer is doing Atlas Shrugged! I hope he has improved a million times! I see some other credits on his resume that have had good reviews, but I'm still not convinced. If you're familiar with his work, please publish something here, because I really want to see Atlas Shrugged, and I'll hate it if this guy turned it into the trash that this movie turned out to be.
