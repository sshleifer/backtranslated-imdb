*** SLO SPOILERS *** This episode of the Full Moon franchise changes the plot slightly and implements some new elements. First a new puppeteer is created. Secondly, the puppets become good in this sequel. Finally, it also introduces some scifi / fantasy elements. <br /> <br /> A new tenant of the notorious hotel near the bay, his girlfriend, his psychic friend and that psychic boyfriend, stumbles upon Andre Toulon's puppet's trunk. They also learn some demon from another dimension that considers Toulon responsible for stealing secrets to animate the non-living. So Sutekh (the demon) sends the totems, a group of small spoiled creatures that look like gremlinino without an ear. Then it's up to the troupe of puppets to take care of the inter-dimensional threat that is trying to kill new friends. <br /> <br /> Like most low-budget films, this film is full of problems of continuity. How did they put the puppets back in the trunk? How come no one remembers the last murders of the hotel murders? Who bought the hotel? Why an entrepreneur in a building with a history of mass murder? All this and many other questions will not be answered ... ever. <br /> <br /> The real surprise of this film is acting. It's actually pretty good. The actors take it with an unusual enthusiasm, especially for a group of Full Moon nonames. Teresa Hill was particularly impressive as the shy, nervous and psychic Lauren. Even Chandra West (Susie) was a pleasant surprise. Gordon Hill was a tolerable protagonist. But Cameron was too annoying for the stomach. Thanks to the Norwegian god he dies before half. <br /> <br /> Puppets are the usual animated selves. With some improvements as well. Emotions (especially those of Jester) are much more human due to the sounds they have been given. The whistles of Blade, the grunts of Pinhead and the giggle of Six-Shooter have all been improved and sound much better. The stop-motion animation is at maximum average, especially the totems. They simply don't seem to move as smoothly as the previous installment in the series. Even the Sutekh costume is absolutely awefull. How should we fear such a funny creature? <br /> <br /> The story seems a bit juvinile for the series. I think Charlie Band wanted to focus on a young demography. Even the attenuated violence in this film seems to speak the same way. Gore fans will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think the above is the main problem that this movie can't really stick to many people. He has no violence for the gorewhores. The tongue is a little cleaner. And yet it is too violent and hard for those little ones. This is why the film gets low marks. I must say that the common reviews are mostly right.
