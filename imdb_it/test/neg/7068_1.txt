This film has no heart and soul; it's an attempt to carve a cult movie among the remains of other, better directors, mainly David Lynch and Tim Burton. Rifkin seems to think that if he overloads with a kind of rotting visual style and fills the street with dirt and garbage, he is making a statement. But it is not a declaration of anything - except the high-pitched sound of the director of "HEY LOOK AT ME! I AM AN ARTIST, ALSO". But he doesn't have the imagination of an artist, just a good memory for the things that worked - like some of the actors trapped in this - for other directors. All this would be almost acceptable if this film were not a turgid and boring task to sit on.
