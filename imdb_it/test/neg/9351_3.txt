Long ago, in a very, very distant galaxy (it sounds familiar), water has become the most precious commodity (this must seem familiar) and a small minority controls its distribution (what a surprise, just having a heart attack and dying from that surprise). A group of ice pirates (renegade water banned bandits? ... oh wait, that last one was used) try to discover the path to a fabulous unlimited water supply with an adorable but spoiled (druova?) Princess and trailer and a group of idiots ???? bad bad pursuers. <br /> <br /> This film has the potential to be a great comic parody ("Star Wars", "Dune" by David Lynch) but it was just not properly managed. Okay, I think the term is "low brow" humor. It's really not so funny to be a real shame, since Angelica Houston, Ron Perlman and Robert Urich (hence the three stars) are not exactly lazy in the acting department. <br /> <br /> Definitely a rent and definitely have a drink.
