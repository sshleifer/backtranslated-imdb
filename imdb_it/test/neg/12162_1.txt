First of all, the nature of the film is beautiful and there is some Mongolian music. Well, the horses looked like Mongols and camels, but that's all it was Mongolian. Oh, Borte is played by a Mongolian actress, although a lame performance. But she's pretty, which redeems the lack of performance on her part. <br /> <br /> But I could not understand what was the meaning of this painful one-and-a-half hour fantasy piece created by Mr. Bodrov. The plot lacked a sense of cohesion. There was no logic behind the development of the plot. In fact, there was almost no story, just a certain number of scenes vaguely linked with a group of "Mongolian" boys, who somehow spoke of a pidgin that should look like Mongolian. Most of the actors were Japanese, Russian or Chinese, most of the scenes were shot in China, Kazakhstan or Russia and there were many disturbing pathos about what a "Mongol" is. The dialog box is primitive and the scenes with dialog box are slow. The battle scenes are ridiculous. All the supernatural pathos is lame and it is obviously there only to compensate for the lack of history. <br /> <br /> The Japanese actor was like a wooden doll, and looking at him there would be no idea how this person could become a leader who could unite nomadic tribes. He seemed asleep, soft, stiff and pitiful for most of the film. <br /> <br /> And I don't even want to start talking about the historical relevance of this piece of film waste. See Chinggis-khan half of the film as a slave, see his first two children born of other men, see his wife selling himself to the merchant Tangut ... my blood begins to boil. And where is the beautiful story of the friendship between Temujin and Jamukha? You could make a great movie out of it. Where is the story of the birth of Temujin? Of his childhood, of his relationship with his family, with his brothers, of how he struggled to survive among the powerful enemies of his family? where is Van Khan, who helped him a lot? where is the representation of life in the steppe, of the life of the nomads, of their traditions, of their relationships with the other nations that surround them? <br /> <br /> Where is the development of the characters? We can't see what Temujin brought with Jamukha and what brought them to pieces and, more importantly, how Temujin became Chinggis-khan, like him, an outcast without wealth and military power managed to unite the Mongol tribes and create such an organized and effective war machine that destroyed one nation after another and created the greatest empire in the history of the earth. All this could make several interesting and dramatic stories with complicated plots and deep characters, but unfortunately we didn't see anything in Bodrov's creation, not even a glimpse.
