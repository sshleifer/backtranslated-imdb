This movie beats everything out there. Well, it depends on what you are looking for ... it could be a 10 or a 1 on the scale. This film is in a complete league aside ... I don't think any movie can get close to it. I'm not sure what the director intended to do as ... a thriller or a comedy. If he thought he was making a thriller, then, fortunately, he created one of the best Bollywood comedies of all time. You have to see it to believe it ... a matrix + terminator + a myriad of other films in one, along with a plot dating back to the Hindi films of the 80s, with an icchadhari naag (a mythical snake that can turn into a human). <br /> <br /> It is an ideal film if you are sitting with a group of friends with alcohol aside, thinking of laughing at the movie! I'm not sure to give him a 1 or a 10 .. Based on flipping a coin, I decided to give it a 1!
