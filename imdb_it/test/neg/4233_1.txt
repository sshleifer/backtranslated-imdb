I saw this movie at the Edinburgh Film Festival, and I wouldn't recommend it. They are two and a half hours long, during which not much happens at a swathe rhythm. <br /> <br /> The main characters are gormless and totally devoid of charisma or personality. No one smiles at all during the film (nor I, if I had their lives), and although Domino seems to have a healthy sexual appetite he doesn't seem to enjoy sex at all. <br /> <br /> the whole experience is depressing and ponderous, the director focuses on each scene in a way that drove me crazy rather than impressed me with the beauty of his technique. Too many questions remained in my mind: why does he smell the Algerian man's head? Why does it levitate? What are you looking at on the assignment fence? Why does he kiss Giuseppe? Why did we go to see this garbage rather than order another bottle of Bouzy Rouge wine?
