Joe D'Amato could have made other noteworthy films in his long and prolific career - prolific, of course, taking turns making cheap MOLOSISSIM films in the great exploitation boom of the late 1970s in Italy - but Porno Holocaust is not one of them, or at least it shouldn't be. Of course, I shouldn't expect much from a movie with a title like that, but I thought considering the description of the back of the box that it might have some funny horror scenes with the "horned, mutant, cannibal zombie". It turns out that the zombie no longer appears in the middle of the film, and at every turn we get instead a dark and hardcore sex scene as can be imagined. Which is fine But it's not very funny, except in most cases where "f *** is this BS". There is a ridiculous dialogue involving lobsters that cost more from Japan by mail order than in Paris, hot and slim women play biologists and zoologists who have particular sexual entanglements (letting the door be unlocked to be raped and a kind of fun bipolar out of being beaten by gangs). <br /> <br /> Everything leads to the island, where "the main attraction" is a boy who at the beginning only spends an absolutely pathetic amount of time (ridiculously forgotten) simply staring at newcomers in the earth desolate radioactive of the remote Caribbean island, and once revealed it has a face like one of the guards in the palace of Jabba and has a sweet potato for a main genitals. But much more stupid than anything else first is the "relationship" that develops between the monster and a dark-skinned lady who has an excessive amount of time to escape, but sits there, faceless, while the monster brings gifts and what must be a racial exploitative move by filmmakers the SOLO monster violates and kills white women, and not her. And it ends, of course, with a "happy" ending. I use quotation marks, of course, for a kind of shock that this could have any kind of legitimate ending. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, this is NOT what you might expect, perhaps being a bloodthirsty horror film with a lot of flashy but trendy Italian zombie-like monsters that devour human flesh. If nothing else what violence is in the film is done on a string of shoes; a strain on the face is immediately reduced to bloody consequences, which are like the consequences of a tomato hitting someone. So really, the last part of the title is designed more for the market. Yet even as a porn movie it has little to do except as a reason for the cast and crew to get a paid vacation in the Caribbean (as an interview with George Eastman suggests, this was just one of the few quickies made while islanding). He has a schocky camera bought in pennies and similar actors, full of genitals about 3/4 of the time and with a poor lip-synching and music like Nino Rota forced to the gun to do something snappy in a brothel, and he's STILL a piece of celluloid dung all the same; all this could be an immense guilty pleasure, but it is not.
