Midnight AKA: Tell Me No Lies (as found in some video stores) can be judged in two different ways. One of it is Merritt as a movie, complete with a plot (without holes), good story and credible conclusion and the other is from the skin blow he is trying to be. This is certainly nothing more than a B-Movie skin movie, whose sole purpose is to show every girl in the movie in a sex scene too long at least once. <br /> <br /> If you try to evaluate this as a normal film, then this is at the bottom of the drivel line. HUGE holes in the plot ruin whatever plot has ever done. For example, if a colleague is killed, would you call the police or go home and hit the hot tub? To judge this film by its skin content, it is watchable ... barely. The girls, for the most part, are all beautiful but quite obviously improved. The sex scenes were all long and exaggerated, though, and this made our only redemptive quality a bit boring. <br /> <br /> Amber Smith could probably be a decent actress if she wanted to. She wasn't as horrible as you could have imagined or maybe next to the rest of the cast, she looked so much better than her. <br /> <br /> Zoe Anderson, who played Detective Arraya, shouldn't even watch a movie, much less acting in one. It looked good, so we know why she was there. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Even if you are looking for a good leather film, there is much better. I consider this 4 out of 10
