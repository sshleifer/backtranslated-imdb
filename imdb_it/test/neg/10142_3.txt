I really enjoyed all the characters in this show from the beginning, except for Reba herself. She comes out wiser than you and frankly a big Bully. And this stinks because she's in every scene and every episode. In subsequent seasons also Van becomes unlikely, as a parody of his past. and Kyra goes around grinning and being unhappy. The first 3 or 4 seasons are pretty good if you neglect Reba. Towards the end it's pretty bleak .. Basically every episode Barbara jean is around to be stupid, Reba is mean to her, but poor Ole Barbara jean desperately wants Reba to like him, which translates into Jean Barabara telling Reba how fantastic each episode is I think it's pretty clear to see Reba having self-esteem problems and wants to be seen as this forgiving saint. It's really a pity, because besides her the show had such potential.
