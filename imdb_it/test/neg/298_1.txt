How can you joke about the mafia? It is not the kind of subject to laugh! A nearby film can't make me laugh, because I compare it to Jane Austen's mafia! Mafia! it wasn't a good movie but Hoods is really worse! In Mafia, there have been good jokes but in this there are maybe two or three ... that make you smile. Actors not too bad but very bad scenario !! We certainly prefer something as serious as The Godfather. I give it * of *****.
