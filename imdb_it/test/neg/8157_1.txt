Even though I'm a fan of Heather Thomas and I have some of her old bikini posters somewhere, I can honestly say that if the only movie I'd ever seen was "Cyclone", I would never have guessed why she had come to the point he had in show business. <br /> <br /> Directed by Fred Olen Ray (almost auspicious given that the buzzards run in circles in the desert), this story of a woman (Thomas) who must protect a high-tech motorcycle from unscrupulous types is like a movie "B" (or in the case of Fred Olen, "B less"). <br /> <br /> The cast itself should tell you something. Not all the films that unite Thomas and actors of the caliber of Beswick, Hall, Combs, Donahue, Tamblyn and Landau (!!). If you're lucky, there are very few movies. And even if they seem to be having fun, shouldn't some of that fun be passed on to the public? I vote yes, it seems they voted no. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you ever wanted to see Heather deliver a mast to another woman, use the word "F" and stay connected to the battery cables, you "were probably looking for it. I'll settle for old replicas "Fall Guy". <br /> <br /> A star, given in the hope that when another "Cyclone" hits the city, Heather runs to take cover.
