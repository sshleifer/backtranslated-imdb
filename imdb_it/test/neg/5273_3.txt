Kevin Spacey is without doubt one of the best actors of the 90s. After his performances in The Usual Suspect, Se7en and American Beauty, you always expect more from him. That's why Ordinary Decent Criminal is a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> Michael Lynch is the most accomplished criminal in Dublin who is never in a bad mood. His next robbery becomes an obsession when his partners begin to question Michael's ability to plan everything perfectly, even if that's the only thing he does when he's not being a good father at home. <br /> <br /> I think it's partly my fault for not paying enough attention to the thousand details of the plot that unfortunately prove to be "the essence" of the film. I gave the film a chance to call it a parody and ... well, parodies are always fun, no matter what they falsify or how they do it. So it wasn't a complete parody after all. It's just a different movie that desperately tries to be funny and fails. <br /> <br /> Unlike some of his "colleagues", Ordinary Decent Criminal depends too much on the development of history and logical continuity, forgetting what the main reason is, the viewer chose this type of film - to be entertained. This is definitely not entertainment. Includes one of the most ridiculous scenes ever - the introduction of Michael's two wives. I don't know if it's a meaningless metaphor or a strange, dark humor, but the chicks are sisters. Remember, Spacey's character has children. <br /> <br /> The ordinary decent criminal is complex and confused. You're not waiting for a fun scene. Instead, follow the dialogue carefully, because there is a great chance of losing yourself in the boring and pale universe, the film is inhabited. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to Spacey. I wonder under what conditions he was, signing for that movie. It's not miscasting, but something much worse. An insult to his work in American Beauty, published a year before Ordinary Decent Criminal. Michael's character is eccentric and talkative. Spacey is almost pathetic sometimes. The only cure for this is thinking of Lester Burnham and Roger Kint. Writer, Gerrard Stembridge should definitely re-consider his on-screen writing skills and be more objective this time. Because, the dialogue is very weak and the scenes are often useless. And we're still talking about a comedy. <br /> <br /> Ordinary Decent Criminal is a really bad criminal comedy that does not deserve your attention.
