I chose this film because it sounded like a pretty decent movie, and I've always been a fan of foreign films. However, for someone who likes movies, I was surprised at how much I hate, hate, hated this movie. <br /> <br /> Although intended to expose the lives of low-class young men in Lima, and to a greater extent, the characters are hopelessly superficial and the public ends up having absolutely no feelings for them. <br /> <br /> Although the story revolves mainly around M, it rarely ever speaks, and its dialouge is, at best, incredibly dry and boring. <br /> <br /> Attention: some small spoilers *** <br /> <br /> Basically, the story revolves around a young man named M who is looking for jobs, but without success (he earns work twice, but stops because they are not "for him", when you are poor, the last option you have is to be picky). Spend some time with his friends, who has any idea of ​​"fun" is to rape a little fourteen year old, steal cheap tires from a piece of shit for a lot of grass, and many other slightly delayed activities. /> <br /> M's friend has a plan in mind to make $ 25,000 a piece and move to the US directing Cocaine in Miami. When the drug lord gives them a job, we are treated by an extremely lame scene of the three friends buying clothes at the mall with some background music. We see them trying on different clothes as little girls who gave $ 200 to shop, get hair cut, and then go away like clear gangsters (a character, Carlos, will ALWAYS always wear sunglasses ... even at night ). The day before their departure, the group leader left to talk to the drug lord, leaving M and his friend to play the fool. They party, take different samples of the drugs they should run and collide in their old school, acting like animals and destroying everything in sight. <br /> <br /> The film ends when M tries to call his girlfriend, who hangs up on him. The friends then proceed to set fire to the phone, which brings out a group of children and an old man with a gun. M's and Carlos's friend responsible for the drug race shows up on his bike and wants them to go away with him. So he starts alone and gets hit by that old man. The police arrive and arrest M and his friends (but not the man who shot the guy) and cover their dead friend with newspapers while the music plays and fades to credit. <br /> <br /> **** Fine Spoiler **** <br /> <br /> I also saw this movie a second time, hoping to see a subtle and saving factor for this, but not the I did. A complete waste of 102 minutes. Although I must attribute the merit of being simple and not moving away from disturbing elements, casting, acting and general management leaves much, much, much to be desired. <br /> <br /> IMHO, if you are interested in a film that explores the problems that this is supposed to, go instead to rent City of God (Cidade de Deus). Avoid this garbage at all costs! You have been warned !!
