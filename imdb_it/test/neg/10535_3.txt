I saw this movie yesterday, and like most of Allrdy he wrote "I also expected a Steven movie", god I love this guy just because his fighting style is unique and very humorous. I had some doubts because I read that "Ja Rule" was playing us, but I thought I hope they gave him a small role, so he doesn't irritate me by watching him. And the offcourse is the opposite, goooooooooooooooooooooood steven what the hell were you thinking of joining a group of sry *** like this. Was Steven broke and needed money? bah = (what a disappointment. If you like the Steven movie, skip this pure drama, you get just some special effects that got me voted on 10/10. But the "acting" of the ja rule ruins everything aswel for his friend kurbito with his annoying talk on the hood. <br /> <br /> My beer has gone from tasting fresh water to the one in which we do dishes. The story has had nothing "good" about it. I felt like I was a 3-year-old. <br /> <br /> We hope Steven will make me happy again in a film of the future - people who aren't even worth renting for it. <br /> <br / > A bad and fussy :-)
