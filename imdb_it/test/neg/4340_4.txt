The only thing in "Sudden Death" that exceeds the amount of non-stop action is the incredible number of holes in the plot. What with that, and the enormous quantity of devices, one could hardly call what has remained a plot. To say that the script borrowed from the "Die Hard" premise would be to make the most obvious understatement in the world! <br /> <br /> Here we have a tormented hero who works in the huge Pittsburgh skating rink like Fire Marshall. On the night of the seventh game of the final series he gets the tickets so he can treat his unrelated children to the decisive game and, of course, spend some time with them. Also taking the game, but for political reasons, is the Vice President of the United States (Raymond J. Barry). When a group of incredibly well-organized mercenaries capture the vice president's box and demand hundreds of millions of dollars in government money, our hero Darren McCord has his plans more than slightly put out. <br /> <br /> Each time a new one of these formulaic gestures are made it seems that all those that hinder innovation are the nastiest villains, and ever more spectacular and gruesome ways in which good guys get rid of them . Director Hyams and his screenwriter have exaggerated (not that this is an original sin) in trying to make us hate the evil terrorists. The horrible villains go to shoot the secret service, security and civilians (both old and young) with a gay abandonment, and with little respect for the relative threat of each victim. <br /> <br /> Van Damme engages in abundance in violent, heroic and death-defying cuffs and shootings. The script asks for some European muscles. Almost everyone else has walk-ons other than Powers Boothe, which seriously distorts his underrated and superficial role as the crudest and meanest old leader ever. <br /> <br /> There is quite a bit of smart cinema and enough special explosive f / x to keep everyone awake. But really, that's all the action has, action. Although there are some elegant sequences, nothing could be called scandalously brilliant. <br /> <br /> Saturday, 10 February 1996 - Greater Union Melbourne
