Young writers, young author, young cast, busload of producers, what could go wrong? Everything. Even the lame is too good a description, which suggests that three of the four legs worked, when in reality none of them was. A plot that is just enough recycled for a 48-hour and a half hour television, exaggeratedly extended to ninety minutes. The audience was talking on the screen again, the story was so bad. Dirty cops steal drugs from the evidence locker. How many thousands of times has it been done on television? Bad cops are good cops. Again, how many times? There was no original whit in this whole concoction. Giovanni Ribisi made a courageous effort to support the lack of script, drawing the only laughter of the entire film. And the thought of him and Claire Danes working from a real script with an adult director and photographed by a real filmmaker intrigues me. Note to writers: buy one of those story generators. It can't be as bad as tearing up bad television. Note to the author: there are shots at your disposal other than close-ups. Even the beautiful and interesting face of Claire Danes eventually becomes boring in the foreground. Note to the director of photography: Learn yourself about a professional for a few years: you have a lot to learn. Note to the color timer in the lab: at least try to convince the author and director of photography that they don't know what they're talking about. Note to Claire: I hope this is paid for your new apartment. It's time to get professional management and start reading the scripts before logging in.
