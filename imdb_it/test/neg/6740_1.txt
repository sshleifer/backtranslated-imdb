The Foreigner is a film directed by Steven Seagal that originally was to be released as a film in March 2003, an intention that would have been canceled when the previous Seagal (Half Past Dead) film got stuck at the box office. According to some reports, the film had a budget of $ 20 million, including location shoots in Warsaw and Paris, and was completed as part of the obligation to study a negotiated two-panel agreement after the relative success of Exit Wounds seemed to indicate that Seagal still had a solid following. <br /> <br /> Despite the size of their investment, Sony Screen Gems probably made the right move to put this film aside. It is almost incomprehensible. What am I saying? It's incomprehensible. I don't think I understood what was happening, except in the broadest terms. <br /> <br /> Seagal is instructed by a mysterious boy to deliver a mysterious package to another mysterious boy. Other mysterious kids try to stop it. Other very mysterious types try to kill the moderately mysterious kids who try to stop it. Other really very mysterious boys do particularly mysterious things, all of which were actually too mysterious for me to understand. The mysterious wife of the intended recipient attempts to intercept the package before it can be delivered to her husband. Since he is a self-proclaimed "consummate professional" who was hired to deliver the package only in the hands of her husband, Seagal first challenges his wife, then later gets involved in protecting her and her daughter from other mysterious kids with unexplained agendas as well as from her husband. <br /> <br /> Many people have mysterious and cryptic conversations. Many people blow each other. Some boys seem to die more than once, while in other scenes the shootings end without a clear view of the result, so the public sees someone die, but is not sure which of the gunslingers is headed for the hill. Alliances change often, adding further mystery. Or should I say confusion? <br /> <br /> I don't know who was on his side, or what anyone really wanted, and the resolution was as unsatisfactory as the show. At the end of the film, I sat there thinking, "Is this the end? What ...?" <br /> <br /> I couldn't even understand the credits. IMDb says Australian actress Kate Fischer (from "Sirens") was in this movie, but I'd be damned if I knew where. Either it was left on the cutting room floor or wisely excluded the project. He could have found some more advantageous activities for his career, such as undergoing unnecessary surgical procedures, tearing up those annoying insert papers from magazines or taking some community college courses in animal husbandry. <br /> <br /> Seagal was a pretty good melee fighter, but the action scenes failed to redeem this movie. Seagal is now 50 years old and is a very large man, so he is reduced to a mimetic level of physical effort and also during which he is contained in a knee-length coat to hide his short Brandoesque build. He could also get some liquidation by removing the wrappers from the chocolate bars, although this is understandable if you estimate how many of those he has to eat to maintain his current girth. Steven Seagal seemed to be making a comeback with Exit Wounds, but if his last film was half dead, it must be close enough to fill the other half.
