An American family moves to the countryside of Spain to live in an isolated house. Queen (Anna Paquin), the teenage daughter of Mark (Iain Glen), who is ill and has some mental problems, and Nurse Maria (Lena Olin) notes that strange things are happening at home and with her young brother Paul (Stephan Enquist), but his mother does not believe it. Reggie decides to investigate with her boyfriend Carlos (Fele Martínez) about the origins of the house, and they discover that forty years ago, the place was the stage for the death of six children. Reggie decides to ask his grandfather Albert (Giancarlo Giannini) for support to protect his brother against the house and his father. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD expecting to see a good haunted house movie mainly for the names of Anna Paquin, Lena Olin, Fele Martínez (from "Thesis" and "Abre los Ojos") and Giancarlo Giannini. Besides, I really like Spanish cinema. Nevertheless, I found a terrible script, a terrible direction and a deplorable recitation of excellent actors and actresses. The intention of the story is good, remembering a little "The Shinning" in some moments, but unfortunately it is badly developed, never clear, for example, the reasons and the reasons why the American family moved to Spain or the horrible relationship between family members, mainly the situation between Maria and Reggie. The management is confused, trying badly to use shadows and shadows to give the story terrifying effects. I love Anna Paquin, but her expression expressionless never works in this film. Lena Olin is a caricature of the great actress she is; and Stephan Enquist is too weak for such an important role. Only Fele Martínez has a good performance in his supporting character. I liked the open end of the story. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Sétima Vítima" ("The Seventh Victim")
