The plot of the film is quite simple: a viral epidemic has turned the population into carnivorous zombies. Those who left have become "hunters". <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, this is NOT the worst zombie movie there is. Among the worst there are "Zombiez" and the infamous "Zombie Lake". In fact, I think the idea of ​​"Quick and the Undead" was very good, just performed badly. Considering the budget they had to work with, this film looks very good. I wasn't bored at all when I looked at him. The special effects were solid, although they once used CGI (a fat zombie was struck in the head), but everything else (blood, liver) was pretty good. Acting is terrible anyway. Our main guy looks like the young Clint Eastwood, other "actors" are not even worthy of mention. As for the plot, they haven't worked out enough on the development of the story. <br /> <br /> Bad: acting, low budget. Good: special effects, idea for the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie deserves 4/10 from me. It's not as bad as people say. Imagine a WESTERN ZOMBIE, so watch this movie.
