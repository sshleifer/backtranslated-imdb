This film is very modern and cutting edge. It's about 75% in English. It is aimed at a young audience that speaks more than English. The basic plot is similar to DDLJ. Acting is below average. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately they portray a wrong image and give a bad example to young people. Tanisha is shown drinking from a bottle, or taking tequila shots about 5-6 times in the movie. The director does not even admit to being an alcoholic and has problems with alcoholism. Throughout the film, she wears only bikini tops if she is at work, on the beach or at the wedding. The heroine of the film that does this makes young people feel that this behavior is acceptable. <br /> <br /> Less is said about the failure of Uday Chopra in the DDLJ role of arrogant pursuer than Shahrukh Khan, the better. The film is about gender equality. But equality should not be to make the same mistakes, rather than making the right to do the right thing. If men have been shown as chronic Casanovas in movies, it does not mean that women should interpret the same behavior. <br /> <br /> Even if the film is made in a carefree spirit, it promotes so many wrong social notions in the name of being ahead, that "funny" part of the film has no impact. Not even in Canada do women dress like this, or boys behave as they showed in the film. It is certainly not a reflection of Indian society or Canadian society. Perhaps they should have a disclaimer at the beginning stating: "All the characters and events in the film are imaginary and do not reflect the true culture of the cities and countries mentioned in the film". The only good thing about this film is the length, 1.5 hours, thank god.
