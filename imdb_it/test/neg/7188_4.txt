let me start with a terrible plot and a horrible control system. good animation but not too good graphics. this is why I'm giving this game 4 out of 10. THIS GAME REALLY REQUIRES AN ANALYTIC IF YOU ASK ME !!! I would do it again and make this control system better, so the jaws aren't that hard to control. if I could improve it, I would have made those graphics better than those in the film. will make anyone crazy when you are killed so easily. I played this and was killed by a diver when he had one of those snap knives in 2 shots. the dolphins will kill you so much that the shark will beg to go to the bottom of hell. this game sucks. sorry for all the rude I think I'm done now. it's just that this game sucks so much that it should be taken off the store shelf. I challenge you to play trash and you'll probably get so angry to die so easy, so DON'T PLAY IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
