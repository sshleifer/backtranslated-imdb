Wow, what movie of cheese is this! It starts as if it were a backwoods braggart, with the camera following the dogs running through the woods. It gets a little boring and follows the story of some girls moving into a house haunted by Indian spirits. We then have a lot of shots of a partially dressed girl and another naked girl in the bathtub. Suddenly it becomes really vulgar when the "Zombie Indians" are born from the earth and start to terrorize the girls. We even have an Indian samurai. <br /> <br /> This film starts quite boring, although I found the story of the four Indians who buried themselves alive quite interesting. Once the Indian zombies (or whatever you want to call them because they're not technically zombies) they start to terrorize the girls when all the fun begins. This is not a special movie and cannot be taken seriously, it is just something fun to watch when you are bored or when you drink with friends. I can't help thinking that it would work better as a story because the first semester is boringly boring.
