Okay, so when a friend of mine told me that he should be directing MM2 and MM3, I thought, hell, I had the opportunity to check out Monster Man and see what happens, maybe I can take a part of it, but when I jumped into my DVD player and I tried to stifle the first 45 minutes of nothing but ugly, mean I mean bad comedy horribly annoying from that fat ass who thinks it's funny, not to mention how much time the director spent on the useless trip to the desert, I came to the conclusion that these guys had no idea what they were doing and they lost the boat with a long shot. The story could be somewhat different from the usual BS you see on the Blockbuster / Hollywood video shelf released by Lions Gate these days, but they definitely messed this up. Why dedicate so much time and effort to take annoying recitations and bad beats, why not shorten the journey and insert more plot into the film. Myabe the screenplay was so bad that they had to cut out a lot of movies or maybe the director didn't turn out enough horror and blood, which they had to fill up to do the usual 84 minutes ???? All in all, and I'm easy here, maybe because a friend of mine is the bald redneck in the bar scene that crushes his skull when he chases the three who go down the street, I'll give him at least 1 star for rehearsing, and the gore scenes / killings weren't so bad, again, they tried. Too bad, Lions Gate could have created an interesting franchise from this idea, but it failed. I don't recommend paying to rent it, maybe you can find a smaller version where the movie starts from the hitch hitch scene. CRAP!
