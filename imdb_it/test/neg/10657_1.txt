... with nothing to leave with. This film begins with scenes in China with the discovery of a newborn. Although this is not a new concept, I have no intention of giving up right there. Then there's a flash forward to adolescence. The man's wife and the biological child are fed up with the father who neglected them. Although this didn't seem culturally accurate, and the film made no move to develop these characters or the purpose for the adopted father's devotion, I insisted. <br /> <br /> So, we are in Malibu, where we are bombarded by poorly structured interaction and terribly low budgets (empty compilation: acting / film camera / lighting). <br /> <br /> I will no longer give away the plot, because I suppose the synopsis is Precise: the film aims to show how a Malibu girl who (although she seems to have innately compassion and interest in helping others when she asks immediately to the teacher of the trip to China) is flawed and reckless, considers himself a healer and helper of the body and the spirit. <br /> <br /> Lame. LAME, LAME, LAME. <br /> <br /> Now, I have to admit, I am a harsh critic, so maybe taking one of those LAMEs is far away and you will be right.
