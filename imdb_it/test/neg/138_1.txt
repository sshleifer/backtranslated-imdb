I'M BOUT IT (1997) <br /> <br /> Developed and published by No Limit Films <br /> <br /> >> Pros: Absolutely none <br /> <br /> >> Cons: I I don't even know where to start! <br /> <br /> Summary of the plot: Master P plays a drug dealer who looks, talks and behaves more like a live cartoon character. This is all the plot I got from this movie. <br /> <br /> Review: I remember being in eighth grade during his release and everyone in my class praised this clown called Master P. This movie is so bad, it's not even funny. All the characters in this film are extremely tired stereotypes, the audio is audible only when the music plays, and it seems that the film was filmed from a public access channel. Fortunately, I didn't buy this movie like all my classmates degenerated in other cities. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 <br /> <br /> My verdict: Avoid this video as its a sexually transmitted disease.
