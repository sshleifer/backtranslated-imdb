Contains Spoilers <br /> <br /> But if you hadn't fallen on your head as a child and then used as a soccer ball, then you'll agree with me that this is one of the worst but hilarious series ever made. Hitting a woman who was beaten as a child by her father who also killed her mother, she spends her time drawing but waiting, then she becomes her superhero drawings and continues to fight crime, so she is "drawn by the pain" " so smart. The story itself is OK, but that's right, Jesse the screenwriter and the director have no idea how to write a script, just listen to a monologue with the 8-year-old hero's version and it seems to have been written from a 30-year-old man, while his father, who wears a big mustache, walks around the house all day while looking angry, showing just how bad characterization is, especially the point where he gets angry in the first episode and starts repeating phrase "no more" while holding his wife's head before killing her using the marble work surface.The following sound effect of the bang and only her terrible acting as everything she does to broadcast he is angry, but he is brilliant, even after where he goes to beat his daughter using his belt which is all over with him who complains and seems angry in slow motion. The episodes themselves could easily contain a good clean script of over 5 minutes, but oh no Jesse does not want this. Little Jesse is causing post-modernism as if he had just eaten Donnie Darko and then committed suicide. The camera jerks around aimlessly, all at strange angles, excessively repeated lines and even useless sequences just confusing every now and then to fill in too long episodes. In conclusion the idea is not bad, it is just how it is made, there is also a great character of a fat boy on a bench that does not show up enough and is fantastic, I just want to hug her chubby Lil cheeks because they look so soft . The character development does not exist because the main character only says the first philosophical thing that comes to his head, even if everyone contradicts each other. But all in all, mainly s ** t <br /> <br /> Indiana Jones 4 is much better, write "Jeeharv" also in you-tube, the results could make the beauty of the world cry even you will hear a lot of jokes to cheap, mostly gay.
