Rabbit Fever is a collection of mockumentary sketches, each focused on a personal female device made popular by a single 1998 episode of Sex and the City (the second half of 1998, rather than the first episodes that were all directed by women) . Since the opening of statistics that make the Rabbit Fever look like a soft porn movie, we are faced with a sea of ​​predictable sketches with real and imaginary characters in a fast-paced world with the dependence of women on solitary pleasure. <br /> <br /> Men, as Germaine Greer explains rather arrogantly, invented a gadget for women that makes men superfluous in the bedroom. The Rabbit Vibrator (which some statistics suggest represents about a quarter of all sales of vibrators) is so named because of the small long ears similar to rabbits that vibrate to stimulate the clitoris, while the rotating beads inside the rod stimulate the inside of the vagina. The film interviews characters who attend Anonymous Rabbits to help overcome their "addiction", as well as people known as Tom Conti posing as a professor or Richard Branson (among scenes of rabbits that are banned on airplanes) saying he would like to provide rabbits free his first-class passengers traveling by air and ultimately to all of them. <br /> <br /> The main weakness of the film is that the idea is not enough to support 85 minutes of cinema, the sketches do not have the written ability to say a Charlotte Church or Ricky Gervais to make them quite amusing and, while it might make the late-night TV bleak, it doesn't have a hook to get people to queue up in multiplexes in public to watch masturbation jokes. <br /> Lines like "It's been almost a week since you used your rabbit - how are you coping?" wear rather thin after five minutes. The film is based on the idea that the mere mention of the word "rabbit" can make people laugh. . . and another and another. The hectic midnight units to buy batteries could be fun in real life, but here they seem rather laborious, and the special emergency delivery service is welcome. <br /> <br /> Strangely the BBFC gave an 18 certificate despite zero violence, almost no explicit sex and sexual references that are less "perverted" than any late night comedy show. The company protested against the decision, but the BBFC did not move. At first sight this seems excessive on their part and their consumer advice now simply says "Contains frequent strong sexual references". One might think that young people would find the jokes about masturbation more enjoyable than the most desperate of bachelorette parties, and the topic that deserves a debate; but Rabbit Fever does not even have the saving grace of a balanced approach to the subject. <br /> <br /> The best part is probably The Rabbit Song by Ruocco (who plays a band called Thumper in the film). For those who have fallen asleep and woken up to the end credits, there is a bonus scene at the end to reassure them that they have lost nothing.
