A study in BAD. Bad direction, bad acting, bad writing and f / x that will teach you that it is better to update your computer before shooting. It's the kind of shot you used to get drunk in your basement with Dad's camera when you were young at heart. But surely you wouldn't show it in public when you're sober again, right? You wouldn't even see it. Avoid at all costs.
