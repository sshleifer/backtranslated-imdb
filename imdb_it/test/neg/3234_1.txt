Dean Koontz's book "Watchers" is one of the most beautiful books I've read. Unfortunately, the film is a sad caricature of the book. The disenchanted middle-aged hero and the solitary spinster with whom he finds meaning for his life become the film in a pair of teenage fools, the stoic security guard and the conscientious sheriff unite in a floury jab - get image? The filmmakers took a moving love story, horror and adventure and converted it into a Z-Grade horror movie aimed - very badly - at the teenage market. <br /> <br /> Buy the book and enjoy many hours of reading - it will be much, much more rewarding than watching the movie. <br /> <br />
