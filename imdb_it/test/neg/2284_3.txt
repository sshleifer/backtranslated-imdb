It only took one vision of this dog for me to say "Never again!" It's so profoundly unmemorable that I had to read other people's reactions before I could remember anything beyond (1) it was horrible, (2) Connery should have quit while he was ahead, and (3) the film included a gross total- A bit of complicity that implies the falsification of a retinal scan through the most gruesome (not to say horribly inefficient) means. <br /> <br /> Actually, I never understood why someone would prefer even the best of Connery's Bond movies the worst releases of Moore or Dalton. Or Lazenby, Brosnan, or even David Niven, for that matter. Personally I found Octopussy and Moonraker, among the other "canonical" Bond films, much more fun than this, and probably for the same reasons that others deprecate Moore Bond's films, namely their ironic humor, and their willingness to surrender to the absurdity of the entire basic environment.
