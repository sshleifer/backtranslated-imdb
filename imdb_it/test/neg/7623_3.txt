I bought a DVD of this film for a dollar in the department store. This is probably the best and kindest comment I have to offer about it. At least he didn't deceive me about the cost of lunch. <br /> <br /> The problem with "Chiller" is Craven's problem as a director. The man has his apologists who claim that his travel documents prove to be a really intelligent boy and a loving conceptualist. But it is no secret that, as a director, he has never owned a small part of the visual and narrative sense of a Hitchcock. Strongly attested by "Chiller", it is much closer to that legendary Hershel Gordon Lewis. What Craven lacks as a director is the main ingredient that would take him from the rented director to a higher film production plan. <br /> <br /> We specify. The transitional moments of this film are elegant. The final shots give the feeling of a quality production. The film seems professionally put together, in the way a film shot by a commercial television director would do it. (One thought: films are only a visual distinction, these transitions that at least seem to be professionally managed may well be the work of some directors of the second unit.) They are the parts between bridges and smooth transitions - the drama - that fall flat. <br /> <br /> The core of the process is always superficially managed. The critical shots (later, for example, the departing car enters the well-positioned camera, then we head towards the outside of a hospital night, then to the waiting room and the corridor, then to the telephone box in the 'corner that will represent the next piece of action) are quickly dispensed so that we can hurry and get to the next part. Craven never comes close to exploding the dramatic or visual possibilities of any moment. The net result of all this misplaced attention to the less important parts, and the harmonious race to keep things in motion, is a film that looks like the work of the young art student who sharpens all his pencils, carefully adjusting his easel and the set of lights. up, grind all his pigments, stretch and plant the canvas ... and then he has nothing to say. Craven, like the art student, never takes meat for exercise. <br /> <br /> For Craven apologists who will point out that this film was made for TV, I will indicate Spielberg's "Duel" and I will say no More.
