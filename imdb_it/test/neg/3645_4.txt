I couldn't wait to watch this film, and it contains very interesting perspectives from Iraqis across the country, not just in the main areas. <br /> <br /> However, as the film progressed, and as it seemed to become more and more one-sided, I began to wonder who had edited the film. To get to several hundred hours at only 80 minutes, obviously the decisions had to be made. <br /> <br /> I would have loved a movie that showed how everyday Iraqis felt about problems on all sides, but with the headlines in contrast to what people said, and with everyone those who had the same opinion at the end of the film, I thought it was obvious that the editing was done with a pre-conceived prejudice. <br /> <br /> it could have been a great movie.
