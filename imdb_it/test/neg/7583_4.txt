Roger Spottiswoode is not the worst director, and did a good job on the underrated sci-fi thriller "The Sixth Day" (a.k.a "The Box Office Downfall by Mr. Schwarzenegger"). However, "Air America" ​​must be one of its most inept projects. <br /> <br /> It looks like a fusion of drama, comedy and war movies - it's not a very convincing mix. In fact, I found out he was overbearing. <br /> <br /> Robert Downey, Jr. (during his heyday) plays a pilot recruited into a secret CIA organization that operates during Laos in the Vietnam era. Mel Gibson plays his co-pilot and comes across the knowledge that they are dealing drugs, and what not. <br /> <br /> The film was advertised for release because it featured two famous faces and Aerosmith had re-recorded the Doors classic "Love Me Two Times" for the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The remake of the song is rather poor, which fits the film.
