When I went to see this I thought, I liked the first two and thought they were very suspenseful, so this should be good too. MISTAKEN! There was no suspense and they don't explain the new dinosaurs! When I finished watching it, I had lost all respect for Steven Spielberg and Michael Crichton, but it turned out that it was not directed by Spielberg or written by Michael Crichton! This film was going through "the motions". I thought this film had absolutely no plot and I thought that nobody should waste their money to see it.
