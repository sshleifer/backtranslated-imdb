The selection of the swollen, boring and racist "Cimarron" is the worst choice for the best film in the history of the Oscars. Not acted (in particular by Richard Dix, rightly forgotten, whose interpretation of Yancey Cravat, egocentric and irresponsible, is one of the most narcissistic characters in the history of the screen) and a pressing rhythm, the film is really shocking today due to the racist tendency towards his only black character, which is presented while being shown sleeping in a chandelier. <br /> <br /> Other comments from IMDb reviewers have rejected the attitude towards this character as simply dated, but many films that appeared during this period DO NOT describe blacks as idiots and lazy mental defects in the way this behemoth he delights; so that argument seems weak to say the least. But if you consider this humiliating characterization as having a bad taste for someone at any time or simply for the forgivable ignorance of a less educated age, it is very painful to look with eyes of the 21st century. <br /> <br /> But even this may not matter if the film were not too long a nuisance. Voted the Oscar for best film at the 1930/31 Academy Awards when such enduring classics as "City Lights", "The Public Enemy", "Dracula", "The Dawn Patrol" and "The Blue Angel" were not nominated, "Cimarron" is by far the worst selection to enter the Oscar pantheon.
