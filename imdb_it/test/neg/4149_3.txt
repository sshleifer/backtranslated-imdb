As a child of the 80s, like so many other reviewers, I hated the original V and V: the final battle. I have both on VHS and I never connect the VCR to watch them. I remember that I didn't really like this short series, but I couldn't remember why, so I rented the first record. With the third episode I had my memory refreshed. It's terrible. Writing is beyond horror. It's not even FUN. They had a lot of material to work with here, but they didn't seem to know what to do and turned it into "Days of our Lives with lizard aliens". How beautiful and full of potential is the concept of Elizabeth the Starchild? All they could think of doing is making her grow into a whining and boring teenager to compete with her mother in a romantic way? Marc Singer seemed less embarrassed than being in the Beastmaster II than he was when he was trapped in this group ... the point is, whether you're one of the young people who just discovered V or one of us older science fiction fans for rediscover some old fun, save yourself and SKIP THIS!
