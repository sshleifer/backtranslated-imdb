Bad news for anyone who wants to film a complete parody of a Lifetime Network movie - the creators of A Deadly Encounter have already done it, even if unintentionally. All the Lifetime trophies are there - a mother divorced in danger from a deranged stalker, an unreliable ex-husband (who, of course, cheated on her while they were married), and a police department that condescendingly dismisses her complaints, forcing her to stand up for itself. Above all stunning is the scene in which the heroine, after enduring a raid and the attempted murder of her mother by her seemingly all-powerful stalker, decides to relieve stress by shopping! Having seen firsthand the harassment of a co-worker by a creep he met at church, I know that stalking is not a joke, but it is certainly in this film.
