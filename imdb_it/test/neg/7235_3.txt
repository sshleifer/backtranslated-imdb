I have to say that I saw the worst Sci Fi Channel originals, but this Nu Image shinker from Yossi Wein was still quite compelling. The big problem is that it is simply not convincing, not just his creature, but acting, writing and any attempt at dramaturgy. The director lacks any kind of talent and the script by Boaz Davidson and Danny Lerner never works, predictable, often ridiculous, while offering less screams than a fair number of films of this type that never offers anything to engage or increase the heartbeat . Actors do their best, but with this material their laboring efforts have little effect. Matthew Reilly Burke is a mildly guardable hero, Meredith Morton similar to a loving loving interest. It was actually a little less convincing, but at least it was easy on the eyes. The film has at least the dignity of moving forward at a reasonable pace, but its biggest advantage is that the octopus is not entirely rendered in CGI. So, even if it doesn't look good, at least there are some legitimate scenes of characters that collide unexpectedly with rubbery tentacles in a rather funny way. I also chuckled the disparities between the different representations of the octopus, the cgi blows of the creature as a whole vary over the course of the film, they are also different not only in size but appearance for the practical shots of it, and there are scenes where the Sprawling action suggests that the producers had given up pretending to make a film about an octopus and imagined their creature as a group of various tentacles. The scenes of the creature that attacks people become old fast, but there are some funny scenes in which it takes on other things, like a boat and a crane. Yes, these scenes are poor, but they made me laugh. Undisputed evidence is a hilarious sequence in which the octopus takes a landmark in New York, the scene may not be much more than a minute, but it is really inspired, and it's worth watching on YouTube. Apart from that, things are not inspired in the round, (a level of lack of gore or malice of PG prevents this from pulling itself out even in the good times of garbage), the film takes a turn in the territory of semi-catastrophic films - thrilling in the end, but I can't really give him credit because the best shots in the last scenes were selected from the movie Stallone Daylight (which for my memory is quite good). Altogether this was pretty rubbish stuff and not something I would really recommend to anyone except the struggling creatures. Better than a blow in the eye with a wet stick, but not much.
