DANGER: watch out for spoilers that fall ... <br /> <br /> Boy, it was a bad movie. I know they were going for a "true love conquer all", but on this whole film there were about 3 (which seemed more like 9) hours of my afternoon that I will never return. The film is about two young lovers named Kai and Gerta who live in a remote city in a fantasy world. Kai is the much abused messenger in a hotel owned by Gerta's father. At first Gerta ignores Kai's advances but eventually warms up with him for the disgust of (You Guessed It!) Gerta's father. As if this obstacle was not enough to overcome, an evil snow queen shoots a piece of glass into Kai's eye and becomes a bad person who treats Gerta badly. Kai is finally taken to the snow queen's fortress (which is the same set as the ice-covered hotel, because the good people of Hallmark love to freak out) and Gerta sets off on a mission to bring Kai back. Along the way he runs to the other 3 seasons that are evil in their own special way, but Gerta escapes them with the help of some boring and forgotten characters she meets along the way. (All the time you want to turn it off, but you can't force yourself to do it. It's probably the worst and most effective spell cast by the Snow Queen.) However, I'll save you from the finale because everything you can think of in your head now is probably better than how they ended it. So in conclusion, the Snow Queen is an incredibly boring film, which takes the fan away from the imagination.
