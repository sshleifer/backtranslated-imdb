This stuff bears more resemblance to the novel as it does a slice of pickle to a cucumber. The directors took the Alamo section from the book, turned it into a movie and claimed it was based on the book. Hah! I wonder what they did to induce Mr. Michener to approve this piece of hair? It was just another Davy Crockett, a flintlock rifle, Santa Ana, 13 days of glory collecting poppies. I almost started cheering for Mexicans, just to end the damn thing. And what was that scene in which Stacey Keach was trying to convince James Bowie to let him look at the knife? The sexual allusions he used were youthful and useless. They could have used the film they wasted for that nonsense to put into real dialogue. This show was embarrassing for Hollywood. Or can those clowns be embarrassed?
