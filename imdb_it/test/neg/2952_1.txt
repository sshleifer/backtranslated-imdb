The opening scene makes you feel like you're watching a school play. But I saw school plays with better acting! Each line was delivered so clearly that I seemed to watch the actors work instead of seeing the characters. I found the development of the character to be poor and the acting very forced! I found that 25 minutes in the film, I didn't care anymore about what happened because the plot was too obvious and I was bored. I kept hanging there, waiting for the film to redeem itself, but it never happened. Sister Teresa was too sweet, even for a nun, but she seemed impulsive and slightly manipulative. All in all, I was very disappointed.
