What about Scream Baby Scream should make me not be crazy to buy it? I bought it because, God help me, I'm a sucker for the old B-cinema, even without value like this. Nevertheless, something about this film irritates me, probably it is Janet, Janet takes off a cold and spicy, apparently, with the intention of becoming deep and noble, with an expression that screams constipation, does not seem to agree at all what his tired boyfriend wants. I am happy that this is his only role. What really annoys me is that this is a gore movie from the 1960s that went terribly wrong, and as we all know, awry is Floridian for "zero gore". It's as if the director had started with a style of Herschell Lewis, but he pulled back from the blood scenes when his wife found out, so instead we end up with one boring conversation after another, and basically, a lot of annoying nothing. In other words, we end up with Florida Bore. Joseph Adler should be embarrassed. Janets boyfriend Jason is almost as ridiculous as she is, this guy has something negative to say about absolutely everything, come to think of it, he's probably the least nice guy in horror history. The only thing this film really brings is that it brings the B-gore atmosphere of the 60s / early 70s that you can find in stuff like Undertaker and his friends, Blood Freak, or more than any other of Herschell Lewis. Even Rodney of the Gruesome Twosome is in this, I thought his comic caveman routine was irritating, most of everything from reel to reel is stupid, even the trip scene was stupid. The only positive thing is the small amount of beach scenery, but that includes above all Janet who complains about life is not perfect. In the only real irony, Scream Baby Scream becomes even less interesting once the story has finally begun, around 45 minutes. If you happen to be indifferent to whether or not your entertainment is watchable, but is offended by the color red, you may not hate it. Why does Troma distribute this? Wouldn't this be the area of ​​Something Weird Video? Scream Baby Scream very well could be the worst in Florida horror / gore of his era, but, I suppose, under the unlikely characters, and the inconsistent plot, lies potential. Scream, Baby, Scream looks like it should follow the Blood Festival pattern, so to steal a quote from Janet, "If it's not good, I'll throw it out." 2/10
