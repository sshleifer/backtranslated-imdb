Terrible psychological thriller that is almost painful to sit on, every aspect is horrible. <br /> <br /> The combined talents of the best actors Kevin Bacon and Gary Oldman are totally wasted, and even if they perform well, one wonders why they are annoyed. Mark Kasdan's script is a complete disaster, and Martin Campbell has the narrative jumping everywhere, but if you can't follow it, take it as a blessing. There are too many useless and crazy scenes that simply don't make sense. Jerry Goldsmith's music is also not very helpful. <br /> <br /> Although there was potential in the plot, director Campbell's approach completely ruined it. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Monday, February 26, 1996 - Video
