In 1967 I saw an exceptional musical at the Wintergarden in New York, where Angela Lansbury performed as Mame. But Hollywood gave you the command ???? No Lucille Ball as big as Lucy was given the role. He killed the movie. What a mistake there was no chemistry as there was on stage Bea Arthur and Angela, who a couple of times when they sang. It is a pity that a producer does not put them together today
