These are moments like these that I really want to be a more avid reader of Clive Barker's literary repertoire, since very few things feel worse than not being able to fully understand a film of this incredibly "visual" caliber. Based on the novel "Cabal", the plot of "Nightbreed" involves a behemotic quantity of sumptuous and bizarre creatures and settings in an underground society of demonic demons. A normal boy is connected to the strange world, called Midian, through his dreams and his psychiatrist forces him to believe that he is responsible for a series of gruesome family murders in the last few months ... Thinking that this is true, he withdraws to Madian - located below a rural cemetery - where it is reluctantly accepted. The shrink, however, is right about Homeboy's care with a diabolical scheme to hit the Nightbreeds community ... <br /> <br /> Wishing so much to love this movie, I was very disappointed in the long run. Unfortunately I didn't read the story, so Barker's fantasy world and its purpose and all these monsters were horribly confused and the premise was painfully erratic. I understand how the final cut was cut to hell and also the moderate antipathy of Barker's show for the overall product, but I didn't "understand" it. Although it is essential to read the story, I think it should at least be translated into a film so that it is still understandable to those unfamiliar with literature. If "Cabal" is as twisted as this film, Barker has really come up with a dead concept. I couldn't help feeling a little bored after a while, especially when things started to get more and more ridiculous (somewhere in the prison I realized how bored I was) - like a police department going to war without fear with Midian as it happens every week! No one seems to think that the idea of ​​immortal monsters is a bit ... strange. I liked the visual effects and all that madness that went on in Midian, especially the hedgehog and the big head of SOB ... Definitely an epic movie when you consider the enormous amount of effects and the morbidly convincing furniture. David Cronenberg fills his position well while the madman shrinks with his cool zip-up potato mask, but we all wish he did some work behind the scenes to help save this pile ... <br /> <br /> So, if you have a boner for the Clive Barker material and fully understand what exactly Midian is, why they show creatures during the opening title sequence (terrible idea!), and why these creatures reside there and as some punk guys share a telekinetic link to it, you should probably check "Nightbreed". I will look for "Cabal" one of these days and hopefully I will gain some perspective ... Or maybe I will completely forget this disguise ... Until then, this is a poorly constructed and quite boring disaster of a movie .. Look instead "Hellraiser".
