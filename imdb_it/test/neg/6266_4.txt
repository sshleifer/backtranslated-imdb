The mad scientist, Professor Tabani, drinks a potion he prepared in his laboratory, but is instead transformed into a bloodthirsty vampire. When Dr. Aqil visits, Tabani sees a photo of Aqil Shabnam's wife and, after turning Aqil into a vampire, heads for Shabnam to make her his bride. Akil's brother discovers the tomb of the vampire and his brother in castle of Tabani and kills his brother with a knife to free his soul. Tabani manages to put the bite on Shabnam and once turned around he tries to attract his young Aqil's sister runs against the clock to stop the vampire curse. "Zinda Laash" almost put me to sleep. The plot is extremely slow, but more or less follows the famous Bram Stoker novel. The suspense is completely absent as is gore and nudity. The film is recommended only for curious horror fans who want to see the second horror film made in Pakistan (after "Madman" in 1964).
