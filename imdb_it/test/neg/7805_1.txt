I saw this movie (unfortunately) because it was the only option at the time and because David Zucker was the director. I saw his previous "Naked gun" (both sides), Airplane and Top secret !, and I liked it, at least I enjoyed it and laughed. I'm not saying that the films I mentioned were masterpieces, but that they were OK. I don't remember any more stupid films than this. It's amazing how the Hollywood industry is in total decay. If any study spends money to produce this terrible image, it's no surprise that these kinds of stories are more common these days. This is a clear reflection of a decadent civilization in which sexual symbols and stupid plots are produced to entertain ordinary people. I have nothing good to say about this movie. If you plan to rent or buy it, please do not waste your money or your time, avoid it, no matter what. Even if you're a fan of one of the actors, it's not worth it. In reality this could be a good example of what a manager should avoid. I will not see a Zucker film again. (He is planning to direct the fourth sequel to the film Scary, imagine!). Pathetic. Terrible.
