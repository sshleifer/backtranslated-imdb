I found this movie in a XXX store for $ 1 on VHS. The interesting thing is that Camp Video bought the rights and slapped a 1986 copywrite date in the credits. However, enough of strange facts. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely not scary. Even calling this horror or "thriller" is ridiculous. There were only maybe 5 minutes at most of what you would call horror in this movie of over 80 minutes, and that was acting, because it was HORROR! Apart from all the word games, the script of this film was also a real rubbish, just as the special effects and make-up were ridiculous. No wonder this is such a dark film, the director has probably spent the last 35 years scouring the country for all existing copies and burning them in a large pile so that no one else could be subjected to it.
