Kate is a tired young woman who has trouble meeting and dating kids. During the film, you meet many of his loser boyfriends. And throughout the film, you're subject to the cynical negative view of Kate on love and relationships. This negative view is continued for everything and presented as the ultimate truth. I had a real problem with this. Why would anyone want to be educated about love, life and dating with someone who is obviously so messed up? It would work if that was the joke, but it isn't. For the jokes in the film (which are neither funny nor original) to work, you have to believe what Kate says: that all relationships inevitably end up with bad sex or not, that the highest level at which a relationship can evolve is when you can fart in front of your partner ... You have an idea. <br /> <br /> There is no film in recent memory that comes close to upsetting the stomach as much as Love & Sex. Why did filmmakers waste time with this waste? Every line in Love & Sex is something I experienced in another movie or in my life. There is NOTHING original or creative about history, production or style. He is cynical, dumb and meaningless. Numb the mind!
