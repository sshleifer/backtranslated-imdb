I kept waiting for the film to improve, but, alack, this is the worst kind of escapist film: a pack of cotton candy that sinks under the weight of its own ponderous importance. The rhythm runs like a legionnaire stuck in the Sahara. The absence of a good dialogue leaves the captivating stars with little else to do except look good in white linen. Irons plays another money charmer who has had a touch of the sun. Kaas is a pleasant singer but not very actress. Fortunately, the script does not call her often to get away from the microphone of the jazz club. All the enviably relaxed, cute and superfluous characters alternate with chewing the landscape with an air of tired sophistication. The whole exercise looks like an endless announcement along Ralph Lauren. <br /> <br /> If you are over forty and believe that francophilia is the key to sophistication, you may miss this piece of cardboard for a baguette. Well, if you liked this movie, you probably felt awake for appreciating Godard's flamboyant eloge de l'amour, and you might even have passed the Divorce without being a fool.
