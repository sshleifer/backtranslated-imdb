If ever there was a film that can be considered a lost opportunity, then that movie is Galaxina. What could be wrong with basing a science fiction movie on a sexy female statuary android? Surely such a film could never be a complete waste of time? Well, unfortunately this film is practically useless. There are a number of flaws with this production that needs to be said, however, there are two fundamental problems that completely destroy the entire enterprise. First, it's a comedy with no fun parts or, at the very least, a movie in which the potentially fun aspects are presented in an incredibly little fun way. Secondly, the title character is sadly underutilized. This could be due to the fact that Dorothy Stratten was not really an actress, but in that case it was a terrible decision since it is still easily the best thing about the movie. I don't think she really needed to be a great actor to play the role of a sexy android to be perfectly honest. However, what remains is a lot of relief from the comedy, which is often composed of hop-free gags like the great sci-fi hits of the time, such as Alien, Star Wars and 2001. It's badly written it's not funny at all, and it doesn't even have a plot to push things forward. The plot basically concerns a police space cruiser who is sent to take a stone. That's all! Steven Spielberg once said that a high-profile film was one whose plot could be described in a sentence. What he didn't define was what you call a film that can be described in less than one sentence - perhaps meaningless? <br /> <br /> This seemed like an infallible winner, but it failed miserably. It seems to have been an attempt to falsify Star Wars and combine it with comical situations for adults. All he actually gets is to leave you cold and a little irritated that he wasn't close to what he should have been. In Barbarella for the 80's this is not the case. <br /> <br /> Shortly after the end of this film, Dorothy Stratten was murdered in a terribly violent and terrifying manner. And for this reason Galaxina has drawn a considerable part of its sectarian interest. I just think it's a real pity that Dorothy has not had a better film to immortalize her.
