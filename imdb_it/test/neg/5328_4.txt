I know I loved this movie when I was 12-14 years old. Now that I'm 24 I looked at him again, and I wish I hadn't. Because all the things I laughed about when I was younger, it's not fun anymore. so this is an hour and a half without fun. For me the jokes were lame, not funny or just too childish. So the same thing I loved about the movie when I was a kid, now it's the things I don't like. Besides not being fun, it's actually not credible. The evil character is very badly done, but I think it's the kind of film that he is. And the last 20 minutes of the movie are pretty boring with bad fighting sequences and so on ... But if you're young you'll probably love it. I consider this film 4/10
