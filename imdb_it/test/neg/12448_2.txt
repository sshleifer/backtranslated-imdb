This was pretty bad - from bad acting, bad technical details, bad shots and bad audio (even though I was watching a DVD, sometimes I couldn't hear what they were saying, sometimes blowing my speakers, even inside the same conversation). The plot was predictable and the characters consisted of mostly incredible neurotics, bipolast and caricatures. The development of the character was horrible ... the little monella sister (why did she also write the script?), The annoying mother (again - what purpose?) The plaintive girl (why didn't she download it a long time ago? ), the band of the "dark suits" (as original - I could not think of a better name I imagine), the sexy girlfriend of the drug dealer (I must have a hot Latina if you have LA gangs I imagine, but really ...), etc. . etc. I can't believe I looked at it all.
