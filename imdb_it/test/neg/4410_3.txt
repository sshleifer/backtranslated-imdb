** May contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> An island attendant from the South Sea is executed by other natives (with a Caucasian appearance) after making friends with scientists Tod Andrews and Tina Carver. The intriguing scientists excavated it and discovered that he took the shape of a humanoid tree. He comes to life and goes on a rampage and sure enough, that the boogeyman of the 1950s, the atomic bomb, is accused of this aberration. To say that this particular monster walks as if it had a stick, it would be redundant. Suffice it to say that the creature walks, like the film itself, throwing its enemies into some comfortable quicksand and giving the main characters one more thing to make stupid comments. Paul Blaisdell created the man-tree suit and is hardly his best job. Over the years this film has been subjected to numerous comments such as "To Hell it can go!" I personally think it's the best tree movie I've ever seen.
