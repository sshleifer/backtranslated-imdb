Let's Get Tough is one of those movies that people probably miss years after making. Filled with horrible racist Jap speeches, this story of East End Kids tells how kids want to join the army to defeat the Japs. Since they are too young, they decide to clean up the city from those vile Japs. They find one, give them fruit (without anyone doing anything to stop them) and pull out a short sword to threaten them! The cops say they stop boring him! It's just Chinese! He is on our side! When the children apologize again, the Chinese man is dead! It's all part of this huge Jap and German Spy ring! Children make sure that this is stopped At all costs! I'm sure all this was fine when it was made (1942) but now, of course, you realize that this is clearly a product of his time. Full of stereotypes, German and Japanese. Strange how the East End boys have a black child in the group, and he isn't spared either. Damn.
