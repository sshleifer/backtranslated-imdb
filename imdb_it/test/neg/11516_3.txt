'Be With Me' is almost the last wallpaper movie. Just leave it running in the background. chat between you and return to it whenever you want and at some point it will end. <br /> <br /> Alas, as I watched him alone, and so it seemed to me that I had almost seen the worst, longest and driest commercial beer in the world, when I was able to keep my eyes open at the end to rolled credits ; and then I managed (just) some other waking moments to witness a "Thank You" to the film's sponsors - which included the Asia Pacific breweries. Aha! Methought: how surprising * is that * - given all the Tiger beer shots interspersed with this most forgettable movie film? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the dialogue between individuals with occasional stabs in depth, but also too often nothing of a particular advancement in the overall history of the film is said or seen. It is as if one could go out at any time and return at any later time and you would not really lose anything that would have been an unmissable contingent, or part of the plot, regarding the overall progression of the film. So the ultimate "wallpaper"! <br /> <br /> Well, I wonder ... What movies were those that positively reviewed this film? I wonder and I keep wondering ... It certainly couldn't have been so artistic to the point of Singapore's reckless excuse for shooting a camera. Presumably, "Be With Me" should be woven around the themes of "love, tragedy and redemption". But all I witnessed was boredom, a script a bit 'cooked with a smattering of text messages without gibbosity, and the only redemption was the one that occurred when this absolutely useless film is finished. What a damn waste of time, it ended up being! It was also said that the characters in this film were fictitious, except for Theresa Chan who is an "extraordinary woman who triumphed over adversity ..." Well, don't disrespect Mrs Chan, but since she was a wonderful and wonderful character, Why did the script have to involve other characters' stories without the slightest attempt to connect their lives together? Yet it turned out to be an almost unbearably boring film whose highlights included the credits. Rather than tying the destinies of all the characters, I felt that the film ended up trying the almost impossible and evidently fell among the stools with regards to any involvement of the spectators. <br /> <br /> I am generally an art -house fan of cinema and usually do not oppose to slow down the pace (of which there is no shortage here, believe me !!). I hate films like 300, Transformers, Fight Club, but I consider, for example, Eric Rohmer as a great director. So I hope you put my criticisms in a certain perspective. Nevertheless, there was no redeemable feature in the conception and delivery of the whole film, which could prevent his eyelids from sinking slowly downwards while every minute of "Be With Me" dripped. Watch this movie if you need to feel like wasting time. Otherwise your life would not be richer for having lost it. 3/10
