The film shows the relationships of the dying mother, and the son, who is very attached to her, and certainly loves her. What does it show? Show their life in very poor conditions. Show how tenderly they "walk" (he really is taking her). But what do we see further away? After the walk he walks alone in the same places, where they walk together. It is not possible. A person who loves and cares for another dying person would do anything to make life better than this. He would not have a free minute to meditate, to be alone with himself, and if he found a few minutes a month for that, he would escape from the places where he usually had to be. Another thing. The author dedicated this film to Andrey Tarkovsky. We see that he has learned many visual effects from Tarkovskij. But in Sokurov's film they are only effects, they do not support any sense or mood. Someone compared this film with "Mirror" ("Zerkalo"). There is nothing common except for these visual effects. "Mirror" is a great movie and this is just a bad imitation.
