Not for the first time, I'm out of my mind with the majority view. Oz is a terrible, pretentious, voyeuristic series. The producers have their cake and eat it. Oz, Em City, etc. They are used as ultra-rough signals that the apparent grit is complete fantasy. This allows viewers the most excuses of an intellectual apology to look at the soap opera nonsense seasoned with everything that is bad for humans. <br /> <br /> When you watch an episode, please remember while the dirty, violent, absurdly twisted, unconvincing, ill, imaginary drama unfolds before your eyes of approval, several hundred children in the poorest parts of the world have died because of bad food or water. <br /> <br /> Oz is the drama of exploitation at its worst. It appeals to the lowest instincts but pretends to be serious and meaningful. It blows hot and cold and changes from fortissimo to pianissimo more often than a Mahler symphony. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is inexorably ugly and utilitarian. The freedoms taken with reality are stupid. Here is a nightclub that owns Dandy, who arrives in Oz with his extremely cool elegance, complete with ridiculously turbid contact lenses in one eye, wielding a supply of drugs that no one has detected. Here is a murderer killer who blames the thermal death of the universe, begging to be killed, but obviously is rejected by the brute who approaches and makes a little unlikely throat by cutting himself. <br /> <br /> The action races on at a pace fast enough to allow the voyeuristic and obtuse spectator to always think about what will happen next rather than the garbage just shown. Don't worry, a betrayal, a murder, a sex scene will come within a minute or two. <br /> <br /> Finally, Oz is obviously pretentious. You don't have to feel embarrassed about being carried away by its flow. You can watch it and tell you that the producers, writers and actors are doing everything with a wink (or the same word but for a change of vowel) to the public. <br /> <br /> Yes, you can be a bad spectator and apologize for the skills of cunning, post-modernity, etc. of the Oz production team. They appeal to the lowest common denominator while pretending to operate on a higher level. <br /> <br /> Really, a contemptible series. And every hour shows, rewarding its creators and actors and generating advertising revenue for channels that show people that they have nothing better to do than watch something so ugly and useless, hundreds more children die whose lives could have been save from the dollars spent on this horrible, successful, widely praised series.
