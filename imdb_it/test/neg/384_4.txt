Dr. Lucio Fulci (Lucio Fulci) is a gorose horror film director who is beginning to feel the effect of having filmed too many bloody scenes. Visit his local psychiatrist to see if he is losing his marbles; this proves to be a bad idea, since the shrink is actually a crazy killer responsible for a series of gruesome murders. Taking the opportunity to make Fulci his fallen boy, the damn nutist hypnotizes the horror hack in thinking he is responsible for the recent series of murders. <br /> <br /> On the surface, Cat in the Brain seems to be a fantastically bloody treatment from the splatter spaghetti god Lucio Fulci. Filled with chainsaw dismemberments, ax attacks and various other bloody murders, the film fades enough light even for the most hardened hunting dogs. But when one looks more closely, one discovers that many of the macabre scenes have been removed from the previous films (mostly the 'masterpieces' of Fulci); remove them from the equation and remain with an idea of ​​ingenious plot that is totally wasted, some welcome nudity, and terrible performances by Fulci himself and David L. Thompson as the psychic shrink. <br /> <br /> the film progresses, develops into an incomprehensible mess, with the borrowed "goreo" footage inserted at random, without any attempt to work it convincingly in history. If you've seen Fulci's Touch of Death and Ghost's of Sodom, or Mario Bianchi's the Murder Secret, then you've already seen the best Cat In The Brain pieces. <br /> <br /> After much bleeding, the film wraps itself up rather quickly, leaving the viewer baffled and somehow tricked. Watch the movie if you are a Fulci outfit, but I suggest you look for the films from which the "beautiful pieces" were taken.
