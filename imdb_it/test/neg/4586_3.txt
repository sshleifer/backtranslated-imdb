THE GOAL: A truck driver (Kristofferson) fights a corrupt sheriff (Borgnine) by bringing his fellow drivers together and forms an unstoppable convoy that stretches for miles and quickly creates a frenzy of national media. <br /> <br /> THE NEGATIVE: The film setup is weak and the ending even weaker. He has all the clich√©s of a good guy / truck driver without adding anything new in the process. It ends up making SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT brilliant and inspired. Kristofferson is too relaxed for a leading role and cannot bring the picture. The character of Borgnine is portrayed awkwardly. At the beginning it is made to look like a real jerk of a sheriff who lets himself go to a little trick that starts it all. Then, in the end, he is determined to be a little more understanding and even secretly aligned with Kristofferson, who doesn't work at all. Either way, Jackie Gleason is a much better actor for this kind of role. The worst part of the film, however, is the attempt by director Peckinpah to launch a "serious message" in this stupid action film that does nothing but slow it down and bombard it in the process. <br /> <br /> THE POSITIVE: The only good scene in the whole film is the combat sequence within the truck stop restaurant. Director Peckinpah makes a fun turn to the violence of his "slow motion" brand and the result is fun. Unfortunately he starts putting all the action in slow motion during the rest of the image until it gets tiring. McGraw is always a pleasure to watch, but unfortunately she is given very little to say or do. <br /> <br /> THE LOWDOWN: If you read the synopsis of how much you've basically "seen" the movie. The song on which this film is based is pretty good, but the film adds nothing and should never have been made. This is all uninspired stuff for such a nonconformist director. <br /> <br /> THE RATING: 3 out of 10.
