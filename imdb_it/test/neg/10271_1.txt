Wow. What can I say? I was born in 1960. I love bad TV movies. I love them I'm involved. Jobs. I want to get involved. I'm spending time looking at it. I saw the emmys last night on TV. How has the TV movie Empire Falls (excellent name) been awarded in the infinite world? He really has a wonderful talent. Obviously. And they have tried admirably. But how can ANYONE pretend it was an OK script (TV for charity)? Direction OK? You know, I wish everyone the best. Really. But I thought it was absolutely amazing that Hollywood was putting this very bad movie for so many honors. Awards? For me it was a sort of alarm bell that Hollywood is a small island community. Being cynical really isn't my thing. But wow. --xptyngi
