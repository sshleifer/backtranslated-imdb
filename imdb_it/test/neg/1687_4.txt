My Wife and Kids was advertised as the Cosby show of the 00s - but unlike the latter, it was little fun and unwatchable. In fact, it's written so badly and some of the jokes revolve around Michael Mickey taking Michael Jr's stupidity and the fact that he's such a loser - that it has become increasingly boring and annoying as the show has gone on. <br /> <br /> What should have been a promising success, eventually turned into a stupid, silly show afterwards, where the ideas became so OTT and ridiculous. And as for the second Claire, I ended up hating this character so much: she became a spoiled teenage girl, childish and plaintive, in most of the last few episodes. <br /> <br /> MWAK was not a trend setter in the Cosby series, rather it was just a poor black sitcom by general standards.
