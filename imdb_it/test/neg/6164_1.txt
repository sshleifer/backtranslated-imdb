Unfortunately, House of D is simply horrible, with a ridiculous plot, terrible writing, mediocre acting, and in fact almost everything else is comparable. <br /> <br /> Tom flees New York to somehow survive an only child in Paris, manages to convince the beautiful Parisian girl who eventually marries that she is French, despite a poor understanding of her language. She is shocked when years later reveals her "secret" to her! Riiiight! <br /> <br /> So "give" his troubled story to his son, and those who are expected to believe he thinks it's just the greatest birthday gift a dad can give to his 13-year-old son. If only such things were so easy! David Duchovny mixes his wife Tea Leoni in the role of his mother and strikes again. Leoni makes me laugh like a comic book but it's just wrong for this role. <br /> <br /> One of the problems is that none of the characters is nice. I don't care what happened to any of them. I rather hoped that Robin Williams and his trademark "child in an adult body" would fall into a hole in the village, but unfortunately it was not so and we had to endure its performance to the end. > <br /> Anton Yelchin and William's daughter, Zelda, were not bad, but I suspect that the rave reviews that others are giving them are simply because they weren't nearly as bad as the others in this movie. They weren't great, let me tell you this. <br /> <br /> There are so many stupid and artificial aspects in this film: Erykah Badu, the bicycle, the Catholic school and its staff of morons, convenience stupid characters, etc. - that this review would go on forever, so I'll end up saying that House of D is a very poor film, and I'm almost embarrassed for Duchovny. <br /> <br /> The thing that really bothers me is the way I was so strongly encouraged by online "friends" to see this that I traveled a lot to do it. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't have been so annoyed that this film was so bad if I had just lost a couple of hours at the local cinema, but instead I lost a whole day and discovered that my so-called "friends" are stupid or dishonest, because this is a terrible movie!
