Hitting the ground, the film begins with THREE consecutive murders. No plot, no characters, no motivation; the second murder takes place off the screen, and the victim's severed head is actually used to efficiently hit the third victim to death! This is a high point. But the Lewis are obviously smart enough to drive with force; soon they will cover up scenes of evil dialogue with the voice of a detective and they will shoot endless snappy responses in a nasty twist. By now the horror atmosphere of Betacam's production is quickly giving way to an infomercial insurance influence, with the monumental (and somewhat captivating) simplicity of cables that further distort things in that direction. Shlub's cop investigates, slaughterers of meat cleavers, repetition, culminating in advance with a finger gag in salad. Just how the hell did your fingers end up in the salad? And wasn't the purpose of the Blood of Blood to collect the appendages they had cut? When GORE doesn't make sense, you know you're in trouble. And without ruining the great, absurd twist, just believe me on my word: the fascinating incompetence of the first scenes gives way to a deep cathode-ray tube impulse. The basic reaction is to try to put yourself behind you and get on with your life.
