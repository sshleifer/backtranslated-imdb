This movie is terrible. Create characters not present in the book, and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes. Including a hateful Jewish boy and a politically correct black girl. Not to mention the Yiddish-speaking elves. The book was a simple story about belief, and this film is a dark film, ugly and unnecessarily scary about nothing. <br /> <br /> The animation is superb, but the story has been ruined by Hollywood. <Br /> <br /> The beauty is that this film will take a bath at the box office and maybe the producers will learn not to intrude on a story that needs no improvement. Hanks was exaggerated and I don't understand why you can't use voices of other actors.
