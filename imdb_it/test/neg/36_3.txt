This film, which I rented as "Black Voodoo", should be avoided. I was expecting a blaxploitation / horror movie; but what I got was a "phantom extracting and very boring, vegence". In this case the ghost was that of a leader of a religious cult who tried to refuse treatment, but his request was ignored and died in an operation. The result: his spirit takes possession of nurse Sherry and forces her to commit acts of murder. The only voodoo link was with one of the three black characters, in this case a former blinded soccer player, whose mother practiced voodoo. The film is very slow and very boring. There is a very standard ending that provides excitement, followed by a terribly stupid ending (warning: SPOILER) <br /> <br /> in which a woman manages to defend herself against accusations of murder by saying she was possessed. This film is slow, and bad in a way that isn't funny, just amazing. Avoid it at all costs.
