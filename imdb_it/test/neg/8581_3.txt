A woman in love with her husband (he is a suicide) decides to have a child to save his life. She has been in a fertility clinic - like the lover she takes - so they both know how artificial insemination works; but instead of using the method that thousands of people use every year all over the world (the $ 5 turkey hitter), they engage in intercourse. We must also believe that, although the immigrant is in love with his girlfriend, he does not suggest the obvious alternative to sexual intercourse. Moreover, even if this is a commercial agreement, the first time he comes with his sperm donor, he takes off all his clothes, as if it were a seduction. Furthermore, her husband does not notice when $ 30,000 disappears from their bank accounts. Does it seem that this requires a more suspicious suspension of disbelief than most of the Hollywood tariff? Far away for all counts.
