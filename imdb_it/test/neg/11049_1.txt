This comment is intended primarily as a warning to people who may be attracted to the title by its (temporarily) high user rating that I find frankly baffling. The reasons why I don't like this title are the following: <br /> <br /> 1. The director must have had some doubts about making a film like Jackie-Chan or a tragic Oedipal tragedy. Consequently, in terms of genre, the film falls between two stools, while the tragic and comic elements collide and cancel each other rather than creating a harmonious whole. <br /> <br /> 2. The reasons and behavior of the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing. Lack of truth and psychological logic. <br /> <br /> 3. Absurd Casting. I don't blame the actors, because it's difficult to create a convincing character by acting alone, if there is a poor logic in the script. However, why is there an apparent age difference of about 15 years between the two main actors, whose ages in the film cannot differ by more than 3-4? <br /> <br /> 4. For me the film was a poor entertainment mainly due to point 2. If you can't find a character you could sympathize with, it's hard to follow the story with interest. When you finally learn the reason for what happened to the main character, it turns out that it doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> 5. Some films are fun as well as stimulating. Having seen this film, I began to wonder if the thought that the director tried to provoke was not that incestuous relationships could be perfectly healthy and delicious. I can't put other constructions on the finish. <br /> <br /> 6. The film is full of totally useless violence. Violence in a film (and elsewhere) is a good thing, if an important and worthy purpose is needed. The purposes may be different and I do not want to go into this broad topic. Let me say that I do not object to violence in films like "Save Private Ryan", "The Passion of the Christ" or "The Mock of Fiction". In "Oldboy" the scenes of torture and suffering are prolonged and graphic (or auditory). For what? I do not know. Personally, I am not satisfied looking at the teeth extracted with a hammer or hearing a man cut his tongue with scissors and then see him choke on his own blood, etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> 7. The film reminds me of some mangas Japanese porn in its fixation on panties from incest and young Asian girls, urinating and the like. There seems to be a minority that actually enjoys this kind of thing. If you are one of them, you might find this movie fun. <br /> <br /> In short, I don't recommend this movie as entertainment or "food for thought". Where it's not stupid, it's disgusting. Do not waste time.
