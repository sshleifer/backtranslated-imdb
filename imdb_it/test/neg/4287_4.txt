In this film Gary Oldman plays a defense attorney, a former prosecutor. He's a little tormented, but he's more or less a normal boy rather than a sort of figurative or literal monster. The funny thing is that it doesn't do it right. I guess you can't get normal from there. Kevin Bacon was pretty scary. The scene in the park was too long with too many fears. And the strange sex scene with Oldman and Karen Young seemed to come from a different movie, even though the rest of the time Miss Young did well. This film suffers from strangeness trying to hide predictability. And failing that. Do not worry
