It starts off pretty well, but after a while you start expecting more from this movie than you're actually getting. Everything becomes unclear and unclear remains. Czech directors were good 20 or more years ago. But after moving to the capitalist country, here it is, the unofficial but well-known mentality of the Czech Republic ... COPY ... COPYING ... COPYING everything they consider good, when they see it in other films or countries or elsewhere. I think this is a good example of "art" and "politics" and "horror" and "humor" and "film" and money. And I remain of the / Someone flew over the cuckoo's nest /, which cannot be compared to this film in the manner of ART and ACTORS and HISTORY and POLITICS. I think this movie is boring. It could be done better. At least, they tried. Sorry guys. :-( CANOT NOT Recommend
