I must confess that I didn't watch the whole movie. I lost the first hour during a broadcast of the Sci Fi channel. Or was I spared the first hour? The other reviewers summarize this well. It was badly conceived. Bad written. Badly acted. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing for me was the ADR. The entire film, which seemed to have been nicknamed, sounded like it was made in someone's garage. There was a massive echo to the words, which only served to block the bad dialog box. And wait. And wait. Even a TV movie should have recognized it. <br /> <br /> And the idea that alternative dimensions are differentiated by color saturation came out in the 1980s, folks.
