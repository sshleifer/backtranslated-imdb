How is it now that minority comedians feel good about slandering their minority and expecting to get away with it? <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia is not George Lopez. There's a difference. When I watch comedian Carlos Mencia, I think he hates his own people. And above all, I think he was forced to model his show like the "Hispanic / Latin / Spanish" version of the Dave Chappelle show. What a horrible mistake. (Note to Mencia: please don't make a "Block Party" movie. As much as I'd like to see Santana, Tierra, El Chicano, Christina Agullaria, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira and the "Xica da Silva" cast meeting on a stage, don't do it.) <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia likes to use the word "beaners" as much as Dave Chappelle liked to use the word "n". Neither is it funny, nor is it acceptable, even if it comes from "its own people". Even Carols Mencia likes to say "If you are offended, too bad". It is not the offense, it is the defense because of what is said and asked to be accepted. <br /> <br /> Carols Mencia goes further - it does not respect anyone for what it assumes as a comedy. It's not a comedy, it's not funny. There is a subtlety in being able to look at yourself and make others laugh in comedy and not laugh at enforcing the stereotypes that other races believed in the beginning. <br /> <br /> Mind of Mencia needs to be polished because Carlos Mencia needs polishing. Find out what is fun and not what will set more prejudices in motion and then - do it. Until then, the show, Mind of Mencia is a passage.
