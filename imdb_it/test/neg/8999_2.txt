What a waste of time. It took me about five minutes and I became * very * nervous, and soon I made a quick advance, and soon the desire to remove the thumb from the fast forward button was non-existent. Actors Mark Redfield and Barry Murphy did very capable jobs, I thought, but no one else I saw gave something like a good performance. Again, take this review with a grain of salt because the film was so unbearable that I couldn't get to the end. Heck, I couldn't get to the MIDDLE !! <br /> <br /> I can't post this review because it's not long enough. Perhaps this last sentence will put it over the top.
