This film is by far one of the worst B-movies I've ever seen. There are no twists. Even if the acting is decent, the plot is terrible. There are also many mistakes in the film, and it was annoying to watch. For none of you who love horror movies, slasher movies or even B movies, I don't recommend it to anyone. Most of the film focuses on useless killings, in ways that are not even worth discussing. This film could very well be compared to a bad remake of Jeepers Creepers, which, too, was not a great film. For anyone who wants to spend a day at home, watching little-done movies, this takes the cake.
