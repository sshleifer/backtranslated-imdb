Jacqueline Susann has written several novels that have involved sex and melodrama and some of them have been turned into films, including this effort and they all have the distinction of being among the worst films ever made. The story is about Robin Stone (John Phillip Law) and his rise to the top of television being ruthless and calculating for all those around him. He is a playboy of the worst kind he uses and then throws away every woman he hosts, including the wife of the president of the IBC network. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Greg Austin (Robert Ryan) is in charge of the IBC television network and when his young wife Judith takes a look at Robin, she wastes no time in get into bed with him. Greg gets sick and has to take some time off and that's where Robin intervenes and starts trying to manage the net, but during all this a model named Amanda (Jodi Wexler) who is in love with him kills himself. When Greg returns to his job he tries to get rid of Robin by using the moral clause in his contract when the rumors begin to fly on his relationship with Jerry Nelson (David Hemmings) who is a gay fashion photographer. <br /> <br /> This was directed by Jack Haley Jr. who was a very successful producer for both television and film, but this was just his second film as a director and the material with which has been forced to confront really looks above his head! The script comes from Susann's novel and this would probably be why this looks like a cross between "Alfie" and "The Valley of the Dolls" and I think the reason why his books never managed to translate well into film is because the filmmakers made the terrible mistake of taking his stories seriously rather than his tongue. With this, the resulting laughter is not intentional, especially during that totally ridiculous fight towards the end of the film, which begins when Cannon refuses to return the slave bracelet to gay characters! Hemmings was a very good actor, but his role here is absolutely exaggerated and he does wear one of the worst beards in history and use the term "chic" in every other sentence. Law was not the original choice for the lead role, but another actor who was chosen had a serious accident and Law intervened and made one of the most wooden performances alongside Miles O'Keeffe. The film's script suffers in two different areas as it is both completely silly and horribly monotonous and will test the patience of the beholder if they choose to watch it. One has to wonder what would be the result if a director decided to film one of Susann's novels and not take it seriously because the attempt here is ponderous and ridiculous.
