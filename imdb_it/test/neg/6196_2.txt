This film has the appearance of many "fresh" directors (close-ups and focus on the emotions experienced by the actors). The point of the film was presented from many points of view and well expressed by the relatively inexperienced cast. The point is "Have faith in Jesus Christ and in the Morman Church" Oh, and if you read or feel anything contrary to the Prophet's teachings, it is only Haterade. (Fuel for hatred)
