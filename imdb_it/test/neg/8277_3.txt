This film was a pure, slow and tiring torture. Not being a fan of slasher movies and preferring classic horror, I might not be the best judge. Slasher fans might like it as one of the first slasher entries. I would really like the 90 minutes I spent looking at this return. The only reasons to see this are 1) a young Vanna White (pre Wheel of Fortune) who has about 3 minutes total time on the screen. 2) An early role of the screaming queen Linnea Quigley (with nudity), and the legendary beauty EJ Peaker as school secretary, who added a bit of humor and sex appeal. Otherwise, a band from the 1980s called Felony makes an appearance, which although interesting, drags on too long. Just like the movie ..... I had to keep checking how much time was left and I couldn't wait to "graduate" in a better film.
