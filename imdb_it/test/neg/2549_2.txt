The Mexican werewolf in Texas is located in the small border town of Furlough where Anna (Erika Fay) lives, her best friend is Rosie (Martine Hughes) and has a Mexican boy named Miguel (Gabriel Gutierrez) who is determined to track down a beast that has terrorized the city, killing cattle and several residents, including some of their friends. Mexican local legends speak of Chupacabra, a wicked creature of myth and legend. Um, I'm struggling now because not much else happens ... <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Scott Maginnis I will not get out of here and will simply say that the Mexican werewolf in Texas is horrible, period. The script only mentions the word Werewolf once and the rest of the time refers to a Chupacabra, in fact I suspect it was not conceived as a werewolf blow. The "Werewolf" creature looks mostly hairless and more like a vicious dog, there is no reference to someone who changes during the full moon and actually attacks during the day on a couple of occasions, there is no scene of transformation and in the end when it is killed and does not change even in anyone. To be honest, apart from the title, there is nothing to indicate a Werewolf film and even then the title is just a rip off of the very famous An American Werewolf in London (1981). This is the kind of homemade crap that I personally think is killing the horror genre, how much time has passed since there was a true low-budget horror classic like Dawn of the Dead (1978), The Evil Dead (1981), Halloween (1978) or Friday 13 (1980) which were all made with shoe string budgets, perhaps The Blair Witch Project (1999), but in recent years it has been shit like the Mexican werewolf in Texas and has no absolutely no chance of being considered a classic. The characters are horrible and things happen around them, the dialogue is disgusting, the rhythm is terrible, the story sucks and practically sent me to sleep and overall this film is just crap, I'm sorry but I don't know in what other way to describe it. <br /> <br /> The director Maginnis does nothing to make it understandable, there is the annoying photographic cinematography by hand that could easily give someone a headache and a quick "flash and you will miss something" that it simply bothers and irritates in equal measure. It's not scary, there's no nakedness, there's no tension or atmosphere and the special effects are terrible. The monster looks really poor and it's no wonder if Maginnis keeps him in the shadows or cuts his scenes so fast that you can't see him well. There is virtually no color for the image, it is either almost black as the ass or oranges saturated with desert sand which makes the thing a sore eye as well. The gore is made up of some fake budgies (blink and you'll miss them!), Some bleeding wounds and a severed arm, a big problem. <br /> <br /> With an alleged budget of around $ 300,000 I admit that the budget was low, but I simply refuse to accept that to make such a sloppy film, there are a lot of low budget horror movies that make the their meager budgets go far. Everything looks like a movie at home, has no style and is incredibly bland and boring to watch. Even acting is disgusting even though you probably already knew. <br /> <br /> The Mexican Werewolf in Texas will probably count some people in the rental / purchase / watch it because they may mistakenly think that it is a sequel to the John Landis classic that certainly isn't and isn't even a real one. own werewolf film. Don't be fooled, this is horrible and I'm sick of having to waste time and money on homemade amateur crap like this.
