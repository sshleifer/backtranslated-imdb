While the film has a saving characteristic, that is to say some strokes that strike for example. the shot of the sheep hanging from the tree, the scene of the funeral procession on the raft, or the scene of the boats leaving the village (which seemed influenced by the scene in which the warships approached in the fantastic "Fellini Satyricon"), these were more photographic than cinematographic, and would have been better appreciated hanging on a wall in an art gallery than incorporated in a painfully slow film that reaches 162 minutes and suffers from terrible dialogues, extremely poor character development, over-acting, symbolism uninspired and heavy stylization. This is the first film I saw of Angelopoulos, and his reputation preceded him, I expected much better, but I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I won't go out of my way to look at others director's work in the future. The four friends went to see him agreeing.
