Some of the first talkies survived to become classics. "The Squall" from 1929 is a classic, but not in the way it was conceived. Melodramatic in history and acting, today it seems ridiculous, in particular the casting of Myrna Loy in the role of Nubi, a seductive gypsy. Imagine Nora Charles breaking a young couple and leading a young man to steal. Outrageous! However, as many know, when Loy first came to Hollywood, she did some of these exotic seductress roles. <br /> <br /> Based on a play, "The Squall" is about the aforementioned Gypsy who in the film is now in Hungary (Spain in the drama) escaping from his cruel master and inviting herself into the Lajos family home (Richard Tucker and Alice Joyce), practically appearing at the door. One after another, Nubi seduces the men of the family and the farm to talk about his pidgin English ("Clouds not bad! Clouds does nothing wrong!") And lets clues fall on beautiful gifts. The son in the family, Paul (Carroll Nye) is engaged to the beautiful Irma (Loretta Young) and is looking forward to marrying her. He loses interest when he meets Clouds. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the beautiful Alice Joyce, Zasu Pitts as a woman who lives in the house and the beautiful beauty of Loretta Young, the acting is uniformly terrible. Loy is stuck with the characteristics of his character - bad English, whining and hysteria. With her darkened make-up, her peasant dress and her curly hair, it's not only beautiful but just from the 80s - quite modern, although Richard Tucker is putting the back of his hand on his forehead to remind us that we're just coming out of the 'darkness. <br /> <br /> Robert Osborne on MTC commented that this film is one of his secret pleasures. While it is deliciously bad, it is not delicious enough to sit down again. It's just bad, but a good example of how far we have come and, if someone had not grasped Myrna Loy's sense of humor, how much could have been limited to her wonderful career.
