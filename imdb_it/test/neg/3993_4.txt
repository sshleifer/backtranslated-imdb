I have always admired the efforts of the Italian horror master Dario Argento as a producer with a certain suspicion and these have been confirmed only after my recent vision of the terrible DEMONS by Lamberto Bava (1985); the fact that this should be his third installment didn't look promising at all, but I decided to give the film a rental regardless of whether we're in the middle of the Halloween swing. I checked the theatrical trailer on the Anchor Bay DVD before viewing the main feature ?? the undeniably surprising images intrigued me to be sure, but, therefore, the actual film (which no longer makes sense of what is presented in that frantic two-minute montage and, in retrospect, can be seen to have wisely compiled most of its highlights) proved to be decidedly disappointing! <br /> <br /> Opening up quite promisingly with a medieval prologue from Alexander NEVSKY (1938), it goes downhill because it relies too much on surreal images to the detriment of narrative. As a result, do different characters randomly take center stage throughout? with the unbearable male protagonist who succumbs to the dark forces in the initial phase, the sinister-looking bishop (Feodor Chaliapin) resulting in a simple false run, the mysterious black priest progressively assumes heroic qualities, the protagonist is for any reason predated by a shaped demon goat (which culminates in a sexual ritual conducted in front of other cultists raised too evidently by ROSEMARY'S BABY [1968]) and a thirteen year old Asia Argento reasonably impressive as a rebellious but sympathetic daughter of the sacristan (who emerges as the only survivor in the end ). Incidentally, the old Argento also co-wrote the film's story and script with director Soavi and (under the pseudonym after apparently clashing with Dario in the early stages of production) the original pilot Lamberto Bava and the prolific writer Dardano Sacchetti (whom I met at the 61st Venice Film Festival in 2004). <br /> <br /> The second half of the film, extremely confusing, sees a group of people ?? including the inevitable adolescents, but also a disgusting English couple (whose continuous quarrel is given a funny and bad joke) ?? In the same way, enclosed in a building prey to evil spirits (the church is the burial place of a satanic cult), not that this outpouring of horror can dissipate the memories of the sublimely surreal of Luis Bunuel THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962 ) that you see! In the end, the film is all the more disappointing (even if the grisly effects of Sergio Stivaletti, at least, are remarkable) since I really liked the only other title of Soavi that I had seen ?? CIMITERO MAN (1994), which I own through the DVD R2 SE. Having said that, would I still like to take on its debut function ?? STAGE FRIGHT (1987) ?? and the director's follow-up effort for THE CHURCH, entitled THE SECT (1991) ...
