without a doubt, one of the most racially prejudiced films I've ever seen, with the prejudice being leveled against Hayden Panettiere while he has to move into a tough internal school. It is constantly called "white girl" and other ligatures based on its color. First, would the opposite be permitted if a black girl were the target of all abuse? and secondly, the stereotyping of ethnic children from the city center school is also a disgrace. The writers' apparent desire to show that they were "fashionable" also spread to the point that internal school won the cheerleader competition, not through talent but intimidating their white opponents !! these nuances to the film took him away from his intended direction of a harmless and carefree comedy, suitable for a family audience in a vehicle that gives no credit to any of the participants. Hayden Panettiere has a star quality, but I would be surprised if anyone in the rest of the class managed to go further. All in all a film without charm that was a waste of time.
