I like Steve Buscemi. I really like his work, both as an actor and as a director. You could say that I am -into- Steve Buscemi. A maniac by Steve Buscemi. The Lurvs Steve Buscemi. <br /> <br /> I remember when I first saw Buscemi's directorial debut, "Trees Lounge". I liked the movie, even though it wasn't as good as it could have been. It was - almost - there. It has almost scratched that itch, the desire to see "small" films about "small" people in "small" bars that are in "small" cities. It was close enough to where I would say it was a great movie - one that with some tweaks could have been exceptional. But it's fine. I like the movie and I've seen it more than once. <br /> <br /> But this review is not about Trees Lounge. It is "Lonesome Jim". When I saw the description of the film and then I saw who the film was, I was excited to finally see the film that I knew could be Tree Lounge. But what I actually felt was no different than leaving one of those neighborhood bars with a belly full of cheap whiskeys and an armful of low money, returning to your apartment with a corny brain full of exciting prospects that inevitably disintegrate in the reality of impotence induced by alcohol and dizzying regurgitation. <br /> <br /> In other words, this film left me flat and unrequited and I'm sorry I wasted the time and money it took me to get to that state - the cinematic equivalent the morning after waking up next to that cheap beer, or if you happen to be the tramp, waking up next to that stinky, farting, long-bearded idiot. The film had all the substance of a stale white bread sandwich (with the shop's branded white bread, no less) and the emotion of a corpse. I'm not sure what the point of this film was, and since it should have had some sort of point and was not an exercise in abstract surrealism that could get away without one, then this lack of a point is a sin of omission. Sort of like those new cars that no longer come with ashtrays, although there are millions of people who smoke and buy new cars (I'm not one of them, but hey, I can sympathize). Overall it was a boring movie about boring people doing boring stuff and had nothing of the grit and credibility that can bring and save a movie like that. I mean, Trees Lounge talked about boring people doing boring things, but it was interesting. <br /> <br /> I blame this on Affleck. Why do people continue to launch these Affleck shifts? They suck life from whatever they are connected to. One Affleck was in a decent movie (and it wasn't even the reason the film was decent) and suddenly every asshole named Affleck sucks as many movies as possible. And Liv Tyler is no better. Being the daughter of a rock star is not necessarily an actress. It's lifeless like Affleck. These people just don't come up from the flat page of the script. People pay to watch movies and deserve to see actors and actresses with a little charisma - these two guys together don't have the spark of the old man who delivers the shopping carts to Wal Mart. I always thought that Steve Buscemi was the kind of guy who would stand up on this kind of table, but oh Steve you disappointed us. This film makes me want to stick you in another wood chipper.
