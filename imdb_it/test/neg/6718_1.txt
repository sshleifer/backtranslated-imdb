Lord, have mercy! Why was this film made? Why did Seagal and the rising star Max Ryan agree to be there? The stranger is so atrociously bad in every way imaginable to rage. <br /> <br /> The film has an ultra-economical appearance. As a budget of a few dollars it was far from their reach. What's worse is that the producers know it and try to make it look polished to compensate. The result is a film that does not seem right. The fighting scenes are so boring and "discreetly" modified that they hide the fact that Steven Seagal is no longer fit. None of them is engaging or exciting. The plot is a nonsense that does not affect at all or that has uniqueness. The locations of Eastern Europe (a clever move by the producers to keep the budget low or non-existent) seem unpleasant and should not serve as a backdrop for an "action" film (what action?). <br /> <br /> And what is the agreement with the title? As far as I could tell, everyone in the film was foreigners. Which ONE does the title refer to? <br /> <br /> The DVD is in 1.85: 1 anamorphic widescreen and in the Dolby 5.1 sound. Nor are they worth mentioning even a single annuity. The foreigner is not worth a second of your time. I must love this tagline! "If they think they can stop it, they are completely wrong." Sheesh!
