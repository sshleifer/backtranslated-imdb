Leslie Nielsen is usually a person who likes movies (even critical films, like "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" and "Wrongfully Accused"). So the fact that I'm slamming "Mr. Magoo" should show it's a piece of junk. Throw Nielsen as the character of the short-sighted title, something is planted on him, and he makes a mess of everything. It seems that Nielsen's combo and director Stanley Tong (behind two Jackie Chan films) would make this film hilarious, but it isn't; they seem to have only people who do anything, and here there is no real humor. <br /> <br /> So the original cartoon with Jim Backus that provides the voice was worth seeing, so avoid this movie. Even Leslie Nielsen has done much better, so there's no reason to waste time on this. Also starring Kelly Lynch, Stephen Tobolowsky, Ernie Hudson, Malcolm McDowell and Miguel Ferrer; they probably don't want to point out this piece of junk in their career.
