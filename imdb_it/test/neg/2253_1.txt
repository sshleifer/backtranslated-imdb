Tarantino's previous films came from a boy in love with other films. This comes from a boy in love with his own writing. It's not inglorious, it's disgusting. <br /> <br /> I absolutely hated gloryless bastards. The whole point of a movie is to entertain - if you call bashing people's heads and remove their funny scalps !!!! - and if there is an unforgivable sin that a film can commit, it is boredom or extreme disgust. <br /> <br /> The film is just a collection of boundless and boring and disgusting scenes of people talking at tables in various languages. There is also a scene where 3 people talk for about 45 minutes at the same table, first, luckily they are all fired. I wish they would have been killed after 5 minutes. Even Woody Allen knows when to close the F ** K up. <br /> <br /> This style of table talk is a hallmark of Tarantino, but in other films, I really cared about what they were saying and the people talking. Here, I couldn't care less. All of Quentin's films show enormous confidence, especially Jackie Brown. But here there is a pervasive feeling in every scene, Tarantino had no idea where he was going with the film. <br /> <br /> Is he violent? Sure, there's plenty of torture and scalping, but you should remind me. Fortunately, the film was so subtle, I didn't even remember seeing it before on the day I saw a review on MSNBC. <br /> <br /> He is out of trouble and apparently dies from writing a novel. But do us a favor QT and spare us the movie. <br /> <br /> I came out of this movie halfway and I would never recommend anyone to see it, regardless of which passionate lover of the quarantine he or she is. <br /> <br /> I give him 0/10.
