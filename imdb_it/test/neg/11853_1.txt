This film was really terrible. <br /> <br /> However, it is worth seeing, as it is the most unnecessarily extended sex scene in the world ever. I mean, this thing went on for about 7 - 8 minutes (repeating the same "moves" over and over), that's almost 10% of the whole movie! I haven't laughed so much for so long. <br /> <br /> There were some seriously strange and useless things in this film, but what I found most amusing was when (for no reason whatsoever) a helicopter lands and 5 or 6 guys in orange overalls they run towards the complex near the end. 2 minutes later they run again. What the hell was it for ?? Furthermore, the tiny white forklift magically turned into a huge yellow digger was rather classic. I am convinced that this is due to the fact that they used the filming of the "carnosaurus" trilogy to mend this absolute ass. I have to see them now! <br /> <br /> The movie deserves to be watched for a laugh or two, but if you don't find any funny bad movies, stay away!
