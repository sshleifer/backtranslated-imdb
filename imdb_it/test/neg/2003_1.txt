It is rather rare that such a useless film arrives, that I with IMDb authorized the use of negative scores. In fact, I reflect on this film and I really can't think of a film that has had so little success. Acting: your right Kidding. Director: No. A plot: No. This film has nothing to do if you take it as a serious film, this is often the case with films of this genre, but most films of this nature can be seen as if were a comedy movie and you can laugh at how pathetic the characters and situations are and almost worth it. This film is so empty, that it is not even suitable for that purpose. I have to give this -1/10, three points less than any other film I've ever voted for. I really feel that the staff involved in this film should pay me the 83 minutes I spent watching it. I really don't have the words to describe how bad this is. No one should ever see him again for any reason.
