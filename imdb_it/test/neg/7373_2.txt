This is the only big problem with this film, along with many of the greatest québecois films: Made pretentiously by pretentious people. <br /> <br /> It is really sad, but the "big shots" (Dodge Stratus guide ...) from this province believes they understand the truth, they know what little people like. <br /> <br /> We are not a rich province, every time a great movie like this (30 million? !!?) is made, it is cutting many others who will not see their film made due to the lack of government help . Therefore it generates mediocrity; only "family friends" films will be made. <br /> <br /> I feel angry and I am. I went to see Nouvelle-France waiting for a trip in the life of my ancestors, but I found myself stuck in a series of inconsistencies: French accent (we must please our cousins, so f *** our québecois language) and lack of historical research is only in a few. Add a lively love story and the same music you play again and again and the stupid québecois viewer will open up and ask for more. I'm glad this pretentious piece of s *** didn't work as expected from the Dodge stratus Big Shots ... It will help film producers who are not in Québec's very sober "film business". > <br /> Rent Cruising Bar instead and really have fun. <br /> <br /> PS: I'll never forgive them for ruining such a beautiful title.
