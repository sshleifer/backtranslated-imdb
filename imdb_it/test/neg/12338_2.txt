Downhill Racer is essentially a movie to be seen only for the fantastic ski sequences. Although there is a story here, the character of Robert Redford, a skier who tries to make the US Olympic team, is so insipid and insipid that you wonder why you worry about him. Gene Hackman, in a first run, adds very well, but this is a film that could be watched with the sound turned off, and it wouldn't make much difference.
