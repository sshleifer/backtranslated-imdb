I thought this series would be another fun action series with dynamic plots and great performances. I was wrong. While I like Jamie Denton, this show absolutely does not deserve to be watched, unless you like watching some brutalized people and the actions of the allegedly justified agents under the theme of "national security". The show is a great propaganda for the current government, and spits chauvinism as if we were talking that way every day. After a couple of episodes, I was bored to death, and started watching House Invaders reruns on BBCAmerica. Rather, look at CSI and Without a Trace, no doubt.
