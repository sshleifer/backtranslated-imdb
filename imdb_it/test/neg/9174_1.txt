"First Snow" has an intriguing start. A peddler told his fortune to an old man whose predictions turn out to be surprisingly correct. From this point on the film looks like a bloated "Twilight Zone" episode. I do not mean anything other than car trips, phone calls and paranoia. William Fichtner does his usual interesting performance, but Guy Pierce is anything but a sympathetic character, neglecting the welfare of others for his own paranoia. The finish is particularly weak, with no gain for the long-suffering public. Do yourself a big favor and avoid this. Not recommended. - MERK
