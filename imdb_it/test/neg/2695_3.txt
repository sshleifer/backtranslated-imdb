Watching this movie and listening to the commentary, it is clear that Michael Radford does not understand this play. The first clue that fails to fully grasp the work is that he takes care of setting the film in seventeenth-century Venice. Which sounds really weird, yes, that misunderstanding the movie would mean trying to make it as accurate as possible in its position. But anyone who has studied Shakespeare knows that while he has set most of his works in exotic venues, culture and values ​​are always contemporary England. This doesn't hurt the movie, but shows a lack of necessary knowledge. <br /> <br /> Where Radford kills the movie is making it all so serious. He succeeds in sucking every line from the script, leaving the entire production flat. Every gram of passion is defeated by the characters. Even Shylock's 'Do we not bleed' speech is a mild and embarrassing murmur from a choleric that seems to only say and do what it does because it should. Lovers are solemn and too moderate (Joseph Fiennes delivers some of the most romantic lines of cinema this year with a barely audible whisper), Gratiano (who must promise to behave in one place) is more sober and collected than Bassiano (which makes her promise to behave), Jessica is reluctant to leave her father and spends her life with Lorenzo pouting. <br /> <br /> In the commentary for the scene of the insipid and watered down court, the director expresses his shock an audience laughed at Portia "A pound of flesh, neither more nor less"; finally concluding that he had to laugh. 'The Merchant of Venice' is a comedy and Radford mocks the idea that the most absurd and hysterical parts of history are anything but the most provocative drama. <br /> <br /> The film does not have an intelligible focus, yet it cuts some of the funniest scenes. The characters are forced into a dramatic veil, so they come out as characters from Ibsen who read Victorian poems. And the end of the play, where all the good guys go to bed happy, drowned in a dignified despair that seems to find the rigid peace of the upper lip with imminent death, rather than reconcile with the lovers. Even Lancelot and Antonio come out of the movie holding their hats like pained aristocrats. <br /> <br /> The film is badly made because the creative powers do not include the script. He is strict where he should be hysterical. It is reserved where it should be passionate. It's Michael Radford where William Shakespeare should be.
