this film is rather bad, aggressive, not well interpreted, not well directed, it seems low budget, low quality, emotionally weak and disconnected. after seeing the previous comments, he went to see it, but if you try to compare it to the apocalypse now, PLATOON, or any other, you're really off the track. this movie looks like an old 60s movie with a cast of grown Neanderthals, let alone (or actually they do), not paying attention to details like shifts, low budget fireworks and all types of poorly filmed features. it's still watchable, if you'd like to see it as a first development of the film document .. don't go back !! <br /> <br /> p - after all, the boys are doing just fine.
