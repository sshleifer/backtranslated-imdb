At the beginning the film seemed to be going great, they had the profiles of the characters set ... the plot seemed to go in the right direction ... however, as the film progressed, it seemed that the director focused on the wrong things. ..or a lot has been modified by the film. The identities of the characters have changed for the worse within the film. Also, there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning - in other words - they had things in the film that didn't seem to fit the film itself. And the title ... no where in the film the title fits the film ... I suppose the title works for the previews .... The actors did well with what they had ..... if they had a director best and writer, maybe this would have worked better. But it was not so. So now there is a terrible new movie coming out this Friday .... My opinion! .... don't waste time and money.
