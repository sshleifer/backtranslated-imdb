This film follows a storyboard very similar to The Warriors, only with less intensity and a rather mediocre acting that is nothing to write about. <br /> <br /> The story in general is not so bad, based on a small Australian band trying to get out of the city when one of their members is framed for rape of another gang girl. They then have to make their way through the streets while being hunted by a number of rival gangs. I could assume that the authors took a page from the book of The Warriors and rewrote it, but as mentioned above - with an intensity not nearly equal. <br /> <br /> Acting as a whole is not very good in my opinion, and it is clearly obvious on many occasions that they are really acting ... the fight scenes compensate for this though, but then the bad sound effects that accompany it back down. <br /> <br /> This movie has nothing on Once Were Warriors. <br /> <br /> Low budget, good story, bad acting, nothing to tell.
