If it wasn't for the hilarious role of Christopher Guest, I would have stopped watching this movie after 20 minutes. The jokes were flat, the film choppy and slow, some characters were nasty and painful to watch, but the character of Guest made me laugh, so I stuck with it. <br /> <br /> I feel that there are better choices there!
