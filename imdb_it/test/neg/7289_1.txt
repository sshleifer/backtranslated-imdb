This film was horrible and does not even deserve to be called a film. The way I look at it, it's more like three mediocre episodes of Disney daytime comics tied together to make a single video that pretends to be the sequel to the first Atlantis movie, which was much more well done and fun. And where do I start talking about the problems with this DVD? History? Characters? The images / animation? For me they are all bad and unwatchable. First of all, the plot of this video DVD is ridiculous and pointless. The only positive thing is that it is consistent - that is, constantly bad, from beginning to end. After the film is finished, I still don't know why Milo is back and how the accidents occur in the three little stories are connected to each other or to the Atlantis itself. And all I could remember about this movie was how it made me feel sick after seeing it. The characters feel wooden and lack personality, and the drawings seem very different from those of the first. You can say that obviously they do not come from the hands of the same animators of the first. While the DVD was being played, I found myself less and less attentive to what could happen to the characters and I only hoped that the film would end soon. In addition to the story and the characters mentioned above, even in this case the image quality is poor, probably one of the worst in those direct-to-video products that Disney has ever published. As a fan of the original Atlantis: the lost empire, I could not be more disappointed with Milo's return, which is a total waste of time and money. Thank goodness I rented it before instead of buying it. Even so, I still wish I had never seen this shit or even known its existence.
