It's definitely not a good movie, but it's not as bad anywhere as some paint it. Nightmare in Wax tells the story of a man who had a disfigured face in a typical flashback scene, spreading his revenge on those directly responsible and indirectly for the loss of his life - in particular the love and company of a beautiful young actress. Cameron Mitchell interprets the artist with his typical style, although with a limited touch. In fact, I thought he had given one of his best interpretations. What does it mean exactly? Mitchell wears an eye patch, smokes cigarettes incessantly, wears a multicolored tunic and talks with his wax creations. They are not your common wax mannequins, but rather the people still alive controlled by a serum that makes them lose control of all neurological functions. They become zombies indeed. I thought the premise was inventive if nothing else. It has some ridiculous explanation, but we need the plot. This is a movie from the 60s to be sure with some psychedelic cameras by Bud Townsend and the company. The acting is mediocre but Mitchell, Scott Brady and Barry Kroeger give interesting turns. The wax figures of the past Hollywood era were made very effectively and most of the location shootings were very credible. The end of the film dissolves into something not really real - or another example of the cultural cinema of the 1960s or the end of the screenwriter's creativity. I'm relying on it. Despite its many flaws, I liked the film. The opening scene showing that an actor was attacked was actually done as was a police pursuit on the waterfront.
