From the acting, direction, screenplay and art direction this film is just completely ill-conceived and the money would have been better spent on shoes for landmine victims. When we became so sad that we had to fill a movie for children with sexual insinuations to attract the attention of parents. <br /> <br /> Dr Suess is rolling into his grave right now, what with the "dirty ho"? "and fake erection scenes, etc. etc. It is shameful how they name Suess to convince their parents to bring their children, to swear to tempt teenagers and some sad parents who won't watch a movie with their child if there is no T & A. Greed for greed and more greed. <br /> <br /> Compare it with classic children's films and we can get a disturbing view of the world that is becoming. These guys should just do video on MTV: why this movie got> 400 votes as a perfect 10 is beyond me (unless it's the directors' family)
