I don't know about you, but I go to the horror movies to be scared and this is anything but scary, the film has had several possibilities to be really scary and has failed miserably EVERY TIME! Many of these alleged moments of suspense have been persecuted by some of the worst cg that you will see this year, perhaps a decade! I mean when I say that the CG looks like daytime TV, I'm giving the daytime TV a bad name, I've seen better things on the science fiction channel. Who I really am sorry for the actors, (who have their names linked to this film) did a good job, I cared about most of the characters and felt that their performances were pretty good, but it wasn't enough to bring this movie out of time. What is really fun is the reuse of some sets, if you've seen "exorcist: the beginning" it will be easy to identify the reuse of some of the buildings. However what I thought was the worst thing about this movie, even over the cg problems was the main demon, it wasn't scary in any case, its shape, the way it spoke, was extremely insipid. all in all this film was a horrible experience and I would have left the theater had it not been for my wife who wanted to see the end.
