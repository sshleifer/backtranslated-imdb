It's a totally normal film with some semi-alright action sequences that make the plot look a little better and remind the viewer of classic Van Dam films. Parts of the plot make no sense and seem to be added to consume time. the final plot is that of a very basic type that does not let the observer guess and any twist is obvious from the beginning. the final scene with the backs of the flask doesn't make sense since they are added and seem to have little relevance to the story of the Van Dam character. it's not really worth looking at again, a little disappointed in the final production, even if it's obvious which was shot on a low budget, certain shots and sections of the film are of poor direct quality
