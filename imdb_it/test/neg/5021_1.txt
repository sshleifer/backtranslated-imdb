"Inuyasha" was horrible. This show was incredibly over-hype but this is nothing but a boring bunch of anime clich√©s. The characters are boring and lifeless, the plot is boring and endless. I think it could be something interesting if it has a better writing, but it seems that the authors of the show have more intentions in the Inuyasha show and its stupid friends fighting with some monsters and then crying for its tragic love triangle with Kikyou and Kagome and many circles around the same thing again and again. The script is poor and stupid and the animation is poor. The character is very ugly, I don't know why everyone loves him, everyone has the same face! : Big eyes, small noses, a line like the mouth and the typical anime haircut. I find "Inuyasha" incredibly boring and stupid. This must be one of the most exaggerated animated shows ever made.
