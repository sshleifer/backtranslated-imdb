1) If you want to make a film that deals with social realism it is quite important that the public identifies with the characters that are portrayed. 2) The public cannot identify with highly stereotyped or obvious situations. 3) If you have a bad actor, you can't build any characters. However, even if you have good actors, their work will be ridiculous if you force them to speak with a fictitious Andalusian accent. <br /> <br /> Jes√∫s Ponce ignores those 3 points and also makes cheap jokes that are completely out of style place. His script is so predictable: a woman gets out of prison, meets her old boyfriend, a hard life, etc. Whatever, the fact that the story is anything but original would not be so bad if only Ponce was not a complete incompetent Writing and resumed. <br /> <br /> I wonder how long they will continue to give money from our taxes to make films like this. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 3/10
