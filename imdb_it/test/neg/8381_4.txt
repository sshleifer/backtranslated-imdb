Cult begins 20 years ago on the "Quinling Mountain Range, Southern China" while a boy named Owen Quinlin (Robert Berson) finds an ancient amulet said to have magical powers, cut in California where Quinlin created a cult and the members talk about sacrificing themselves when one of them (Cazzy Golomb) foils his evil plan ... Go ahead as far as five college students, Mindy (Rachel Miner), Cassandra (Taryn Manning), Bailey (Glenn Dunk), Alex (Joel Michaely) and Morgan (Victoria Venegas) are doing research on the events of twenty years ago that have become known as the "Quinling massacre" for a school project. Unfortunately, Morgan decides to kill himself, unleashing the evil spirit of Owen Quinlin for reasons that are rather tenuous, he is preparing to complete what he started many years ago claiming souls so that he could finally inherit the magic powers of the amulet for his same evil uses ... <br /> <br /> Edited, co-produced and directed by Joe Knee, this is not a good movie and this is kind to it. The screenplay by Benjamin Oren that seems to take itself very seriously is a severe supernatural story about a cult leader who returns from the dead to finish what he started a few years earlier, as one would expect the characters involved to now have links to that which happened all those years ago and is as boring as it seems. The characters are bland and forgettable, the dialogues are so much, there is no real horror or exploitation, sometimes it's slow, it's predictable, it's clich√©, it ends completely off the rails at the end and doesn't make much sense when you think about it. The story does not grab or involve you, it is never exciting or particularly interesting and I would struggle to call it even in the media. There is very little I could recommend Cult, don't worry about it. <br /> <br /> Director Knee is all right, but the film has a bland shot-on-video made for TV is completely forgettable and flat stuff everywhere. There is no fear, no atmosphere and lack of tension. No blood, of course there is a fair amount of splatter blood but no real special effect make-up artist scenes. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of around $ 950,000 Cult it looks cheap even if it is not as badly done as some low budget horror films I have seen recently. Acting is not even worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> Cult is a poor film that did nothing for me, I would struggle to define this media. There are much better horror movies out there.
