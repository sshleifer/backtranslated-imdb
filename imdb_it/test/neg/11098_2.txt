OK, I admit that I still associate Sophie Marceau with La Boum. This was the main reason I went to see this movie. But it was so boring that I almost felt asleep. Sorry, but your talents as an actress are not very convincing. Furthermore, this film was presented with special effects and exceptional CGIs. Yes, it's not so bad for a B-Movie. After seeing her in "Marquise" some years ago (even a very lousy movie), I thought she would sound more convincing. But La Boum (and could be the James Bond "the world is not enough") seems to be the only good movie with her. Is it his "talent", does he have a bad taste when he chooses his films or simply bad luck?
