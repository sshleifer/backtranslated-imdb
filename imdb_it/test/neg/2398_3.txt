The 3 stars are for Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Nothing else and no one else in this film deserves even a tiny image of a star. Well, OK, Amy Adams deserves a little smidgen, but the smidgenometer doesn't seem to work, so I'll keep it with 3. Tom Hanks ... nothing. Julia Roberts ... nothing. Mike Nichols ... do you still see a trend? Aaron Sorkin ... OMG, not a possibility. <br /> <br /> I could complain about several paragraphs about the way Charlie Wilson's war flies over history, morality, legitimacy and so on, but I don't think that such a ruckus can prevail over the fanfare by Aaron Sorkin. For the rest of you, be careful. Push your films elsewhere. <br /> <br /> However, if you are looking for a sensible comment, here is mine. You can put the hot fudge sauce on a pile of garbage, but it doesn't change anything. Garbage is rubbish and so is Charlie Wilson's war.
