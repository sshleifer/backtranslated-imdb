Where do I start with Killing Mind before mentioning it? This film is about a young woman in the FBI's psychological profile, or something, who for some reason goes to work for the LAPD for a while. There are some recognizable faces, like the boy from "I love you, man" by Wayne's World, who plays a policeman (also with a beard!) And two guys who always seem to play cops playing ..... you guessed it, cops. One of them was one of the Gross Point Blank cops after John Cusack on the spot, and the other is the FBI guy with the specifications in Final Destination, who is also in the Fugitive as another cop. I know the FBI, the US Marshalls, the CIA, etc. They are not policemen, but they are all the same. They enforce the law to a certain extent, which makes them cops in my book. Feel free to disagree with the definition of a policeman whatever you want, they are still seen as those who are trying to bring down the bad guys. Any, I digress. The woman is working alongside these policemen who seem to sit in a library in the basement or something, and for some unknown reason she decides to reopen a case that was not seen for yonks. He saw the corpse as a child, so he naturally decided to reopen the case because he was personally attached to it! I also like how the person who profiled the psychological state of other people witnessed a child murder scene. Surely it is the kind of thing that can rip someone's head ?! He starts asking questions to some journalist who told the story when it was open, even though he seems to be the same age as the woman, so presumably he was writing for a newspaper when he was 10, or he wrote some school reports about it, and she decided that she would be the best person to ask him. <br /> <br /> Then we see that, in addition to reopening cases of murder from 25 years before, he engages with the small theft while some a really inconspicuous type sprints through a busy road with a balaclava. Way to mix, moron! However, she and the ice-cream cops in the park are chasing him, and as he crosses a bridge with a woman and a child on it, the thief grabs the child from his mother's arms and launches the child into the river. This, if you haven't already guessed it, is the best part of the film. I'm not a sadist, and I don't hate children or anything, but the scene seems so stupid that I promise you will get your pants wet laughing at this if you were to watch this movie. It improves when the Final Destination policeman and the Fugitive jumps to save the child and declares to his friend "He is a child!" How could he not know that before he jumped in, he's beyond me. <br /> <br /> However, he chases the thief but loses it. Later he remembers that a dog at random did not bark at the thief, so he thought it should be his and decided to track the thief through the dog. The dog had no markings or anything on it, so how he knew where to find the dog, and therefore finding the thief is another question I won't get into. it was soon after that I stopped watching. The story was moving very slowly, and after I stopped laughing at the baby's launch, I lost interest and lost what was said. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I go ahead and assume the killer was the journalist, because he seemed a little elusive, and he spent a lot of time with him, and anyone who looks at Columbo knows that the person outside the police who passes most of the time with the investigator is your villain. Also, other people's reviews say the killer was pretty obvious, so I'm sure it was him. <br /> <br /> So, all in all, a movie of pants, but it's worth looking only for that glorious scene.
