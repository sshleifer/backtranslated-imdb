This is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. What a weak waste in the obvious talent of Michael Imperioli. Disgusting movie from start to finish. All I can say is that this director is not an "author". You never entered the game, the character's head, the incredible talent with numbers that the real Stuey had. The coca scene is bad enough to throw the shoe on the set, it could have been a fantastic scene if it had been filmed and not on stage, with the camera halfway hovering over a mirror with drugs on it while the the drama is going far in the background. The scene in which the great championship wins is just laughing in a ridiculous loud voice. This should be shown in Film making 101 - What Not To Do In Making Pictures.
