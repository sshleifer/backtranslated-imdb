Not only did I read the book and watch the movie, but I was stationed on the USS John F Kennedy when they shot this film. Needless to say, film crews and actors can prove the people trying to do their job. Now, about the movie. As a career sailor, I was rather troubled by how they showed life aboard an aircraft carrier. I could distinguish the inaccuracies of the film (anyone who lived on a courier could), but that would require pages. One scene that stood out in particular was when they were in the CIC (Combat Information Center) and were watching a RADAR contact move across the screen. Each time the contact moves, an acoustic signal is emitted. Unfortunately, that equipment doesn't make a similar sound (I was a technician on that equipment). The book was based on the fact, the film was not. The following of the TV series was just as bad and the Marina finally realized that the support for this series would only make them bad. If you are a Navy person, look at this to see how a film about the life of the wearer is seen by the eyes of Hollywood. If you are not a Navy person, look at Midway or Top Gun, at least those movies are fun and fact based.
