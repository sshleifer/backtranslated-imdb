This film was the worst movie I've ever seen. No story, no point, not even fun at all, I'm not sure why people say this movie is hilarious because it sucks so much !! Felix Bean the main character sucked. Susanna sucked. This film was made in 1996 and was set in the 1980s. What else, I will never leave my friend again to choose movies. Hmm, the cover of the film said it came from super-troop producers, who kidnapped them and stole their identities. Wow, what a waste of time. The only thing that was fun was Freaky Ricky, it was fun, especially when he and Emily ended up together. This was good. All in all, it sucked, waste of time and sleep. Wow, I never thought a movie like this could be made, so stupid to watch for watching it until the end.
