Chaplin was a great silent comedian, but many stars of the silent era fell when the audience heard their voices in the first talkies. In my opinion, Chaplin's voice simply didn't fit his silent characters that made him rich and famous. His career never recovered when the sound came to the cinema. Contrary to most of the reviews I read, Chaplin's lifestyle and politics did not help his popularity with the average spectator who expected to be entertained by Chaplin the comedian, and not to spend their fun watching the Chaplin's political comments. <br /> <br /> Despite the prizes and the knighthood of Chaplin, I would make an exception to his "contributions" to humanity. The Great Dictator was created at the same time that Stalin's brutal dictatorship was having its show shows, and both dictators signed the agreement that led to the invasion of Poland by both dictators. World War II began in an attempt to save Poland. The Nazis were defeated in 6 years, but Poland disappeared as a sovereign country. This happened during the time this film was made and the Hollywood government investigated by Hollywood. If Chaplin had included Joe Stalin in this satire, in addition to including the Italian dictator, perhaps he would have had less criticism of his politics by politicians. The abuse by the Soviets of Jews and dissidents exceeded the time and number of Nazis. <br /> <br /> Judged simply as a movie, many of the gags were too current to be understood by younger viewers, who didn't know who Goebbels was, Goring or Mussolini were. A classic piece of art must stand the test of time. The classical Greek tragedy, the ninth and the ninth of Beethoven are still appreciated centuries after their creation because they are timeless. Films that rely on topical political comments or currently popular social opinions usually do not survive the generation in which they are made. But those who face problems common to all generations will probably live forever and will receive a high vote on my part. <br /> <br /> Chaplin, as a writer, director and leading actor, has to take the blame for what I consider a dated and boring film. <br /> <br /> Chaplin's apologists apologized for his decision to leave the country that made him rich and famous. If Chaplin found the United States so offensive, why didn't he return to his homeland. The great English fought the Nazi with blood and money. What has Switzerland contributed to the fight against European dictators? Switzerland is like a country club that chooses and chooses its members based on race and class, and cares little about people who cannot join the club.
