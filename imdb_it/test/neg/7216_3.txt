The original Road House is by no means an award winning film. But it's one of the great guilty pleasures of all time. It should not have been so difficult to make a sequel. There is no need for a big budget, big names and spectacular visual effects. Even the story didn't have to be original. All he needed was good fun, and some great fist fights. I don't mean "thread-fu" in the Matrix style, just some well-chore bar fights. Many of them. There are a couple of decent fights in the movie, but none of them is memorable, and the focus is more on the gun game. Moreover, the way it connects to the original film is ridiculous, to the insulting limit. Johnathon Schaech plays Shane Tanner, an undercover DEA agent who is good with his hands and feet. But here's the kicker ... he's the son of Patrick Swayze's character Dalton !!!! What????? Let's see, the original Road House was created in 1989. So for Dalton to have a child in his last 20 years (maybe even 30) in 2006 ... well, you understand. They give him a rough explanation that he lived with his uncle Nate (Will Patton) while his father "traveled a lot". Oh please. That itself almost justified the closure of this film. But I digress. Schaech is completely out of his element. Of course he can throw a couple of kicks, but he has nothing to do as an actor. Moreover, in the film he is defined by the bad guys as "handsome boy". I've never scrutinized men up close, but I don't think this guy is too good. He looks sick. His face is too thin, and his sunken eyes make it look like it will fade at any moment. I had never heard of him before, but I think he should give up acting and go back to his day job. Jake Busey plays the famous drug corrupter Wild Bill. Busey is not a terrible actor. He was good at Starship Troopers, and had even made a bad enemy in Hitcher 2. But here, he just chews the landscape in bad standard mode. Even his "threatening" dialogue is a worthy yawn. We should buy it like the man who has the whole city in his pocket. But why? What does he do? Why do you want to buy a bar from Patton "by any means necessary"? Ellen Hollman has the role of symbolic girlfriend. A woman with a secret. Too bad the secret is difficult to understand as 2 + 2. She is the local elementary school teacher who seems to be a former army soldier. Guess what it means? It means that while she could tremble with fear for most of the film, she will be ready to destroy the heads when the fur begins to fly. Oh well, at least she's sexy. Actually the fight between her and Wild Bill's girlfriend is the best in the film. It's fast, brutal and fun. Which brings me to my next problem with the movie ... the fights. As I said Schaech knows how to throw a punch. The same cannot be said for anyone in the film. Obviously, the film will come to Schaech against Busey. Busey is an actor, not a fighter. He doesn't have the skills to pull out of a movie. Swayze may have been a trained dancer, but his athletic ability gave him the means to bring out well choreographed fights. He also faced a couple of worthy opponents and had a killer move (literally). None of this here. With a couple of exceptions, the fights are forced, poorly set up and routine. Fists sound like someone slaps a 2X4 on concrete, and there are even a couple of parts where the sound doesn't even match the punch. It's embarrassing. There is not even good southern / redneck music of the original. Road House had the Jeff Healy Band, which at the time was a pretty popular band. This film features a singer named John Otto, whose music is lukewarm, and his acting is even worse. He gave a line in the film, which was probably inserted to placate any fan he might have out there. Or that, or someone owed him a favor. My last complaint about the film is the one that comes out of being picky ... continuity. The films are shot out of sequence, so it is up to the editor to put everything together. Well, someone should give the editor of this movie a little push. The problems range from small things like people who don't look the same way when a shot changes, to the RE-USED movie at the end of the movie. At the beginning, we are introduced to the bar, The Black Pellican. As the camera moves across the bar, you see the band, the bouncers and the people dancing. At the end of the film, when the villains were defeated, we get another shot of the same bar, with our hero's inserts sitting at the bar with his girlfriend. The problem is that the footage of the people in the bar is the SAME movie from the beginning of the movie !!! I'm not kidding. They are the same people, standing (or dancing) in the same places, wearing the same clothes. Want to know the fun part? See the bouncers in the shot who were KILLED at the beginning of the film. Do yourself a favor, don't watch this movie if you don't feel the need to go out and punch someone. This movie will make you angry enough to do it.
