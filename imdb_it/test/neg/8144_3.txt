For an indy movie this is probably a little better than a 3 out of 10, but in general it only gets a 3. The effects are not horrible and at least they have some adults who play adult roles rather than all children like a lot of indy low budget low budget movies. The acting is very wooden, but at least they had a better "display" than some films in the cheaper economic category. It's shot a lot inside a building rather than in a friend's basement. The plot as a whole is not the worst. He is a Resident Evil who cares about an evil society that invades a small town and an epidemic brings people into zombies. I would have liked to have seen some sort of creatures rather than the big bad one just being another "super" zombie. I try not to write spoilers but this review has one so be warned !! NOTICE SPOILER !!! Not only do some cast members seem to just shake off zombies (they are recycled over and over again, but at least they have more than 5 people playing them). But one of the twists really doesn't fly with me. The deputy who enters turns out to be on the payroll of evil corporations. He kills one of the other employees in cold blood and then meets the evil leader in an office that talks about cleaning up the mess. The deputy has just shown us that he too is a really bad person and talks as if he were able to clean it up (which means killing all the surviving witnesses), no problem. But then 2 seconds later, he's helping them. There was no real emotion of the "change of heart" or something that made me feel that that bad boy had gone from killing an innocent a few minutes ago and then said that he didn't bring anyone to be a savior. There was no accident or anything to buy me in this. It is worth looking at if you are a fan of low budget films, otherwise you will not like it.
