This film is ... horrible and wonderful at the same time. I saw it for the first time when I was about 13 or 14, so it has great nostalgic value for me. In this film, Cesar Romero actually plays the character of Octavio, the man who "discovered" Santana. There are also two other actors, Monte Markham (playing Sam, who is trying to save his daughter) and Peter Mark Richman (playing the priest), who have great filmographies, and these are the only performances that go well. The rest of the acting and the film itself have all the qualities of the movie B that some of us adore. <br /> <br /> I recently spent 2 years trying to get a copy of this film, and it's almost non-existent. I assume it was interrupted shortly after its release. But in the end I found a copy and paid a nice penny to buy it. If you happen to meet Judgment Day in a video store (unmistakable with a green cheese satan on the cover), count among the blessed who live near one of the few video stores that still has a working copy. A must see for those of you who like to laugh at cheese attempts in a scary movie.
