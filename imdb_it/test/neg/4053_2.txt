In the only common sense act they have ever done, the NSW Film & Television Office refused to finance this film. The producers have raised a great stench and in a blaze of publicity have taken their production to Victoria. Apart from the work lost for the technicians, NSW was fortunate not to have been involved ... <br /> <br /> The film fails at virtually every level. Post modernism fails, casting fails (what is Rose Byrne's character in general?) That a 1-dimensional grumbler made Hugo Weaving's channel? What the hell is Pia Miranda's character doing? And the plot is a clich√© of contradictions. In reality, the story flows like a dragged prelude rather than a complete plot. <br /> <br /> He could have had a chance if the "pop culture meets depression" style was better thought and executed. If the casting was weirder, if the style was less serious ... if everything was different. <br /> <br /> In addition to the usual excellence in costume, design and cinematography (like most Australian films), the film is just a total mistake. <br /> <br /> With a budget of over 7 million dollars, "The Tender Hook" is a symptom of the Australian film industry's malaise: the wrong people and the wrong projects are financed. Compare this mess with "Noise" (less than $ 2 million) or "Cedar" (less than $ 1 million) and get the idea. Hard and interesting films are struggling for funding and flaccid and exaggerated projects with cast names are coming to dollars. <br /> <br /> The lenders who have invested in this deserve to go the same way as the character of Hugo Weaving at the end of the film.
