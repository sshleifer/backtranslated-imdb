* The ELITE sniper team who entered 24 hours before, instead of digging and making them invisible, decided to take cover behind a big stone in one of the first scenes. * When the hero "runs" to save his wife, he is actually jogging. * When inside a building and aiming for a target only 20-30 meters away, the hero USES ITS SCOPE. In addition to the fact that most of the non-elite soldiers would make that shot from the side and still be hit, there is also the fact that the range would probably not be able to concentrate so closely. * There is a satellite that can actually look horizontally in buildings. <br /> <br /> The list is endless ... and the movie is the biggest pile of shit I've ever put in my DVD player.
