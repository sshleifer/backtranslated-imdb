I really love Lucy ... comic genius yes ..... MAME ... NEVER ... she was ridiculous like Mame ... like the film adaptation of the Divine Secrets of the sisterhood Ya Ya. Both have completely missed the point. Roslind Russell was, is and always will be the first and only Mame. Perhaps as a young star, Ball could have gotten a role like this, where his beauty and youth could take her with him ... but this seemed like a desperate attempt by an old star to prove he was still able to live in the field. The reason that there are many other Russell version supporters (apart from the fact that you can't improve the original) is that Russell has the presence, absorbs every scene, while Lucille Ball could also be a motif in the background of Mame for all the attention she commands in the role.
