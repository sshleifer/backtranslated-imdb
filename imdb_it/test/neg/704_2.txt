I never want to see this movie again! <br /> <br /> Not only is it terribly ugly, but I can't stand to see my hero Stan Laurel look so old and sick. <br /> <br /> Mainly I can't stand to watch this terrible movie! <br /> <br /> Frankly, there's no reason to watch this horrible movie. The plot is simply stupid. The actors surrounding Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are really bad and Laurel and Hardy have been more fun in one of their previous films! <br /> <br /> I warn you that you will not look at it, the images will haunt you for a long time to come!
