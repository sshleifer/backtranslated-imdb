Kevin Spacey is my favorite actor of all time, he is no doubt also on the lists of others when it comes to great actors. He also brought out a good Irish accent also in Ordinary Decent Criminal. But Kevin Spacey, as leader of the mafia? Or even a thief? I'm not so sure it could go that far. The film made no sense to me and the part of the story did not seem to me solved. <br /> <br /> I know once again that IMDb will write me ten more lines. But I'm not so sure what I could say about this movie because I'm still trying to figure it out. Silly, isn't it? But I'm pretty sure that more than you IMDb users have been in the same situation as I am right now when you only want to say a line or two about a movie, but now you have to do ten lines? Wow, he should do it. : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
