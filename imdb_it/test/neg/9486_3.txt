This film was fine. Mary-Kate and Ashley play two twin sisters (sorry for having said the obvious) that against their will they are sent to Paris to spend the week with their rich uncle or something. <br /> <br /> Two Frenchmen immediately (which seemed a bit unnatural) started talking to them and becoming interested. Blah blah blah. It's a twin movie by Olsen - we already know what will happen between them. However, along with this, the twins meet a FABULOUS French model because they are in Paris, the fashion capital of the world. They make bffs with the model and spend a fun shopping montage in the city of lights. Yes. <br /> <br /> Plotwise, I honestly can't remember what happened. I guess he could say something, but hey, it's an Olsen movie. "Olsen's film" seems to be synonymous with "light entertainment". <br /> <br /> Overall, this film was annoying. I mean, can I really identify with two girls who are devastated to hear they're going to Paris? Really? Besides, the jokes weren't all that funny. However, I watched the whole movie. So it had to be a little fun. The fact that it was set in Paris was probably the one that kept an eye on me.
