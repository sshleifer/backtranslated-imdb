Writer / director Brian Burns has obviously seen some romantic comedies, and seems to think he has discovered the formula for success: a lot of location photos in New York (preferably in winter), allusions to old Hollywood movies (especially musicals), fun musical soundtrack. Alas, all this is a simple reward for Burns' lack of talent as a writer. (The great mystery of many screenwriters and directors who make independent films is not why they can't get on with the main studies, but how they get any support for their films.) Normally our interest in romantic comedy is motivated from the main characters, but the couple in this film simply has no appeal. This is neither the fault of David Krumholtz nor of Milla Jovavich; their characters are just badly written. What we answer in classics like When Harry Met Sally or Annie Hall or older films like His Girl Friday are oddities and flaws in the characters' personalities. Lacking the ability to create individuals, Burns offers us an after-school special inspired by Men Are From Mars, Women are from Venus. <br /> <br /> As anyone can see Burns as Woody Allen's successor is beyond me. I didn't laugh once during this movie, and the script is full of echo chamber dialogs ("I want to paint the red city." "Do you want to paint the red city?"), Which is the most revealing sign of someone who does not has business writing to live. In one of the first scenes, we see the girlfriend of the Krumholz actress filming a senseless television sitcom. It is the only moment in the whole film that dialogue seems right; perhaps this indicates what the talents of Burns are really suitable for.
