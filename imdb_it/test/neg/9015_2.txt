Another winner of the era of the 50s and 60s that I adore so much for the comic value they give with every vision these days. Those who never leave you with these films, take themselves seriously and have a very low budget, a recipe to look good for sure. Ed Nelson, a very competent actor, started with Corman and many other favorites who introduce themselves to Superman and many of the westerns of the day. The costume is pretty ugly and the sound of the alien talking, well the reverb was a little off but that's the beauty. Film making for the love of it, not seeking perfection just by digging the action of doing it, comes through. These films are a fun time! Even better is the MST3K version !!
