Unstoppable as one of those noisy action movies. The whole cast seems to be about speed. I really didn't understand the director's intentions, if there were any. I wonder if he ever saw a Stanley Donen, Vincent Minnelli or even a George Sidney musical. Structure, please! This is a big mess and I loved Abba. The costumes are the unflattering photography - unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations) The only thing that makes everything bearable is the sight of Meryl Streep who makes fun of herself. No chemistry with her friends (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) thinks of Streep with Lily Tomlyn in Altman's film and you will understand what I was hoping for. I was especially embarrassed by Pierce Brosnam and Colin Firth. The audience, however, seemed to be enjoying themselves, so it's probably just me.
