Being too young to have experienced Hammer films when they were new and new, I am discovering their sacred horror films as I find them on DVD. I know it was almost a decade and a half between them but it's hard to see much of the magic in the original Hammer Dracula in this late entry into the Christopher Lee series. The original story of the Hammer vampires had a lot of atmosphere and a terrifying story to get involved. Lee was a great Dracula, a vibrant vampire, if possible, in the first release but here is nothing but a cardboard character that mostly wanders and looks threatening. The modest young people talk like cartoon characters (although my aunt lived in England in the 1970s and says that people really spoke with those terrible clich√©s). I had no interest in who lived or died in the younger crowd. They were all rather terrible characters anyway. I enjoyed seeing a young and charismatic Caroline Munro; but leave the story too soon. Lee and his historic nemesis Peter Cushing add an air of authenticity to the film, but fail to draw blood from this empty film. It is D.O.A.
