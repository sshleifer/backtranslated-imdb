I saw this Hallmark television movie when it was originally broadcast. I lost interest in the story because it was said that a character was a witch. I wasn't in the right frame of mind to watch this movie. But Hallmark represents the best quality films. Now, there is a reason to give this film a second look. Clive Owen who plays "Damon Wildeve" could have the chance to be selected as the next James Bond 007 when Pierce Brosnan passes it. Clive Owen may have to wait until the year 2008. The other reason is that the female protagonist is Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is now a celebrity (at the time unknown) and who in 2003 became Oscar winner for best actress protagonist. Joan Well as "Mrs. Yeobright" is also in this film. I like the opening line of this film: "Deliver me from my scary, lonely place, send me a great love somewhere else I'll die, I'll really die."
