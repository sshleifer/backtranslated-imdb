The United States built the atomic bomb to show its military superiority and to end the Second World War. The movie Fat Man and Little Boy is a portrait of the efforts of American physicists to invent the technology necessary to create the bomb, and the tension that existed between scientists and the army regarding the potential uses of the bomb, and even the acceptability of its creation. Scientists thought the bomb should have been created as a deterrent, a mechanism that would stop the war wasting as little life as possible. Fist, they saw themselves as in a race with German scientists, who were trying to build nuclear weapons by themselves. When the Germans were defeated, many scientists hoped to stop working on the bomb project, since they knew that the Japanese didn't have the technology needed to build a nuclear weapon, and therefore didn't pose a threat to massive loss of life. Those who favored the continuation of the Manhattan Project hoped that the bomb would be used as a demonstration, inviting the Japanese head of state to see its deployment on a small desert island. The massive demonstration of strength, they thought, would have been enough to win the war: it would not have been necessary to kill. The American army, under the direction of General Leslie Groves, always hoped to use the bomb as a real weapon to be deployed against the enemy, first against the Germans and then against the Japanese. Due to the persistence of Japanese soldiers on small Japanese islands, the United States decided to drop the bomb on populous cities to end the war, first Hiroshima and then Nagasaki. The exhibition of that vast amount of force also notified the rest of the world that the United States was the dominant military power, a message addressed especially to Russia, whose growing military power and economic weight in Eurasia threatened our pre-eminent world position. Fat Man and Little Boy was a film that had good intentions in mind, but rather embarrassed them with the choice of actors, script and film. One of the main points of the film was the struggle between the military vision of science for killing and the scientific vision of science for knowledge. The keystone of this conflict is the continuing disagreement between General Groves and Dr. Oppenheimer. Mr. Newman does his job in the role of the general, creaking, hugely angry and radiates his dependence on the success of the project. Dwight Schultz, on the other hand, never puts up much resistance to the demands of the General, always with a rather weak, deflated and phlegmatic aspect in his public. John Cusack presents an incredibly obnoxious character in such a flat role I've ever seen: he seems to be just reading his lines. Laura Dern seems to suffer from the same disease. None of the characters is helped by the script, which is almost childishly ridiculous in the way it attempts to explain scientific concepts in a non-scientific way, offers the most unrealistic share relationship between Mr. Cusack and Mrs. Dern imaginable, does not even give us money the thrill of seeing the army throw nuclear bombs at Japan, and relies on a voice over technique that is bad at any time, even when it explains the true innermost thoughts of a character, or the narration of something that cannot be shown on the cinema medium, but is used here to read some absolutely trivial selections from Cusack's diary. The filmmaker offers us several shots of the threatening shadow of the two bombs, which could be surprising if they didn't look like cardboard cutouts instead of bombs, the fake atomic fire looks really fake - and why use it when the stock images are really amazing and realistic ... and the pervasive brown tone does not seem to be thematically appropriate. Besides that, it's not a bad movie.
