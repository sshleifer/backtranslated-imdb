The prince is, without a doubt, the attempt of someone's originality, but what we have here is art in its most morbid and grotesque form, therefore, for that, Begotten has my respect, but, to be realistic, it does not Unlike what this abomination is about, but for the record ... <br /> <br /> In the height of incoherent horror, let's start in an unknown time, in an unknown place. Immediately, we are immersed in the psychotic nightmare that is Begotten, a god is, apparently depressed, mutilating himself with a razor, I mean, really trying to finish everything, it takes a while (why shouldn't he?) After this introduction ultra-morbid, something is happening, something is rising from the corpse, greets Mother Earth. What does she do? Well, she gives birth to something. The thing would probably have preferred to remain in the womb, but this is life. Begotten's psychotic nightmare reign welcomes it in the only way he knows how. The thing, along with Mother Earth, is mutilated by strangers, hooded, attackers, with the bad intentions that are the only available clarity. From this point on, things drag on like they never dragged before. The interesting, grim images with a totally decent soundtrack are the highlights of the rest. Do not give the impression that I do not recommend this evil, because I do it, but only once, and only for people who appreciate the dark side. <br /> <br /> From my description, it might seem that I don't "get" Begotten. Trust me, I understand, and yes, Begotten is art if I've ever seen it. Everything in this film, no matter how unrelated it may seem, is significant. That, perhaps, is the only thing that makes Begotten art. That said, many of us require some form of entertainment, and this comes from someone who liked The Chooper. Probably the first five most intriguing minutes, I saw in a movie, but we are realistic, the next 7 hours and 55 minutes would put one in a coma, that is, unless it is meant only for some kind of psychedelic purpose, in that case , it does not matter. But how can one evaluate such a uniquely boring masterpiece? Depending on how much attention may be required, it should be 1 or 10, any other number would not make a statement. It hurts to do it, but with regards to the value of entertainment, Begotten is not. 1/1
