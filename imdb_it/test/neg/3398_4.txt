The incomparable Paul Naschy, icon of Spanish horror cinema, lends his talents to this funny, if not scattershot film. What starts as an action movie ends with a horror story. All I can say is just sit back and enjoy the journey. <br /> <br /> Paul Naschy plays a cool-hearted hired assassin from some shady Japanese diamond hunters (one of whom is his flame carrying his son) to cancel a diamond deposit from a Belgian businessman . When the fact is done, the charm of diamonds is too tempting for Paul to fire, so he kills his Japanese cohorts. His girlfriend, whose brother Paul killed, swears revenge and chases Paul through the forest, shooting him and leaving him dead. However, Paul is found by an ideal with two horny daughters and taken to his estate to recover. <br /> <br /> On the estate, the two daughters, Silvia Aguilar and Azucena Hernandez, fight for Paul in his weakened state, with the busty Silvia Aguilar determined not to lose the sweet and very first Azucena. But things get dry for Mr. Naschy who starts to see the ghost of his mother's long-dead daughter on the estate grounds. Couple this with the Japanese girl trying to finish the job of killing Paul and being pulled from two sides. <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (The story goes in many ways and does not fully satisfy. The script creates a fight for Paul among the daughters, but Silvia, whose character seems assertive and volatile, simply lets Azucena win in Paul Naschy's lotteries without a fight, Personally I would have preferred the phantasmagorical story of appearances to revenge in search of the Japanese woman) <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (You get a gun, a child blew up and some pigs that eat a little bit of poor alive schmuck.The Gore hounds will not be disappointed by this Naschy movie). <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$$ (Paul Naschy, as always, is fun to watch, but spends too much time in bed recovering from his injuries. Once again starring with Silvia Aguilar and the beautiful Azucena Hernandez, who collaborated with Mr. Naschy in the little gem "The Craving". Both girls do a great job. <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$$ (Very short glimpses of both Aguilar and Hernandez are obtained, but they are strategically positioned, keeping the null bits covered.The complete nudity is provided by the two less attractive actresses: the Japanese woman who chases Paul and the African maid who works for Silvia and Azucena).
