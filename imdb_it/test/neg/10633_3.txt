I saw this movie because I thought it would be a classic Amy Adams movie. Wow, this movie is so ugly on so many levels that it shakes the imagination. It's badly built for one, even the script and acting are just awful. But hey also Johnny Depp has a string of ugly films under his belt. The positive side of this film would be Amy singing, and even on that point I think that better songs may have been chosen. Amy is obviously beautiful to look at and if you're a huge fan of her you'll probably watch this title, no matter what, but don't expect too much. I wish I had found more pleasure, but it was painful to watch. I recommend Sunshine Cleaning or Doubt.
