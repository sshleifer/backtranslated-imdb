Although not as bad as some movies (like the horrible "Atomic Twister"), "Meltdown" still relies on common misunderstandings and inaccuracies about the nuclear energy industry to advance the plot. I am currently studying Nuclear Engineering in the search for a Master's degree, and it was easy to highlight flaws that would have been obvious to anyone involved in the field. <br /> <br /> Riding the false fear that a Chernobyl-style meltdown could happen in an American factory, the film claims that any merger (even partial, according to one of the guest commentators in the film) would mean a disaster for the area. Indeed, a partial fusion in an American plant, while destroying the nucleus, would not involve any risk for the surrounding area. Three Mile Island has experienced partial fusion and no radioactive material has been released into the environment, thanks to the natural stability of the fuel and the design of the core used in this country, combined with substantial containment. <br /> <br /> The security measures shown in the film were perhaps the part of the film furthest from the truth. In any important strategic place - whether it's a power plant, a chemical plant, a military base, or anything - you'll never see the staff responding to an alarm by continuing to talk as if it were an exercise without notice. This is particularly true in a nuclear power plant, where, at the sound of the alarm, the reactors would be SCRAMed immediately, closing them. SCRAMing can be done by pressing a button in the control room (it is not necessary to put the core in "shutdown mode" as shown in the film), and the chemistry of nuclear fission prevents a core from being returned to power within about 9 hours from a SCRAM . Thus, if this scenario were to take place in real life, the attackers would not be able to cause a significant collapse. In theory, they could still cause a partial one due to the residual heat if they exposed the core immediately, but this would be almost impossible given the numerous backup systems present in a plant - there are many more than the single backup pumps they talk about In the movie. <br /> <br /> As for spent fuel pools, it may be possible to turn swimming pools into a dirty bomb by making them explode, but this is much more difficult than simply parking a truck full of explosives near the pools. The fuel it is under (about) 18 feet of highly purified water. Water cannot become radioactive (no radioactive steam like in the film). Particles dissolved in water can, but water itself cannot; hence the reason for the very thorough purification. So the only way to turn a fuel reserve into a dirty bomb is to get the fuel out of the water. It is not an easy task since the water is very heavy and the pools are buried by very thick concrete walls. The explosives should be in the pool under the fuel (which is firmly fixed). And there should be a large number of explosives, since the water is * very * difficult to overcome through an explosion. Even if this happens, the spent fuel is not extremely radioactive, and the explosion would not cause a death toll almost as high as the one mentioned in the film, especially considering the small amount of radioactive material that would be spread. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of the basic film, I got a little tired of the style used. The constant fading in and out, the use of gritty black and white and fast monitoring and panning seemed amateurish. The characters were one-dimensional, especially those of the United States government. I have some problems with the breakthrough launched in the film, but I won't discuss it because it would be an important spoiler. <br /> <br /> In general, 3/10
