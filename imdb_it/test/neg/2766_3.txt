The film begins with a little girl (Rita) who sees her father killed. Apparently he was a criminal who screamed among his fellow crooks. Later, and this part makes little sense, the girl grew up into adulthood and STILL her father's past haunts her! A little later, Rita meets a good for nothing and lets him out. During one of their dates, he is a bit intoxicated and drives like a total madman. The cops hunt and he accelerates - killing a pawn in the meantime. Here's the really stupid part. He convinces her to confess the crime, while he assures her that his lawyers can make her disappear from scratch. Why, oh why, would you agree ?! Yet she does it and spends the next two years in prison !! And, shortly after his conviction, this boy disappears, proving to be a total heel. How disgusting !!! Later, after her release, her friend (Jack La Rue) informs her of the truth about her boyfriend. Then, he explains, the boyfriend's family is in charge and she should shake them for a lot of money for all the problems she did with taking rap. Frankly, this makes sense - as they certainly owe it to her - especially since they knew she would go to prison and had every intention of using it and then discarding it. <br /> <br /> Now the idea of ​​tapping money from the rich pieces is a good idea for the plot. However, there is no way this would have occurred in the first place because it is hard to believe that anyone could be so stupid as to take rap for a hit and run! In an interesting turn, the stupid woman decides to live a criminal life - wear a wig and pick up a rich boy - take him to the desert and rob him in the arms! Wow ... how it has changed! Apparently she loves the idea of ​​stealing from "fake" - ie rich hypocrites. However, and this made no sense, he soon stopped doing it and started shaking the father of the old boyfriend - because in the meantime he had taken the trouble to make some meaningless little robberies. And even what was a little hard to believe was that, instead of wanting money from the old fool, she was interested in letting him put his influence behind a mafia-controlled man for the mayor. Strange ... very, very strange. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, another plot develops involving a young Alan Ladd. He is an undercover agent who has infiltrated the crowd. It was chosen because it is simply a bell for a real scammer - what a cliché! But what doesn't make sense is that this real scammer is not in prison and is committing crimes while the fake is infiltrating the crowd in another city. <br /> <br /> In the end, the evidence that Ladd is able to discover is enough to issue mandates for the mafia bosses, including Rita. This is a case of very bad timing, as in the meantime, he made the decision to become a decent and legitimate woman, since he met a really nice guy who wants to marry! Wow, ... what are the odds ?! Overall, this is a stupid and rather stupid film that suffers from "kitchen sink syndrome" - in other words, there are too many plot elements and strange twists to make the film less credible. Furthermore, since the film lasts just over an hour, everything seems very forced and forced. It is a rather poor series B movie of the crap-studio PRC known only for the performance of Alan Ladd shortly before it gained great fame the following year at Paramount. <br /> <br /> By the way, this DVD was released by Alpha Video --- a company that sometimes releases some wonderfully obscure titles (mostly in the public domain) but that NEVER cleans up prints or adds subtitles . In other words, the DVD production values ​​are strictly third choice ... at best.
