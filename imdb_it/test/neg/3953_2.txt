In The Ring, it was a videotape; a website was the problem in Feardotcom; the danger in Pulse came from computers; and phone and One Missed Call featured ?? you guessed ?? deadly phones. In Stay Alive, the piece of technology that causes all sorts of problems is an online game: those who play it end up dead shortly after. How smart! <br /> <br /> Directed by William Brent Bell (who?), and with a cast of twenties you may have seen before, but you probably can't remember where or what the hell they're called, this is a piece of film -making extremely derivative, aimed directly at the PG-13 horror set; the expert cinema observers will have no doubt that Stay Alive is extremely boring, highly predictable and not scary. <br /> <br /> The poorly developed storyline follows a group of players with extremely silly names (October, Loomis, Phineus, Hutch and Swink!?!) who try to unravel the mystery behind the deadly game before they too become victims. Eventually, they discover that it is the evil spirit of the legendary Countess Elizabeth Bathory that is killing anyone who dares to play, and that their only hope of survival is to continue with the game until the end. <br /> <br /> With such a stupid story, viewers should expect a movie with plenty of ideas, not a minimum of logic (who did the game, how, and why it is never explained), very little in terms of fear or blood, and a closing scene changes to leave the door open for ?? God forbids ?? a sequel.
