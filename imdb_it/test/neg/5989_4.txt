The best thing about Shrieker is dialogue. Like Scream and I know what you did last summer, this film is aware of the conventions of this type of horror film and manages to invent some good jokes and scenes that play on those conventions. Unfortunately, Shrieker is simply boring. The plot is your base of ten little Indians with a monster controlled by one of the suspects / victims. You know from the beginning that each of the characters will be cast out until only the hero (ine) is left to defeat the evil. And that's exactly what happens. Absolutely no surprise and no tension. The production values ​​and the acting were ok, but I had no motivation to look until the end (even if I did) because I already knew how the final scene would go. The ending surprised me a little, because it managed to vanish, literally, instead of throwing out a bucket of special effects. Perhaps the budget for special effects was spent until the end.
