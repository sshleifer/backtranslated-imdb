Try not to see this. I thought it would be nice because I'm a fan of 80s cheese films and I enjoyed a lot of Linnea Quigley's work. I was wrong. I should have said "no" and instead I looked at Gigli, which is probably a much better film. I think my biggest problem with this film was his attempt at humor. Nothing about it was fun or even close to fun. The acting is bad, even for the queen of the 80s movies. There is no story, just random clips. I guess I shouldn't hate him so much because it was just made as a funny and silly piece, but I didn't enjoy it and didn't entertain myself once. I also had to go on fast to the end to get through all the crap. I'm sorry, but I don't find the zombies doing aerobics fun.
