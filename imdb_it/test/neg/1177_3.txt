With a captivating title like Butcher of Plainfield this variation by Ed Gein and Kane Hodder who will undoubtedly play it will fly off the shelves for a couple of weeks. Most viewers will be bored with this latest version of Ed Gien's life. /> <br /> The film focuses on Ed's fury and gives us a (few) glimpses into his Psychosis and dwells in Plainfeild. With these scenes that give the film a much-needed shock. <br /> <br /> What ruins this is the constant attention to the lives of other characters and focuses less on the error of Eds. Big here. <br /> <br /> Kane Hodder is a strange choice to play Gein, but he does it quite well and deserves more acting credits than he gets these days. Priscilla Barnes and Micahel Barryman also introduce themselves. <br /> <br /> 3/10
