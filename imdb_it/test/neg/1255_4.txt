Wow, I just witnessed one of the biggest poker tragedies and I'm not talking about the premature death of great students. This film, I'm sorry to say, was terrible. Absolutely terrible. A real tragedy in the history of cinema. Well, maybe I'm a little stern, but unless you have some interest in the life of stu ungar, then don't even think about getting close to it. And those who have an interest in his life will find that most of the parts have been trivialized and made to be great new scenes. I watched it because of Stu UNgar but I almost wanted to finish myself like he did watching this 4 star movie for the effort but unpleasantly painful
