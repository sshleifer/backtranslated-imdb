I'm a historian. This movie is so wrong that it hurts. I tried to look at it with an open mind, but if you intend to go deeper into a film or anything else for that matter of this nature, at least do some work regarding the history, places, ecclesiastical protocol, and so on. Stop playing to the stupid audience, please. There are those of us out there who actually put on their shoes and venture into the theater when something of this nature worthy of a theatrical version arrives in the city. A little research, all I'm asking. But then again, the book on which it is based is somehow a joke in itself. So, in practice, they made a novel with many mistakes and decided to turn it into a script, pay millions and millions and millions of dollars and make an incredibly promoted world distributed in the cinema and at no time does anyone have time to make a little research on the bag. Do I know many of my colleagues who would have done it only with credit alone or at least given to a body of students as assignment for several weeks of research of various aspects ?? or simply pay someone who knows a couple of dollars just to go through it because you believe me, there are many hungry historians out there who would have taken the opportunity if he showed up alone.
