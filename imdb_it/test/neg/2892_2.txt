This film is honestly one of the greatest films of all time ... if you suffer from insomnia. It's a foolproof way to guarantee hours of sleep at a time. As the film progresses slowly, the audience slips into a state of unconsciousness and gradually loses sight of any type of plot that the film can actually contain. This effect is certainly created due to the lack of sweet action / sweet girls. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Mr. Eisenstein was obviously not able to master the art of editing. A prime example of this is the scene on the Odessa steps. For no apparent reason, an event that in real life would have required a handful of seconds has turned into a seven-minute nightmare for every sane viewer. This defect of modification tarnishes any kind of realism in the whole film. Honestly, I saw a more realistic montage watching the cartoons. <br /> <br /> Some people who have commented on this title have hailed Battleship Potemkin as: "One of the greatest films of all time" and, "Truly a masterpiece". Well, I'm writing this comment to convince readers to avoid watching this movie at all costs. My best guess is that my fellow Potemkin critics simply wrote the wrong words in their summaries. Surely what they meant was: "One of the greatest snooze-fests of all time" and, "Really an epic failure". <br /> <br /> In conclusion, don't waste time. If you are interested in watching a higher quality film, go to www.youtube.com and watch a montage of Halo 3. If you had played the movie "Battleship Potemkin" in a Slayer on Guardian game, I would have shot him in the face my sniper rifle and then his body with the tea bag. PEACE!
