Opulent sets and sumptuous costumes well photographed by Theodor Sparkuhl, and a good (not exceptional) interpretation of Jannings since Henry fails to overcome the bad writing and static photographic work. Henny Porten chews the landscape like Anne. <br /> <br /> It's all very nice; but it's all surface and without depth. The melodramatic story of an offended woman made it a success in America where the expressionism "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" flopped in the same year (1920), showing that what is popular is not what lasts. Lubitsch would be remembered for his lively plays, not for sterile shows like this.
