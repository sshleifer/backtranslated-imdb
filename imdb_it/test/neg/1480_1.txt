This is truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Rod Steiger, who plays the original grandfather, Charlie, is in full swing to survive hoping that the more flashy he is, the better his performance (cue cue sound). Rod Steiger is one of the last legends of real cinema and seeing him in this film (even if End of Days is the second worst film I've ever seen) is really heartbreaking. From the ugly plot to the non-existent direction, it becomes casually clear that the only reason this film was made is that the surname of the producer ended up in DeLaurentis. The only good thing about this movie is that it's so ugly, it's really hysterical. Look for the flashback scene where Rod is a Superman Jor-El wig and a big black porn whisker. It is only hoped that his follow-up film, I Believe in America, by Uber producer Kevin Arbouet will redeem it and leave a good taste in everyone's mouth.
