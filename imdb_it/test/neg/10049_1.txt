What if someone made a horror film completely devoid of plot? <br /> <br /> Well, I think it would probably end up a bit like this. I don't think I've ever seen a move so firm that it slipped from trita (at the beginning) to complete a crap (by the end). I'm limited to it, because I kept thinking it couldn't get any worse. Well, until the end, "Necrophagus" / "Graveyard of Horror" showed me that I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Who would have suspected that a movie with an undead lizard-man, evil cultists of graves, and mad scientists thrown in for no discernible reason could suck it so badly? One might think that there is at least some humor ... but not here.
