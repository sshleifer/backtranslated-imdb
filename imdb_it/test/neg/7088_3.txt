This is another of the anti-communist Hollywood controversies of the 1950s. Stalwart Gene Barry, the beautiful Englishwoman Valerie French, and three others are kidnapped by an alien and endowed with clamshells that contain a fantastic - and incredibly vague - power. What will Earthmen do with such power? Do you throw it into the sea or use it to wipe out all of humanity? Anyone who knows American cinema in 1957 knows the answer to what the commies will do, but the story becomes mature when the Americans really test things in the middle of the Pacific. So a scientist, alone with the ultimate power in the universe, comes with his theory and uses it! His lanky attitude afterwards is sickening, and the cheerful disposition of all others is terrifying. <br /> <br /> Here is the spoiler for this dog: the capsules inside the clamshells have a mathematical code that tells the professor that they kill only "confirmed the enemies of freedom"! Exactly, don't worry about the ethical enigma of killing everyone that an alien pill decides to be an enemy of freedom; just do it! Hooray! No commitment! Fool female - and you threw your in the sea! Ha ha! Kiss me baby!
