What a sucky movie. This is undoubtedly a low-class B movie. The German elite StormTroopers assaults the Russian bunkers en masse as an old battle of the First World War. The acting is mediocre, the subtle and threadlike texture. It is sometimes difficult to follow where it is going. Action sequences are rather worthless (when some are shown), except that they use authentic World War II equipment / vehicles. THIS IS IN NO WAY at the same level as "Saving Pvt. Ryan" or "Platoon". A lot of useless attempts to develop the character, which lead nowhere. Old official good / bad official theme that is highly predictable. Even the action sequences look like a 12-year-old boy who fixed them. I could have said better. Too bad this is the same guy who did "Das Boot (The Boat)" because that was a good movie. He must have celebrated too much after that success because he definitely lost his touch when it came to this movie. I bought it on DVD, better to rent it.
