This is a great movie for the first ninja that are going out together. If you are trying to impress some cute little ninja, I highly recommend that you play this masterpiece. It's one of those special movies that lets you lose big sections without interfering with the plot. <br /> <br /> I was also wondering, where is a Teal ninja hiding? Are the ninjas color coded like this? It's normal? If I was attacked by one of these yellow or orange ninja I will die of laughter before succumbing to his sword. <br /> <br /> And I finished my black ninja test the other day, it was a multiple choice, it went pretty good. I discovered that there were a lot of questions about how to "sneak" around and look evil. It is about eyebrows and attitude. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film could have been better if: 1. There were no color-coded ninjas (or color-coded ninjas could be combined into a super ninja). 2. Joe died in the first two minutes and Patricia had to avenge him 3. Various monkeys were dispersed throughout the file 4. Patricia did not speak and Patricia was replaced with another character 6. The French boy was also a black ninja star 7 Chris Tucker, Whoopi Golderg and Chris Rock have been added as a "comic" relief 8. The strengths of the ninja came from the Miticlorians.
