I saw this movie about six years ago and I did it recently. If I remember correctly, I didn't like it the first time and enjoyed it a little more this second time. <br /> <br /> This film obviously has a big budget. The effects are mainly first-rate (except for one or two "impacts") and the cast is impressive. However, there are some elements that destroy the overall impression of the show. <br /> <br /> First, anyone who has decided that Peter Stormare should behave like a crazy Russian astronaut should be fired. Being a Swede and a Peter fan, I'm pretty sure he can play a Russian character well. But his performance in this case is simply stupid, both in terms of pronounced jokes and acting. So ... something has to be wrong with the script. I'd like to see Peter as a professional Russian astronaut. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the action scenes taking place on the surface are so intense that it is almost unbearable to watch. It is a total chaos that lasts over thirty minutes with too few moments to catch your breath. Beyond that, the events taking place are simply not credible. I'd like to see a much more sensible and stripped version of this part of the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, the scenes involving the flying spaceships are too influenced by the action. The shuttles are maneuvering as if they were a pair of MIGs, at zero safety distance, bouncing ice blocks similar to machines like ping-pong balls. The director should watch Apollo 13 to learn the limits of spaceships like these. <br /> <br /> I like the soundtrack because it is dramatic to a level that makes it very touching. The overall performance of the actors is fantastic. Apart from the things mentioned above, the story is interesting and quite easy to follow. <br /> <br /> With some minor modifications this would have been a movie in 8/10. I'm sorry it's not!
