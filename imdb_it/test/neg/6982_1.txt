This film was ugly but it was so bad that it could reach cult status in the distant future. A kind of film-noir meets the 9th floor of Outer Space. The story was, well, there really wasn't a story. There is a place reserved for Ed Woods and Russ Meyers of the world and this film proves it. "So bad could be good" is the best way to describe it. I seriously doubt that this film will be picked up by any legitimate distribution company, so it is unlikely that a broad release will be published. I will add that I expect to see another actor, Ron Carey. He did the best of what he had. The rest of the acting, if I can call it that, was completely forgettable. I've seen worse from big studios with huge budgets.
