Undoubtedly, this film will be much more appealing to those interested in some aspects of "Knute Rockne All-American Notre Dame Football" - probably, it is more interesting for serious followers of Notre Dame football and / or football. You'll see some documentary-style footage. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it is difficult to recommend it as a film. It is not much more than a historical document. "You'll know" that the end is near when Gale Page freezes - and, don't blink or you'll miss Ronald Reagan, of all things, "Camille"! <br /> <br /> *** Knute Rockne - All-American (1940) Lloyd Bacon ~ Pat O'Brien, Gale Page, Ronald Reagan
