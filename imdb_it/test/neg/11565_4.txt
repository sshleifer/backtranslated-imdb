Okay, there's no way to coat it with sugar. The plot was ridiculous, the premise was ridiculous, the acting was inconceivable, the effects were laughable and all the outdoor scenes seemed to have been shot in Central Park in New York. That said, there was something in this film that I couldn't get away from. Maybe it was the atmosphere, or maybe it was the evil super-vixen or the amazon wenches. <br /> <br /> In any case I am not one of those who sit on the margins and criticize without underlining some redeeming qualities, so here they are. <br /> <br /> A violent off-shoot of the women's lib movement is represented in a wild environment (in the central park, of course), and all the young masochists out there will be very impressed. Also, some scenes in which some characters lose consciousness are fun (note that I write dramatically, rather than convincingly). <br /> <br /> All I can say is that some people love B movies and I'm one of them. If you are one of them, try it. Greetings, Mr. Kincaid. This is one for the ages.
