I saw this movie with my boyfriend, a passionate hip-hop fan and couldn't wait to feel the "soul" atmosphere that the film claimed to have. Boy, we were completely wrong. When I finished watching the movie I heard two things: remorse and relief. Remorse because I regretted wasting my time looking at this horrible piece of dung, and relief because I saw it free on cable. <br /> <br /> This movie really gives blacks a bad name, putting so much stereotypes that I believe all smart blacks around the world are trying to spell. I am Asian and I feel very sorry and sick for those who made this film. What else to say? Bad writing, even worse acting and horrible plot. <br /> <br /> Even if you're bored to death and you have no other choice, don't watch this movie. Seriously. The film really has nothing to offer, unless you want to see things like the least illegal drinking, killing of animals, degradation of women, and in general: A REALLY REALLY BAD FILM, OSSEAIOSO-SICKENING-AWFUL. How disgusting.
