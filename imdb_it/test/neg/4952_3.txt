I can't understand why you would give this movie anything more than 4 ... Just enough it takes me back to the 80s and the "good old days of horror comedy" but that genre hasn't improved since then - it's still like this Low budget - low tech - bad acting - bad story - not scary at all and not enough fun ... in fact there is not much good I could say about it. The so-called monsters are simply horrible! I mean, we went back to the time when they used to make monsters with plasticine and shoot the scenes fame by frame ... I can't really understand why anyone should invest money to make this script into a movie - but I guess that it may have been almost OK if it was a bigger economic movie. <br /> <br /> The recommendation would be - please don't make the mistake of wasting your time on this unless you want to get advice for a bad Halloween trick! Personally I like independent films and anything out of the box, but that didn't do it for me.
