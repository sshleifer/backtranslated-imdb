For all its many flaws, I am inclined to be charitable towards "Cosa". There's the nugget of an interesting, creepy, claustrophobic Hitchcock style story here. Put it in the hands of a writer like Theodore Sturgeon or (if you prefer the British perspective) Robert Bloch, or the guy who wrote "Day Of The Triffids", and you may have had a spooky and disturbing story that was the best thing in a anthology of horror books and suspense stories. <br /> <br /> However, someone has chosen to tell this story as a feature film, and a second cheap percentage, and so much of the potential is wasted. A story like this really needs a voice like Sturgeon to bring out interesting character quirks in a better light. His classic story "The -widget-, the -wadget- and Boff" is an example of how he can bring together an isolated group of "ordinary" characters and in the space of 40 pages he can turn them into the most amusing, comprehensive and fascinating people you have you ever met. A good writer can, with a few chosen words, make the reader "see" some of the most vivid and memorable events ever to scare his emotions. <br /> <br /> Instead, we get a movie in which some of the most irritating and unpredictable characters ever made are grouped together and made to interact unconvincingly "Where is it from?" moments that lie there. (That is the blond girl who declines saying: "You are all evil and I hope you are destroyed!"). We get lead pacing and slow motion blocking, boring sets and stiff actors. I blame the director for the "rigid and superficial" part. These are all 3rd level actors who have never made the big success, but they are also "real" actors, and a good director could have achieved better results from them. We can't understand the nuances of lesbians that make the viewer uncomfortable and exploited without providing any kind of compensation. (If I'm going to exploit my basic instincts and feel guilty about it, I want it to be done by things better staged than that). And we get over an hour of scary build-up in about 35 seconds in one of the worst anti-climaxes I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Good things about "What"? Um, well ... some of the close-ups of the warlock's head silently mimicking his directions were pretty effective. The greedy and cunning widow played faithfully to life (although I wanted to put a sock in my mouth). The first scene in which the big and "simple" hand of the ranch silently turns on the fat cowboy and kills him had a bit of shock value, because the plot had taken the trouble to establish the big boy as a fairly sympathetic character. And as I said before, the idea of ​​an insidious force of the past that transforms the members of an isolated community against each other is good and can sustain interests well above the merit of a bad performance. <br /> <br /> What is surely. <br /> <br /> But, as I said, I am inclined to be charitable, because the director was probably working with a paltry budget, time-constraints at breakneck speed and the best actors he could find for the money. Heaven knows how future generations will judge easy crap as "The Cave", "Wrong Turn" or the remake of "House of Wax" in 40 years. I hope they are charitable to our tastes in supporting our generations of film stock waste.
