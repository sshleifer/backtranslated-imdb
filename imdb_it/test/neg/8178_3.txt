What you need During "What You Need", every episode from "The Lonely" was a winner to some extent. This episode is the first major failure of "Escape Clause". Serling's script is again based on someone else's material, a story by Lewis Padgett. As with "And when the sky was opened", Serling modified the content significantly, removing a scientist and his car and inserting an elderly street vendor. <br /> <br /> "What You Need" works best when it's sweet. The mid-opening, in which the street vendor provides customers with a bar with the items they will need in the near future, has a gentle charm that could have worn thin during an entire episode but works well in the time frame it is allotted . Unfortunately, the main plot it creates is full of holes. At a time when Steve Cochran's performance as a two-bit thug becomes the main goal, the episode falls apart. The Cochran part is a subscribed stereotype and its flat performance highlights this defect. His exploitation of the old peddler is boring and predictable and the revelation that will kill the old man is not entirely convincing, making the whole scene of slippery shoes completely false. Ernest Truex is good as a peddler, bringing a magical, mysterious but warm character to the character, but he is not good enough to help the script in distress. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the weak script is also full of inconsistencies. For example, we learn that the power of the street vendor to provide people with what they need comes from the ability to see into the future. So, exactly like this allows him to produce a pen that will magically choose winning horses. It looks like it should be a little outside of its realms of power. Furthermore, for a man who can see the future, the peddler certainly behaves surprised to find the delinquent waiting for him in his apartment. There are many other holes that can be chosen in "What You Need" but it's not worth it when the episode is so subtle that you can still see it.
