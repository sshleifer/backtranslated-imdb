Fatal contact: bird flu in America: 3 out of 10: this film is both funny and sad. The fun part is pretty obvious as this is certainly not a sober look at a possible impending crisis. This is a modern version of The Swarm. And just like those killer bees (and the so-called killer bee crisis that pushed them), bird flu has joined a pantheon of scenarios inspired by the end of the world (SARS, Y2K, global warming) that simply refuse to materialize. /> <br /> The sad part is the obvious attempt by the directors to inspire panic. Disease pandemics were historically quite common, after all people did not all die forty due to heart disease. Even recent pandemics such as AIDS reflect the old VD crisis (Think of Syphilis) that killed more soldiers than bullets. <br /> <br /> The flu pandemic of the early twenties was a bad business that killed millions but honestly life went on. I wonder if our too dramatic media and power-hungry government allies would allow normal life today. <br /> <br /> The movie itself deviates wildly from fairly competent scenes (Triage in Grand Central Station) to ridicule (Rednecks tries to ambush the National Guard in Manhattan). The scenarios themselves are quite useless as the directors don't seem to decide exactly how contagious the bird flu is or whether the symptoms are an Ebola-style accident or simply a long illness. In fact, a scene will show everyone wearing anti-risk suits and the next one will have no one even wearing a mask. <br /> <br /> The film also refuses to give any practical advice on what to do in a bird flu crisis. (Outside of washing hands, isn't that duct tape?) Acting and directing are competent for a TV movie, but the script is everywhere on the map. The last film has a strangely non-exponential death running at the bottom of the screen. Just like the Swarm did.
