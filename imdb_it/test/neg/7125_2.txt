I'm a big fan of the first four Ju-on projects. I own them and watch them every few months. He lends them to colleagues and friends just to be able to get a good scare from quality Japanese film production. I think Takashi Shimizu has created a great story and presented it very effectively in these four episodes. I was pretty excited about the opening of The Grudge 2 in theaters. I saw the first American Grudge before looking at the four originals. The Grudge was actually pretty good. Sure, the originals are better, but I got a good Halloween scare from the 2004 American Grudge. <br /> <br /> The Grudge 2 got off to a bad start and we went down from there. I kept waiting for it to improve, it made sense to show Shimizu's talent - nothing like that happened. The great thing about Shimizu's Ju-on work is history. True, it's usually said in a disjointed style that you have to think about connecting its components, but it's still a great story. There was no story in The Grudge 2. It was a series of free deaths from characters that you never had time to start caring about. <br /> <br /> The assembly was atrocious. Disconnected (as in the Japanese originals) is one thing, but the complete randomness of the scene was grueling. I kept thinking, "This is so stupid" and, "No - he didn't really sell all this for real?" It made me want to get out of the theater, run home and watch the original work, simply to reassure me that Shimizu has not always made this stupid, generic, boring, nonsense, thrown together tripe. /> <br /> If you really dare to watch this movie, I suggest you wait for 2 months to rent it. Really. Two of the five people in the theater with me went out for about 45 minutes. I discussed how to do it alone. Going home and cleaning the house actually seemed like a better way to spend my time at that point. <br /> <br /> I'm really shocked at how bad this movie was. Please Sam Sam Raimi no longer spends money to create The Grudge 3. It is not worth the trouble anymore. Sigh.
