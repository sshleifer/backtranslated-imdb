I just finished watching 2FTM. The trailers intrigued me so much that I went to see it on the opening weekend, something I never do. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. The story has so much potential and it's frustrating to see it mess up. I truly believe that the problem with the film was the director and Matthew McConaughey. First of all, I'm not a hater of MM, I thought it was great in both Reign of Fire and Lone Star. I liked his performance in those films without having to see it with his shirt 3-4 times. Yes, we all understand that he is a good-looking guy with a beautiful body, but I think most people knew it 10 years ago when he came on the scene in A Time to Kill. Showing it with a pumped iron t-shirt like a crazy sweat 3-4 times in the movie is absolutely useless. I think it would have been enough once. It wouldn't surprise me if they threw those useless scenes so that girlfriends and wives were willing to tag along with their significant other, no woman wants to see a sports gambling movie unless ... with that, we enter his role. I feel his acting was very forced and he didn't seem very comfortable. I know his character should have been this charming southern, but his lines were trivial and cheap. It was almost as if he were quoting the lines of Days and Confused a few times! In short, I didn't like his character, even though I had to. The accent, the wide-open shirt, the corny pick up lines, the weak sales pitches. His character was too much of an instrument, like Brandon or Jonathan. Pacino and Assante were fantastic, but it wasn't a surprise. Piven is fun to look like Arie .... Oooops I mean Jerry. I just heard that this movie was very commercial and put together badly. It is offensive that they could take a great story and throw in ingredients to try to make it a box office success. 1. Fantastic story that attracts the male man 2. Hunky Hollywood actor for women (make sure he has numerous scenes with the shirt raised by weights) 3. Al Pacino with 4 great speech scenes and 25 fantastic one liners 3. Each character will be dressed in thousands of dollars and will have an extremely dark tan 4. Jeremy Piven will play the same character he did in Entourage and Old School 4. Lancia in Armand Assante to seal the deal 5. Trace, good writing, character development and intelligent casting is not necessary <br /> <br /> This will be good enough for most people, but not for me! Anyone who disagrees with me, ask yourself this. This film would be much better if: A. Directed by Sodeberg B. De Caprio or Ed Norton as Brandon instead of MM <br /> <br /> I will probably be part of the minority in thinking that this film sucks. I understood it when the woman next to me started crying during the ridiculous final scene of Pacino who shed a fake tear while hugging Russo. The financial success of this film will guarantee one thing. The film becomes public and gets what the film wants public, a large sum of money.
