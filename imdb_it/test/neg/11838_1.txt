This movie doesn't even deserve a 1/10 This movie was a scam. <br /> <br /> I swear that at least 30 minutes of the film have DELIBERATEDLY been copied by Carnosaur 1, 2, and 3. The entire "Raptor" movie was based on the film and that was really a pathetic attempt to be a copy of "Thriller, Action Packed, Dinosaur". I loved that series of films and seeing him put on a film that he can't even afford or want COPY without making his own models is what's coming to America. I suggest you see the movie Carnosaur FIRST (all) and then look at this and you will know what I mean. <br /> <br /> - Spencer
