I exclude with the obvious revision of factual inaccuracies. They are too numerous to name. A much shorter list would be what they were right. 1. Friend named Noah. 2. Ark with animals on it. <br /> <br /> If you want a much more accurate portrait of Noah's Ark and the destruction of Sodom, go and rent "The Bible" (1966). It depicts the story of creation through Abraham trying to sacrifice his son Isaac. It's a much better film, and it could be that the abomination called "Noah's Ark" (1999) has prompted you to look for a movie like that. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060164/ <br /> <br /> I really couldn't stand to watch the whole movie. Reading other comments, I can see that even atheists found it grossly inaccurate. As a Christian, it was intolerable to me. Perhaps the worst movie ever made. No real point to this film, except perhaps to show their secondary computer animation. <br /> <br /> Was it a complete waste? Maybe not. God can use evil to function well. <br /> <br /> Romans 8:28 says, [28] And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose. <br /> <br /> Genesis 50 says, [20] But as for you, you thought ill of me; but God understood it in the good, to realize, as it is today, to save many living people. <br /> <br /> In the second example, Joseph's brothers intended to kill him, but God turned their evil into a great good. He could have done the same thing with this movie. <br /> <br /> People were so amazed by the lack of biblical foundation that they probably broke the old and dusty Bible and read the story for themselves. To discover Lot and Sodom, they would have to travel all the way to Genesis 19 before God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. At that point, they read almost half of Genesis, so they may want to finish. The next book is Exodus, which the film "The Ten Commandments" was based (and much more accurately). If they saw that movie, then Exodus becomes an easy read. So now they have read at least two whole books of the Bible, just because they saw a pathetic film about Noah's ark. I'm sure this really happened to someone out there. <br /> <br /> God works in mysterious ways.
