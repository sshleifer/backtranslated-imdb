The other lower level reviewers have summarized this sewer system so perfectly that it seems little to add. I must point out that I had the imposition of Cockney Filth only during the visits of my children, who insist on looking at the Sunday omnibus. My God, it's depressing! Like all soaps, it consists entirely of totally unpredictable characters that are unpleasant to one another, but it's ten times less than it could be the worst. The reviewer who laughed at the "true to life" bilge caught by his defenders was a success. If someone lived in a social environment like this, they cut their wrists in a few days. And I can assure anyone not familiar with the real East End that it's a little more "ethnically enriched" than you can ever see here. Follow my advice: avoid this nadir of the British television industry. IT'S BAD.
