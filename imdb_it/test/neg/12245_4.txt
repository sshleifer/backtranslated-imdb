Spoof movies have come so far since Mel Brooks in "The Producers" (1968) said "Don't be stupid, be a cheat, come and join the Nazi party". He brought us delicious movies, like "Young Frankenstein", "Airplane!" And even "Naked Gun". But the good dies young. Fortunately, the genre managed to get through the late 1990s. And then ... the Wayan's Brothers sparked the apocalypse: "Scary Movie". Suddenly the word parody was an insinuation for raw sex jokes. Most movies that claim to be parody have since followed the example, including "Scary Movie 2", "Date Movie" and the movie to kill the "Epic Movie" genre. Of course, there have been some findings. There was "Shaun of the Dead" and "Hot Fuzz". Will Ferell has become a vehicle spoof near all the sports imaginable. In addition, the Wayans Brothers abandoned the "scary movies" and were created by the trusted Zucker Brothers. While these films have had some value in the rescue, the genre is tragically destined to be a film loved only by prepubescent males who have just discovered what an erection is. People who haven't explored the term "parody" and cut and paste films together for a quick laugh. No heart, no brain, only cheap glue. Unfortunately, "The Comebacks" has been added to the list. Dave Koechner (who starred in "Anchorman" alongside Ferrell) leads a team of losers to win against a coach (Carl Weathers of "Happy Gilmore" fame) who brought him back to coaching. Koechner has shown promises as a supporting actor, but as a protagonist in this film, he plays just like scripted. It seems too much like he's doing a cold reading passionately. Also, the jokes about being a washed coach, which through the film encourages the team to fail at school and then run away from the police in their underwear, have already been done before. Yes, this is a parody. But let's remember that even bad words can have quality. Give the characters dignity and a kind of sophisticated vision of modern society. Furthermore, dependence on stereotypes will not make us laugh any more (those who knew that a film with people who talked about jive could lead to gangster stereotypes (not really, but see)). While I will admit I laugh at least a couple of times ... he wasn't even. The football team inside it had a lot of stereotypes, including a Mexican, an arrogant athlete, a fat boy, a skeletal nerd and help for mentally disabled people. Even the only female of the team has been reduced to a stereotyped feminine humor, being mostly dressed succinctly and giving away countless. In fact, his character, like most others, never developed. It's a sad state of affairs for this movie. If only he wasn't so addicted to stupid sex jokes, he could have done something for himself. Indeed, this film will probably be the target of jokes alongside "Epic Movie" for the future. Koechner really deserved better. The script in general was poorly conceived, even naming the "The Toilet Bowl" championship. So yes. fake movies are dying. There is a movie called "Meet the Spartans" (anticipates the trend, boycott it now!), Which includes a parody of Britney Spears' failure. So let those guys keep having erections ... but people grow up and lose them. We need sustenance. One day they will learn to stop spoofing spoofing and restore them. We hope that one of the heroes will be "Get Smart", made by master Mel Brooks, which will be released next year. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 of 5 (Stars)
