First I will say that I will be as subjective as possible. <br /> <br /> There will be some potential spoilers ahead so be careful. <br /> <br /> I can hardly ever review films, but this particular one I felt I had to review. The film Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children, based on the ultra popular rpg (Final Fantasy VII) for ps1, has been in the works for a long time. After the years of hype and dozens of trailers (none of which I've ever seen, I've only seen still images) this film has made the legions of fans really excited to see their favorite characters on the big screen. I myself had played and completed the game a couple of times like any good fan, and being such a movie maniac I was pretty excited. So I thought to myself, "WHAT CAN I GO WRONG?". <br /> <br /> Well, the film started well in the first 20 minutes, but then things got out of hand as the movie progressed. Without a doubt, this is the most beautiful CGI animation around, but that won't help a weak storyline, undeveloped characters and indulgent action scenes. <br /> <br /> Here is the story in essence. These three silver-haired, nancy-haired boys who have nothing to do with the game, are supposedly clones of Sephiroth (he is the villain of the game who allegedly killed all his alleged clones) are trying to kidnap all the children for some reason that was not really explained everything well, probably to create an army (of children?). They also centered part of the story on a boy named Denzel, I don't know who this guy is, or what his point is, he just seems depressed all the time. So sephiroth clones are also involved in some sort of pattern involving a disease called geostigma, which affects only children, this disease seems to cause boredom and small amounts of skin discoloration. <br /> <br /> So now the cloud has to save the day from these guys. Apparently Cloud and his teammates have learned the skill of flying, I felt a little insulted by the fact that these characters fly around a city fighting a dragon and landing on those feet all the time. Perhaps if the film were not so exaggerated, then the view would relax and then be surprised by something incredible. The real problem with this film is logic. Now I know what you're going to say "But it's called Final FANTASY! It should have those ideas!" well this is a crazy way of thinking, the game is based on a kind of reality and the film should follow in that CONTEXT. Context and logic in this film are inconsistent, I could explain everything, but if I did, I will end up writing the script. <br /> <br /> Furthermore some scenes of this film have been extremely elaborate and banal. like when all the characters of the game are displayed just in time for their mandatory time on the screen, so as not to upset the fans. They present themselves, there are a little and practically no sense in history. <br /> <br /> If it's too long here is the simplest review- <br /> <br /> the first 20 minutes top-notch cgi animation action scenes decent visually stunning <br /> < br /> excessively indulgent comforting action / unbalanced action (leave the viewer tired at the peak) weak plot super-human characters = no suspense the j-rock soundtrack / score (what happened to the orchestra?) Horrible end <br / > <br /> BIG TIME SPOILER- <br /> <br /> Now the ending of this film has really disappointed me. they could have gone to the final really fresh and sweet where the cloud dies and meets with the aeris in the afterlife but after the great battle at the end the cloud is hit in the back, the wound arisen where the bullet explodes through the chest. then the cloud has its 100th flashback in the movie and then wakes up in a lifestream pool. (now I remember the lifestream in the game, but it had no resuscitating properties, if so, they could have brought the aeris back to life, thus making a completely different story) so the cloud is brought back to life and everyone has a party and dives into pool and we have an ultra-stylish character moment / kind of life. <br /> <br /> not that the film does not have its moments. Worth seeing for its graphics. but that's all. <br /> <br /> in addition to that it's not really a good movie. it's strictly for the blinded fans of the game. not for people who love plot, character and story.
