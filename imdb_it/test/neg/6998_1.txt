It's time that American critics and fans begin to unmask their undisputed and untamed veneration of films like "Once Upon a Time in America" ​​by Sergio Leone. The chess story of this opulent film (and the great, imaginative myth associated with its production and many versions) belies its narrative mediocrity. The film staggers back and forth in fits and starts, its central figures adrift and seemingly out of place surrounded by the surrogate decadence of towering sets, the slightest details of production and, in 1984, clichés, but a splendid cinema offering the public. The temporal horizon of the plot is confused, deceptive and laborious, leading some critics to imagine that the opium of the figure of Noodles may be the antecedent of some future "dream reality" as well as sepia memories. This ham delivered, excessively fanatic, the interpretation of the apologetic-boyfriend sheds the evident narrative irregularities in the exhibition. Even at this full (?) Execution time, the figures appear and disappear with sudden alarming: Deborah's character is fleetingly established in childish form, a cold and unattainable trophy woman, without even mentioning the gravity with which her Relating to a post-prison noodles, the re-union henceforth sounds completely false. The damping rhythm is a bit to blame, certain sequences drag stagnant for too long, meaning very little, suggesting a director with so little restraint and narrative economy that he often feels obliged to usurp every iota of possible time on the screen to show out of the his production, fatal for a film that contains such dark and detached figures. The trajectory of the lives of the figures is presented to us as a microcosm that reflects the historical trajectory of American adolescents through prohibitionism and its booty, ending with the (questionable) ruin of its dying central figures (with the exception of Deborah - a make-up department fumble or intentional one asks). This notion is common, even trivial. The cast of characters imagined in the script of a single note (written by seven Italians no less) are interpreted flat and awkward by all but the younger actors, who at least venture into some variations of facial expressions. This is understandable given the almost unworkable material. Some critics say that the characters may seem so impenetrably self-absorbed, but actively seek their own goals, assuming the conformity of others (for example when Noodles gets out of prison, Max takes it and offers him a prostitute without asking him if that's what wish and later will do business assuming that the spaghetti will be compliant). This explanation of their abrupt and abrasive dispositions is inexplicably foreign and serves only to highlight the complicated aims that the unshakable supporters of the film will go to defend their positions regarding a film, unfortunately, of little meaning. Although the soundtrack of Ennio Morricone is very revered, it is undeniably schmaltzata and repetitive, it springs from an emotional sensation that the scenes themselves, very violent, simply do not justify. In points it is debatable whether Morricone was looking at the same film in which I was so incongruous is his work. As a paean for American Filmmaking, he succeeds in terms of mood (aided by some masterful editing shots that follow one another between periods of time) and visual (not helped by the aforementioned score) but lacks narrative cohesion and fluidity.
