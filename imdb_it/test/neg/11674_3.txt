I'm terribly sorry! Where the Lubitsch-pic was charming, wonderful, full of spirit and elegance, this one is just colorful! Lana looks like a 51 (in fact she was 31, but obviously depressed) and tries to play a shy and boring girl. Think of Jeanette McDonald, who gave the widow's role a double depth "playing" with Count Danilo. That Lana had to play an operetta although she couldn't sing: crazy! Just sing a song - the main role of a Lehar-operetta, which is really fun! The only really positive thing is the big waltz scene at the end: glamor! And - after seeing this scene - take a look at the introductory waltz scene in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"! Any resemblance?
