this movie sucks. so many holes in the plot. if the devil is invincible, why does he need the protection of the arni bodyguards? I couldn't understand why Arnie didn't show up for work for several days and then suddenly appears, takes all his armory and disappears again !! Good job if you can get it. It is sad that the last half hour should lead to the standard end of arias 'uzi 9mm'. Arni's interpretation of a depressed cop is to bow his head and smell. I thought he had a bad cold for most of the movie. Strictly scripted, Arnie is called "friend", "boy" etc. For 95% of the film and then suddenly we hear him called by his real name Jericho Cane (where do they get these names from?). The finish is so impeccable that you will do the best to prepare the bag. Too bad the Gladiator came to the same end with 100% more class. <br /> <br />
