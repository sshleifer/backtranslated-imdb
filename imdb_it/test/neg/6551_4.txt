Another of those inconsistent stories coupled with the most forgettable musical numbers. Powell and O'Keefe, as publicist fighters, are quite forgettable. However, there are two brilliant moments. Hubert Castle is the most incredible tightrope walker you've ever seen: his "drunken walk" on the wire must be the most spectacular piece of balance ever recorded on the film. It must be seen to be believed. The other is Sophie Tucker who makes a turn towards the end of the film. His magnetism, his professionalism, his pure talent for being herself - well, the charisma is not learned - you have it or you don't. A great lesson for all aspiring cabaret artists. A sad note: W.C. Fields in his latest film cameo is completely forgettable.
