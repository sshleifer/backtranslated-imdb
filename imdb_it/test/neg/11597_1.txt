A group of environmentalists goes to an island to discover a secret laboratory that is experimenting on animals. When they arrive, they find that they are late. Apparently the government made a scientist to test his experiment on a komodo and, yes, you guessed it, a cobra that made them become very large. I'm not sure this film really needs or deserves to be explained, since it's almost identical to the Curse of Komodo, which it also sucked. The effects of the computer are always smoky like a komodo that roars like a dinosaur that really made me nervous. Like Boa versus Python, this film is not worthy of being seen and is as much fun to watch as you stick your hand on a table. To avoid!
