Ben Stryker, a former green cap, stops in a small town called Agua Dolee to visit an old friend, Tick Rand. Immediately after riding in the city with his Suzuki and settling down. A band of motorcyclists known as "The Savages", led by the tyrant Pigiron, invades and finally takes the place. Stryker doesn't want to get involved, but changes when his friends become the real targets. <br /> <br /> Is there anything good to say about this scuzzy object? Difficult call, because the only fundamental reason to observe this low-cost car wreck is for the huge b-cast that the crew managed to get for this project. Even if I don't think it's a complete job, it's not too good either. Now what a cast! Lance Henriksen (being the main character, strangely not the maximum billing, but the last), Karen Black, George Kennedy, Richard Lynch, Bill Forsythe, Mickey Jones and Leo Gordon. Now, what went wrong with this bizarre low-budget wharf. The superficiality of the material is too one-dimensional that takes heavily the ideas from better films (ie Mad Max) and comes with a complete disorder of ideas that do not gel and could be better thought out. The clich√©s that are used can be manipulated in a good vision, although they are predictable, but "Savage Dawn" seems to let you hurriedly hurry without letting the viewer get soaked with everything. The cast is mostly wasted in no roles. A bleached blonde Henriksen is perfectly solid and also with her moving presence that provides an enigmatic glow to her character. He doesn't get very angry and sometimes disappears into action. Too much side action, but when he kicked some bikers' asses, the good times went by. The hissing performance of Karen Black is very strange and concerns screams and curses. Even if he enters a memorable firefight with the impertinent violin character of Claudia Udy, Katie. A wheelchair linked to George Kennedy wanders aimlessly until the final assault and Richard Lynch seems embarrassed as a rebel priest / mayor of the city in a very redundant role. Bill Forsythe is simply crazy about the infamous biker pack. <br /> <br /> The history of the junky (written by William Milling and Max Bloom) has a comic-book look and is very influenced by the western genre. Look at the bad guys for that. How they invented their names is a mystery. Maybe they pulled them out of a hat. It is a rather second-rate material that more often moves on to one scene lackluster after another. Not funny comical elements are thrown in and even a bit of mud. Foolish exploitation that doesn't get gritty enough and deaths are pretty ridiculous. A clumsy script is full of complicated details and unbearable trite. Simon Nuchtern's stained direction was by numbers and slightly arranged. One or two intense scenes can't wear make-up for its turtle rhythm and the numerous poop stunts. The cardboard sets had a dirty appearance, but they lacked that organic sense. Gerald Feil's gravel film was best handled when the main focus was not on the city, but on the desolate background (like the beginning and ending climax of the film) with some camera touches. Pino Donaggio's choices of awkward music are suffocated by his own incompetence. <br /> <br /> "Savage Dawn" is an instant and forgettable midnight film that is a real bonfire for the most part. There are better and more convincing exercises of the same kind out there.
