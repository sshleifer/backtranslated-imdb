Did Agustus and Call really do anything? Because they are Heroes, they have done nothing but go to places after the bad ones where they died. What was the point of this show? I was very disappointed. I expected more action, more history, and to see the birth of Heros and Great Deeds. Instead I saw very little, it looked like Agustus and Call, where only the lateral story is for the great Indian chief. <br /> <br /> I'm not even sure that the story is also very close. They did very little to show why the Texans and the Comanches fought against each other. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this film was Zhan, who played Gus very well and is a great actor. A lot of good stories that could have been wasted. He was sad and I wish you hadn't seen him.
