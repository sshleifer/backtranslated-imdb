This movie just happened on HBO yesterday, so I watched it. This was a mistake. I think I was sucked in and kept looking, even though it was very similar to a train crash, terrible, horrible, but somehow you can't look away. shaudenfraud I guess! ; ). <br /> <br /> This is the story of a photo shoot for models on some Caribbean islands. One by one they are all murdered. One drinks cleaning fluid, one blows himself up on a waverunner, one goes on a cliff ... so these are NOT accidents, but for some senseless reason the police are never called and no one thinks that maybe they should "wrap up" the footage and go home, not only respecting the dead, but perhaps for fear of your life. No. They continue shooting because THAT is the most important thing. Forget dead models, we have a magazine to produce! <br /> <br /> One of the subplots is the owner of the magazine Evil, played by Lee Majors, Rex is his name. It is the most obvious suspicion and every time a model is killed, she twirls her mustache and says "well, I can't say that it won't go well for sales", so absurd. Another subplot is when it is revealed that Rex is one of the baby dady models, only when he found out about the child did he try to convince the girl to have an abortion, but he didn't, but he always resented having even suggested it. <br /> <br /> They try to give you false clues and point to a boy named Raule, apparently because he is the only one with an accent and "looks creepy". <br /> <br /> In the end (sorry to spoil but this film came out years ago, so if you haven't seen it yet ...) one of the women was found dead face down in the pool, this was the sun drop !!!! Vanessa Angel, forget her characters the name comes to Rex with a gun, they fight, the fires of weapons and now she is dead too !!! While she is lying on the floor her business partner tells him that with all this bad press the magazine will be worthy ss and it's all his fault. He has the magazine signed. Once it's voila! All the dead models come back to life and discover that the whole thing was an elaborate cunning to get back to Rex. <br /> <br /> Oy! What a ridiculous movie. As someone else said; if you want to see something like this, April Fools Day is far better!
