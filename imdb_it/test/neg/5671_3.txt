I won't say that the show is all bad, because there are some fun parts, like Spencer, and some random incidents. But other than that, let's face it, it's just another dry sitcom where kids are buying. <br /> <br /> Miranda Cosgrove was as pretty and fun as Megan on Drake and Josh. Honestly, she's mediocre in ICarly and it's not as fun as she tries to be. The actress who plays Sam seems to be half asleep most of the time, and her antics are so obvious that I would think of them. They are not funny, just annoying. And Freddie is fine, but it's not that interesting. <br /> <br /> Of course, the situations are not realistic, but it's not bad at all. Some are annoying, though. Here are some: <br /> <br /> 1. The girls are 14 years old and have a web show that gives too much personal information, with a weekly audience of 27,000 (WTF), with little or no advertising, and can still continue to talk about their lives not attacked by fools <br /> <br /> 2. Their web show gets too many praises ($ 100,000 a year to advertise sneakers, a free trip to Japan, Plain White Ts performances, and etc). Honestly, anyone over the age of 6 would not find their funny "comedy". <br /> <br /> 3. How are they so "mediocre", yet they have a three-story loft, Spencer does very little and can still afford many basic luxuries, and they have all the equipment for a web show? 4. All adults are idiots. ALL. <br /> <br /> 5. No 5-foot tall girl, no matter how hateful and tenacious, can bring down trained policemen, unless she's muscular. Sam is thin and petite. <br /> <br /> 6. No one can fall 9 floors in an elevator and live. <br /> <br /> 7. Children can handle the discovery of criminals better than cops. <br /> <br /> The show is stupid. In fact, it seems harmless, but making sure that children think they can be hateful to their elders, living alone in Seattle when they are only 14 with an irresponsible moron and giving personal information is simply wrong. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed to say that my cousin, who is 3, enjoys the show. What happened to the cartoons when I was his age?
