It's hard to believe that such a bad movie hasn't been produced once, but four times! Most films require a certain "suspension of reality", but this takes it too far. The basic scenario is an Air Force pilot who is shot down over a "Middle Eastern" country. The US government drags itself to recover it, driving the pilot's son (Doug Masters) to attempt a rescue mission. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with the film is that it describes the American aeronautics as a colossal joke. In the film you will discover that Doug and his friends from the air base are able to secure two F-16s, all the ammunition, the fuel, the Intel for the mission and so on. Security on this basis seems to be a joke. No one seems to have a problem with the fact that a sixteen year old boy is fully qualified to fly an F-16! <br /> <br /> If that wasn't enough, you might think that producers would at least try to get ammunition right, since people like to see things "explode". Not like that! Several times in the film, Doug launches AIM-9 missiles on ground targets. AIM stands for "Air Intercept Missile", which means a weapon used to hit targets in the Air. It also fires 15-20 missiles, where the maximum that an F-16 can hold is 6 AIM-9. The film also lacks continuity. You will see the plane configured with a set of ammunition, and in the next scene, it has a completely different ammunition package. Furthermore, 20MM does not completely destroy everything it touches! An F-16 will contain 500 rounds of 20 MM, and is mainly used for self-defense. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on with holes in the plot, flaws and incorrect information from the film, but I won you bored. If you're in the mood to see a good Air Force movie, your choices are rather scarce. Most military films deal with the army, navy or marines. Until Hollywood fails to invent an Air Force movie inspired by "Save Private Ryan" or "A Few Good Men", we will be forced to watch movies like the "Iron Eagle" series. <br /> <br />
