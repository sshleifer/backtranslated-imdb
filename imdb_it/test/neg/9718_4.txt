Think "fascinated" with testosterone instead of estrogen and get the general idea of ​​this image. A very lame story with mediocre effects and an anti-climax ending to open the door to part 2. We hope someone has the sense to spend their wisest money. I would suggest a 'Charmed - the movie' because compared to this 'Charmed' he kicked ass and I only watched that show to please my girlfriend !!!! Wait and watch it on DVD on a rainy Sunday, when you have nothing better to do. Or better yet, download it so you don't waste your money. The first 15 minutes were in place. But the funniest line in the film and also the only highlight of this film is when Reid says, "Kiss my ass, Harry Potter" while you are driving on a cliff. Although I'm not worthy to kiss Potter's ass, because Potter is so much cooler and at least his movies have a story. The glass of fire was even scarier than this !!!
