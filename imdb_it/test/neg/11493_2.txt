This is the perfect example of how a great book is turned into a poor movie. The direction gives the impression that the film was invented as they went along and Patrick Swaze is so wooden that he can almost see the puppet's strings on his body. <br /> <br /> Spy Vs Espionage films are not - or should not - be pursuits and car shootings, the villains in this film are really bad shots and the main characters are missing even at close range . <br /> <br /> Even the action shots are just a clich√© with the usual mounting sidewalks and crashing tables and chairs - yawn. <br /> <br /> I arrived halfway and turned off - completely bored.
