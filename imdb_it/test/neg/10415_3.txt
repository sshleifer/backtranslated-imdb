The only time I seem to browse IMDb's comments is when I saw a duff movie. I think I try to find reassurance that it's not just me. For me, then, Lonesome Jim was a film duff full of incredible characters in incredible situations that limped weakly and boringly towards a wild ending. So I control what other people have to say and I feel a bit like Jim, out on a branch, insane, while one page after another of more stars and votes leaves me in doubt about my critical faculties. Yet maybe I should check the settings for submitting comments, because after a while the gush goes off and I'm relieved to see appreciations that reflect mine. I feel confirmed. It's a junk movie, it doesn't get stuck together and constitutes a wasted evening sitting through it. Praise to kindred spirits.
