As embarrassing as I am to admit, I was listed as production manager in this film ... my very first! In fact, it was the first feature film for almost everyone who participated. Look closely and you can even see me in one of the opening scenes, like a murdered emergency room named ... "Cely" (my surname). <br /> <br /> Originally titled "Hostages" this image was changed to "Another Son of Sam" by the producer-director who wanted to cash the serial killer in the news at the time. Nothing could have helped. I don't even think that this image was good enough to be shown on "MST 3K!" <br /> <br /> The film was mainly shot with a collection of old Mitchell cameras and the first Arriflex portable cameras. In fact, the shot of the helicopter during the siege of the hostages was shot with my World War II era, Arri. The photo was shot entirely in Charlotte and Belmont, North Carolina, in the mid-seventies. Most of the "stars" were local television journalists, and the rest of the crew was fairly inexperienced or credulous enough to believe the former stuntman and producer-director, Dave A, to the disappointments of Adams's adams. <br /> <br /> If you like to look at these kinds of photos, you might love the work of another North Carolinian, the legendary Earl Owensby. <br /> <br />
