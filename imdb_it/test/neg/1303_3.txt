I'll tell you right away, this movie is boring. It's a flood, that's all. Blah blah a little family, blah blah blah politics, blah blah blah boring. <br /> <br /> Blaming the whole meteorologist, poor people. Deputy Prime Minister Campbell is a tough ass who expects everyone to be clairvoyant, a very irritating character. <br /> <br /> If you come from the UK, or from anywhere you can flood, you might like this movie. It is a bit like the most appreciated earthquake films where earthquakes occur. <br /> <br /> This is not an action movie, in which time is the enemy and you have to conquer or literally overcome it, it is more like a time bomb that must be deactivated. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, it's understandable why the UK thinks the world is overpopulated, it's not, but for them it is. <br /> <br /> Really, the film is as exciting as the scab collection and I can't recommend it. Over 100 minutes have passed, too long. <br /> <br /> Problems with the film; I will not go into them beyond this because the film does not deserve such dissection. Point at you Londoner's - buy more boats. If you bring children in this film, they either fall asleep or become barking bawling demons.
