It's a pity that the character of Barry Humphries, Sir Les Patterson, had his film debut in this espionage / cooked comedy. <br /> <br /> This film reminded me of the fetid / rascal Hoffman, Ishtar (1987). Humphries should have learned from the mistakes the film made - if you're changing your mind about a concept DON'T USE SPIES! Like Ishtar, the first 20 minutes offer a promise of something different. It would have been nice to see the anachronistic and grumpy Patterson wandering in the world of Australian politics. One of the characters also points out that Patterson is dated with the current times - one might think that Humphires could have had a field day commenting on the Hawke government (I can only imagine a scene with Patterson and Hawkie in a drinking contest). But instead of a film that could have been clever and even a pungent look in that world, Patterson is going around the world while James Bond tries to save the world from the biochemical weapons that run out of steam before the turn. <br /> <br /> Disappointing.
