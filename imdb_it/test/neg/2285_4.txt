Thunderball and Never are two of the biggest box office failures and Never is a surprise farce of the hero of the empire Strikes Back Irvin Kershner. Klaus Maria Brandauer seems to steal the show, when, in the midst of the plot unfolding, Bond's mission becomes more fun in Hollywood (Basinger comes into play some time). What about Klaus Kinski? I still think that the casting of Largo ago or, as is evident in both films, breaks the story. The worst of all is the attempt to pass off the elderly and very hairy Connery as the sex symbol he was in the 60s. The 1980s were a sterile period for James Bond films, although For Your Eyes Only is an exceptional title. Sometimes, when I happen to have to waste some time during the holidays watching this film in the often Bond series of celebrations, I think the best attribute of the film is its score, and I don't like "Jazz" 80.
