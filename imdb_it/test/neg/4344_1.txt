Normally, I wouldn't even stoop to looking at garbage this way, but since role-playing is a hobby of mine, and that was the subject of the film, I did. It was rubbish in so many ways that I don't know where to start. I'd rather sit in the "Plan 9 from Outer Space" marathon than watch another minute of this vomit. At least plan 9 did not have an agenda. How the media could capitulate and irresponsibly represent an extremist agenda as the fact is outside of me. It is a frightening moment when a whole group of people can be defeated unceremoniously without defense and without presenting real facts. I know this comment has become more social, but could not be helped, as this film begged him. Imagine a pro-Nazi film rigorously reviewed on the merit of the film. It won't happen While sitting, the people who made this film are facists themselves, and they should perhaps move to a communist enclave where propaganda is accepted.
