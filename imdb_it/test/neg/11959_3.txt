Scarecrow Gone Wild starts out as a high school teen Mike (David Zelina) and his companions decide to give wimpish diabetic Sam (Caleb Roehrig) a 'nonnismo' as an initiation of some kind. Mike and his partner decide to take Sam to a cornfield, tie him to a cross next to a scary-looking scarecrow and leave him there all night, it sounds fun, right? Well, things backfire when Sam enters a diabetic coma after suffering a hypoglycemic crisis and Sam's vengeful spirit passes into the scarecrow that comes to life and starts chasing children responsible for Sam's unfortunate situation. Can Sam Jack's best friend (Matthew Linhardt) and his girlfriend Beth (Samantha Aisling) save Sam's day and life? <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Brian Katkin Scarecrow Gone Wild is the third straight-to-video entry in the Scarecrow series and while I haven't seen any of the previous two after seeing Scarecrow Gone Wild, I'm certainly in no hurry to change that situation for sure. The script actually has an almost decent premise as Sam's offended soul seeks revenge and his friends have to keep the real Sam alive, but the way it is said is poor and I suppose it's basically just an irrelevance to the fact that this is a movie about a killer scarecrow that runs by killing people in ways that are not too bloody or fanciful. Having said that there are one or two scenes here that save him from a star rating, the gart fart in the cornfield is fun and something that a lot of immature kids (like me) could do, the piece when two guys bury their companion in the sand and then stopping on him and peeing on him is also pretty funny in a youthful thief and a bit cold when a guy starts singing a terrible song so the scarecrow throws a pole that impales him! However these OK bits are few and far between and overall it is a stupid, boring, badly written slasher teen movie with very annoying characters that irritate. It's also very predictable and has a stupid ending that doesn't have the scarecrow at all, which is a problem like when you watch a movie called Scarecrow Gone Wild that you expect to see a scarecrow go crazy and I have to admit that it looks pretty cool like the horror character . <br /> <br /> Director Katkin does a reasonable job here in reality even though what's on Earth with that hospital at the end and all that neon lighting everywhere and the fact that there is only one patient there and two staff members? Cinematography is much better than the usual low-budget end-of-film horror film and there is some beautiful, if not entirely unrealistic, lighting. The film lacks any real fear or tension and some medical terms used in everything else are a bit uncertain, so to speak, and I say it as an insulin-dependent diabetic. There is not much blood here, there are a couple of scenes in which some actors have fake guts resting on their bellies to represent that they have been gutted, but it looks rather fake, there is also a burned face and a couple of impaled but little else. There is a fair amount of nude female breasts on display, if that is your point of view. <br /> <br /> Technically Scarecrow Gone Wild is quite good considering some of the low-budget abominations I've had recently, unfortunately it's still a poor film overall. The less he said about acting, the better. <br /> <br /> Scarecrow Gone Wild is not as bad as some of the straight-to-video horror films that have been discovered recently, but that said it's not much better & it's still a bad movie when everything is been said and done. Not recommended, the two previous entries are Scarecrow (2002) and Scarecrow Slayer (2003), both of which went directly to the video.
