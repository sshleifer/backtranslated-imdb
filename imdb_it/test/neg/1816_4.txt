This is the first and, as far as I can tell, the only complete production of "Heart of Darkness" ever published. Before starting on "Citizen Kane", Orson Welles shot some test films for a version of "Heart of Darkness" that was to be entirely filmed in what would now be called "POV", where we would see everything from the character's point of view principal Charlie Marlow; he would have been seen only fleetingly in mirrors, windows, water, etc. The film was never made. The "POV" technique was used, not too successfully, in 1947 in "The Lady in the Lake", with Robert Montgomery played by Philip Marlowe. Presumably, the coincidence of the two characters of "Marlow (e)" is just that. Certainly, "Apocalypse Now" by Francis Coppola was based on "Heart of Darkness". <br /> <br /> The short novel "Heart of Darkness" by Polish writer Joseph Conrad, first seen in a British literary magazine published in 1899, presents one of his favorite alter egos, the ship captain Charlie Marlow, who narrates also the story "Youth" and indirectly tells the story of "Lord Jim". Marlow, temporarily out of work, decides to take a captain's position as captain of a river boat for a Belgian company involved in the brutal exploitation of the resources of King Leopold II's personal fiefdom, the cruelly mistakenly called Congo Free State. Marlow travels from London to Brussels, signs with the company, and is told that his mission is to take a boat on the Congo River to an inland station run by one of the colony's most productive agents, a German named Kurtz. Shipments of ivory, latex (for rubber production) and other products from Kurtz station have ceased, and Kurtz has not been discussed for some time. There are rumors that he has "become a native". Marlow must investigate, take all necessary actions and make a report on his return. He takes the passage along the West African coast to the Congo mouth, is delayed for weeks while he is forced to repair his boat at the coast station, and eventually takes off upstream to find Kurtz station. The river, the heat, the vegetation, the wildlife, the insects, the people all have their weight on its resistance, on its imagination and on its mental resources. Find Kurtz sick, half crazy and near death. The final meeting and Kurtz's death are almost an anticipation, especially since Conrad is so obscure about what really happens that we are left to solve the problem for ourselves. This is a novel in which you close the book, vaguely dissatisfied with the ending, but nevertheless retains its history for its incredible atmosphere. <br /> <br /> This "Heart of Darkness" was filmed with Guyana in Central America for West Africa. It is better that the novel is at its greatest disadvantage: actually showing us the inhabitants of the world of the first world as it would be a boat on a tropical river. But the rest of the film was forgettable. Tim Roth does his best as Marlow, but much of the plot, characterisations and character relationships have been altered beyond the recognition that you wonder why they worried. If the purpose was to make Conrad's story for the screen, why didn't they leave him alone? It is unreasonable to expect that no compromise will be made when a book is turned into a movie, but so many changes have been made that I have not had any cinematic justification that you wonder if we are simply dealing with incompetent screenwriters and filmmakers. The most disappointing of all was John Malkovich as Kurtz. He was completely upset and simply flubs the role. Everything about him is wrong: his looks, his acting style, his voice, his accent, everything. A decidedly better choice would have been one like Bruno Ganz (unlike Malkovich, a true German, like the character). <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing production and I would recommend it only after reading book if you want to depend more on your imagination to get a visual image of a boat trip on the Congo River around 1900.
