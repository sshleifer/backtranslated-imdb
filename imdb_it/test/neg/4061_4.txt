As a big fan of DM, it's obvious that I've seen this movie numerous times. Anyway, I only watch him for the concert footage ... the rest of the film is, um, rather terrible, sad to say. <br /> <br /> The famous rock music director DA Pennebaker has followed Mode late 80s Music tour, which promoted the superb self-titled album. Title 101 comes mainly from the fact that the concert material included is from the 101st final concert of the Pasadena Bowl tour, but it is also a reference to the fact that the film is a "beginner's course" on the band and how it works. Depeche Mode 101. Among the quartet sequences that play live and that explore America is a second story about a group of DM fans who won a competition to meet the band, go on tour in their bus and participate in the final concert. <br /> <br /> Now, as I said above, the concert footage is fantastic. The modalities are here at the top of their form of the rock deity of the stadium, a somewhat unusual result for an electrostatic group dating back to the late 1980s. Although the film captures the band before they recorded their 1990 "Violator", there are still countless excellent songs seen and listened to here, such as Behind The Wheel, the majestic Never Let Me Down Again, Everything Counts, Just Can not Get Enough from the Vince Clarke years, Shake The Disease and many others. <br /> <br /> When Mode is on stage, they are brilliant. When they are not, they are, well, very boring. Nothing vaguely interesting interests the boys while they control the United States in the dying days of the Reagan administration. For example, the likely "highlight" of the material is a visit to a country music store to buy cassettes. Not exactly thrilling stuff. I know all the bands don't have to be reckless and reckless idiots, but these guys make the Mormon Tabernacle Choir look like a Rammstein. <br /> <br /> The only real excitement comes from various clips focused on the band's singer, Dave Gahan. Gahan bumps into the 101 like a mild psychotic, talking about a violent power within himself that he can't control, remembering a bizarre attack of anger that involves a taxi driver and so on. There's a point in the movie where he throws a first-woman bang at a poor backstage - really embarrassing. At the time the man clearly had problems, which fortunately were solved. Singer-songwriter Martin Gore and keyboardist Andy Fletcher are presented as very articulate men, clearly very talented, but also absolutely devoid of color; while the enigmatic fourth member Alan Wilder is the only one in the quartet who brings out the rock star character with all sorts of aplombs. <br /> <br /> And as for the "fan tour" thread, well, it's swallowed. Let's not fool ourselves. Maybe it's just because it's all so * very * late 80s, but the bunch of young devotees does little for me, but it does generate a feeling of irritation. They are, for one person, singularly superficial and vapid persons, whose antics are trivial when they are not antics. Allow me to repeat ... * nothing happens in the movie that is not on the stage and that is of some interest. Anything. Endless scenes of kids splashing their hair, fighting uselessly, changing their clothes, getting lost in the city on the street of concerts and finding their partners in bed with another winner of the competition make me wonder just one thing - if the Cure fans were this mind cowering loudly in 88/89. The love young people have for the band is something I can definitely relate to, and it's sometimes contagiously joyful, but if what we see is the most interesting thing to what was shot by them, then I'd hate to see the outtakes. . <br /> <br /> But music is all that matters, and in this sense 101 excels. The Pasadena concert, one of their best concerts of all time, makes the film worth seeing. The recent DVD edition of the film is accompanied by a bonus disc containing what remains of the unreleased movie (a good 80% of the performance), and therefore makes the DVD an absolute must for fans. The audio commentary of the band (less Wilder, who left Mode in the mid-90s) on the first record is also, strangely, much more interesting than the film itself. <br /> <br /> As a document of the boys from Basildon during their period of idol amphitheater, Depeche Mode 101 is priceless. But if you're looking for excitement, it's best to get the double live album that accompanies it (now available in Super Audio CD format).
