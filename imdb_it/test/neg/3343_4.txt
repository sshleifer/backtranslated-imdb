(Spoiler) <br /> <br /> Oh, sure, it's based on Moby Dick. Totally obsessed and destroys him. It is total madness. The film starts pretty well, but at the end of the film, all the others are destroyed and the main protagonist's mind is empty. <br /> <br /> The supposed half sister is never convincing. Some very poor lighting effects. The music is interesting. But little else. It took me over a month to finally finish the damn thing. I suppose if you like being John Malkovich, you might like it. But where BJM was a great movie I didn't want to see again, Pola X is a movie I hate for hell. The only possible excitement in the film is the free incest sexual scene towards the end of the film. (We hope you don't even think about Catherine). <br /> <br /> This film is strictly boring, depressing and misdirected. Not highly recommended. If you like French movies. (look at the Crimson Rivers) <br /> <br /> 4/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 5/10 Show: 1/10 Reproducible: 0/10
