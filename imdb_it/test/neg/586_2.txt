A strange script by Cameron Crowe (who follows his "Fast Times at Ridgemont High") has little inspiration and stirs the stupid gags. At least "Fast Times" had a good deal of satire and sensitivity behind his slapstick (courtesy of a good director, Amy Heckerling, and Crowe's undeniable inclination for acquiring a perfect literal language); here, Chris Penn (Sean's brother, natch) is the goof-off that makes hellish life for the straight arrow Eric Stoltz, and the filmmakers seem to think it's hilarious. Jenny Wright has some good moments as a contractor, but Illan Mitchell-Smith is lost in a subplot scratching the head of a teenager who seems to be infatuated with an upset former soldier. Confused and meaningless nonsense given a brilliant shine and a soundtrack full of pop-rock melodies, but characters that one hopes to avoid. Players who support Lea Thompson, Rick Moranis, Lee Ving and Sherilyn Fenn are wasted on stupid roles. * from ****
