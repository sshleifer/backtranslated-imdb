It is amazing that some people saw this as art. We saw it as a poorly filmed film (hand-shaking camera and all), a misreading (generally) misinterpreted mess that looked more like a high school project with children experimenting with black and white movies. Injecting heaps of poetry instead of a story does not make an art film. When we looked at it in the theater, people began to come to terms with giggles (including us) for the infinite stupidity of this indulgent and indecent chaos. And believe me, it seems endless. If we had finished our candies and our popcorn, we too would have left the theater with the other two dozen people who packed and left to look for something more interesting to do!
