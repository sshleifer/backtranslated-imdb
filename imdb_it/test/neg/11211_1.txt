The plot is very simple, but acceptable: a young American soldier, after studying Asian martial arts, puts it to good use in defense of the general's daughter and falls in love with her. Unfortunately, the three main actors (soldier, girl, rebels) combine IQ 3: a point for the soldier, one for the girl, a large number of Ninja fighters must share the third point between them to be able to lose against the first two.
