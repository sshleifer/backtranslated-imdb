Eleven years ago, Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City by finding and wearing the Nordic god of evil, the mask of Loki. The Mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and reached a very popular status for its originality and sheer fun. Everyone knew how to write the party. PARTY. Why? Because I have to! Now, eleven years later, it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie "Son of the Mask". Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you doing this? And he replies "Cuz I got!" Unfortunately, this answer does not cover him because after seeing Son of the Mask I left the theater thinking: "Good God, why?" Guterman and the rest of the people involved in the blasphemous film must realize that the answer given to why you are making this film should not be as simple as the answer to the debate on whether or not to party. <br /> <br /> The Son of the Mask begins with Otis, the dog that finds the infamous mask and brings it back to its owner Tim Avery, a clear tribute to the legendary creator of Loony Toons Tex Avery. Tim, played by Jamie Kennedy, is a distressed animator who is stuck working as a tour guide for the animation company he aspires to draw for a day. On the night of the company's Halloween party, Tim puts on his mask and turns into a mischievous and crazy character that we all expect. After the party, Tim returns home, masks again and conceives a son with his wife. Nine months later, chaos ensues when the child born from the mask has considerable comic power. Otis, the dog, jealous of the child's attention, puts on the mask and participates in Tom and Jerry with the chaos of the type. Meanwhile, Loki, played by Alan Cumming, is looking for his mask by order of his father, Odin. <br /> <br /> First of all, I admit that I respect the fact that this film is a tribute to classic cartoons like Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons, with its Wile E. Coyote-type contraptions and the infamous frog plot dancing. However, this reverence cannot save the film and make it less respectful and more of a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film becomes increasingly silly. The fool is not always a bad thing, but in this film, stupidity comes to the point of simple annoyance. The characters are not fun to watch and, what is worse, they are not fun. The dullness of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that so much CGI was used. One of the biggest things about the original is that while, of course, computer animation was used, it was based on Jim Carrey and his exuberant style of being alone. Jim Carrey, we were convinced, it was a real cartoon. Jamie Kennedy doesn't have that kind of ability, a fact that is clear when you watch him wear the mask and his facial features rarely change. The child and the dog were mostly completely animated, which became increasingly distracted during the film. Loki's side story in search of the mask has become more and more astonishing. <br /> <br /> The son of the Mask is a sad sad situation. What I suggest is to rent or buy the original of the Mask and thank the Nordic gods, or anyone, for bringing it to us. And I will consider seeing my sacrifice as I continue to ask the infamous question "WHY?" The son of the Mask gets a star, although that star should be divided between the classic creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey, who will always be the mask in my book.
