This seventh (yes, you read that right - the seventh) Puppet Master movie shows how demented the group of dolls has become; from a French puppeteer who uses them to take revenge on a group of ancient mummies who persecute him as soon as they discover that he holds the secret of life. He was taught by a sorcerer, also on the run, before he died. He used this power to create normal puppets. This sequel is basically meaningless, sprinkled on even more nonsense like most of the Puppet Master sequels. Because of the PG13 rating, we don't even get fantastic murders. Come to think of it, there are no damn puppet murders. If there was a franchise that had to be cut, this would be it. No more .... god, please no longer ...
