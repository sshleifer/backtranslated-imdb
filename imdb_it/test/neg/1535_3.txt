This is a typical "perfect crime" thriller. A perfect crime is executed and the detective, ignoring all the clues, knows immediately who is guilty. The public has to wait for the whole movie for the perpetrators to be caught. The result is like every single episode of "Columbo" or "murder that he wrote". The director himself refers to the history of makeup by showing the policeman watching a Matlock episode! This story barely fills 90 minutes but the director insists on using all 120 minutes that fill every click in the book. Skip this, you don't miss anything.
