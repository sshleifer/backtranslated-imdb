20 people voted this at 10! That urn was stuffed better than a Christmas turkey! Speaking of turkey, here is a traditional story that hopes to return to the current poker craze - without success. Said entirely in linear flashback, and when I say "told" I mean SPOKEN DEATH, this film never leaves a sufficient image when words can be used to expose. <br /> <br /> Stu Unger's childhood fascination with cards and his association with hooligans may seem an interesting film, but the director succeeds in sucking his life. At no time did I feel the slightest sympathy for Unger, a genius at cards who threw everything away on other forms of play that he was not so skilled at. Obviously, this leads, as we go through THREE musical montages, to the inevitable descending spiral of drugs, to the loss of the family and finally to its redemption (sort of). Great yawn!
