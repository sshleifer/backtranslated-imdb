It looks so nice on paper - Matt Damon, Lawrence Fishbourne, Jean Reno, handsome right? And a robbery with $ 42 million - looks like a crime-inducing movie. <br /> <br /> Big disappointment - I think the stars have all the money because the production values ​​on this are bad. <br /> <br /> But more than that is the atmosphere of pseudo-tank dogs when the easy crime goes wrong. It is very much done for TV. <br /> <br /> All in all extremely disappointing - marks points for being what it is - but loses them massively to be, in no uncertain terms, not very interesting at all ...
