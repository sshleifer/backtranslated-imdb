He borrowed scenes from LOTR, Matrix, Star Wars, etc. Humor is so dry, artificial and banal, that you can't help but laugh at his madness and the fact that you're looking at him from time to time. Exactly what you would expect from a HK comedy. The average person would enter with an IQ of 100 and leave with less than 80. Stephen Chow is an obvious omission from this film. Humor would work better with Stephen. The Mandarin version of this film is not as good as the original Cantonese. The graphics are poor compared to its Hollywood counterparts. There is an excessive dependence on low quality CG. My biggest complaint is its end. The origin of the white horse is so clearly described in the "Journey to the West" (JW), that this alternative explanation does not work well with the plot. Despite its many flaws, this film has a much greater entertainment value than the other film starring Nicholas Tse - The Promise.
