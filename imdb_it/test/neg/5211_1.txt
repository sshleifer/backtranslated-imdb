How the hell were these guys giving money to make this movie? Lack of script is one thing, but cinematography makes you want to cry. A hand-held camera can be of great value to the graphic appearance of a film, but in this case a photographer is needed who knows what he is doing. I am well aware of the fact that the actors are amateurs but it is not of any defense since the director could be the least talented he has ever directed in Sweden. It would be a pity for the industry if he (or anyone else on the team) was given money to make a movie again. This film does nothing but feed the argument that too many films are made in Sweden every year.
