There is something else on earth to be more tempting than to learn what our fragile bodies expect after, um, death. The Spanish director Ignacio Cerdà (the soul mate of his German colleague Jörg Buttgereit) provides an answer to our curiosity and invites us to an exciting journey into the world of preparation tables, scalpels, surgical saws, human bowels and deformed minds. <br /> <br /> Welcome to the autopsy room! <br /> <br /> I don't know which facets of the film, apart from its infamous reputation, may have helped it to get a sufficiently high rating. <br /> <br /> Storywise is quite simple and straightforward - a day in the life (actually half an hour) of a tormented coroner (or, perhaps, an assistant pathologist or whoever he is) who is fed up with his morbid routine duty and discharge his psychological tension in a non-traditional way, right at work. I am puzzled by what particular message the authors have tried to provide with this plot of a single note. I suspect it may be somehow inspired by the strange demeanor of Udo Kier's character in Andy Warhol's Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> Even the artistic values ​​of the film are questionable. It is difficult to assess the performance of actors who do not squeeze a single word. Their emotions are hidden behind medical masks. There is not enough space for a great photographic work - in practice, the whole action takes place mainly within four walls. <br /> <br /> Authenticity: the effects and the make-up are impressive and the installation seems very plausible, but only a handful of Forensic experts can judge how true and anatomically correct the dissection performed here (if anyone cares ). Honestly, I used to think that an autopsy was done to examine the condition of particular organs and to ascertain the cause of death. Now I know that the corpses are cut, raped and humiliated, the intestines are ripped, the brains are recovered from the head, inserted in the abdomen and mixed with the guts, so the body is sewn up and washed - nothing personal. And what are these poor boys who expect to write in their fake autopsy reports later? <br /> <br /> Factor of shock and disgust - it is very unlikely that an unsuspecting spectator can discover, to his horror, that the record was intended to watch with his wife and children next to a Christmas tree turns out to be a manual of graphic videos on vivisection. This dark object is barely available, sought after by people who are familiar with the subject and who are not easily offended. So it would be useless to warn someone to sabotage this movie. They are well aware of what they are looking at and what they want to see. <br /> <br /> Cerdà is a very gifted and elegant director, who is clearly evident from at least two other parts of his "trilogy" - the previous "The Awakening", a surprising short black and white and "Genesis" of 30 minutes, a visually stunning and moody piece with an unusual and interesting concept, and I'm pretty sure that one day it will conquer the hearts of viewers with its new material, more oriented towards the mainstream, and sooner or later "Aftermath" would become a rarity for meticulous collectors of his "first" heating works. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, I fear, it could be strictly recommended for medical students or specialists studying mental disorders and sexual deviations.
