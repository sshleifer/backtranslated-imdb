The worst movie ever seen. Even worse acting. I can't imagine a film worse than this. Nothing to see. No acting. Hey (actors) should look for another job. I can't understand who was stupid enough to actually put the money into this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for Eric Roberts. It must be hard ... I can't imagine how HUUUGE should be his mortgage to justify taking the job! <br /> <br /> Women in the movie ... maybe it's better to stick to XXX. <br /> <br /> As for the LEADING MAN ... what an advantage! Better to be put in command and stay there! I can see him more successful barking than acting. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: NO NO rent ... DO NOT BUY!
