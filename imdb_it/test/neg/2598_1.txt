I haven't seen many episodes of "Family Guy" and it's a pretty safe bet that I won't see too many in the future. Some say that comparing this show with "The Simpsons" is unfair. I absolutely think that this show would not exist if "The Simpsons" had not arrived first and I absolutely think that it wants so much to be "The Simpsons". I don't understand what's so funny about this show. In the episodes I saw, I realized where they wanted me to laugh, I understand that someone thinks a joke has just been said, but the joke is not funny. I find the whole spectacle lazy: the title, the "jokes", there is a complete lack of inspiration in everything. <br /> <br /> The best shows on television (cartoons or not) are created in this way: the script is written, goes through several rewrites, things that are not working are taken, inspiration is triggered added good things, there are more rewrites and then it is filmed. <br /> <br /> "Family Guy" episode to be created this way: a script is written and shot.
