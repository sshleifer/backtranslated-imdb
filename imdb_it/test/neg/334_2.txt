I really didn't want to write a severe review of this film because I sincerely appreciate how hard it is to make any kind of movie with an incredibly low budget, let alone try something as ambitious as science fiction. <br /> <br /> However this movie is really horrible. Acting is among the worst I've ever had to endure and as a fan of low budget movies that is a pretty serious accusation to make. There are a lot of aspiring actors out there who would work on a deferred payment plan if they believed in the movie and what the director was trying to get. I'm sure the actors did their best as did everyone else involved in this production, but it just wasn't good enough to bring out something so big. <br /> <br /> Then there is dialogue. Really very poor. There is no excuse for this. I had the impression that the script was hastily written on the back of a beer mat after an epic drinking session. I hesitate to use the word "laughable", but that's exactly what the script is. I didn't have empathy with any of the characters. In fact, they scratched me the result: on more than one occasion I wanted to beat a couple, Mr. Stirton was overloaded with too many roles. Clint Eastwood is not. Again, there are talented people out there willing to work on deferral if they believe in the project. <br /> <br /> Much has been made of special effects in this film. For the money, they are exceptional, even if a little abused. It's like someone says "I have side effects and boy, I'll use it". Anyone who has done CG's work has been among the most talented of this crew. <br /> <br /> Quite simply the money was not available to make an ambitious film like this one tries to be. Congratulations on having tried it, but unfortunately it fails to reach its exciting goals in too many ways. <br /> <br /> I greet all those involved in its production, I really do it, but for their next engagement they must both get a better producer or lower their eyes to something more manageable. <br /> <br /> In conclusion I cannot recommend this effort to anyone who is not the most enthusiastic of film students or usual sleepers. If you want to see a true masterpiece of cheap science fiction movies, try the "Dark Star" student of a certain Mr. John Carpenter.
