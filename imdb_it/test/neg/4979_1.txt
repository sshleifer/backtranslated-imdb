Only three words are really necessary for this review: Piece of shit. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed watching the cartoon as a child, this movie will make you completely lose time and money. The best thing about your two hours in the auditorium will be your feet glued to the floor. <br /> <br /> Yes, they use all the names and take the sentences. The namesake of the dog "Shoeshine" (referring to the dog that is "Shoeshine Boy" in the cartoon). They call the love interest Polly, but it is not Miss Sweet Polly Purebred. <br /> <br /> My wife and my son are taking me to see this. They should have taken drugs to see it. <br /> <br /> The original Underdog was voiced by Wally Cox, the definitive nerd. This is voiced by someone with an "intelligent teenager who knows more than all adults" attitude. <br /> <br /> As an independent film, it's horrible. As a tribute to Underdog, it's even worse. It is not a tribute. It is not a retelling of history. It's not a story update. It is purely an attempt to cash in a known title and create merchandising. The next time I go to the store, I'm afraid I see toys, pajamas, towels, sheets, clothes, etc. Of Underdog. McDonalds and Burger King probably fought for the child's meal rights for this. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this film, however, is the soundtrack. They do THE UNDERDOG THEME SONG TO RAP (read the one with a silent "C" at the beginning)! Well, now that we're going to destroy something, let's go all the way. <br /> <br /> I knew it probably would have been bad before I left. My fears were confirmed when I arrived at my local 12 plex and discovered that they opened it for the first day and for the first time in their smallest auditorium (and one of only four without seats in the stadium). Even the people in the theater knew it would be rubbish! Save your money on tickets and invest better by going out and buying the original DVD series. It will be more fun and will have better production values.
