Ok, first the good thing: if you've seen the trailer, you know 100% of the film's "scary / nervous" moment. And yes, it's a good thing because you should just follow the trailer and not go see the movie. <br /> <br /> Now I understand why Sarah Michelle Gellar did not long survive in that movie, she did I don't want to associate her name with this production. I wish you the best for "The Return". <br /> <br /> You must follow 3 different stories in this film, and they are all disconnected (in time and in meaning) until the end. And even then it's a bad climax. And God doesn't even want to open the door to another sequel. <br /> <br /> Yes, in this film, "The Rage and Fury" is in motion. No need to visit the house anymore, be close to someone who is inside and finished. It is no longer a curse, it is a bit like a virus. Enter the house, be frightened, return to the United States and spread the joy in your apartment building. <br /> <br /> It's not so hard to follow, but you don't really care about anyone. The plot is thin to anyone and you have a lot of scenes in this movie where you laugh and shake your head ... Someone milk ?? I saw Ju-On 2 at the Fantasia movie festival last summer, a completely different story but much better than this fool. It's not a remake, but this time, maybe they should have just done a remake .... <br /> <br /> If you have to see it, wait for the DVD.
