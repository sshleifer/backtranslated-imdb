I'm really surprised that this one got 88% of Rotten Tomatoes and a nomination for best foreign film at the Oscars. The evaluation of 7.3 on IMDb ... is no surprise, given how IMDb users have recently voted. I can't get into a movie where the real facts of his main character were clearly distorted, and not in a way to make the film artistic, but rather to make it melodramatic and less boring. Which, apparently, makes it really boring for anyone who expected to see a serious and credible interpretation of the life of Genghis Khan. The Mongolian, far-fetched and too dramatized, often recalls the caliber of 300, a film that could not be happier than being ridiculously inaccurate; but unlike the 300, Mongol takes itself seriously. It's stoic seriousness, mixed with obvious inaccuracies, is what really makes the most boring movie I've seen this year; perhaps the most action or biopic movie I've ever seen. The characters have been pathetically written. Honestly, I doubt that Genghis Khan was boring and passive as shown in this film. Which is fun for me, because if there's something I think should change for the sake of theatricality, it's making an interesting person boring. The love story between Khan and Borte is likewise boring, simple and stupid. Moreover, without giving up anything, Mongol contains the most stupid scene I've ever seen in a LONG time - where there should be good 20 minutes of plot development, the movie jumps forward without any explanation. He seemed to come from a Saturday Night Live scene that parodies epic action movies with a horrible rhythm. (Did I mention how seriously Mongol takes herself?) In the meantime, it drags on like any movie I've ever seen before. Even now, I could have sworn it was three hours long. After about 45 minutes, I checked the time, being fairly certain it was almost finished. In addition to some beautiful scenery and quality acting from Asano (of course), Mongol is honestly just a disaster. He completely failed to have fun or enlighten me anyway. I would never give this film a second chance. And don't look racist or patriotic or anything, but give me a shabby and unreasonable American epic on Mongol every day. At least then I know what I'm getting, unlike Mongol, where reviews and ratings have led me to believe that it was really something to see. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing I hated Mongol is that I have friends that I know, no doubt, I would simply love it.
