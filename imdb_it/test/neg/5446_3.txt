This is just one of those movies that constantly make you moan and I wanted it to be over. The problems are many and the positive points are few. I feel that the main problem with this film is that it has a pretty rough plot and they try to make it an epic movie, that a film about super bad monkeys and smart ones that just sign is not epic, it's cheese. When you have cheese, make the movie more fun. Of course, the final scene with the monkeys and that laser was very nice to watch and there was a need for more things of that nature. Instead the actors are doing such a serious job that you feel that the film has only a trivial plot in the midst of all the serious tension that the film is trying to create. The plot revolves around a woman trying to find out what happened to her missing husband, while searching for some sort of legendary diamonds. She uses these two boys who trained a monkey to do sign language and now they want to set her free as a cover to enter the country and begin the mediocre adventure of a lifetime. The only things that make this movie quite tolerable are the character of Ernie Hudson and the laser attack at the end.
