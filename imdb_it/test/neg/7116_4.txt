Mr. Brento wonders if this film was produced by the same one that produced the TV series of Dragonball Z. Of course not. <br /> <br /> This is a true Hong Kong action movie based on the first episodes of the original Japanese cartoon (also based on a series of comics). And I really don't know if it was produced under the license of the creators of Dragonball ... <br /> <br /> However, the story of the boy-monkey with special powers is an ancient story known throughout Asia (in Japan , the boy's name in the story is Songoku, in China, it's Sunwukong, in Korea it's Sonogong, etc.) and the Dragonball story has a lot to do with that story. <br /> <br /> By the way, as I said, this film is based on the first episodes of the Dragonball series (which was followed by Dragonball Z, although I think the American version had a different broadcasting order) . And all the scenes related to sexuality were also contained in the original cartoon series (without too much attention and so much insistence!), But because of your comments, I suppose they were completely removed in the American dubbing. <br /> <br /> However, I agree with you about the exaggeration in the film and how scarce this adaptation of the original cartoon is. But perhaps this is why nobody can forget it after seeing it ...
