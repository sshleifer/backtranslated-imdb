"The Cellar" is an unbearably boring and excessively child-friendly 80's parade of cheeses, directed by Kevin Tenney (creator of the very best films "Witchboard" and "Night of the Demons") and starring Patrick Kilpatrick's incredible talent which is supposed to depict a boy with feelings. The rhythm is very slow, the plot seems too familiar, the effects of the monsters are far from petrifying and the film opens and ends with boring narrative narratives that somehow feel alien to the real object of the film. The voiceover continues to haunt the wind and the creatures that ride the wind, but what the hell, is there no wind in the plot? Like so many horror films of the 80s, "The Cellar" deals with damn Indian landscapes and mythical monsters all too real hidden in basements and marshes. Tipping Cashen and his family move into a house built on what was once the home of Native Americans, but then the whites arrived and turned the land into oil fields. Half of the script is wasted in explaining the origin of the monster, but I can easily sum it up for you: an ancient Indian sorcerer summoned the creature (which resembles a very large paper rat) to annihilate whites overflowing earth but buried it by new because, and I quote, the SOB also kills Indians. Mance's extremely irritating son accidentally awakens the beast and naturally fails to convince his parents of the big hungry mouse in the cellar. The supposedly emotional family situation (dad constantly wants his son to love him) is very pathetic and redundant and the film desperately needed further bloodshed; films for children or not. The juvenile hero (Chris Miller) is rather annoying, but in the 1980s we certainly saw worse kid actors. "The Cellar" is not recommended unless you are a fan of cheese and typically from the 80s. The great racial rat thing is a real hoot to see.
