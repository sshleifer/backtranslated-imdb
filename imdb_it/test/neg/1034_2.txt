Some horrible weirds who had three families, all betrayed and neglected, built ugly useless buildings on which they are no longer appreciated and crumbled. His bastard Jewish son runs around interviewing casual Jewish senile people who we don't care about and shows his horrible narrative and writing skills while playing tragic piano music. This goes on for almost two boring hours and leads to nothing. <br /> <br /> All you shallow hippies who watch these stupid documentaries, eating salads and yoghurts, think that all this shit is so important. It is not. Save the whales. Nobody cares.
