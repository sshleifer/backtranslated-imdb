Since I bought the DVD, I've seen this as a sense of obligation to my wallet. <br /> <br /> The plot has Kirk Douglas as the first successful novelist who hired Laraine Day as a secretary, falls in love and marries her. There are complications. <br /> <br /> Douglas is usually considered an intense actor, given to highly dramatic roles, sometimes heroes, sometimes rats. It's not bad in this completely comic part. The problem is that the part is not particularly comical and there is nothing else. <br /> <br /> The plot turns up. A dozen "extravagant" characters come and go - the most important Keenan Wynn as a friend of Douglas who does nothing but make ironic comments. Thelma Ritter was better at this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Well, if the plot is weak, it could still have been saved by some twinkling in the dialogue, but there is no one to talk about. Some gags are stupid. Others do not cancel that bar. Here's what I thought of as a fun line. Douglas just hired Day and wants to take her to the beach and seduce her. The day is disturbed and notes that he has never heard of a writer working in a beach house. Wynn asks if she liked Douglas's previous book, "Last year's love". Yes, of course he did. "Well, most of 'Last Year's Love' was made in the beach house." Ha ha. <br /> <br /> Nice cast, including support, but a failed comedy. There have been better sitcoms on television.
