'This Life' is really bad. His cast of mercenary characters, lascivious, ruthless, duplicate, superficial is intended as a reflection on his post-eighties environment and I must admit that in this regard it is an accurate creation. Unfortunately, it leaves me nothing to sympathize with or worry about and I consider it just another step forward towards the scam premium television phone; saturated television surprisingly bad, cheap, reality and "celebrity"; and other ferocious attitudes that have destroyed this medium and, indeed, much of British society. Does it seem exaggerated? I don't think it is. In this regard programs like "This Life" have been really influential as they are often called.
