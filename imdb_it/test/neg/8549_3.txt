Despite having an absolutely horrible script (we'll talk about it later), this film is still vaguely watchable just because it has two excellent actors, Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda, as protagonists. Apart from one or two REAL skunks, I'd probably watch anything with them in the movie, since I'm a big fan of the golden age of Hollywood in the 1930s and 40s. However, no matter how much I love their films, I can't recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Fonda and Stanwyck on holiday in some ski resorts. The two haven't met yet, but the film starts noisily and hatefully with a scene in which Fonda horribly jodels while skiing. It was done in an unprecedented way and made me grind your teeth but I pulled it out - especially when Fonda fell into a bank of snow and this stopped the jodel !! In hindsight, maybe I should have turned it off right away! Fonda is put out of action in the fall and Barbara goes in search of help. Back at the ski lodge, it looks okay, but luckily she is ALSO a doctor and she has him x-rayed and restored to health. He, in turn, will become infatuated with her and propose them. Although they barely know each other, they get married and so far the film looks like a sweet but very light romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Once at home, however, not everything is rosy as he jumps back into his job as a family doctor and starts to show signs of being a controlled and potentially dangerous man because of his jealousy. The film sounds all for laughter, but frankly Fonda's behaviors were really disturbing - by spying on her and her male patients, attacking or threatening ANY man she treats, tripping a patient who already has a back injury and trampling a surprise party and insisting that everyone there (men and women) are out to steal his wife. It comes out as a combination of sociopathic and paranoid schizophrenic, but it should be all for laughter. Considering he looks like a dangerous fool, you'd think Stanwyck would ask for a cancellation along with a restraining order! But, strangely, she gets angry but can't get mad at Fonda because that's so ........? I can't think of the right word - "creepy" is all that comes to mind !!! Later, all of a sudden, the multimillionaire Fonda gets a job working at the counter in a department store. Then, through magical thinking, he and Babs seem to assume his hostility and violent jealousy is all a thing of the past - so a job seems to heal anger and suspicion. When this work falls, the film ends with Fonda buying his hospital, giving Barbara a job there and living happily ever after. They do not go further with the story, but I assume that Fonda's character spent most of his time as a hospital administrator, beating all male patients. <br /> <br /> The first part on the ski the lodge and the next one did NOT fit together well, nor the last section inspired by "Horatio Alger" in which the rich boy had adapted to the business world. They were like three separate plots, but despite this, the most serious problem with the film was its excuse to banish domestic violence and delirious jealousy! What a creepy little movie! Thankfully neither Fonda nor Stanwyck are known for this yechy movie but for all their other good films.
