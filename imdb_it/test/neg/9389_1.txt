This is the worst movie I've ever seen. At first I thought it would be nice because I was interested in the Bermuda triangle, but instead it was terrible. All he did was offer a series of limping explosions that didn't make sense (if time moves differently there, why the woman doesn't age, and her son gets old quickly), and has a horrible and mushy finish. The next time the guys who did this go to Bermuda should take all copies of this movie with them. Please, everyone votes for this movie so it can get into the worst movie list.
