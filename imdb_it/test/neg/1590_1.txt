The movie was playing on the Lifetime Movie Network last month and I decided to try it. I looked for the first 20 minutes and then turned it off b / c I'm sorry but the holes in the plot that are an integral part of a movie plot make the movie nothing but junk. <br /> <br /> The film is about a woman who accidentally runs a child on a bicycle off the road, goes out to ask for help, comes back only to find that it is called a success and runs and there is a hunt for "monster" that hurts (eventually kills) her. /> <br /> This is a film about a female in an affluent neighborhood that has 2 elementary school children and who is an active and sociable woman and yet to make this film work, it must be credible that she does not own a CELL PHONE. Sorry, but this is complete, especially when everyone seems to have one - they used their to call 911 when they found the girl lying on the side of the road - when our female protagonist left the crime scene to call 911 in some public telephone. When the female protagonist returns, the ambulance is already on the girl's side and there is talk of how horrible the person who hit her and left her is. <br /> <br /> Just DUMB. Sorry but I'm not willing to buy that this woman doesn't have a cell phone that is needed to make the movie work. Please don't insult my intelligence film, thanks. Perhaps if this had happened in 1970 or 1960, I would buy it but it is clearly a film of today (1999 at the moment). ..but wait, if he had a cellphone, there would be no movie. Pfft. <br /> <br /> The woman clearly knows the technology since she had the computers in her home, the ones the kids played with, so all the movie had to do was make her cell phone dead in the car, making the his resort in another way of calling the cops. Leaving out a cellphone has created a ridiculous plot.
