I watched this show for the first time hoping for some laughter, good acting and good plot. Unfortunately, I didn't have any of this. <br /> <br /> First of all, this show is completely unrealistic. How can someone go to a college that is fashionable, in a fantastic location and almost without rules? Plus a sushi bar. A SUSHI bar. No school has a sushi bar. And what's up with the huge ultra trendy dorms? This does not happen in the colleges! Everyone in this show seems to be perfect. Zoey, looks perfect, has perfect friends, never has to do homework, and is super popular. It looks more like a villain to me! I hate how they use so many groups in this show, Example: Dana the skater. He is completely ignorant and wears "sharp" clothes. The jokes are old and terrible! I wouldn't watch this show if I were you, it's one of the most horrible shows I've ever seen and I hope it gets canceled soon! Rating: 1/10
