I loved the original P.H. and was a little satisfied with Bloodwings (II) and Ashes to Ashes (III), then I saw part IV. Oh boy ..... As a Pumpkinghead fan, I did my best to give Part 4 as much credit as I could, but it's pretty bad. The fight for the reception of the wedding at the beginning of the film is a terrible mess for one thing. The plot of Hatfield and McCoy is incomprehensibly stupid and clich√©. How did the producers get away with using that tired family feud? Wow, unbelievable. The acting, besides Henrickson, is below average. The plot and the script are shocking. Actual editing and cinematography are average, as is directing. I mean, the film is not a total loss. As always: I really like watching Pumpkinhead, I like to see Haggis the Witch and how to look at the ghost of Harley in action. But all three characters had too much time for the screen. I thought that Haggis and Harley would end up at a dinner venue for an evening meal to eat and drink, as were the companions in his cabin. The bottom line is ... Is that I wanted all the characters in this plot launch party to be dead within 20 minutes of the start of the photo. Where does Sci-Fi come from these so-called "film production professionals"?! I could do a better job writing a cold drunken script. I'm sure there was a limited budget and everything, come on! Watch it if you're a fan of the other three, but only once. And then go back and stick to the two originals. Shame on you Sci-Fi !!!!
