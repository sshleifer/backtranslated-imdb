So pathetic isn't even funny. From the first scene of the film I knew I had been in a bad moment. Thank God I saw this movie only on TV. The plot was terrible, not to mention acting. It was horrible. Very unreal and unusual things have happened in this move like. The lady puts a whip under the door and whips the boy a little and he gives the keys. I'm like, GET REAL. The creators' attempts to create a futuristic city have even deepened my dislike for the film. To tell you the truth, the only positive thing in this film was the fight, which was quite lame in itself. All I could ask myself when watching this movie was "when it's going!"
