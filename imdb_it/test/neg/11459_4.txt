The Mummy's Curse is the latest in the Kharis mummy movie series, and it seems that the creativity has become quite dry by the time they made this film. Kharis and his partner Ananka both end up in the Louisiana bay, and at his resurrection, he looks for his beloved princess. The way they end up in Louisiana is not made clear, but with various people trying to find them, the viewer can be certain of some mummy murders. <br /> <br /> The Curse of the Mummy was watchable, but it was really nothing special. I had the feeling throughout the film that I had seen it before. Frankly, apart from the original The Mummy with Boris Karloff, the Mummy movies are not my favorite among the old Universal horrors. They are not bad, but they become a little repetitive. <br /> <br /> There are some great scenes in the film (the scene with Ananka that comes to life in the swamp for example) but overall you don't do much for me. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing if you want to be more complete and see all of Mama's films, but otherwise you may want to pass this.
