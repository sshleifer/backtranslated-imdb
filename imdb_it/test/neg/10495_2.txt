I'm giving this movie Vampire Assassins a score of "2" mainly because it had no sex or nudity. Besides that, I'm not sure why it was ever made. It was more like a training exercise on how to make a film with a very limited budget. The characters Derek and Slovak were the best actors. They were followed closely by the "biker-Dude" with Pleather pants and a silver belt. He was fine too. Most of the film was shot in a sort of distribution warehouse. If you are tired of watching the kung-fu kick boxing stunts, you can check out Scott, Windex and other cleaning products. You'll have plenty of time to do it, trust me. I almost started making a list. The dialogue and kung-fu stunts were extremely slow. They talked slowly, quarreled slowly, etc. I do not know why. At least with the extra-slow delivery of the actors' lines, you can hear everything very distinctly. I'm trying to find good things to say about this movie. We saw it to the end to see if it had improved, but it wasn't. We could never decide if the actors really knew martial arts or if they simply acted as if they knew martial arts. You can watch yourself and decide. My favorite phrase was something like (the vampire spoke) "what are you looking at?" the other responds: "your bad dental work".
