I am not bothered by the squalid hosts, nor am I bothered by the cynical, hypocritical position that the creators of this shit take. <br /> <br /> What worries me is that the vast majority of episodes are fake. I wouldn't even be surprised if ALL the episodes were staged. So this is not a reality show but something much worse even than Oprah: trash television with zero point zero appeal. Like the TV daily soap opera, but with more action, fighting and less plot. <br /> <br /> The premise would have been great, if only it had been performed without deceiving the viewer. If only this idea were free from all the legal complications / trappings that would surely be achieved because of what would happen with real people and what will eventually be transmitted. Hence the only way to create this "" "reality show" "" was to get pretty desperate actors and make them improvise (and what pitiful and unconvincing improvisation is most of the time!). Shouldn't it be obvious to anyone who has finished elementary school? Most of the reviews I have read here do not even say that this is false, let alone that this could be. Thought or simply naivety without limits? <br /> <br /> The actors hired in this pathetic show are the kind of unemployed actors from the bottom to the barrel who are miserably waiting on the tables, impatiently waiting for a call from a talk show (or this shit), which is when finally they have the chance to make several hundred dollars. I also recognized an actress (in the role of "cheat") that I saw years before in "The Jerry Springer Show". And I've only seen 6-7 episodes of "Cheaters". How many more of these losing actors have appeared in Springer and "Cheaters" that I don't even know about? <br /> <br /> However, comparing "Cheaters" with Springer is not right for the latter. The Springer show is not all fake; most of the episodes have not been published, so they are often very funny. There is no value to be found in "Cheaters", unless you are a struggling actor and wish to receive advice on how NOT to act in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> The producers use various (very cheap transparent) to create the illusion of reality, to give the film that elusive documentary feeling. But it's all in the mood. In the end, the smartest viewer looking for the wreck of the train was absolutely squat. "Professional wrestling" has more credibility than this.
