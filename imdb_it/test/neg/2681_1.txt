Taste is a subjective thing. Two people can watch the same movie with one of them who loves it and the other hates it. As for 'Halloween: the curse of Michael Myers' I quote in this last category. <br /> <br /> I am of the opinion that John Carpenter, in 1978, made one of the most beautiful films of that decade, despite its flaws, still holds up well in the 21st century. He reused many of the old horror devices but used them in original and effective ways. He made no claim that it was anything other than a movie about a sick patient escaped from babysitting on Halloween night. Yet there were "ideas" in the film, but they were subtly introduced and not hammered into your skull. He approached the myths of the macabre festival with the reality of what was happening in history and did so with a wonderful ambiguity. <br /> <br /> The "directors" of this "movie" probably don't even understand that previous paragraph. That's why we saddled ourselves with this miserable and inept piece of disposable celluloid. The direction, the script, the acting are the lowest levels imaginable. This is the kind of film that is so darkly numb from the mind and nausea that makes you want to crawl back into the womb and die. It's also really, really sad to see veteran British actor Donald Pleasence wasting his acting skills with this saliva potion of a movie. He seems drained of all his energy and resigned to the fact that this could be his last film. Maybe that's what killed him.
