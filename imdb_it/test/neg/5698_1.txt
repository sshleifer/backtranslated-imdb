I'm surprised someone actually thinks they are spending money on a movie like this. Really. Let us forget for a moment that the plot does not even give a hint of originality ... Most films of today are based on stories from other films, so a "simple" lack of originality is not a big problem. <br /> <br /> But I can't believe that any of the guys involved in the movie never got on a plane before shooting this movie. Because, let's be honest, that would be the only excuse to invent something so ridiculous. To be honest I think a 6-year-old with a fake camera could have invented something technically much more credible. Some examples that follow. <br /> <br /> The scene that really drove me crazy is when the engines shut down when they regain control of the plane. When they have to switch them back on, the guy on the radio says "Ok, press buttons 1 and 2 on the dashboard". Now, those are not pulsating. They should not be pushed, they should actually be pulled up and towards the pilot. This is something that only an insider would know, you say? Mistaken. In the next scene you can see their fingers pressing the "buttons" ... And of course the so-called "buttons" don't move at all! Not even a millimeter! (And note that I didn't even mention the fact that the engines of the planes are not like the engine of cars, that just turning the key and the magic happens ... You have to do a complicated enough procedure to turn them on ...) Come on guys ! You may have simulated the movements at least !! Not to mention the exhilarating final effect, in which the plane crashes against every single thing along the track (Poles of light along the track? What are they thinking ?!) ... And the wings are not even torn away! It happened to me once ... Except that the plane was made of Lego! And the flight attendant? He is so skilled that he knows exactly where the "aux 1" and "aux 2" fuses are, in the middle of the cables behind the cockpit. So should we mention the guy who can drive an ambulance and fly a plane behind the ambulance using his computer? And how did you turn on the other aircraft engines? <br /> <br /> Really, I could spend hours with this stuff. This is the stupidest movie I've ever seen, and I'm including garbage like Alone In The Dark and other things on the list. Do you want to do yourself a favor? Don't watch it
