This is really a bad movie. However it is nice to laugh at the horrible ideas and "special" effects. The plot focuses on a European space agency that discovers a tenth planet that directly orbits the Earth. They send a managed mission (have they been to Mars and have yet to discover this planet? Is someone so stupid to fall for this?) On the planet and you can believe it, it's the mirror image of the planet they come from. Almost everything is predictable from that point. Honestly from the title of the movie you can guess pretty much everything. The only surprising thing here is a space program run by Eurpoeans :) There can be no excuse for the concept or the execution of the plot. So it's good for a laugh or maybe if you're in an altered state of consciousness.
