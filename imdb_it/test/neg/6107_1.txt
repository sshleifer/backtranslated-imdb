The film is a gross misrepresentation of the Orthodox lifestyle and practice. Never a Jewish court will enforce divorce between childless couples. Although the concept exists in Jewish law, the conditions are too numerous to actually take place. Childless couples find it difficult to face their absence of children in a community where children are a very important part of life, but nowhere are they "rejected" by their community as depicted in the film. They are treated with extreme sensitivity. In fact, many great rabbis lived their entire lives without children and never considered divorce. <br /> <br /> The depiction of Yosef, a horrible human being, aims - perhaps in the subconscious - to show the behavior of a typical Orthodox male. In fact, it is typical how violent rapist of a drunkard is typical of secular society. Both exist in their worlds and both are contemptible. <br /> <br /> It is surprising that so many people form their opinions about a company based on a FILM (from someone who is personally biased against a community). I have always thought that only the Orthodox, due to their restricted mentality and insular lifestyle, judge all the laity on the basis of the violence and the immoral conduct of which the newspapers read or watch in the movies.
