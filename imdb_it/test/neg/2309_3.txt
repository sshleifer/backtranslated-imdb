To anticipate my observations on the film, I know the subject is horrendous and the words cannot adequately express the compassion that a decent person would have for the people who deal with the postatic horrors of an atomic bomb dropped near them. <br /> <br /> However, this film does not deal very horribly except for the first 10 minutes. Some of the images are horrible and should remember how it can produce the devastation of nuclear weapons. See burned people who are aimlessly running or the man who combs his hair, the tufts of hair coming out, etc., It's not a pretty sight. <br /> <br /> But after the first dozen minutes, this Japanese film is about people dealing with the consequences of Hiroshima between the mid and late 1940s. Actually I found the story developing quickly into a boring soap opera. <br /> <br /> Almost the whole story happens five years after the bomb and deals mainly with the problems of a family at that point. This is why it has become more of a melodrama than some upsetting story of nuclear disaster. Is it simply a story about how these people started living their lives around 1950, if one of the women was permanently damaged and if so, should she marry? <br /> <br /> This may have been a real impact movie but it didn't go that way
