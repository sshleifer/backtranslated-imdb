This story starts at the end! So the film's headlines advise us. Unfortunately it is not true, since we were treated for about 70 minutes in a typical science fiction B movie of the 50s. The story is sad; the plot is very weak and was clearly filmed on a low budget, as often happened in those days. <br /> <br /> History could have covered up any situation where people took refuge in an isolated house threatened by someone outside. has just been adapted to fit a science fiction story. <br /> <br /> The scenario consisted of some rocks, bushes and smoke. - Oh yes, there was also a pool of water. Someone was wearing a rubber mask with a beak face and those that looked like feathers. <br /> <br /> Written by Lou Rusoff, who wrote several science fiction stories during that time including The She Creature and It Conquered The World. The filming was completed within a few days, not allowing the actors time to develop their characters in a better way. Limited budget restrictions have also prevented this film from reaching its potential. It could have been a much better film than it was. <br /> <br /> Mike Connors and Richard Denning brought some life to the film, but even they could not raise this film in the category in which it could be said - "I liked that movie" The career of Richard Denning's actor started in 1937. He starred with Gregory Peck and Deborah Kerr in An Affair to Remember and later became more famous on television in the Hawaii Five-O and The Flying Doctor series. <br /> <br /> Directed by Roger Corman who has many films to his credit both as a director and as a producer. He has made some good films and is still making them. He became famous for directing films based on the stories of Edgar Allan Poe, often played by Vincent Price. He has also made other low-budget films; some were good and fun for one reason or another, and most were much better than this. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone. <br /> <br /> Darnmay <br /> <br /> 10 September 2007
