Neal N Nikki is voted for the worst films of the year by Planetbollywood. It's hard to believe that the famous Chopra produced this lousy movie. It was presented as a film for the family, but turns out to be a ridiculous sexual comedy. Nor does it make you laugh, but you cry with boredom and don't even have sexy girls to make the movie sexy. The title song is the most annoying song of the decade, I'm the Neil, I'm the man, rock star superstar. Uday Chopra is one of the worst Bollywood actors ever, without acting talent. After doing a lot of Superflops, and not having received films from a producer rather than from his family. It gives a total shitty performance, which bores you to death. Tanisha, who is and always will be known as Kajol's sister, makes a tremendous performance. Both actors have the most annoying chemistry and are very immature for their age. It has a special aspect of the cute Richa Pollad, in a pathetic role. The ending was so stupid and stupid, I can't believe I paid money to rent this shit.
