This film was beyond terrible, it was a pimple on the a * s of the film industry. I know that each film cannot be a hit or even a media issue, but the responsible parties who came together for this epic disaster should have been able to see that they had a time bomb on their hands. I can't help thinking that the cast would gather between the scenes and will consolidate each other to be in a huge pile of manure. Can I hear it now, "Are you getting" paid? "" No, you? "I understand that this film was more than likely on a shoe string budget, but even taking this into account, it would have been better anyway. Wait for a monster / creature to appear and when you finally see it "It's a big yawn. I'm so mad at myself for spending a 1.07 on this stink !!!"
