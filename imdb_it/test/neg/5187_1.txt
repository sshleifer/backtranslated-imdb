I imagine that if you like the snow board you could enjoy some fun looking at some beautiful landscapes and some tricks. but that's all the film has to offer. the plot is non-existent, and any joke that may have been in the film was not fun, even in terms of understanding. Also I didn't like the characters, the main actor (Adam Grimes) did his best, and for a comedy like this that shouldn't have been much, but when surrounded by so many other bad actors he had no hope of making this movie good . but I shouldn't be too strict with them, because I know they could have great skill, but with a script that I could have written in ten minutes, their skills were handled and hidden for fear of appearing in this film. my advice is not to watch it, I wish I'd never done it!
