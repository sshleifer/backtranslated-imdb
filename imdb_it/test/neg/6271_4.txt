One of my favorite "bum" actors, C. Tom Howell, is the star of this lukewarm WOTW remake. He runs a lot, while a CGI-like spider-like car goes around killing everyone. The budget for this was obviously quite low. It was also one of the productions of The Asylum. Did you see any of those? Yikes! I'm not sure why anyone would have done it while the big budget Spielberg version was killing them at the box office. And if the truth is told, neither version is so exciting. George Pal's version of the 1950s remains the best representation of the novel by H.G. Wells, primitive and all-around special effects. Perhaps because Gene Barry was much more convincing in Howell's or Tom Cruise's guidance.
