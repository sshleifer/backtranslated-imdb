Yes, of course, his film already looked horrible and not very promising, but the premise and the cast seemed good, so I still expected to be entertained by this movie. This was unfortunately not the case. The premise is good, but the plot is full of improbability and is logically imperfect. <br /> <br /> This movie is potentially thrown into the toilet. The main plot is interesting and quite original. It's okay to make a good adventurous movie, you would think. But this film fails to entertain and I think this is the biggest flaw in the film. Maybe he takes himself too seriously and a little more humor wouldn't have hurt the film. But now it is nothing more than a flashy and inexpensive film, full of one unlikely event after another, which also steals a little too much from other more successful films. Especially "Jurassic Park", of course. <br /> <br /> The characters do not help make the movie more compelling or at least interesting to watch. I still think that Edward Burns did a pretty decent job as the main heroic hero. But the rest of the characters are really confused in the film and it becomes very uninteresting to do. The film is based rather on its visual aspect, which are extremely poor. Catherine McCormack also has a very irritating character. Basically all his character does is complain and talk about how right it was and the rest is so wrong. His character is not nice. And the rest of the characters ... well, I've already forgotten their names, I think this is saying enough about them. Certainly it is true even if the performance of Ben Kingsley alone makes this film worth seeing. He is really excellent in his role as a bad businessman, but from the moment he disappears from the film the film goes down really fast. <br /> <br /> Visually the film is extremely poor. It has some terrible-looking CGI effects and you can't even get the simpler "blue screen" effects convincing in the film. The sets are also terrible and cheap, as if they could fall and break down every moment. <br /> <br /> The film never becomes tense, exciting or adventurous since the story is brought in the least interesting and engaging way possible. It is a film very far away with faraway characters that it fails to impress. There are a lot of action sequences, but all of them are so ridiculous and believable that they never get tense or brave. <br /> <br /> So in practice this film lacks all that is needed to make a genre the film like this is good and successful. It is sad to see how the bass director Peter Hyams sank in the last two years, having made some good films in the 70s and 80s. <br /> <br /> 4/10
