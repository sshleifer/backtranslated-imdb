"Scarecrow Gone Wild: it's the death of the party!" Do I have to say anything else? The crazed scarecrow took four out of ten stars for a simple reason: apart from the terrible acting, the holes in the plot, the cheap special effects and the anti-climatic whistle, it was the gold of cinema! I think this movie could have been really good, if the scarecrow turned out to be the baseball coach (as played by the always so brilliant Ken Shamrock). But then again, they would have to cut those AMAZING special effects of "Return of the Jedi" electricity. <br /> <br /> As we watched this film, my friends and I were convinced that it was written by one of our friends, a stereotypical teenage boy. This film has topless women, miserable gores and dialogues that could not have come out of a paper bag or, in this case, from a cornfield. <br /> <br /> If you could ask the director one thing, it would be this; "How much did you have to pay the teenager who wrote this for you?"
