Oscar-winning actor Sidney Poitier of "Lilies of the Field" takes up the role of Lieutenant Virgil Tibbs in the 1967 Academy Award-winning Best Picture "The Heat of the Night" for the tired and uninspired sequel to veteran Gordon Douglas " They Call Me MISTER Tibbs "" with none the equivalent of Rod Steiger with whom to exchange the dialogue. Clearly, both "Bullitt" screenwriter Alan R. Trustman and Robert D. Webb of "Cape Fear" were out of the game when they wrote this predictable procedural police action: dialogue is sad and none of the characters is interesting, not even the main suspect, absolutely nothing remotely exciting, full of suspense or surprising occurs in this domesticated clan. Meanwhile, things have changed considerably since Virgil was last seen in "In the heat of the night". He worked as a homicide detective for the Philadelphia Police Department in Pennsylvania. MISTER Tibbs "hand, our hero works for the San Francisco police department. In addition, he has a wife, Valerie (Barbara McNair of "Change of Habit"), and a family, a young rebel son, Andy (George Spell of "The Naked Kiss"), and a younger daughter, Ginger (Wanda Spell of "Hickey and Boggs"). Tibbs drives an average blue Mustang and his wife keeps at home and hovers on their two children, since she doesn't have time to spend time with them. Literally, there are no surprises in this mystery of pedestrian murder. In fact, the best thing about "They Call Me MISTER Tibbs" is the extraordinary orchestral soundtrack by Quincy Jones with a memorable opening theme, more memorable than this memorable crime thriller deserved. <br /> <br /> It all starts sensibly with a prostitute fight, Joy Sturges (Linda Towne of "The Adventurers"), who was beaten to death in the bedroom of her downtown apartment by an invisible attacker. The handyman apartment Mealie Williamson (Juano Hernandez of "Intruder in the Dust") enters Joy's apartment and finds it spread on the dead carpet with a bloody forehead. He picks up the statue briefly and then puts it back on the floor and reports Joy's death to the apartment superintendent, Rice Weedon (Anthony Zerbe of "License to Kill"), and Weedon gives Mealie and a handful of dollars and sends him to luggage . Later, Weedon anonymously informs the SFPD that the popular minister Logan Sharpe (Martin Landau of "Nevada Smith") beat Joy to death and seemed to leave Joy's apartment. Captain Marden (Jeff Corey of "True Grit") assigns Tibbs the task of managing the case; it seems that both Tibbs and Sharpe have known each other for 18 years. Of course, Tibbs' wife, Valerie, cannot believe that the notorious politically active evangelist could have committed such a crime. Just to give the context of the film, it should be noted that when Tibbs and the police study the crime scene, they mention the word "seed", undoubtedly a controversial term to mention in a film from the 1970s. <br /> <br /> Tibbs questions Weedon, who suspects he is a drug dealer or a pimp. Weedon explains that he has no record of Joy Sturges because he was subletting the apartment from another real estate company. Tibbs visits the company and real estate agent Woody Garfield (Ed Anser of "JFK") escapes and leaves, essentially doing an O.J. Simpson until he crashes into his car after a long but unrelenting search. When Tibbs shows that Woody did not kill Joy, he allows him to leave, with his unsatisfied wife, Marge ("Penelope's Norma Crane"), ready to file a divorce application after the revelation that she paid a prostitute to stay in an apartment. <br /> <br /> Tibbs tracks down the handyman Mealie and clears him of the crime, and then follows Weedon. Fortunately, for Tibbs, our hero captures the evil Weedon in the middle of a narcotics transaction. One of Weedon's henchmen assails Tibbs, but Tibbs dispenses him briefly before embarking on a long hunt after Weedon. Finally, he puts Weedon in an underground garage and they shoot out. Guess who wins. <br /> <br /> The scenes in Tibbs' house are more interesting than his investigation. Andy runs rampant, hits his sister and smokes in the garden. Our hero wants me to clean his room. When Andy refuses, Tibbs blows him three times in the jaw. Probably these child education scenes could never be managed today as they were in 1970. At the end of the film, as if to consolidate the family sequence, Tibbs is seen leaving with his wife and children. There is a clash between Valerie and Virgil on the welfare of their children and how their long hours of work influenced them. <br /> <br /> Director Gordon Douglas leads competently. Surprisingly, for a film released in 1970, the directors never played the race card. In one scene, when Tibbs looks for a billiard room owned by an African American, we see a mixed race of races frowning at the hero when he finds Mealie and leaves with him in tow. <br /> <br /> Overall, "They call me MISTER Tibbs" is a poor sequel to "In the heat of the night". Mind you, Poitier offers another nice performance with nuances, but everything looks prefabricated. All the sets look fake and there's not much physical violence: an underground parking lot that's fired that doesn't last long and a fight. The soundtrack of Beyond Jones, the only surprise, and does not really qualify as a major surprise, more like a comfortable device that is the ending. "The Organization" by Donald Medford followed "They Call Me MISTER Tibbs" as the second action-packed sequel.
