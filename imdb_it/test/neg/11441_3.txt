Not as bad as "Nails" from 1992 (where Hopper plays an "unstable" cop) but rather ugly. How can a film with such an exceptional cast go so badly? This film manages to find a way. The story was pretty stupid and Hopper's management seemed never to have directed before. All the long shots were annoying at first. Lots of meaningless scenes with a lot of meaningless dialogue.
