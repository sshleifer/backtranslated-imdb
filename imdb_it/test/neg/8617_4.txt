There is a good story well hidden and never really used! <br /> <br /> The film is short and too dependent on action and thematic photography; somehow, the development of the character and the story have been forgotten. What remains is confused and superficial. <br /> <br /> Turn off your brain and note that you will probably find that time flows fast enough, but unless you are the kind of person who finds deep and meaningful soaps, you won't get any real satisfaction from this movie. <br /> <br /> Look only if you have nothing better to do and only if someone else pays for the video.
