Don't tell me this movie was funny or a little weird. It was a complete disaster and one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Ali G is fun only on Channel 4's Ali G Show. After seeing his performance, all I can say is it's not for movies. With a Daft script, or more like no storyline, there's nothing to keep you entertained. Full of annoying and unrealistic character, this film is a complete garbage to the end. At the end of the film, Ali G makes a speech. Mention, if you hated this movie, tell people that it was good. Even the speech could not save the film, he probably knew it would be a stinker. I would like to give a 0/10, but the minimum start is 1. Overall, don't waste your time with this garbage either.
