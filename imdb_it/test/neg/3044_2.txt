This is pretty much all I can say about this flat and uninspired remake of the 1979 Carol Kane vehicle. Camilla Belle is not a great actress and does not bring energy and vitality to the role of Jill Johnson, the babysitter harassed by an anonymous caller. <br /> <br /> But if you're looking for something great home architecture and interior design ideas, this movie offers more inspiration than anything you'll see on TLC or HGTV. Jill spends about 90 minutes wandering around the house of the wealthy doctor and wife for whom she is providing her sitting services, looking for the origin of strange sounds and things that continue to "stir up" in the night. As he wanders around the corners and scans the corridors, we see a beautiful master bathroom with its sinks that look like Roman basins, a huge kitchen with incredible backlit glass shelves and the showpiece, a self-sufficient aviary and the pond that has a self-irrigation system. <br /> <br /> Because the film is not compelling enough to drag us into Jill's fear, we are distracted by the grandeur of the house, which is not something you should do while watching a thriller. Although Jill is chased by the faceless maniac, we shudder because she is breaking valuables and ruining the pond, not because she is going to be killed. <br /> <br /> The film limps as predictably as most teen slasher movies and the ending is anything but original. When it was over, I just wanted to find out where that house was and if it was real. Not bad for Jill and the children she was babysitting. <br /> <br /> 2 stars - both for the house.
