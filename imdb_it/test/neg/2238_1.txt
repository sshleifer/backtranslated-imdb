Bastards without Glory It's the worst Tarantino movie I've ever made. It is full of its usual ingredient, that is of a snappy dialogue, of brutal and sudden violence, but everything looks like a deja-vu. The direction is typical of Tarantino and nothing seems completely new. It's almost as if it was copied exactly from his only masterpiece, Pulp Fiction. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new or exciting in Inglourious Basterds to be honest, it's just a war drama that is not fun, nor is it as brilliant as Pulp Fiction. Basterds is supposed to be Tarantino's tribute to the spouses of western lion, but he seems a little crazy and out of place, especially with the continuous use of large subtitles and the audience is in the balance.
