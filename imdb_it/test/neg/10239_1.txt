I have seen several theatrical and film adaptations of Alice in Wonderland and this must take the dessert as the absolute worst. My family bought the DVD in an unsuspecting way and failed to pass the first half. Later I turned back and forced myself to see everything (it was a Christmas present for me) and I was just horrified. <br /> <br /> The only saving factor (and hardly redeeming enough to save the entire show) Mark Lin-Baker plays the Mock Turtle with a Yiddish accent. It is one of the few moments in the piece that has a certain charm and can be taken a little seriously. Apart from that, the songs are half songs, the melodies are half melodies and even Meryl Streep can't make this director look good.
