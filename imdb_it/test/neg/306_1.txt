"Fat Girls" is one of the worst indie gay movies. <br /> <br /> The premise is promising: a medium-looking gay teenager is trapped in a small repressive city in Texas. His only kindred spirits are the other misfits of the village: the classy "fat girl", a naive immigrant from Cuba and the sensitive acting teacher. So far, interesting. In theory, this plot creates a decent configuration for a fascinating story of arrival with a built-in audience --- the thousands of gays who grew up in small cities across America and experienced this adolescent first-hand anxiety, spiced with a dose of self-deprecating humor. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, rather than a nuanced drama, Ash Christian tackles his autobiographical subject with a poorly executed attempt at irony and dark humor. The result is a cast of improbable, derivative, two-dimensional characters that the viewer cannot help but feel indifferent. Sabrina (Fink) is a quasi-Gothic gazer rider. He is such a pungent and unpleasant person; there is no doubt about the reason for his condition without friends. The chemistry between her and Rodney (Christian) clears. This may have been a bad casting, but it's more likely due to a script that is simply unsalvable. As a result, he is left to wonder when there is such a non-existent bond, what could justify their almost constant company throughout history. <br /> <br /> Sabrina's new boyfriend, Rudy (de Jesus), and Rodney's mother Judy (Theaker) is among the most exaggerated of the cliché series characters torn from dozens of other films. Rudy is a submissive and horny immigrant / nerd, directly raised by every teenage and vulgar "comedy" that has ever been made in the realm of television or cinema. Judy is the reborn obsessed with Jesus' speech and big hair. Just when you thought that Tammy Faye's thing was done to death, Christian inserts a scene where Judy's mascara runs with her tears! Is there anyone in the civilized world who may think that this tired old stereotype is still fun after seeing it nausea for 20 years? <br /> <br /> In addition to the failed attempts of sardonic humor, there are many disconcerting inconsistencies in the story. Rodney considers himself an "ugly fat" loser. However, at the same time, he manages to attend occasional and regular impromptu meetings with the ubiquitous school jock, Ted (Miller). Although these relationships are devoid of emotional satisfaction, most gay boys (full of rabid testosterone, just like their straight brothers) would see that this is a rather enviable agreement given the more common alternative of involuntary celibacy. <br /> <br /> Rodney finds an object for his affection in Bobby (Bruening), an exotic transplant from England. Against all credible odds, the boy not only happens to land in this small TX village, but he is conveniently openly gay. Like Sabrina, Bobby is a jealous, angry, furious aleck and the viewer is left to scratch his head for his magnetic charm. <br /> <br /> To his delight, Rodney is invited by his new crush to the city's gay bar, where Bobby claims to be the DJ. Upon arrival, the future boyfriend immediately leaves Rodney alone and heads for another area of ​​the bar for a quick meeting with a rather handsome young man. This is still one of the ridiculously inexplicable plot elements since Rodney's feelings as an outcast are presumably derived largely from his solitary existence in a parish city. Tiny like the city, do they have openly gay high school students? A secretly bisexual soccer captain? Lesbian moms? A gay teacher? and has a gay bar in the center (frequented by attractive men, not less)? Apparently, the place is not so backward. <br /> <br /> Ten years earlier, "Edge of Seventeen" by Todd Stephens covered almost the same material with a much more creative, honest, touching and humorous film.
