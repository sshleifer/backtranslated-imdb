THEIR PURPLE MOMENT <br /> <br /> Format: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: Dumbledore <br /> <br /> (Black and white - Short film) <br /> <br /> Two unfortunate nightclubs (Laurel and Hardy) are unable to pay the bill, causing violent pay from a warm waiter (Tiny Sandford). <br /> <br /> Scenario L & H typical, less substantial than some of their best work of this period, but still worth a look. Stan takes center stage this time, caught in a financial dilemma after holding back part of his pay to finance a night on the town, only to find out - too late! - that his injured wife (Fay Holderness) has replaced his escort with worthless coupons. Some of Laurel's prolonged close-ups, while slowly realizing the disaster that is unfolding, reveal his genius for characterization and mimicry. The morality of the 1920s is represented by Patsy O'Byrne, who performs in an ax-faced body that feels great joy in alerting the respective spouses of L & H (Holderness and Lyle Taho) towards bad behavior of their husbands. The ending fades, but the film still has a lot to recommend. Directed by James Parrott.
