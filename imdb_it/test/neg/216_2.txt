How do you get a cast of experienced and famous actors and put together such a stupid movie? Nimrod Antel has the answer: armored. Six colleagues from an armored car decide to steal a large shipment of money. But as soon as they arrive at the first base with their plans, everything unravels quickly. With a story like this, you'd think it couldn't be too bad, at least for an action movie. However, in the first 40 minutes or more of this film we see what appear to be 6 normal everyday types. They joke, laugh, drink a few drinks together, etc. Then, suddenly, we learn that they are planning to rob their business. The hero Ty, (Columbus Short), is sucked into the scheme due to the cold and cruel world, even though he is a decorated veteran, a good boy and a reliable employee. Oh my, oh my! Then in the last 40 minutes of the film, these normal former boys almost all turn into money-hungry psychopaths, willing to slaughter each other for money. In the latest scenes Mike, (Matt Dillon), goes on a suicidal rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend. The viewer has no hint before this ending that these men are ruthless and bloodthirsty. It's absolutely amazing and "B movie" is almost too nice for this kind of storyline. I would say not to waste your time - it's a pity that no one has given the same advice to Laurence Fishburne, Jean Reno or Fred Ward before taking this picture.
