Do I have to say anything else? The reason why the good Australian version of Kath and Kim was, as mentioned, good, was for its hilarious and funny originality. The reason why this new American version is so terrible is because a lot is taken directly from the original. Not to mention the infidelity to the characters. Kath is thought to be a dag. Kim is destined to be fat. Kel (or Phil as they nicknamed him) is thought to be pathetic. Brett (or Craig) is destined to be a loser, not a person who acts as if he were on heroin and ends every sentence with "friend". Thanks to God, Szubanski didn't sell his rights to Sharon, he'll probably end up being a tall, thin blonde who likes Kim. <br /> <br /> Kath and Kim are MOTHER AND DAUGHTER. They are not meant to look after 2 years. And they are not meant to giggle like school girls. This show is also a misfortune to share the same title as the Australian version. America: get your TV shows.
