A remake can be successful. An adaptation can be successful. It is not relevant whether it is a remake or an adaptation. <br /> <br /> A good movie is a good movie and a poor movie is a poor film, regardless. <br /> <br /> Sarkar, I fear, was a very poor film. First of all, only by making the characters appear dangerous, or macho, do they bring an aura about them. <br /> <br /> What was so brilliant about Nagre (Amitabh Bacchan's character) that we should have been in the aura of his "power" and what showed the character's "benevolence"? Nothing. <br /> <br /> This was said by a commentator and Amitabh continued to give facial expressions. Now Amitabh can give brilliant facial expressions, but because it should mean anything if there is no history or story to accompany it. <br /> <br /> There was no real characterization of the characters who also worked with "sarkar". Just because a man had glasses, why should we assume he's wise. The flow of the film was generally boring because the Godfather's scenes were created (like the policeman slapping Abhishek Bacchan), the older brother killed by Abhishek (as Fredo was killed on Pacino's instructions), but he tried too hard to be packed in films with too little history and depth to go with it. This was really the problem. <br /> <br /> If you try to pack 3 hours of intricate details like a Godfather in 2 hours and even with a few dialogues, what you get is a light show from a cricket match, never making the full impact by watching a complete match will do.
