This was the first Chan movie made by Monogram. What a result of Fox values ​​and standards! I was shocked when I saw my first Monogram after seeing the great Fox movies. This is boring and uninspired by the wild music that plays as Chan walks quietly across the street. Chan is now working for the US secret service rather than the Honolulu police department. He is assisted by Benson Fong, who plays the number 3 of Son Tommy for the first time. He also has a daughter, Iris Chan, played by Marianne Quon. Mantan Moreland also makes his debut as Birmingham Brown. He's a taxi driver in Washington, DC, here, rather than Chan's next driver in later films.
