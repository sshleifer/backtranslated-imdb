I saw the episode about living with the minimum wage. He went until the appearance of Oprah Winfrey for the aforementioned episode. It's bad enough that people struggle to make ends meet week after week. So have this hypocrisy by exploiting the problem. I didn't appreciate the constant complaining from him or his significant other, in everything. Is this how people have the power to pay their medical expenses from the emergency room? of course he shows that the account is high, but he paid the remaining balance (from his pocket) after his "excruciating" experience. How many poor people have that kind of privilege after 30 days to pay their bills. Instead they are starving and "rob Peter of paying Paul". Complaining during the episode is not a humiliating thing for him. The movie and restaurant scene is scary. Another privilege that the poor don't have.
