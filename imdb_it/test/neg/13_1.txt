An obvious vanity print for Julie in her first film with Blake. Let's see. Where we start She is a traitor during a world war; she redeems him by falling in love; his friends (who are presumably patriots because they are German citizens) are expendable and must die; and she ends up like a heroine. OK. The scenes with the drunk driver and the clowns who work for French intelligence cannot even be described, and we will not even mention Rock's romantic scenes with a female. (By the way, when they visit a museum, look at his eyes - I make it on video and it's priceless). Is it a farce or is it a romantic classic or is it a war movie? I don't know and neither will you.
