Robert Lansing plays a scientist who experiments with objects that pass through solid matter, but goes too far one night and involuntarily turns into four dimensions! The fantasy of the atomic age is quite fascinating in a very poor way. Perhaps he was considered a thoughtful sci-fi in his time (with psychological nuances), but seen today the film is slightly overbaked and naive; is a tailor-made festival for the late TV show. The wooden performances of Lansing and Lee Meriwether are hardly worth a one-dimensional thing, although Patty Duke (playing a cute little brat pre "Miracle Worker") gets a colorful and memorable output. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
