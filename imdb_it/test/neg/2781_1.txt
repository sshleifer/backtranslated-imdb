Another stupid "movie". The image quality is correct. Even the sound. Music is at the center The boy tries to make music like on Halloween. <br /> <br /> For once rare, the producer / director chooses non-anorexic girls. It is because this "movie" takes a week and costs $ 10,000. Does that mean that when producers have money, they choose all the anorexic girls? Good question. <br /> <br /> But the girls in this "movie" are physically correct. But I'm not a good actress. Not even boys. But perhaps it is only because the "history" of this "film" has no value. I'm sure we give $ 10,000 to some teenagers who love the movie, and can make a better movie. <Br /> <br /> Don't waste time looking at this "thing".
