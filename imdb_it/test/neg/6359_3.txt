Unfortunately, this film is not very good. Does it really matter? We all know the basics of the story and this has nothing new. But I love low budget horror classics and ski fields ... so I lose it. About the only thing that anyone remembers about this movie, is that that little Leonardo DiCaprio made his debut in it. <br /> <br /> He did well. The part didn't require great acting skills, and the director probably never gave him the chance to supply one anyway ... The little Leonardo DiCaprio was very nice ... and also the girl. The movie is fun, if you like horror and sci-fi classics and you have experience watching them.
