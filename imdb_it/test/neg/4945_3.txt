I'm watching this movie as I write this. It's about 45 minutes into the movie and there have been so many back and forth and empty dramas, I don't really see where it's going. No facts, just enough to let you make assumptions. The acting of the main daughter is painful. Why was this done ??? Not the best of Lifetime movies.
