After his romantic starring career ended in the late 1960s, Rock Hudson starred in many different projects, including TV shows and minor films. However, I believe "Embryo" is his only breakthrough as a mad scientist, and it's probably a good thing. I guess he needed the job. <br /> <br /> Driving along a dark and stormy night, the brilliant Dr. Paul Holliston (Hudson) hits and injures a Doberman, who reports in his lab (which looks a bit like a basement basement in the Midwest). So he can lift the unborn puppy of the dog outside the womb, so naturally he decides to do the same thing with a human being. He raises Victoria (the beautiful Barbara Carrera) in the same way from a fetus. Victoria grows at an amazing pace and soon blossoms into a beautiful young woman. <br /> <br /> Predictably, things are very bad. After the resounding start, Holliston's sister-in-law, Martha (Diane Ladd), begins to wonder where the young woman comes from, and Victoria herself begins to show signs of instability and violence. The final sequence is a long car chase of "Smokey and the Bandit", after which Victoria ?? who scandalously aged in a few minutes ?? is attacked by a frantic Holliston, who tries in vain to destroy his malformed creation along with his unborn child. All this is accompanied by squeaky tires, roaring engines, a car fire and lots of sirens. The limping end of a group of paramedics working frantically on Victoria while Holliston writhes in regret is more tiring than disturbing. <br /> <br /> Although it was just released in 1976, this film is very dated. The only difference between this and many films of the mad scientists of the 1940s is that Hudson plays the lead role rather than Boris Karloff. The sets are quite cheap and very old-fashioned for today's audience, as long as Hudson's Reel-to-reel reel-recorder is the size of a refrigerator. Much of the action takes place in a poorly lit laboratory. Hudson slumbers through his sordid role, giving the impression of really being a movie star, while Ladd and Carrera are much more believable. Surprisingly, Roddy McDowall appears briefly as a chess player. <br /> <br /> The Passport Video transfer is very poor, as if it were made from a poor VHS copy using the home equipment. If you are nostalgic for 1976, look this time just to say you did it. Otherwise, watch a football game or a soap opera instead.
