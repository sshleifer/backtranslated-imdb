This must be the worst show I've ever seen. I've always liked Chuck Norris in Films, but because we need to make these shows politically correct by adding a black side kick that is threatening like Shirley Temple in Little Miss Marker. I also thought the show was limited because how many times you can kick a guy in the face and make it interesting. I know an African American who looks like this Trivette and gets his ass kicked once a week is all about attitude. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris is the man and he deserves all the compliments he gets, I think this show started off great but lost steam over time. <br /> <br /> They should have downloaded the side kick from Chucks
