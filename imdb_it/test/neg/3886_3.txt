With Knightly and O'Tool as protagonists, this film had a good chance, and with McCallum as the villain after Knightly, maybe a little tension. But they threw everything away in evening nonsense and then later with remnants of maudlin's war. Obviously it was totally superficial, beautiful English countryside and sea or not. The number one mistake was downloading Knightly so early in the film, when he could easily play someone a couple of years older, instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part. They lost all chance of having a big conflict between the cast, and instead foolishly they pulled out the cordial and easy and cheap items.
