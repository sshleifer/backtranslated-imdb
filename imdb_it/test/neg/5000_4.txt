Zombie movies are hot, I love them. I can't get enough of it. Because I should buy a movie of this caliber without explanation, I really love zombies. Surprise, this is not very much a zombie movie; a small budget that I can handle, being deceived just irritates me. <br /> <br /> A group of horror film clich√©s holds up in a warehouse / workshop / who knows what to escape from a fire storm outside. Panic, screams, low light and (possibly) zombies arise. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the directors, since it's obvious that they really thought they were putting together something good; a serious and scary horror movie. It is not, far from it, it is a boring casino of wooden acting, vulgar effects, poor lighting, excessive dialogue and overwriting. <br /> <br /> Things go for the first time when it takes more than 10 minutes for the characters to sit down and start figuring out what's going on. It gets worse when another 20 minutes pass and they are still sitting around trying to figure out what's going on. All this is littered with non-acting and bad dialogues. <br /> <br /> Finally someone is attacked (not by a zombie) and hopes only a touch before the characters come back to complain (the only emotion that everyone generates) about how this sucks. Me guys too, me too. <br /> <br /> Finally the zombies are in the mix, but no one looks to worry anymore. I think there was a little blood and blood inside, but I was too busy praying for the credits to be noticed. And when the screen eventually faded to black, I felt even more cheated by the useless end 'Cube'. <br /> <br /> I will give you credit for trying very hard, even if it failed miserably. That and the punk girl were very hot if totally underused. <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend it to anyone, except for film students looking for "no-no" pointers. <br /> <br /> 4/10
