The Hebrew Hammer is a wasted smart idea, because the execution is weak. As often happens in the case of iconoclastic humor, it relies excessively on outrage to generate laughter, which is simply not enough. Poor humor has two elements: bad taste and humor - and both are needed here, but humor is rather poor. As a result, it is often painful to look at, especially as a result of good attempts by artists, particularly Adam Goldberg as well as HH himself. The Shaft references are fun, though, but only for those who know those movies, and they certainly don't carry The Hebrew Hammer. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that many of the jokes are based on the knowledge of Jewish American culture, and many in the public simply will not understand the jokes.
