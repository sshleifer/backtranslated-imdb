Low budget mystery. A shot comes out of the darkness and a woman is seen running in that direction. A young architect Jimmy McMillan (Chick Chandler) discovers a body that disappears. The woman in a hurry, Mary (June Clyde), is tied to the scene of death; but it is McMillan who must try to resolve the case to avoid serious suspicion. The suspects are six shop owners near the crime scene. The whole atmosphere of Film-Noir; but not really the real thing. This film is simply enough to be a good low-cost drama and is a nice little escape. Other players include: George Meeker, Michael Raffetto, Milton Wallace and Rebel Randall.
