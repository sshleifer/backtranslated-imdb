Loving the fairy tails of Andersen as a child and I recently saw some intriguing documentaries on this strange, albeit brilliant, author, I couldn't wait to see this movie made for TV. Unfortunately, the experience was only a disappointment leaving me in anger and confusion. First of all the story / screenplay is full of inaccuracies and real fantasies and in this way it almost creates a completely new story, while shamefully abusing Andersen's fairy tales, presumably to sell shit to suckers like me. Secondly, cute actor (really ... have you ever seen a picture of the real Andersen?) Kieran Brew manages to portray Hans Christian as mentally retarded rather than the brilliant character, however disturbed, he was. Although annoying and irritating as Andersen, Brew lacks the charisma necessary to create any feeling of compassion that has ever existed. Thirdly. The love story between Andersen and the fake Jetta (which actually should be Henriette, Edvard Collin's wife) ... Why? This man has lived such an interesting life, it should be enough as a foundation for a great movie! <br /> <br /> I could continue to be a very long list, but I think it's safer to simply recommend to all of you to spend your time and money on something else instead.
