I went to see "Passion of the mind" because it usually surprises me with the genre of alternative reality novels, such as "Sliding doors", "I, myself, myself", etc. <br /> <br /> But this was the worst I've ever seen! I had to force myself to sit down. I didn't even go through the credits I had never heard before. <br /> <br /> Magic realism was completely absent because Demi Moore was grim and the lovers who had two times were boys who usually played bad guys, even though everyone was a little sexy and attractive. <br /> <br /> There was actually a psychological explanation provided for the dual lives, with a loathsome disgust of the Elektra Complex; perhaps the magic should not be explained for this kind of work. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 5/28/2000)
