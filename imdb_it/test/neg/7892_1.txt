Okay, let it break down. Why is this one of the worst movies ever? Because there are so many answers to this question that I'm having a headache. Come on ... Cracker World? Mr. Honkee? The part with the Arab boy? it's just awful, I didn't care about all the shit about white racism, but when they did that thing with Arabic, I wanted to get the names of all the writers. It's not really worth watching 3 seconds of this movie. It's not even funny-bad that was my first performance. I hope the person who directed this film does not commit suicide, but it seems likely, I see no other options. I will NEVER watch this movie, if you look at it, you cannot say that you died without regrets.
