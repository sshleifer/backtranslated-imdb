I fully understand the historical significance of Rocketship X-M, but that doesn't make it a good movie. To begin with, the plot (or whatever it is) is boring and lifeless. Five astronauts fly for the moon ?? are thrown off course and end up on Mars (eh?) ?? Martian-looking Martians throw stones at them ?? they return to Earth and meet a fiery death ?? The end. Believe it or not, but this description of the concise plot makes it much more interesting than it actually is. To make matters worse, the character of John Emery, Dr. Karl Eckstrom, considers it necessary to make long and articulate speeches on any subject, from the nature of man to the dangers of nuclear weapons. It's just a shiver per minute (sarcasm is intended). Looking back at the Rocketship X-M almost 60 years later, I would call the representation of women amusing if it wasn't all so sad and misguided. There are a number of examples that I could cite, but there is an exchange of dialogues immediately after the take-off between the male driver Floyd (played by the irritating plastic-haired Lloyd Bridges) and Dr. Lisa Van Horn (the only woman crew member and the constant object of Floyd's often disturbing attention) which illustrates the film's attitude towards women quite well: <br /> <br /> ?? Floyd: "I wondered why a girl like you got confused in something like this in the first place." <br /> <br /> ?? Dr. Van Horn: "I suppose you think women should just cook, sew and bear children." <br /> <br /> ?? Floyd: "Isn't it enough?" <br /> <br /> I think Floyd should have stayed behind with the cavemen!
