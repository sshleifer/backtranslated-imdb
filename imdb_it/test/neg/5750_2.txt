Well, now that all the friends and relationships of the director / producer have published their reviews after seeing it at various festivals, I guess it's time to show reviews written by people who actually paid $ 10 to see it. <br /> <Like the director "Dear Jesse" (the only other of his films I've seen), "Loggerheads" suffers from a lack of attention and too many ideas crammed into an independent budget. I swear, this guy might have better luck making miniseries. I kept waiting for the various plots of the plot to unite, but they were intercepted only in points clearly prefigured in an obvious way for everyone except for the densest spectator. It was like watching a season of movies made for life on TV crammed into one, long (I said LOOONG) sketch on the old show of "Carol Burnett". Perhaps an enterprising male suitor could take his girlfriend to see him and then exclaim "Hey ... remember all the chick gestures we did last year ... the one about the adoptive mother ... the one about the gay guy ... that of the Christian housewife: we went to TRE Chick Flicks last year, so now we have to go see Terminator 4! "I guess we have to do anything to launch a family actor to get funding, but what does Bonnie Hunt do in this film? She is not known as a dramatic actress, and this "exhibition" attempt will not send Mr. Oscar to her door. I mean (speaking of Lifetime Original Movies), were not Valerie Bertinelli or Farah Fawcett available? Mrs. Hunt has always come to me as cold, maybe she should have played the other mother? I wish I had chosen "Capote" to fill my indie called Gay themed weekly..oh well, maybe next week. I think there is a good reason why Capote is playing in tons of theaters throughout the New York area and this only plays to one; let the distributors believe in this movie to make sure you run in the opposite direction if you don't trust this review!
