This film is fine, quite silly and should be taken lightly. But what I can't stand are the numerous heroes and the ILLEGALY SENTIMENTAL comment of that boy towards the end: "look, they all look the same". Isn't it far exceeding tasteful standards? I thought it was disgusting, as were the heroic, disinterested acts of some people in this film. I'm not saying that it won't happen like that, but zooming in on all the courage like that makes my stomach boil.
