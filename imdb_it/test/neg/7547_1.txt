I've always been a Bottom fan, taking all the videos I've found from the series here in the states. The chemistry between Rik and Ade is always brilliant, and the combination of intelligent writing and absolutely stupid humor seems to work without fail. I sat down to watch this movie with great enthusiasm ... and was completely disappointed by the end. <br /> <br /> The first 3/4 of the film can be described as uninspired and ill-directed (sorry, Ade!), but with some absolutely brilliant moments. Unfortunately, these moments of laughter make you realize how less brilliant it is than the rest of the film. The slapstick starts in a fun way, but eventually it gets a little boring, with only the lines of perverted sex to keep things fun. <br /> <br /> The end of the film (the "green" scenes, for those of you who have seen) was ... perhaps the worst ending I've seen in the last ten years. Honestly. It was a joke repeated about thirty times, followed by a rude ending that made no sense (which didn't bother me) and wasn't funny (he did). <br /> <br /> To sum up, I was terribly disappointed with this movie. I will cling to the few bright moments in it, to keep the best memories I can ... but I must warn you, if you are going to overpay your NTSC conversion tape from the local importer, don't do it. There are much better things to spend your money on.
