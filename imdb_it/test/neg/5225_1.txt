I gave this movie a rating of 1 because it's by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. This film was made in 2003 and I saw films made in the 60s with better special effects. I wish I could go into details, but words can't describe how bad this movie was. I could have done better with a home video camera and $ 20! I pray that Chuck Norris will never make a movie again. Now, if you think I'm throwing this movie down because it has a Christian theme, you're wrong. I like the fact that IL 'Chuck decided to make a film that at least tried to make God look good, but why would he make the poor spectators like me suffer in such a lousy movie? The entire film can be summarized in 3 words: RE DAMN DICULOUS.
