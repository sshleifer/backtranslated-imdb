This is a stereotypical plot. A young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school. This leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally finds a strange new teacher who teaches him to fight. <br /> <br /> The fights are not of a high standard. They are too "simple" so that 1 + 1 is simple for every adult. The fighter has trained and enters the ring, but does not do what he has trained and kicks his ass. The trainer screams this and does it without success. And after a bit more of this ridiculous beating, he suddenly does what he is told and hits his opponent once. This translates into a turning point in the fight, even though our hero took a beating of his life up to that point. Think of the Rocky movies and you'll have a good point of reference as to how much beatings you really have. The fights are also shot badly. <br /> <br /> The last thing that ruins this film is the stupid love story. Background music and embarrassing moments are not what I call entertainment. <br /> <br /> These guys could really do some quality entertainment, but the director was not up to the task. Or the other crew in my opinion. Maybe they had a limited budget, I don't know, but what matters in the end is that this film is bad and deserves the rating of 3 out of 10.
