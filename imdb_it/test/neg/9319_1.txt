Well, I remember when the study dismissed Schrader and hired Harlin to shoot this film, they were right to do it. <br /> <br /> Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist is simply a bad movie, it's boring, It would be nice to think that the studio put aside a psychological masterpiece and that all those who in such big words condemned the Harlin version and they praised Schrader, although no one had ever seen him, he would have been right. <br /> <br /> But they weren't. <br /> <br /> To put it briefly: Schrader has no idea what a horror film should be, and shows a great way. <br /> <br /> Droll, boring, unintentionally funny in all the wrong places and bad supporting cast. <br /> <br /> Save your money and your nerves, don't see them.
