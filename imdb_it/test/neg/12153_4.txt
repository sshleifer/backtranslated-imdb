This film didn't excite me. While on vacation in Turkey, I noticed that he was playing at the local cinema and I decided to take the opportunity to go and see it. The action sequences of the film are well choreographed, however, the story drags on during the middle of the film. One thing I didn't follow was how Borte was able to get the money to bribe the movie. guards. <br /> <br /> The other thing I didn't particularly like was the missing part of Khan's life. He didn't go into detail about how the bad guys managed to find him and re-imprison him after he'd been missing for so long. <br /> <br /> Overall, I consider this film a (4) because I liked the action sequences, but they were too few to justify a higher rating because the dialogue left me less impressed ...
