Another horrible hockey movie. If I had never seen hockey and seen the Hollywood version, I will hate the game. This film does not make Canada so beautiful. I can laugh and not take it too seriously. However, this film is terrible, with everything you can put into a 1980s movie. In the end, don't even watch it on TV. 4/10
