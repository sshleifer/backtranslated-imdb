It is not "so bad it is beautiful" - It is "so serious, it violates the prohibition of the Geneva Convention to punish cruel and unusual"! Only by reading the Synopsis can you even imagine the "plot" of this Straight to Video disaster. It's a weave of grainy stock footage combined with some of the worst recitations of all time you've ever had the misfortune to see. Comparing this incompetent, turgid and humorless disorder to "Dead Men Do not Wear Plaid" is like saying that "Gigli" is like "Citizen Kane". Talented actors are cheaply dressed, dressed as J.C. Penney "Goin 'to Church", and there is not the slightest attempt at hairstyles or tricks of the period. If you really want to see how this kind of "tribute" works, take a look at "The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra" - It is intelligent, well written and, above all, played by real actors who are not so tormented by the clock. After all, look for the work of the Phoenix artist Paul Wilson, whose science fiction short "The Attack of the 70 foot Courtesy Lady" leaves this film in the dust. People in Terror In the Tropics seem to have been pulled off the road and given their scripts to read during the one and only catch. This is an insult to Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney and anyone else involved in the cannibalized films to make this schlock-fest! Money is not the problem: a lot can be done with very little expense. A good script, decent actors, and above Z-Grade costumes and production design should have been a given before the so-called director created this stinking pile of film offal. We hope that the "promise" of a sequel does not come true: it was by far the scariest thing shown in the whole film !!
