A young man, who never knew his parents, receives an old farm in an isolated section of West Virginia after the death of his natural father. Visit his property with a cross-section of potential victims including the black prominent comic boy and a fashionable lesbian couple. (Hmm, will there be the lean dive? Take a guess.) Unfortunately, the party ends when the spirits of the skids are killed by his evil great-grandfather and used as a scarecrow to take revenge. This movie starts well. An astute montage of photographs of the era of depression and fake newspapers against an FDR speech - this, I believe, is his first appearance in a killer scarecrow film - sets the mood. I have developed some hopes for the film, which have been partially realized. The story was quite useful. The setting was sufficiently bucolic. Photography was mostly in focus. The acting, although without major shocks, was slightly above average for horror films in this budget range. The film could have actually functioned within the limited needs of the genre if the scarecrows were appalling. But they weren't They seemed cheap. They weren't scary at all. The better the monster, the better the film. These scarecrows wouldn't scare Dorothy, let alone Tot√≤.
