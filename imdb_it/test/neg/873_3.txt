* Warning: 1 small insignificant spoiler * You are right. This was not a Madison County bridge. As soon as the solitary woman and Richard Gere entered the big empty hotel, it was assumed that something fun would happen. The question is: how will it be? The answer is a stupid story of connecting points that are not worth addressing. In an alleged bonding experience, they get drunk and clean the cupboard of old jars. (That was my spoiler). And the next day they put them back. LOL It was not irresistible. I am an elderly married woman like the one in the film and my friendships are more interesting than her love affair with Richard Gere. LOL. . . He had that advantage. You go and go, oh brother. . . I too could have written something more credible than this. I guess my life isn't as boring as I thought it was if I could mock a love story with Richard Gere. LOL! And did that friend inherit that totally contemporary home, probably computer-generated, which rested halfway in the ocean, from his GRANDMOTHER who built it AFTER THE CIVIL WAR ??? Perhaps his grandmother is Oprah and this happened after the civil war? And yes, WHERE WAS THE EMAIL? In which alternative universe do these people live? I never want to see another movie that pretends to have no e-mail, and facebook and messages. And OK, maybe these people have a horrible aversion to providing news on the phone, but don't ask me to believe anyone in this age of instant communication that someone falls into your life without calling first.
