This is perhaps the worst movie I've seen in a long, long time. Forget that it is clear that no research has been done on Detroit (forest in central Detroit! Bwahaha !!). The writing was horrible, the premise completely unlikely, and frankly, the characters were embarrassing. I cannot for the life of me understand why the expert actors are lowered to such a low level and participate in something of this horrible god. Now, I've never seen the original and I don't know if this movie pays tribute to its original form. I realized that the original was not set in Detroit. The reason they would have deviated from that without looking for details on the setting just told me it was more than the cast that was trying to pay the rent. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this garbage, unless you're from Detroit and want some comic relief.
