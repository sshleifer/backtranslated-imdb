I must say that it is not very good. Polly Bergen looks good in this film. The rest is so-so. I'm gay and honestly, there are so many clichés for this time in history that it's just sad. We started watching it and then turned it off, then we decided it would be fun to make fun of the rest of the movie. But all in all, the basic idea of ​​the film is good. If it had been rewritten with less elaborate lines and better acting, it could have actually been good. Overall I would not recommend it. ALSO, this is the coo-co line of thinking is so lame. Moreover, the fight in the hair salon is fun because it is so ugly. The lesbian sister in the room with them while they are trying to do it is so strange that she is sad.
