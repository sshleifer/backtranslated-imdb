I have read each and every one of Pimpernel's books by Baroness Orczy. Counting this, I saw 3 pimpernel films. The one with Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews I preferred this a lot. He goes out of his way for violence and action, sometimes completely violating the spirit of the book. I don't expect the films to stick directly to the plots, I gave up being so idealistic a long time ago, but if an excellent book movie has already been made, don't do it again with a TV movie that includes excellent actors and good costumes, a just decent script. Attack with the 80s version .... Rahne
