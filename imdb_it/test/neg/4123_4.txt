I just finished watching this movie and I have to say it was a good movie, I loved someone good and I loved the killer robot but the movie had a hole in it. <br /> <br /> the name of the people in it was kind of ... stupid ... I think people should have sued the producer of this film for how lame it was in the end ... the first half an hour was good but then she dragged herself on and on I was happy..it was over ... but I always liked the killer robot and some of the good guys in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think they were the best two money I've ever spent because I do like stupid b-movies like this and give. it's a b-movie to everyone.
