Ha ha! First of all if you've never seen a "Dimension Film" movie for a real surprise! Mainly known for the films SUPER LOW BUDGET Horror / Slasher, "Beowulf" was no exception. <br /> <br /> However, this video was more in the style of ultra-poor. I lost the K-R-A-F-T label on the side. <br /> <br /> Consider the anachronisms! (something out of place and time) <br /> <br /> We had: candles, armor, swords .... <br /> <br /> Yet we have seen: telescopes, shoes with soles, cigarette lighters, loudspeakers, Electricity, body bags, aluminum boxes and spoons / forks. <br /> <br /> Not bad for something like the eighth century! <br /> <br /> This is not a horror movie, it's a horrible movie. It's very ridiculous. It's really a comedy made to look like a horror movie! I couldn't stop laughing! <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert ("The Highlander Series") - must have really taken a bad turn in his career if he is working for "Dimension Films". <br /> <br /> I learned my lesson though. I'll watch the film studies on the videos, MUCH more closely now. <br /> <br /> APPOINTED CAN NOT BE FIVE. If you want a good laugh, it's hard to give up this job! <br /> <br /> This move had a few necklines in the stitches - I particularly liked the little blonde girl! <br /> <br /> Wayno <br /> <br />
