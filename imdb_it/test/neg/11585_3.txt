Another ridiculous and meaningless low-budget science fiction presentation ?? but is it actually fun? guy?? in a passively non-binding way. Am I soft? I don't know why they invented these titles. Yes, there is a komodo. And yes, there is a cobra. In any case, what is the agreement between "against"? Of course they come into a fight? only in two sequences (one that recapitulates an accident and the other is the sinister climax) and exchanges that are quite boring I could add. The triumph is the usual old routine of a scientific experiment that escapes an isolated island (there are no dinosaurs) and some innocent passers-by (environmentalists who hope to expose animal tests) to get involved. This sees a Komodo dragon and cobra becoming huge in the statue with the government soon wishing to destroy any kind of evidence (including witnesses) of its existence by blowing up the island. So this leaves the survivors running against the clock to find a way out. The main points of reference were the horrible CGI video game, the script, some squalid sets (even if the setting of the tropical islands was easy for the eyes), escaped characters (but I found inflated performances), shivering without life (which for some reason they kept using the same repetitive shot as the victim standing there in terror, which implied that I was waiting, please eat me now, I'm not going anywhere and in the end they were swallowed whole ... well almost as it always seemed to take a second sip to finish them off or simply to spare the annoyance by making them stupidly crush) and a very hysterical side with a sort of petty message between the acts of survival. Director Jim Wynorski seems to be in control of the cruise all the time. Michael Par√© is having fun with his stormy dialogues and Michelle Borth has added the necessary sparks. Renee Talbert is there to sulk a lot, even successfully.
