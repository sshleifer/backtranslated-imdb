I tried. God knows I tried to appreciate this Swiss cheese from a movie, but the story was too full of holes, some big enough to ride a horse-drawn carriage. The general acting was balanced and the characters, rather appealing to regret, went out like newly sprayed beetles, scattering to die of their horrible deaths. Overall, however, it wasn't really that scary. After all, we saw fast moving ghostly figures in the background from "The Brood" because back when / and it was scary then only briefly. This film has never solved the basic plot points and this is the work of the writer. Of course you would expect the director to take up the fact that the story didn't make sense. Like who was the secret room behind the wardrobe, why didn't the blood hungry ghost die when he received the nails as prescribed by the book they had read before? Why did the computer say "game over" to Frankie's character even though he lived? The list could go on and on. I don't really feel comfortable recommending this movie because it makes you feel like you've wasted your time and there wasn't enough pay off at really scary moments.
