I would put Death Wish 3 in the same box as Cobra and Commando di Stallone. The box that I would sell for $ 2 in a garage sale with all the videos inside. The story is about the main character who returns from the success of previous films to ruin everything with this load of garbage. Because the producers wanted to destroy the reputation of the 2 previous films with this cheap junk. The story is so lame it had to be an outrageous sequel. I mentioned Cobra first because he has the same mood, that a man can kill 20 or 30 gang members without a scratch. Both this film and Cobra were intent on showing the hero shooting with guns at the hip and the enemy was falling in large numbers. Police officers spend hours at the shooting range so why were they killed by gang members by shooting aimlessly from the hips? This movie was so bad that I thought for a minute that it was Death Wish 4.
