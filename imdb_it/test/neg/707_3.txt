When the film starts, it's obvious how old and sick the boys are. Although Oliver Hardy is huge, it is Stanley who appears to have overheated death. Apparently, he was seriously ill during production and obviously lost a lot of weight. Although he will eventually recover and live another decade and a half, here he looks like a dying man. Also, while watching the movie I was shocked by how many prey Stan took - I almost expected him to fall dead from the effort. I really can't understand WHY they came out of retirement considering their health - especially when the story and production values ​​are as poor as they are in this movie. <br /> <br /> Stanley inherits an island and a boat. He and Ollie are ready to go when Antoine, a stateless man, is literally dropped into their boat and they begin their journey to find the island. Along the way, they discover that Giovanni has hidden himself, but despite this the four men become friends and land on a different island. It looks like heaven and everyone is very happy. A little later, a beautiful girl joins them and everything looks great. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, uranium has been discovered on the island and the place is filled with rabble. In the end, the crowd decides to hang the four men and take over - at which point the island sinks back into the sea and the men are spared. <br /> <br /> I will give the film some credit for being original and for being interesting. However, one thing that is not is FUN - and this is unforgivable for a film by Laurel and Hardy. Although it's not a bad movie, it's certainly not a good movie. A sad end to their brilliant careers. <br /> <br /> All the actors, except for the duo, are dubbed into English, since the film was made in France. Although it might not be the worst movie they made (this would be THE GREAT NOISE), it certainly is close !! Watching this movie is painful and like watching people clean up after a serious accident.
