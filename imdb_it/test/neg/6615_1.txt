His obvious ESPN drools whenever Knight is in the news, but did they have to do a movie about him? This was the worst attempt at a serious drama I've ever seen. He had it all: terrible acting, terrible dialogue, ridiculous casting, cheap sets, etc. Etc. It seemed to have been shot on a $ 10 budget. Cummon, how's the game scenes? Were they in a middle school gym? And the lighting, well, let me tell you it was ridiculous. And Brian Denehy as Bob Knight? Give me a break. Denehey looked ... Denehy in a red sweater, nothing more. ESPN has lost a lot of credibility with this flop attempt. They paid millions of dollars in advertising, then the premier was a huge dissapointment. Bob Knight is not a topic that can be covered in a 2-hour movie. ESPN blew it up. Even Knight thought he was more stupid than anything else.
