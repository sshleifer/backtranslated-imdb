I'm a big fan of Patricia Hodge and Mariam Margolyes, so I watched this show when it came to A & E some years ago. The show was strange to say the least, but I gave it a chance because I liked these actresses. This must be one of the worst shows I've ever seen. I would not look at it again and surely I will not waste money buying the video. The plot of this TV version is ridiculous and simply stupid! The "kicker" comes when Ruth undergoes surgery on her leg bones. That kind of nonsense belongs to James Bond and science fiction films. If this version is true for the book, then I won't check the book from my local library! The American version came out a few years after seeing this original. To my surprise the Americans understood this time, as their version with Meryl Streep and Roseanne is interpreted as a laugh and is quite funny. When you play to laugh, the plot works.
