I've always loved horror movies. From some of the usual ones known as "The Exorcist" to some of the most undervalued ones like "Black Christmas" or "Just Before Dawn". But who are the people who are joking, even calling this basket a b-movie. It's straight up to the Z-grade barrel. Acting is the worst ever in a movie. Really, I saw better in an episode of "Young and Restless" ... SPOILER ... Try when the woman comes to tell him the legend of Jack-o. He stops sometimes for a matter of seconds, as if someone is flashing his cue cards and is struggling to read his lines. A REVOLT! <br /> <br /> Oh, and besides bad acting, absolutely no gore or F / X. And Jack-o looked like a lit plastic pumpkin. Watch Linnea Quigley in "Night of the Demons", or "Silent Night, Deadly Night", a far superior movie.
