Have you ever tried a type of food made by your friend, and then you said to yourself, "wow, that wasn't a good mix"? Well, that's how I felt after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Many spectators will be left very uncomfortable with this strange mix of crime and comedy very, very trivial. It's almost like watching Mr. Rogers play a ruthless, very strange gangster. Some things just don't mix and this film clearly shows. <br /> <br /> There are some excellent performances here, as Dean Stockwell, Mercedes Ruhle and Alec Baldwin are all excellent, but this is not due to lack of balance and symmetry in the film. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Demme did an excellent job in films like Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia, but he seems to be out of his element with this.
