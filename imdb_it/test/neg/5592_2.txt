I think the value of production is OK .. probably worthy of a 4/10 or 5 / 10.it movie, traditionally shot, with good-looking people with the quality of the model and a small class .. <br /> <br /> but the premise leave me bothered .. a decent woman would do this dirty? I mean will he marry a man who would have sex with another woman? <br /> <br /> and what is more serious is also active in behavior ...... only in the mind of de Laclos .... the film also has many aspects that make Eastern Europeans seem immoral <br /> <br /> after all, it's just a movie, if you don't want to degrade women in general, I'll give you another point ... but of course, he concludes <br /> <br />: a bad piece of shit with a little taste
