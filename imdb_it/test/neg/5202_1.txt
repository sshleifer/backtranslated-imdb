This is a terrible film from every point of view. Since a lot has already been pointed out in the previous reviews, let me concentrate only on "Serbs" and "Delta Force" in this film. <br /> <br /> 1) The uniforms that the "Serbs" wear are not Serbian. And even the helmets are wrong. <br /> <br /> 2) The actors who play the "Serbs" do not speak Serbian, not even a language close to the Serbian, unlike "Behind the enemy lines" where the Czech actors did their best to speak the language and add at least some credibility to the film. <br /> <br /> 3) The gray-bearded "Serbian general" looks and behaves like a moron, firing his gun whenever US soldiers call his name: <br /> <br /> - US soldier: "Gravic! Abandon!" <br /> <br /> - General gray-bearded morion: (shoots his AK47) <br /> <br /> - US soldier: "Gravic! Come out!" <br /> <br /> - GBMG: (fires his AK47) <br /> <br /> - American soldier: "Gravic! You're surrounded" <br /> <br /> - GBMG: (fire his AK47) <br /> <br /> - Prop boy: "Excuse me, mister general with a gray beard, see, we are without white and I sent the boy to buy more, but he hasn't come back yet ..." > <br /> - GBMG: (click) <br /> <br /> 4) Since when the Army releases AK47 to Delta Force? I guess they wouldn't find enough working M4s in Bulgaria, but there were a lot of old AK47s and practice blanks;) Maybe they should have gone for some airsoft, they're cheaper and still wouldn't have damaged the film's credibility. .. <br /> <br /> 5) In the scene where a DF officer hangs on a rope while talking to a rocket scientist, he always keeps his finger on the trigger. No healthy person with no weapons training or just common sense would ever do it. I imagine the actor has realized that his freshness level increases the longer he keeps the gun that way. <br /> <br /> This film is such an insult to common sense
