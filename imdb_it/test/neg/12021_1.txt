Everyone has his choice for "the worst movie I've ever seen". Some like to choose Lilies or Battlefield Earth. Some choose classics like Plan 9 From Outer Space. Ever since I was 14, I've been very explicit in telling me it's Problem Child 2, and 9 years later, I feel exactly the same way. It is not "one of the worst", it is not just an expression. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> How much farting, pooping, pee and vomit can you put into a single movie? I don't need to see a dog take a dump that comes to my life! Why am I so hard on this filth? I have nothing against the bathroom or the gross humor. Hell, I like American Pie movies. Having such an excess of it within 90 minutes is a bad idea, but the real turning point is doing it with children! Having small children are called sexual names (IMDb does not even allow me to post that word here, but here it is coming out of the mouth of 8 years. Think of the irony in this!) And urine and vomit on each of them makes the other all the more dirty. The worst line in the movie: "I think I should fart in more people's offices." <br /> <br /> What other movie he has: the urination in the lemonade, the sticks of dynamite that explode the baths, a little boy who films his babysitter while having sex and projects it on the side of the house, and a little girl jokes to scratch the testicles? <br /> <br /> However, my absolute favorite moment must be when the same girl is around for the carnival, says "I'm throwing up", opens her mouth, and a fake vomit seems to come out of her open mouth in a perfect 90 degree angle! The vomit scene in Scary Movie 2 seemed truer than that. <br /> <br /> I suppose that the only saving element in the film is Gilbert Gottfried. You have the impression that he didn't even have a script, but it was just his usual car. Too bad I have to act stupid while the pizza is thrown on him. <br /> <br /> Do you know what? Thinking about the film so much forced me to go to the bathroom. Goodbye!
