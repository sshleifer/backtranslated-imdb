After I couldn't ignore the clamor on the show, I started watching the first season and it hit me very well and I was hooked .... for about 5 episodes, then it started spiraling down. Why? First, Ethan Suplee is scripted to serve as a complete idiot, confirming that very clearly spreading semi-random stuff with high expectations that somehow can become the best joke. <br /> <br /> Jaime Pressly looks great, but if you think you can stretch your lips to explore parts of the face that normally never go and make strange grimaces to accentuate everything he says is hilarious, he's off track. Perhaps he thought that his character would have been too flat, faded and wanted to make it colorful and spicy, but he created a wave of colors, an excess of spices and shouts out loud for attention and hurts my eyes, my ears and to the intellect. > <br /> I really really wanted to love this show, as I said, the premise is fantastic, (it comes from the same shelf as Amelie Poulain's The Fabulous Destiny) and Jason Lee is doing a good job here, along with some of the other actors , but there's no way to get me "sucked" and forget that this is just a show, because the surreal and extreme characters of Pressly and Suplee wake me up abruptly when they show up. It is worth noting that their characters and acting would be fine if this were not a series of 70 parts and if they had not gotten so much time on the screen.
