I know that if I were a cheap film director, I'd probably check this page to find out what people think. So I really hope the film's creators read this! I think you should find a way to pay me back for an hour and a half of the life I just lost looking at this garbage. Please stop making movies about something you probably fancy. Just stop making movies all together ... you're one of the reasons why it's so hard for indie filmmakers to make it big. Do the world a favor and find a job like a McDonald's or something where you can do something productive with your life! I feel like calling blockbusters to complain that they actually brought this movie to their store.
