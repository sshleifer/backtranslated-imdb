Did people expect "Jurassic Park 3" to be full of surprises? Not a single moment is worth it. Many elements could easily scare people from movies ... and they are not dinosaurs! Tea Leoni ... I think she's a great actress, but I'm sorry to say that this time she has reached the bottom. I wonder if she happened to strain a vocal cord while shooting the film ... Laura Dern ... she's ok, but why not be more evident in the movie, maybe exchange intelligent dialogues with Sam Neil. Alessandro Nivola - "Have you ever heard of something called facial expression? Fellings, emotions ...". He has to work harder on this! Sam Neil, no big deal. The soundtrack ... you got to change that record, or you get tired. My applause goes to William H. Macy, a talented actor who I have never seen perform in a bad role ... unfortunately he cannot save the film, nor the well-created computer-generated dinosaurs.
