What can I say about Ocean's Twelve? Who thought he would ever come to this? A gigantic mess that is lost halfway and cannot go back. I was amazed at how ugly it really was. Really! I've never seen the ending correctly because this movie is simply unbearable. I'm a big fan of the first, but this is a bad excuse for a sequel. <br /> <br /> What was the point of the robbery if they had to pay back the money? The film is just boring and so drag it that I can never sit down. It's really bad. Stay the farthest, repeat, as far as possible from this movie. It has no value.
