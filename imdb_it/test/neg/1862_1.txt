This movie was so horrible ... I want to get out of whoever made this movie ... I was an original fan of all the ghoulies movies ... but when I saw it I started crying I couldn't handle it .. There are not even the ne ghoulies in it ... like the original creative monsters ... this is so cheap economic ... I come on a witch ... that's bull bullshit nobody wants to see the witch ... they wanted to see what the movie is about ... "GHOULIES" me me jeesh I'm right or what? Here ... we looked at the others ... now we have to put up with this horrible plot ... This makes me want to eat my poop after Spaghetti Monday !!!
