I don't see the sense of having to face so many problems to make a film like this, and then throw the story book out the window. There wasn't a single accurate detail in that film except the fact that Richtofen died, which I was grateful for at the end, so I didn't have to watch it anymore. Movies like this are an insult to anyone who knows anything about the aerial history of the First World War. I will skip the obvious, that they were flying on Fokker DVII in 1916, because even the Blue Max did it, or that Squadron 209 was flying on SE-5 and would attack other parts. First, they call Pfalz D-III an "old Albatross" in the beginning. For another, they have Voss, Goring and Wolff all in Jasta Boelcke. The only one who was in that Jasta was Voss, and he joined after Boelcke's death. Richtofen was not held responsible for Boelcke's death ... Erwin Boehme, who clashed with Boelcke, had strayed to avoid a British plane that Richtofen was chasing. When Richtofen received his head wound, he was attacking a two-seater FE-2d, and he didn't crash into the trenches and he had soldiers fighting over him, and NO .. Werner Voss didn't die that day . He died on September 28th in one of the most epic battles of the First World War. Manfred was short, not like the actor who towered over everyone else. Even his brother Lothar was never at Jasta Boelcke, he joined the squadron when Manfred was in charge of Jasta 11. <br /> <br /> There are so many other glaring mistakes in the historical fact that I will let them go perhaps the worst, the scene of death. In the movie Manfred is out of the way by Brown and then shot down, making a perfect landing. Brown dropped a burst at Richtofen while Richtofen was chasing May, and the facts accumulated over the years have shown overwhelmingly that Richtofen was killed by ground fire, not by Brown. <br /> <br /> The only value in this film was the chance to see the flying scenes themselves, which were as good as 'The Blue Max', apart from the fact that I won't watch it anymore and I paid $ 30 for the ribbon!
