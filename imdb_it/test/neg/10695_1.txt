This is the worst movie I've ever seen, so amazing is it. I'm glad I never saw that black buddy in any other film: OK, it wasn't his fault if someone gave him those lines, but he could have refused the role, and he tried to learn how to behave. How come someone got the money to put this movie together. Is there any company in Hollywood that deals with trash for male university students without brains? "Oh yes, they will love this: it has no credible storyline, some kungfu movements, Chuck Norris, a black fellow with bad evil lines, a sweet little Israeli (or is he Arab, or does anyone care?) Pickpocket and the devil." Brilliant, and many thanks to all concerned for enriching the human race.
