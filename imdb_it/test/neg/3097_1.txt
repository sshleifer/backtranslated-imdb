Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie. Minus 50 billion out of 10. If you want a hard-boiled action, don't rent it! If you want a good independent film, look elsewhere! I never thought I'd see Burt Reynolds in such a lousy movie. It has the thinnest weft ever. Van Damm's films should win an academy over this one. <br /> <br /> Rob Lowe proves once again why he is not the coolest actor in the world. Even Hasselhoff would have made a drug addict better than he was. I don't want to bore you with more facts about this lousy movie, except to say that it's better to rent something from Hulk Hogan or Dolph Lundgreen. This should prove my point of view, if you understand my turn. <br /> <br />
