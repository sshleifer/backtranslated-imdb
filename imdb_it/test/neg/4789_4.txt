I agree with the comments concerning the downward rotation. The last vision shows that it was a little better, but surely the writers need a little more direction. I think the characters are still interesting, even if sometimes they turn a little too much in the "white garbage". The subtlety and nuances go a long way in shows like "Office". I think the target audience is somehow similar being both on the same night and lineup. One might think that Karma and the whole of the Eastern religion is a topic large enough to bring different and interesting performances, but only scratch the surface of the subject. In my opinion, it shows the contempt that many people have in Hollywood regarding the level of intelligence of the masses. We can handle more heady content. It has already been tried in many other shows.
