Algiers is not a classic, it is a perversion of the wonderful original Pepe le Moko, directed by Duvivier and interpreted by a much more attractive and charming Pepe, Jean Gabin. If you want to fully enjoy the Casbah and the characters of Algiers, I advise you not to even watch this film and to see Pepe le Moko, because it is much more elaborate, more beautifully filmed, the lines are not clich√©s and the characters adhere much more to reality. Furthermore, the ending is so dramatic and fundamental to the character of Pepe that you will find the intolerable version of Algiers. Although Algiers does an almost excellent job imitating every scene, acting does not coincide with the credibility of the characters. Furthermore, the wardrobe is truly breathtaking in all the scenes, in particular Pepe's in the last scene and Gaby's (at all times), but also when it's on the boat. Frankly, Algiers is cheap for imitations.
