In the beginning, it's hard not to miss the fact that one of the seemingly sophisticated killers intentionally twists his foot in a red paint on the murder scene, unfortunately this is not an intricate plot point; and, there are worse stories about stumbling on foot. Overall "Dead Silent" is not a bad way to spend some time, if there is nothing better, or you're in Lowe and his co-stars. <br /> <br /> **** Dead Silent (1999)) Roger Cardinal ~ Catherine Mary Stewart, Rob Lowe, Arlen Aguayo-Stewart, Larry Day
