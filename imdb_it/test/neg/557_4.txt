"The Next Karate Kid" is an absolutely predictable film, just like its predecessors. Its predictability often translates into a feeling of impatience on the part of the viewer, who often wants the story to move a little faster. Despite his pauses and his extreme familiarity, however, this fourth entry in the series is painless, almost exclusively due to the presence of Morita. He doesn't seem tired of his role, and he puts life and humor in the film, becoming the best reason to see it. Not terrible, but not much either.
