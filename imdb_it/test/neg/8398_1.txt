first of all, I am amazed to see that this film scored 7 on this site. at first I thought it might be people in the industry who connected to IMDb and raised the rating. but after seeing rotten tomatoes and having seen that this film has something like 76% of liking, it seems that perhaps people have been again deceived into a specious shit for depth. I mean, this movie is just awful. acting is simply terrible, but the rest of the film is worse. at least the acting provides some laughter (involuntary). <br /> <br /> the plot involves a teenage skateboarding guy who is questioned along with his friends about a murder that happened in a park where they skate. and this is all. the rest of the film consists of the terrible recitation mentioned above, in a terrible dialogue, in slow-motion images of people walking, of faces of people, of people who skate, often set on music that does not fit the scene. maybe it was made to be "cool" or experimental or fashionable. or maybe it was done in the hope that it would trick people into thinking that it was somehow deep, but it doesn't work. nothing in this movie works. it's pretentious rubbish. I can't recommend it enough
