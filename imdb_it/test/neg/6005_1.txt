OK. Before I said, I just wanted to check if this film has a lower average rating or exactly -1. But 5.9. This is sicker than all murder trials -, -. This made me curious about what people wrote here ... which eventually made me create an account to give my 2cents of truth in this "pit of disappointment" that I find here. <br /> <br /> How dare you guys MENTION this movie in the same phrases as eg Seven? The only thing they have in common is that they show various crime scenes. What-is-it. And "Best thriller of 1999!" ? Have you ever seen another movie that year? Or any other movie of your life? 1999 is not a year that people remember RESURRECTION ... what are real films like 8mm, Eyes wide shut, Arlington Road, Double Jeopardy? (Actually I'm more of a "thriller" than it could ever be ..). The Resurrection doesn't even deserve to be dedicated to A SECOND 1999. <br /> <br /> Really, you guys can't be serious. I saw that movie yesterday with my girlfriend, highly recommended by a friend of his. A "great movie with Christopher Lambert"! ... that I hadn't seen yet? Hmm .. <br /> <br /> Well, first look at the Covers: OK, nothing special. At the second glance it is not necessary to have supernatural powers to be aware of the fact that they simply mirrored Lambert's head, cut their noses in this and that, then created a negative pattern of fantasy about it, to get the image of the killers on the COVER. You might even think about having an apprentice eating a gallon of marshmallows just to mention that creepy mouth (booooh! -.-) .. whatever. Shot and the plot starts with .. "It's raining in Chicago ... blabber blabber". Come on, a six-year-old could have made that fragment more exciting. Now, with this huge excitement coming from the film, an exceptional presentation -, you absolutely want to start watching it. Because it can't be so bad, it's still Christopher Lambert. This assumption of mine has been denied. By "wrong shown" I mean that he was brutally executed by a deadly mix of the worst imaginable acting ever seen by humanity (every actor, but the leaders are "I can do 1-Liners!", Prudhommes Wife) __ actually the best Prudhomme detective when he recombines several incidents with a suggestion ABSOLUTELY UNKNOWN in the case !!!! -.- __ and .. yes .. Prudhomme himself) with a squadron of false inhuman feelings, logical errors in a minute-cycle , light years far-fetched conclusions that in my point of view represent an insult to every thinking human being and, last but not least, a cameraman who evidently was a hyperventilated kangaroo. Oh well, and if you don't completely close your brain (these are not the premises to see it) then you should know who is who and what is what after max. 30 minutes, simply because you know ANY scene after the first one. It is exciting. Exciting because this film makes you almost think you can tell the future. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: this is by far the worst movie I can remember. Trust me, I've seen many horrible movies that somehow were just bad attempts or bad copies of another movie. However, resurrection is the best example of how to fail in every possible aspect. It was so bad that, after being shocked by its unimaginably low quality in e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g, I laughed more often than in any recent comedy, simply because I was fascinated by the boldness of the crew to release an extraordinary film strip. The good thing for Lambert was in Highlander: Endgame a year later, so he can be forgiven. ; ^ O <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend watching this movie on ALL. In the end, we had a lot of fun watching it: ^ Q. I guarantee you, after looking at the Resurrection completely (be brave, you can do it!), You will love the level of acting in a given daily soap. <br /> <br /> Or just go and watch the highlander one more time ... that's what I'll do.
