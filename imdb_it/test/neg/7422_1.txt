(r # 64) <br /> <br /> Irremediable garbage, without merit and above all sad. You know a movie will be bad when its only stellar power is Lance Henriksen. The French title of this film says it all: "Inexplicable". How can you make this movie incredibly ugly in this day and age? Whatever the make-up of Jonas Quastel, it worked. This is Ã¼ber-trash, I'm talking about the crap at the level of Manos, meaningless bile, cumbersome, not so bad, cinematic of the highest order. <br /> <br /> Lance Henriksen It is Harlan Knowles, a character that could have been interesting if he were not so completely lacking in features or personality. He, along with a group of morons, goes on an excursion in search of an evil Sasquatch who is believed to have attacked a plane that crashed into the woods, or something like that. Not much else happens. There are some soft-core nudity (which means: Teletubbie level) and some obvious "Predator" ripoffs. After 92 minutes of total pain and another scene torn, this time by "Blair Witch", the film finally moves across the finish line and ends. As a bonus, we only see the monster itself for about one or two scenes in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> There's really not much to say about this movie. All you need to know is, this is a very bad film and it's not even worth being seen as a "so-bad-is-good" movie. "The Untold" is for entertainment the value of what Orlando Bloom plays as an actor. Avoid it as arsenic.
