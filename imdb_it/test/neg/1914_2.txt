I saw it on cable because I was a big fan of Leelee. Big mistake. What a horrible movie. You don't care about any of the characters in the movie. Chris Klein plays a guy who is a complete asshole in the movie and steals Josh Hartnett's longtime girlfriend. If the writer knew what they were doing, this film would follow the proven formula, and made Hartnett a donkey, and Leelee as the girlfriend trapped in a bad relationship, from which she was rescued by Klein. But Hartnett is a really strong guy, who shows a lot of emotion and love for Leelee. <br /> <br /> So you hate the leeeas, because they betray Hartnett with Klein, who is an idiot for everyone in the city who is trying to help him and actually showed up. <br /> <br /> It is also very campy, and the characters do everything but run around the kitchen dancing and synchronizing their lips, and using hair brushes and spoons and fake microphones (even if they come very close). <br /> <br /> What a horrible horrible film. You don't even care what happens at the end, because the director never lets you worry about the characters.
