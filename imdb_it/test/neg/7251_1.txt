Even though my exposure to world cultures is limited, I try. This was a movie I tried and hated. Worst of all, after hearing so many people bemoan the superficiality of typical Hollywood dishes and stereotypical caricatures, I have seen characters too outrageous for "Eastenders" to show off as realistic. <br /> <br /> Clint wants to get out of the drug life and aspires to be a waiter. Aim up, I always say. Brad Dorif, or a faxed photo of him, or maybe a curly wig on a stick, it was hard to tell, offered to hire Clint if he had a pair of shoes. <br /> <br /> Clint, and a huge entourage, apparently wandering all over England trying to get him some shoes. Eventually, they end up in a suburban home. Who is not clear Mother helps a girl shoot. Oh, now there's a bit of realism for you! Mrs. Brady may have been a ridiculous stereotype of American housewives, but she never helped Marsha tie up and find a vein. Good God! Dad comes home and sings some Elvis songs and then chases the kids away. <br /> <br /> Why didn't Clint borrow money and buy shoes in a second-hand store? Why didn't he go to a church and ask a nice nun for help? Why didn't he stop in front of a shoe store and a strip of bread? I just don't know! None of these things seemed to be below him. Benevolent groups like Goodwill and the Salvation Army have shops to help people. I know people who work there! If someone without money showed up and needed shoes, the staff would give the person shoes. Maybe not Prada or Gucci, but some form of foot cover. Not many of these groups distribute mobile phones to the less privileged, but shoes are not usually a problem. What a stupid concept. The world, or at least the western part of it, is simply not so cruel. In England, perhaps it comes from "The Queen's Royal Charity" rather than from Goodwill, but people who need shoes take them. <br /> <br /> In addition to looking for shoes, there was no perceptible trace to hinder the action. Not that it made the film faster or more bearable, mind you. Although I checked the cassette several times, I wasn't looking at the extended 20-hour version, it just seemed like that. <br /> <br /> Has Clint taken his shoes? Did Brad Dourif's cardboard cutout take him to the restaurant? Have I ever looked at another stranger ever again? <br /> <br /> [spoiler] Yes, yes, and yes. <br /> <br /> Regarding the fate of this particular film, I decided to finish it all. I took out my S & W .45 and shot a half-inch hole through the cassette. Blammo! (I managed to rewind it first.) I put it back in the tape case, returned it to the rental shop, and incredibly NO ONE EVER CALLED TO ASK IT !!! It means, of course, that no one else has rented it for at least the remaining three years I lived in that city. The others knew something I didn't have. Live and learn. <br /> <br /> BTW, if you rent something you've never seen before and someone put a bullet in it, take it as a sign. And if you work at Kroger's video department, I'm just kidding. <br /> <br /> Note: this classic has yet to see the light of day on DVD, so we should be eternally grateful to digital gods.
