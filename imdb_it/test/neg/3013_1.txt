this show sucks. I don't think I have to even say it or because, judging by the number of comments, I'm just repeating everything. the VIP's keys are like turning on the TV and getting yourself kicked out. this is exactly what it is as I do not exaggerate even a little. these guys are so stupid, not funny and not smooth with the ladies that it's not even funny, it's stupid. I sat through four episodes and I want my two hours back. where they find competitors because they are clearly mentally deficient. if I were the man who invented this idea for a show and put it on TV, I would do the world a favor and jump from the highest building I found. how do waste like this on TV? in particular shouldn't the comedy network be a show about something called the comic network, at least be a comedy show or be funny so often?
