This is a really stupid nonsense job - almost like Hepburn who plays a Chinese woman in DRAGON SEED. The main part of Hepburn is a combination of Granny of the Beverly Hillbillies and faith healers! This film is even worse than Bogart's Swing Your Lady, because at least Bogart didn't play in the hills - he was simply surrounded by them. And the dialog seems to come from a strip of Li'l Abner! The problems actually don't end with outrageous casting, as the plot is completely confusing and the "love story" could hurt your head. For no reason, HELLO, he married Robert Young for this Ozark doll. Was it his beautiful personality that won his heart? I doubt it, since she like the fiery "spitfire" of which the film was entitled and who really seemed to want to fight and scrappin and hollerin '! Was it her feminine charm? Without makeup and fashions that seemed to have been designed by Ma Kettle, I doubt that this was the case as well. Finally, in the end, Ralph Bellamy somehow fell for her too, even if, once again, it doesn't really seem to make any sense. <br /> <br /> So, here we have two city singers who fall for a nasty, non-playful beast played by Mrs. Hepburn - now this is a recipe for a good movie!
