Because I didn't like the movie, apart from the sheer ugliness of the actors themselves, it's that someone could actually believe in this crap. <br /> <br /> First of all, the Second Coming of Christ will be at the end of the words, and when Jesus Christ comes on the day of judgment, he will not come as he did before, in human form. He will come in His full glory as God and we will be judged not only for our sins, but also for the consequences of our actions. Everyone will do it! Secondly, I saw the eternal gay pride illustrated in this film with the unquestionable "I read the Bible last night and it is not written anywhere". Well, it is. Moses mentions on 3 different occasions that men who make love with other men, or women who love each other as if they were to kill man and wife, because these will never inherit the kingdom of God as they are dirty! If it were really for us to follow the Bible word by word, now there would be executions, wouldn't there be? But I think that misinforming people does more harm than this ... That was the Old Testament. <br /> <br /> There are many crazy people in psychiatric departments who think they are the Son of God, but to make a movie later that really makes you think about how many idiots out there can make a movie.
