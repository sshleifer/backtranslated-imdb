Of course, the concept had already been done with Alf and the Incantimi: pushing modern society on one or more misplaced characters. But I loved both shows and watched them religiously until the end of 1990. When I learned about Scorch, I was really very confident about something new, since the new TV in the 90s didn't impress me (but at least Star Trek : TNG and the Simpsons were still going. <br /> <br /> What I got was a big disappointment: the acting was terrible, but considering the ridiculous dialogue and the incredible writing, I can't blame them too much for that they had to work with. There were some funny moments, but most of the deliberate jokes seemed forced in their release. The entire production work on the show seemed too low for what was on TV at the time. it would have been perfect. <br /> <br /> Still, it was the first episode that had to introduce the characters and establish the whole premise of the series, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. god was not so bad, and I resumed my hopes that once he entered his intent, the show would be improved. Unfortunately, my VCR didn't record the third episode, I never saw it, and the series disappeared from the TV lists later. All I have now are the first two episodes recorded in clear text on a VHS tape.
