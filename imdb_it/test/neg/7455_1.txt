Why can Canada produce decent or good films in every genre, in addition to action? I caught Dragon Hunt on TV the other day and it was like a train crash. I could not change channels, it is pure stupidity that has reduced my willpower. It's nice to say that the IMDb cast "credits" with this monstrosity apparently never worked again. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, bad writing, bad storytelling, bad music, bad hair, bad cinematography. Go on and on. The film really has nothing to recommend. If you are looking for bad action movies to have fun laughing, there are a ton of other movies that don't force you to burn your retinas later. I hope this film has no money from the government for funding, otherwise I will never pay taxes again.
