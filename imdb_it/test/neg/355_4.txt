As a physicist, talking about black holes and cosmology makes my heart beat. However, I found this presentation too slow and not full of sufficient information for the interested layman (who is more likely to see it). If you have more than a passing curiosity in this kind of thing, go to the library and take a look at some books. You'll find that they explain the current scientific cosmologies with much more detail and at the same time fill you with a sense of wonder more than this movie does. Also to make things clear: Hawking is NOT considered the "greatest mind" or the "smartest person in the world", as commonly stated also among the user reviews here in IMDb. Hawking himself commented: "It's rubbish, it's just a media hype, they need someone to fill the model of disabled genius, at least I'm disabled". To be honest, he is probably a genius but, among the greatest scientists in history, people like Einstein, Newton, Gauss and many others are even more appreciated. This does not mean disrespect to Hawking, who is undoubtedly a great scientist, but rather to respect others who have done more than he has. Anyway, watch the movie if you're really passionate about science. But if not, I think it would be boring for you.
