<br /> <br /> Well, great costumes and a wonderful "feeling" for Italy before the Second World War. But what happened here? <br /> <br /> Great actors ... Kristin Scott Thomas, Sean Penn, Anne Bancroft, James Fox, Derek Jacobi ... if you can't get memorable performances from this "list", then the problem with this movie must be blamed in a compassionate direction and an inadequate script. I rented it on DVD after enjoying "Angels & Insects" (1995), also directed by Philip Haas. <br /> <br /> Yipes! I can't believe how boring this was. He dragged himself forward and no one was able to save the poor thing. This is not even a nice curious movie for foreign boys and girls! <br /> <br /> "Tea With Mussolini" Gone Amuck! <br /> <br />
