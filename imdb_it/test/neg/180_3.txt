This film seems to be an exposition of the current trend towards globalization and homogenization in the wine industry. Wineries around the world are increasingly joining large conglomerates (the American producer, Mondavi, in the case of this film) or paying expensive experts to help them make "the perfect wine" - and consequently, the wines they are becoming very standard and predictable. For some, this is a good thing (especially because few can afford to pay $ 50 or more for a daily wine) and for others this is horrible because the uniqueness of the smaller wineries is disappearing. I can really understand the concerns of both sides and I don't think there is a villain or hero in this business. Of course, good and cheaper wine is a nice thing, but like what happened with beers (with giants like Unibrew and Anheiser-Busch), food (McDonalds), shopping (European shopping centers are almost indistinguishable from American ones ) and megastores (like Walmart / Asda) are taking away much of the uniqueness of "the little ones". So I was definitely ready and willing to listen to these directors. However, with a product almost two and a half hours long and a general lack of attention, the film has simply become a thankless task to watch and I lost interest. A film focused on 80-90 minutes would have been MUCH more effective, especially since the average viewer is NOT an oenophile (it is the high-level word for a "wine lover"). <br /> <br /> The upside is that filmmakers are smart not to talk much and simply let the ones on either side of the issue talk. Furthermore, the topic is so pertinent and timely. However, despite the choice of a good documentary-making style, the film simply goes so far, too long and ends up making a very boring film.
