I love bad movies: Showgirls, Outerspace Plan 9, and so on. And this film fits perfectly. Don't believe those who tell you that this is a good movie. It's really terrible. Tim Curry's accent goes from German to Portuguese to Hungarian. There is a person in a gorilla suit who should be able to communicate using a glove that interprets the sign language of the monkey. There is a scene with a killer hippo moving around a river like a great white shark. There are people who jump up and down the mountain. Kilimanjaro as if there were escalators installed on it. This is ridiculously ridiculous. So ridiculous I was rolling on the floor. It is totally unlikely. I loved every minute of it.
