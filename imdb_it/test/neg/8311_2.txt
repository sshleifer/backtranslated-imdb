As bad as this film is, I really like it. Poor acting, dialogue and action made it so fun. I loved John Travis of Omega Cop and stayed up all night working on how the death machines registered at the airport if they couldn't talk, probably had to shake up / nod security questions. Actually why don't they talk?! He fails to adhere to any kind of movie convention that makes it strangely interesting to watch - only a lot of people are killed around a very loose storyline surrounding hired assassins - no "machine" as such and those strange faces / things mountain on the front the cover and the trailer do not appear! I love the fact that there is not a good guy in this film up to about half and I love the many useless scenes of this plane landing - many people are killed that have nothing to do with the "plot" and no explanation is given on everything - DO NOT expect to understand this movie. Instead, admire how the main good guy can't even manage an old casual guy in the bar - who is presented as the villain but who speaks against the bartender's decision to hire a woman dressed succinctly to dance badly in the "entertainment" corner - all good guys seem to like this! Why did the old man beat our hero - and why did the boy decide to help the old man fight ?! Why did the hero collapse under a fist from an old guy at the bar, where a jet of water splashes in the background, so it looks like it's coming from his mouth? Defined as Top 20 B-Movie, it must verify a part 2.
