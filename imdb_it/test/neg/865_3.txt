I just saw Caribe a couple of nights ago at the annual Vistas Film Festival held here in Dallas, and I must express my discontent. The initial caption tries to tell us that the film is a portrait of the current invasion of South American countries (Costa Rica, in this particular case) by North American oil companies, and of the negative effects, both economic and environmental, of this invasion. The main characters are a married couple who live a simple and pleasant life while maintaining a banana farm. Immediately a woman arrives and announces that she is his wife's half-sister. I have no intention of going into the details of this (and to be honest, I don't think I'm ruining anything with this review), another key point is that the company they distribute their bananas makes them fall due to budget demands in a poor economy. Thus, the main conflict that should be addressed in the film is of the husband between the rock and the difficult place, trying to preserve his livelihood. On the one hand, the Reynolds oil company has practically offered him a job and financial compensation (basically a bribe) to use his public influence to encourage the city to allow the company to start drilling in their city (compromising its position with the community and the community yes). On the other hand, he is faced with being dead, but on the side of his community, protesting against drilling. Given the length of this film, it would have been much longer to explore the problems just described, but it doesn't happen and I'll tell you why. You will notice that this film has won a couple of awards so far, one for the director and one for the public. I'm not going to set aside Esteban's direction, it wasn't bad or good enough for me to be so keen on writing something. The audience prize was at a film festival in Spain, and to get an audience award, I had to imagine that the Spaniards were limited to finding soap operas. In fact, even Central and South America dig soap operas, I know a lot. I suppose that Esteban was aiming to take advantage of this or that he himself digs up soap operas, because this is what takes place during this film, to the point of pushing the whole story of the oil company aside, almost as if they imagined half of the making of this film that had become boring, because it seems that at least three of the supporting characters have had their past history and the development of the severely compromised character to make way for more scenes of sex and crying. The only real villain in the film is one of these three characters, and at no time will you be able to find out who the hell it is. It's almost as if they had cut his time on the screen just before taking him out of the film entirely. From time to time, they play with oil against the community plot, but these are digressions at best. What we see much more are scenes of passion, jealousy, betrayal, adultery, etc. These themes saturate the story to such an extent that the oil company sub-plot becomes useless. It's almost as if it were a gimmick to legitimize a romantic drama (soap opera) by introducing some political relevance. Nevertheless, the film is so caught up in the romanticism that in the end it doesn't know what to do with itself, resulting in such an established ending that you are asked who you were waiting for, or if ever there was something to start with. Here are two things that I think may have saved this movie: either cut the stepsister or cut the oil company. It is obvious which of the two were more interested. Or, perhaps, if Caribe had been a longer hour, they could have solved all this. Regardless, I would have gone well with a pure soap opera and I think the subject of oil companies that exploit foreign nations desperately needs to turn to the cinema community. Caribe is both and neither. These two angles could have worked together if they had been balanced accordingly, but with a romantic plot that ran in circles and absorbed almost twice the time needed at the expense of an oil plot that was just established to begin with, both sides suffer . Best of all, the romantic plot is never even solved. I would like to say that I would watch this film again to see what I missed, but I have the distinct feeling that I already know what it is. As for me, it doesn't matter if I've seen Caribe ten more times. I lost it because it simply isn't there.
