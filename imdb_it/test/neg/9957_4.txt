The scientist's daughter Lenora grows suspicious of her father's actions and shares her suspicions with a journalist of the newspaper. When the scientist loses control of his creature, he falls on the scientist's daughter and the journalist to stop him, "according to the synopsis of the cover of the DVD. <br /> <br /> The mad scientist George Zucco (in the shoes by Lorenzo Cameron) creates his formula quite unimaginably, mixing human blood and wolf, which brings the beast into the giant Glenn Strange (like Petro aka Pedro), who is headed to behave like Lon Chaney Jr. in "Of Mice and Men ". Johnny Downs (like Tom Gregory) and Anna Nagel (like Lenora Cameron) are a nice werewolf hunter and a damsel in distress. Certainly," The Ma d Monster "cannot replace" The Wolf Man "; but it is a useful addendum. The grainy black and white photograph enhances the foggy and web-like atmosphere.

As Blaine (Robert Strange) said: "Mixing the blood of man and the beast is a real sacrilege!" <br /> <br /> **** The Mad Monster (1942) Sam Newfield ~ George Zucco, Johnny Downs, Anna Nagel
