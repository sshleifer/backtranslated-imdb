I'm not a cinema snob. I liked many films that critics hate and I hated movies that critics love. However, I have to agree with the critics here - "Galaxina" is only below standards. Clearly destined to be a comedy, it has only a few sparse laughter. "Galaxina" has a poor picture; has poor special effects; has a rather poor acting; and production values ​​... well, even the sets could be made of cardboard. <br /> <br /> "Galaxina" tells the story of a spaceship whose crew is looking for a magical object called "The Blue Star" ". After a long journey (and some unconvincing space battles), the crew arrives at its destination, a kind of wild west alien world. There is a painful scene in the cellar (clearly designed to be a parody of the famous "Star Wars" scene), a chase involving space enthusiasts and an escape final. <br /> <br /> The cast tries, but can't do it breathes life into this turkey Stephen Macht and Avery Schreiber have done a better job in other films James James Hinton is pretty good as a crew member of the spaceship. The late Dorothy Stratten plays the title robot, and while she is beautiful, her role does not give her much opportunity to act. <br /> <br /> You could see this movie to see Dorothy Stratten. However, if you are looking for a good movie, pr you will probably want to skip this.
