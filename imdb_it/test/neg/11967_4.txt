I assumed that 'Scarecrow Gone Wild' was a dry and boring blow. Yes, it has some common sense, but it's a rehash of another movie. The acts are so horrible, nor the plot. <br /> <br /> The story starts from a legend about a living scarecrow on the cornfield. When an initiation becomes a joke and causes the life of a boy in danger, the scarecrow comes to life and a murderous frenzy begins. It looks familiar, right? Comes from Scream, Friday the 13th, Jeepeer Creepers, Children of the Corn, your name! <br /> <br /> 'Scarecrow Gone Wild' is far below the average film. Just a scary moment. Even the final scene is ridiculous! Unfortunately, we could still enjoy ourselves as our time killer. But I prefer that you look at something else instead. Unless you're a big bad fan and a good movie, off course. <br /> <br /> 4/10
