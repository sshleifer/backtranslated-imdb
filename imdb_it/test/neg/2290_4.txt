Not bad as some say ... This is an unofficial Bond movie and a remake of "Thunderball", written by Kevin McClory (co-producer of "Thunderball"). Well, the cast is very very interesting, Maria Brandauer is a beautiful Bond-villain, Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera are just like the "original" Bond-girls, in addition to Rowan Atkinson and a great Edward Fox, who seems really refreshing in Role "M". In fact, the whole film is refreshing and gives some new impulses. Sean Connery once again makes it safe and charming, except that he looks a little too old. But that's okay, he's the original Bond and it was good to see him again in this role. The locations are also typical - Bahamas, France, etc. The only thing that really doesn't work is the soundtrack, the song "Never say never again" is O.K., but the musical theme is missing. All in one, a nice attempt to make a difference from the comic and stupid films of Roger Moore as "Moonraker". Only if there was another story, "Thunderball" was an excellent film and really didn't need a remake
