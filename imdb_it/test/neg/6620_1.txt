There's a reason why the prime minister got a 2, (which is too high), this film is a worst movie of all time and I saw my share of rotten movies. The president of the board of directors sees two most annoying actors / people today, Carrot Top and Courtney Thorne Smith. Carrot Top is no longer fun and was not in this piece of junk. Courtney Thorne Smith is no better, just look at "According to Jim" and you'll see a first example of what I'm talking about. The council chairman received 1 from me, because he is as low as you can, he is so bad. I am a bit shocked that this piece of junk is not on the 100 IMDB below somewhere, I would put it in the top 5 on that list, but it is proceeding slowly towards it.
