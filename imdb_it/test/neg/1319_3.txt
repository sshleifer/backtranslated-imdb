A truly exceptional cast and a talented technical crew have wasted their precious career time, and our equally valuable spare time, taking care to support this absolutely predictable and clearly formidable piece of commercial junk. The film is based on a really good and very current idea, but both the producers and the director have simply applied the standard formula of the Hollywood disaster film and therefore ruined every potential value from the production. <br /> <br /> An unusually high stormy weather and very strong gale conditions combine to produce a record surge of storms that overwhelms London and floods most of the Thames valley. The plot revolves around a heroic scientist (Tom Courtenay) who warns the authorities of the danger and eventually saves the day, a charming female police chief who runs the entire show and a deputy prime minister (David Suchet) who tries to appear important. <br /> <br /> But it's all so unreal that it feels like a long break after just 30 minutes. The charming young police commissioner asks for a complete authority on the army during a declared state of emergency and obtains (as if!). The experienced general is simply set aside as a complete moron who has to lick his boots because of his obvious superior ability. The trouble is that our supreme female, while now responsible for millions of lives, spends most of her time worrying about the fate of her two daughters who have traveled to South West London and have not phoned to say they were fine . So our powerful woman sets up her staff to look for them and decides that the only priority for the whole army and rescue services must be south-west London and not in any other quarter of the city. Of course the Minister, the Army and the entire entourage accept his priority without reservation. One can only assume that everyone had property there. When her children are finally found after endless relationships and efforts by her staff, she is told by our male hero: "Thank God I am safe, this is the main thing". Don't worry about the millions of others or all the other responsibilities you should have controlled; until her children were safe, everything was fine. <br /> <br /> This film is just another excuse to push the same old feminist chauvinist sexist trap that women are smart, caring, caring and clearly capable leaders while men do nothing except physical courage , mindless strength and specialized knowledge. Yet the only simple instruction that could have given the population; that is, going to the nearest building and quietly climbing to the 4th floor or above and waiting for instructions when the waters recede was never given by this female superhero - or indeed anyone else. The whole problem was so simple to solve yet millions of people apparently didn't think they were going upstairs! Pathetic garbage.
