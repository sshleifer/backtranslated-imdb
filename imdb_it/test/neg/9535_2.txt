L'ALTRO is an alleged "horror" film made in the 1970s. It should not be confused with the same title THE OTHERS, played by Nicole Kidman. <br /> <br /> The plot is as follows: a woman with strange supernatural powers teaches her twin grandchildren something called simply "the game" ". One of these twins - Niles - should be" good ". The other - Holland - should be evil. <br /> <br /> The idea seems quite interesting as an abstract concept and the film was adapted from a novel, I can only hope that the novel is interesting because the film was incredibly boring from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The execution of this film is very similar to a TV movie of the kind that the residents of the United Kingdom could see on Channel 5. Actually, this film seems made to be the daytime afternoon movie for this TV channel, a slight cut in one or two scenes and this would be a film with a U classification of the Disney genre, but even the youngest child is more likely to be bored than scared of ALI. br /> <br /> It is not necessary to check the CV of the director to understand that horror is not his forte. <br /> <br /> Mr. Mulligan relies on the characters to guide the story. This is obvious from the start. I haven't seen any of his other films, but TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a highly regarded crime film on this site. Unfortunately in THE OTHER, the characters have too little to do and the tiring script ensures that the film never takes off in the way you'd expect. <br /> <br /> The management is so bland that it could be found. Almost every single scene takes place during the day! Think of this: a scene shot in the landscape open in rural America during the day with the camera focusing on a large area. Sounds scary or atmospheric? Believe me, it is not. It looks like something more like an episode of LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE than a horror movie. And yes, both the aforementioned TV series and THE OTHER were shot in California. <br /> <br /> There is a noticeable lack of danger or malice that makes the whole exercise rather pointless. <br /> <br /> The ending was clearly meant to be highly disturbing and perhaps influenced by that of another film of that period. I will not reveal which film, but I will give 2 clues: a boy was a main character and the film is well known. And I will add that the concept has been used more effectively in this last film. <br /> <br /> Acting is actually pretty good and that's the only reason I awarded 2 stars. The actors who play the twins, together with the actress who plays the grandmother, all strive with the poor material that is given to them. <br /> <br /> Diana Muldaur is completely wasted in an ungrateful role as the mother of twins. Don't be fooled by its high billing on the cast list. He gets very little time on the screen and his presence is presented as a ploy to collect his long television career in order to attract television viewers. <br /> <br /> I paid a lot of attention to the blurb on the back of the DVD cover (of the Region 2 version in the UK). The comparisons were made to THE EXORCIST, which I thought was a complete insult to that movie. There is no comparison. THE EXORCIST has everything this film should contain but does not - suspense, tension, ironic humor, highly disturbing content, great acting, superb characterization and involvement of the viewer. Ironically, THE EXORCIST was only released a year later, but in terms of style and execution it seems decades before the bland drama known as THE OTHER. The OTHER looks like a work that would have seemed docile in the 50s, not to mention the 70s! <br /> <br /> The 70s were a great era for horror films with classics like THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN, THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRO, THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, SALEM'S LOT to name just a few products. For this reason, L'ALTRO proves an even greater disappointment. <br /> <br /> If someone finds the synopsis of ALTRO interesting, they may want to read the book or do some more research on what the book was. I would recommend everyone to skip the movie.
