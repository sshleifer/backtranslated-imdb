I saw this mostly to see Charlie Ruggles and Una Merkel, two of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The plot has many twists and turns: it's not as bad as a mystery aboard a train. <Br /> <br /> But why throw a circus and a gorilla into a wreck? I can say this without being a "spoiler" because the circus wreck and the gorilla have nothing to do with the intricate mysterious plot. <br /> <br /> The bad person who tries to kill good people has many tricks on his sleeve, but the wreck of the circus was purely coincidental. It allows a single scene with a menacing gorilla, but then returns to the mystery of the crime!
