I arrived in the middle of the film and was very disappointed. It was simply boring and absolutely unrealistic. I can't be unrealistic in many films, but not when it should be a dramatic crime thing. The evidence gathering and interviewing processes were simply strange. I started fast forwarding to see how it ended. And then he was bored with it and turned it off and returned it. The main character, played by Ellen Barkin, was not at all credible. Peta Wilson played very well in this film, but his character was very far away and there was no one for whom his acting talents to play made him work.
