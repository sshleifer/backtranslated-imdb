I was pleasantly happy with the ending. I just saw this movie yesterday, and I was going to turn it off, but I changed my mind. It was not the direction in which I thought the story would end. This is all good I can say about this movie. All the actors are nobodors, especially the protagonist. While she is an attractive young woman, she will never be able to grow up. Writing, direction and acting are wooded, a bit like what you would see in daytime soaps. The locations of the shoot were very clever in making you think it could be anywhere, instead of brazenly skidding in Canada. Since this was shot entirely in Canada, I assume the whole lot was Canadien, which is not entirely negative as some recent Canadien TV productions: "Cold Squad", "Stone; Underover" are quite well done.
