First of all, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. This may make you want to see it, but it's not bad in a good way. It's boring, implausible, badly shot, ridiculously scripted and without disastrous effects. <br /> <br /> Worse, it is intensely patriotic without a trace of irony or fun, rolling in the sense of uniqueness and Japanese victimization. Everyone leaves the Japanese in their hour of need. In particular the Koreans. The noblest characters choose seppaku: they descend with their ship while their beloved island sinks. "Only the Japanese would think this way," says the prime minister. <br /> <br /> If this film somehow reflects Japanese opinion about their place in world opinion, the first thing they should do to correct the problem is to stop making films like this.
