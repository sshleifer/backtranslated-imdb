Hello! I am Sheena, a princess from the African jungle (yet white!) Who has the incredible ability to transform herself into the cheapest and least desirable monster in the world (think of the Star Trek aliens of the 1960s) rolling seductively in the mud! When I found myself in this horrible position for the first time, I took the only logical action: I made a torn jungle bikini in which to perform my antics. I like love novels and tearing the occasional and insignificant African warlord. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention my (white, of course) assistant Mr. Cutter, an American ex-military who appears to have fled the United States after his divorce. Can you say "ducking alimony"? In any case, it provides the occasional distraction from my difficult life. I mean, how many idiotic idiots do you know that I'm also an endangered species of a harrowing monster? Despite my many difficulties (acting is so difficult! * Whining *), I did not give up and, after much research, I finally discovered my role in life: to terrify the sleepless television viewers who are so unlucky as to have no cable or satellite.
