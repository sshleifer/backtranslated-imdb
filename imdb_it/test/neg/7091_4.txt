In an attempt to keep up with the soul of the young public while the 1970s approached, OaCD, YCSF was the product of hated and hated materials selected for musicalization. Here is the regression of past life, ESP and hypno-therapy ... rather anxious! The real problem with the concept (music or not) is the extraordinarily low dramatic posts; where can a movie go, and what can happen when a man falls in love with a previous incarnation of a girl who can't stand? He can't go anywhere new, but strangely, he can't even go anywhere old! In fact, if he could, the public would still have no interest in the union of Yves Montand (who plays a much older, arrogant French donkey) and Streisand. (a much younger girl). We never invest in them, in their situations or results. Montand is a mixture and his strong accent makes many of his texts incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> A surface coating from the 1960s was given which makes it eminently disposable; despite the efforts here and there of Minelli who are respectable. It's not even adapted from a non-musical story that has been successful in the past ... it's just too passionate! Streisand occasionally has some fun bargains to offer, such as when trying not to fall asleep on its roof and improvising an energetic dance. But she relies too much on her catchy (translation: irritating) kooky, shtick Jewish girl. However, he can sing very well, both in the "delicate" and in the "powerful" endings of the range. Amidst a series of musical waste, he gets 3 or 4 incredible songs * of a much higher level than what Fanny and Dolly had to offer. 'He is not you' is a sublime sweet nonsense like "My Funny Valentine" by Lorenz Hart, but the film is unable to make any impact from it; because the lyrics don't seem to refer to anything in the film, and nothing suggests that a great love blossoms between Chabot and Melinda. <br /> <br /> The only cut we can see is a poor job of a war ax a much bigger film. A strong search shows a longer film, better explained and more decorative, but not necessarily better on: http://barbra-archives.com/films/clear_day_streisand_2.html. You can be sure there are more Babs in that version, but above all, there will be more thoughtful work from Minelli. <br /> <br /> In the end Montand sends Babs to sing the title song, after he discovers he is a total cock that feeds her a homily of self-esteem to leave behind. And she bites. So, uh ... cheers for that. <br /> <br /> (* Hurry up is nice up here, love with all the bows, he is not you, and the song of the title)
