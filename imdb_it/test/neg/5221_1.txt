Normally, I don't like Chuck Norris movies. I appreciate his work as a martial artist and his fight scenes are usually quite well choreographed. Chuck is undeniably one of the great martial artists. So, in my used bookstore, I found a movie I had never seen before and brought it home. <br /> <br /> While the acting in this film was worse than most of Chuch Norris's films, I was hoping to see at least one fight scene. I immediately started to understand that this was not a typical Chuch Norris film; rather it was a Christian film, intended to illustrate the paradigm of "winning good will". <br /> <br /> There is really nothing on the package to indicate that it is a Christian film, except for the label. .. Goodtimes Entertainment, of which I had never heard of before. I will certainly keep it in mind the next time I see a film of that company. <br /> <br /> I have no problems with Christianity ... I have a problem with devious proselytism. If someone is going to make a religious film, at least he has the good sense to tell the viewer that this is how he will get it. The only part that redeems the exercise is that I spent only $ 3.25 to spend 97 minutes watching a great martial artist who doesn't fight. At least it was during dinner time, and I spent a little of what I cooked and ate. <br /> <br /> In short, if you're looking for a mediocre martial arts film, and don't hope for much, don 'don't worry about this movie because it doesn't even offer it.
