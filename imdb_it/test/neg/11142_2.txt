I like underground movies when they have something to say, or show, for that matter. I tried trying "Trash". I tried to see some artistic results, or some interesting representation of New York life in the early 1970s. Or at least be entertained by it? But the film sucks and cannot be called art or entertainment. <br /> <br /> "Trash" is basically an excuse to expose Joe Dallesandro's naked body for 2 hours, while he meets other uninteresting and boring figures (I agree, this is a wonderful body, but no excuse for a whole movie about it, right?). Holly Woodlawn, like Joe's girlfriend, offers some good laughs at the end, but then it's too late to save those wasted a couple of hours. Lou Reed's classic song "Walk on the Wild Side" is a better representation of those people and of that moment, even though it is more fascinating than they actually were. 1.5 / 10.
