Eddie Murphy has put a lot into this film with written direction and produced this story about two nighclub owners in the 1930s trying to fight the mobsters and corrupt cops from taking over their club ... an exceptional cast in Murphy Redd Foxx, Richard Pryor, Danny Aiello, Della Reese and a splendid jasmine boy who would be worth seeing for themselves ... but the story does not arouse interest or gives enough cast to work with ... on a scale of one to ten. .a 4
