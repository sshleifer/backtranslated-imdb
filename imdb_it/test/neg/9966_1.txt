I listened to legends about this "movie" (phrases used to not insult movies) for a while, so when I finally got the DVD, I started looking at it impatiently. In the end, I had to * quickly advance through only some of the most absurd, meaningless scenes that made no sense of this useless childish mess to end it faster. <br /> <br /> This could be the worst movie I even "touched" - and I was associated with Troma for a while. "Manson Family" makes Troma's voices appear as bold and revolutionary works of art. I could go on and talk about the syphilitic skeleton of a "plot" that it has, of wickedly disgusting "acting", of painful and inept "direction", sets and props with their "ninety-nine dollar" look (in particular "loved" "the plastic toy guns used in the Tate murder scene!) or the nauseating aspect of this whole garbage bag (I think it should have been a drug-induced hallucination, I have absolutely no idea how a hallucination induced by drugs look or test, nor do I want to find out - but I imagine that drug addicts with burned "brains" will love this "movie" (they seem to be the ones who did it) I have seen many films of various "Worst" 50 "lists, traditionally opened by those of Eddie Wood - and Eddie Wood would remain horrified by the pure ineptitude and without talent of van Webber (or whatever it's called, I certainly don't want to remember) I've never seen" Superbabies "or its continuation or, but I would strongly like "Manson" to join them in the IMDb chart. Fortunately, this obscure Robotic garbage will not be seen by enough spectators to sufficiently justify many "1" votes - and all the better!
