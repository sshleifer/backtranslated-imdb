The "leader" of the Monkees is one of those peculiar phenomena that I noticed - that when something doesn't make sense, people will try to read things and attribute great deep meanings to it, which its creator never intended. This is the case here. <br /> <br /> The film is a spectacle of consciousness of the Monkees that floats in and out of various sketches, blackouts, set pieces, etc. Similar to those of their television program. But while the television show was played for laughter, this does not seem to be interpreted at all except a sort of deep, trippy, pseudo-intellectual state that this brand of psychedelia imposes. All in all, it's The Monkees doing the same schtick, but now it's "raising the consciousness" because the trace of laughter is removed. There is no point of humor or meaning for the whole thing; the music of "Head" should show anyone, beyond the shadow of doubt, that the Monkees did not have a minimum of songwriting skills. The melodies are mostly junk; the only one that is even listenable is "Porpoise Song", which opens and closes the film. But the fact is that it was a Gerry Goffin-Carole King song and, although it is above the average of the Monkees, it is below the average of the Goffin and King standards. It's like listening to one of the old Peter And Gordon songs that Paul McCartney wrote for them: you might think it's a pretty good song, but then find out who made it and you realize it's thrown away. Mike Nesmith's song is perhaps passable, the rest is worthless. Davy Jones has, I imagine, what the filmmakers imagined to be "the big number" in the picture, since it's the only song presented as As Show Biz and not cut into a film montage or a dream sequence, but it's also flat, just because the song is not good. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I've always liked Monkees, so the film is a real disappointment. Sure, they were cheese, but they were so happy about it. <br /> <br /> They knew they were made of cheese and they were fantastic. But then they became ambitious. In "Head", they actually joke about being a manufactured pop product, but the truth is that they wanted something more. They wanted to be great musicians and taken seriously as artists. Maybe not like the Beatles, but something that comes close to this. "Head" shows that they failed on all fronts. 1 * out of 4
