GOOD: The acting was exceptional, in particular Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. Terrence Howard should have run as best supporting actor instead of Matt Dillon. <br /> <br /> THE BAD: I am a visible minority (not white) and have experienced some form of racism in my life. BUT despite my life experiences and the subject of the film, I would NOT say that this film is the best of the year, in fact, it is FAR from it. I have problems with this film both from the point of view of the viewer and from the point of view of a visible minority. Some of my problems with this film are: <br /> <br /> (1) Poor (or completely absent) character development. Just because we've seen the extremes in a character, for example, Matt Dillon is a racist cop and can be a good helper for his sick father, that doesn't mean in any way that the character is well developed. Yes, I admit that in a great cast like this movie, it's pretty hard for any character to be well developed, BUT that doesn't mean that none of the characters should be like that. <br /> <br /> (2) The dialogue seems really elaborate to the point that I'm really surprised that this film won the Best Original Screenplay. They should show this film in a script of a script NOT because it's good but to show students and future screenwriters what NOT to do. I felt like I was hit by the head over and over again as was racial. I understood. <br /> <br /> (3) The plot seems so random, it's ridiculous. What are the chances of a black machine thief who invests an Asian boy who also happens to be a human trafficker as he enters his van, and the same black car thief ended up stealing that different Asian boy's van hours after she brought him the hospital, only to find out that the various Asians are being trafficked inside the van just to show you that the black car thief has a nice side, after all? Or, what about that scene in which a prejudiced, upper-class white woman who fell down the stairs and all her prejudice and hatred vanished into thin air? If it were that simple, why don't we throw all the racists in America down the stairs so they change their minds? <br /> <br /> (4) I think my biggest doubts about this film are the unrealistic view of racism. As someone who has experienced racism in my life, the realistic view of racism is that it is hidden rather than in your face. I was refused entry into a supermarket because I am not white. The shop owner said why wasn't I white? No, he said the store was closing even though there was a lot of people shopping inside. Did he scream racist insults? No. Racism in America is more hidden. Some taxi drivers probably won't stop to pick you up because you're not white, but that doesn't mean that they will try to discourage you or go out and say racist insults. If a Chinese woman holed me up, I won't say "blake! Blake! Learn an English bitch!" On the other hand, if I were a Chinese woman and accidentally ended up a Mexican woman, I won't say "Mexicans are bad drivers" in front of her face. That's not how things work. Instead, I would give my information on the insurance, apologize, and go home and tell my Chinese friend friends and my family that the Mexicans are poor drivers and make fun of them behind their backs. This is true racism. It is hidden and not on your face. <br /> <br /> However, Crash is not original unlike what some people might say. The weaves, the plots and the intertwined and interwoven characters have already been made before. "Magnolia" is a film that does much better than Crash, yet it has never been nominated for the best film at the Oscars. He had a stellar cast - Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who won best actor recently), Tom Cruise, etc. It really drives me crazy about how Crash was named best film.
