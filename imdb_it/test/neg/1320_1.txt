Bad as they get. This film makes the fatal mistake of making the viewer not worry about what happens to the characters. The two women in this movie are so stupid that they start rooting for the bad guys so this thing would end. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the few that was so bad that I had to turn to another channel. <br /> <br /> Put in intellectual language, this film lacks verisimilitude. People, not even the people of Ohio, simply don't behave like that. Well, maybe the writers do it. <br /> <br /> There is not enough beer in the world to make this movie bearable. <br /> <br /> F903
