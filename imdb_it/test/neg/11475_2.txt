This film is not one of those films that is so ugly that it bothers you and you get angry because it looks like it is so alone yet it's not funny at all. It's just that there's nothing interesting about this movie. There are no jokes that will entertain you, you just have to watch for 80 minutes, then turn it off. I bought it on very cheap DVDs and I'm happy because it's not worth much. This is not even one of those movies that is so ugly that you can watch it with friends when you get drunk / up high and have a good laugh. I didn't hate it as I hate some movies, but it's pretty boring, and it's not worth investing in any time. <br /> <br /> The only people who voted 10 votes for this film must have been connected in some way because I can't imagine that someone really likes this movie except for the little kids who spend their time
