I lost my time This is a very pretentious film. At first you think something is happening but within 30 minutes you realize that nothing is happening. I waited for another 20 minutes and since then I was so frustrated that I started reading reviews on IMDb and realized that the director lost precious time for so many people. <br /> <br /> Incredibly boring useless movie. Stay away. So many good soundtracks. I will give a point for the police inspector's joke because this worked for me. I laughed a lot but for the rest it's a bad movie. Stay away.1 10.
