This movie is terrible. Not only is the story unbelievable, the situations in which the characters fit are so stupid, to the point that it's not shocking. I find it sad that Daisy Eagan, the Broadway star of The Secret Garden, decided that this would be a step forward. The idea is interesting, two young girls become very fast. But sex isn't even exciting. The film is stupid, the story is stupid, the performances are silly, and the whole concept while the interesting falls flat. I'm sure all 14-year-old girls go out with the boys after they've had their first spell and tried to throw their panties in the toilet. Better luck next time guys. My scale * T-Scale *
