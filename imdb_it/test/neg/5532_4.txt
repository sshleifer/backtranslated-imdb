This is a very interesting knowledge! "Stories with two fists" contains three silly and childish episodes - the genre is not actually horror or action, more like a happy medium. Where's the suspense? Where's the fun? Where is the common sense? Definitely not here, but if you don't expect to get it, don't necessarily miss it. <br /> <br /> The first segment is called "Showdown". It is a violent and absurd western. I didn't understand the whole idea. "King of the road" is a stupid story starring Brad Pitt. At the time of "Two Fairy Tales" it was just a pretty face that didn't know how to behave. Fortunately he learned the skill later and is now a fantastic and talented actor, one of the greatest of the younger generation. The story is almost ok in all its stupidity. The final episode "Yellow" is the only segment that has almost entirely succeeded. It's silly but fun. We have to thank Kirk Douglas for this. <br /> <br /> This movie is something to watch when you sit in an armchair and eat popcorn. (I should know, that's what I did.) If you loved "Tales from the Crypt", you'll love "Two-fisted tales" also because it's all the same. I understand that these three episodes are actually extremely rare "pieces of art" and very difficult to find anywhere. I have the whole package on VHS but I don't think it's a great privilege. You'll have to be a huge Brad Pitt fan to look for it. Otherwise, don't worry, it's not worth it. Nonsense.
