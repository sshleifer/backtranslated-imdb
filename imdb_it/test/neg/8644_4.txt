William Petersen (that boy from C.S.I) has a small unaccredited role but it's the best part of the film. His character comes across an intelligent and hard ass, and it's a funny surprise to see him in this. It has a range that allows it to play on just about anything. After its 5 minutes, it goes from cold to little else. He lets you hope his character reappears in the movie but after 20 minutes you lose hope. The film itself is rather poor. It's worth looking at a TMN or a library retreat but not much more. Too much reminds you of LA Confidential except that where the film starts to get complicated on itself, this is so loose, that it turns everywhere but where it should. 2 out of 5 stars
