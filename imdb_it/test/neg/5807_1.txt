Honestly, this could be the worst movie I've ever seen. And I saw Spider Baby and Not of This Earth. Heck, I've even seen 200 motels. Having just discovered the Freaks and Geeks series and being surprised by Linda Cardellini's acting ability, I checked the reviews and decided it was worth trying. This is the LAST time I will ever rely on a review on IMDb. I didn't realize that MORONS was writing IMDb reviews while waiting for their calls to be heard on the AM radio. <br /> <br /> This film is so beyond evil that mere words cannot express the misery of its vomiting state. Seriously. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you think Will Farrel is really very funny, if you think Adam Sandler is a comic genius. Watch this movie but PLEASE DON'T PICK!
