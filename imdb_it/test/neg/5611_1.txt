This film had so much potential to be hilarious but moving, but it wasn't up to it. It had a fabulous plot, it wasn't as big as it could have been. The strange "hallucinations" during his sleep scenes made absolutely no sense and were not absolutely necessary, had no impact or improved or provided any understanding of what would happen or happened. <br /> <br /> The character of Jon Heder was OK but could have been expanded on more. He played the disgusting part that was best given him. The character was funny, but again, he was not up to what could have been. Mila's character was perfect and her performance was perfect. <br /> <br /> In closing, the writing was horrible and most of the time, it made no sense and his hallucinations did not fit the film at all. This film, with better scripting and directing, could have been a National Lampoon's Vacation contender with regards to the fun and bad things that happen to a person on a journey across America. <br /> <br /> Instead, it was only worthy of a second "flush". If I had seen this at the theater, I would have asked for my money back and boycotted the movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that made this film was losing an hour and a half of my life. He also managed to make all those involved in the film look bad, simply because the film was a stinker. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone! Never!
