Clearly, Andreas Bethmann would like to wear the crown of Jess Franco while aiming (at least cinematically) at the wife of the old workhorse, Lina Romay. Romay plays a corrupt, salacious prison guard who masturbates in this modern, ambitious W.I.P. movie. With a few exceptions, many of Franco's films are flawlessly produced and directed in a hasty and hasty manner. Shots don't always come together and sound mixes can be horrible. While watching "Angel of Death 2" (aka "Prison Island Massacre") I wondered if Bethmann was deliberately trying to replicate Franco's lack of patents, or is he just as natural as his mentor? Is this film deliberately bad, would it be counterproductive or is it simply negative through negligence? After a hitchhiker was forced to give a blowjob, his rapist fills his mouth, then fills her vagina with some medications. A few minutes later, she is dragged to a prison at the top of a cliff for unexplained reasons and subjected to malcontents and ill-treatment of staff and other prisoners. Since this is a WIP movie, there are lesbian scenes galore and a lot of violent behavior. Blood is also bloody and sadistic, with delights like the teeth that pull and the scalp (courtesy of Olaf Ittenbach). The acting is pretty horrible and the fighting scenes are limping, but there's a love of squalor in every frame and an understanding of what trash fans appreciate. Unfortunately, the flat script makes a film flat. So, despite numerous atrocities, hardcore sex and a Jess Franco appearance, the experience is empty. But isn't that what most of Jess Franco's films are?
