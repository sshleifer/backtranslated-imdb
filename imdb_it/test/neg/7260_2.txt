This movie starts showing you a map and then explaining the radar and it's a long time before you can see the deadly mantis. Probably a better movie in the 50s this dated piece is a bit slow in movement and the pay off at the end is not very good. Although he has his moments like when Perry Mason's boyfriend argues with an old man and when he says "I narrowed the possibilities down to one" excuse me, but when it narrows something you have a couple or more possibilities not one ... take it down to one you have not restricted, but in fact you understand what it is. The monster is the science fiction fair of the 50s, better than to say the grasshoppers in The beginning of the end. Acting is sub-par and heroin is the most attractive ... in fact in some shots it looks like a drag type. You see many shots of fighter planes and other things, but you won't see much of the deadly mantis.
