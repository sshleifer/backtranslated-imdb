PLEASE folks! DON'T worry about this little direct joke. The management was totally wrong from the beginning. Where is the story of his mother's emotional interference and general madness in the original family? Why is DE described as this imposing, imposing imposing figure full of anger and hatred? What is this shit? The writer and director obviously did not do research on history and just wanted to cash in on the notorious name of Gein. The fools who made this film have taken so many liberties with the truth, it's ridiculous. If you want to see a brilliant Gein movie. back to the classic minor "Deranged" to see how Ed really was. There is humor in that film, and Ed is portrayed as more than the sad, lonely light man he was, according to HISTORY. Where is the background story here? There are only badly regulated shocks (which are not shocking) we have seen before, and even more accomplished. Get the worst scam at the Texas Chainsaw massacre and add it to that list. I had to give him ONE in ten because the evaluation would not accept ZERO. I want my money back. If someone considers this film as "amazing", they could get a financial bribe to do it.
