TART is the worst movie I've seen this year, and it includes both the Affleck / J.Lo GIGLI bomb and Rob Zombie's BOREfest HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES. I don't know if this is a fair comparison since the TART was created two years earlier and probably has a budget equal to that of even the low-budget CORPSES. Regardless of this, all three films suffer from the same faults: horrible screenplay, horrible acting, horrible direction. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** (although I honestly don't think there's anything to ruin) <br /> <br /> TART is about a bunch of super-spoiled private school kids. Most of them reside in large apartments along the hyper-expensive Park Avenue, thanks to the finances of their negligent parents. The film depicts the aimless life of one of the students (Cat) as she discards her only true friend (like a frivolous person like her) in the pursuit of "good life" with the crowd. This, of course, leads to sex, drugs and music which is substantially worse than rock & roll. Everything is overly dramatized in the way that bad movies are usually. Cat's first sexual experience brings his being branded as a vagabond and ostracized by his newly acquired circle of friends; her first encounter with drugs almost led her to be dumped in a garbage can after her cohorts believed her dead from an overdose. No heavy messages out there, he said sarcastically. <br /> <br /> This is mainly what the "100 times before" plot involves. Other minor, and even less interesting, details include a friend who steals jewels and odds and ends from everyone else, a wild child who lives on the edge (and eventually falls one night in the EST Hamptons), an anti-British Semitic Chick ending her close friendship with Cat as she discovers that Cat has a Jewish father and Cat's tense relationship with a single mother who unsuccessfully tries to convince Cat to appreciate the privileged life she has. The thief turns out to be an unrecoverable unfaithful life. The "wild child" is interpreted as a muted version of one of the Hilton sisters. The English girl disappears from the film after the separation. The mother / daughter relationship is seen as totally irrelevant until the final scene of the film, where she and her besieged mother have a sort of reconciliation. * yawn * <br /> <br /> *** END SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> About the cast and crew ... Dominique Swain came on the strong scene with her role as a seductress LILITA underage and FIA / OFF highly illuminabile of 1997. His performances were strong enough to take her on a lot of lists "alone to look" at the time. He was 17 and I hope they won't be the best roles in his career. If he takes on some more roles like the one he plays in TART, it could be very nice. <br /> <br /> I saw Bijou Phillips in another film (BULLY) and I swear that his performance in that movie one was almost identical to the one he gave here. I'm not sure he isn't capable of giving various shows or if it was just a coincidence that his roles in the two were very similar. My hypothesis is that the first is true. I feel that this woman has a very small talent for acting. Here, she is the actress touched to portray her watered-down sister Hilton. The fact that you record such a weak performance is surprising, given that she has grown and remains friends with the real-life Hilton sisters. She's essentially playing a version of herself in this movie, and damned doing it. <br /> <br /> As for the writer / director Christina Wayne ... I don't know anything about her except that TART was her first, and only, film project to date. With a first effort like this, it's no wonder that his career in the entertainment world was short lived.
