"Beowulf" is like a very ugly game: no character, no story, no real dialogue, bad fighting ... It is probably the worst film in the history of cinema. It's deadly boring, it's a waste of time. I'm really sorry for Christophe Lambert, who visibly doesn't know how to choose a role. If anyone suggests you see "Beowulf", believe me: run like crazy.
