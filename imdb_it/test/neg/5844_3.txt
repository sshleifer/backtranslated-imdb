A good example of the differences between American and foreign cinema can be seen in a film I saw recently on television: Indecent Proposal. <br /> <br /> The two protagonists of Indecent Proposal, David and Diane Murphy are played by Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore. I'm not sure if it was their total lack of chemistry or that they weren't doing well, but why we should worry so much if these two get together were beyond me. Love, affection, playfulness, attraction ?? none of these materialized on the screen in their interactions together. <br /> <br /> Since I knew that Robert Redford would eventually arrive, it was clear from the beginning that the best part, the film's flesh, would be the scene between him and Demi Moore. Poor Woody Harrelson failed to pick up any emotion for the film. He seemed to have restrained himself, worried about his receding hairline. <br /> <br /> OK, so fast forward. What idiots these two (Diane and David) are thinking of being able to win back the $ 50,000 owed by gambling. There is no false step in progress, only a horribly bad, lazy, unforgivable writing. Obviously they lose all their money. Surprised? I know I wasn't. Enter Robert Redford (John Gage in the film) ?? a romantic man, perhaps emotionally frigid, an updated Gatsby. A very good role and, although not a great, great actor, alongside those two, Redford resembles Olivier. He immediately falls in love and craves with Diane and we, for once, feel like spectators. This is like loving a woman! It's not David's way, swapping the mouth-to-mouth rubber with Diane on a slimy pier. (I've seen it right?) Like Gage, Redford wears a suit and tie in every scene. Yes, it aims to educate the seemingly cerebral public who is a rich man here, but he too looks damn good and at this point the audience of the dead brain appreciates it! The other symbolism of the wardrobe includes David's shirts now ironed at the end of the film, which signify resoluteness, which come together after a long, curly and worn shirt parenthesis. <br /> <br /> And what is it with the California garden parties as depicted in Hollywood movies? Suddenly everyone appears British, complete with lace dresses, three-piece suits for men, hats (HATS!) And of course the parasol. Yes, Diane, her transformation with Rich Man's girlfriend now complete, is there during the auction that gently turns a parasol. Although he had insisted that it could not be bought, he eventually succumbed to sexual tension. This is where the film branches out into pure American. I mean, obviously David and Diane will end up together, my question is, WHY? Diane was bored with David, why not let her ride the Robert Redford wave? And I mean for quite some time? How can she get out of this sexy older man's sexual romantic slave so easily just because Woody Harrelson brings his receding hairline to the garden party, sits down and looks Demi Moore in the eye. This is not exactly how it goes. He was so DEBTED. <br /> <br /> But we must have our happy ending. We must swallow the moral lesson. We are not sophisticated enough to have it otherwise. Director Lyn tried to make a fatal attraction for the young juvie set. <br /> <br /> In addition to garden parties where there is not even an SUV, a T-shirt or a baseball cap in sight, these films also have a reliable public transport system that connects cities and municipalities of California far away. How else to symbolize the return to the middle class or to the life of the working class?
