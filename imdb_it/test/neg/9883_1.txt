There were only two saving features for this film; the beauty of Bucharest and its architecture, and the way they represented the transformation from human form to the shape of the wolf. Forget the plot or the plot of the book - they are completely absent from this film. In fact, the only things reported by the book are the names of the main players. Even then you will barely recognize the characterizations. If the directors had made a good film, even if it wasn't linked to the book, I wouldn't have been so disappointed. Unfortunately no. The plot and the plot are typical of low-budget horror films, the acting is in wood and the directorial efforts are trivial. Oh yes, the way the loup garou bows to their leader is pure hoe. I suppose a nod of recognition is due to animal breeders. The wolves were beautiful animals and well managed in their roles.
