Ugh. Quite awful. <br /> <br /> Linnea Quigley gets top billing, but her character doesn't have a big part. Who is his character, however, should be the child's aunt? Another user commented that he was getting naked in a shower scene. While there was a shower scene in the movie, it was a head and shoulder shot. Perhaps there are some alternative versions of this film. <br /> <br /> Quigley still has a bigger part than John Carradine, Cameron Mitchell and Brinke Stevens. Carradine appears briefly in a monastic dress, reciting a vague dialogue. No other character is in the scene with him, even if he is a kind of composer, or there are over-the-shoulder shots that unquestionably belong to someone else. There is also a bad photo of him in a cameo (it looks like a bad photocopy), and a decent photo of him in a family bible. He initially evoked Jack-O, or something like that. <br /> <br /> Cameron Mitchell briefly shows up on a TV as a TV horror host. Brinke Stevens is in the film that is showing "The Coven", in which he runs around a cemetery in a tunic. Evidently there is more of the Brinke movie as a bonus feature of the Retromedia double film, Mark of the Witch / The Brides Wore Blood. <br /> <br /> Jack-O: what is it? Damn if I know. A child is told a story about a pumpkin head demon killer, and he and some other children are scared of a woman who they think is a witch for some reason. She follows him home and offers to help his family with their haunted garage for Halloween (put your hand in a hole and hear eyeballs that are actually grapes, etc.). The pumpkin-head killer shows up several times to hold the branches while he is watching people, or he holds the scythe in front of the camera and he poses with it for a while. Sometimes he can do more than just keep things, and actually he kills people. <br /> <br /> There are also some flashbacks in a western family or prairie, with the little boy playing the child in that same family: his ancestors, I think. I think they take the backstory of Jack-O into consideration, but I'm not sure how. <br /> <br /> The boy is apparently the main character, but in reality we do not learn anything about him except that he wears glasses, has nightmares and will fight bullies, even if he is beaten in the process. More time should have passed to establish his character. I couldn't have cared less if he died. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, not even for Halloween.
