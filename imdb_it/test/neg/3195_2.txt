Wow. I saw One Night at McCool's yesterday, and all I can say is "Wow". <br /> <br /> Here I am. MAJOR SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> Would you like a summary of the plot, just to see how stupid and useless this movie is? I would never tell anyone to watch it, unless I was able to inflict pain on them. However, here is a glimpse (or a huge piece) of the plot. <br /> <br /> Randy works for a bar, McCool's. He meets this woman named Jewel who convinces him, surprisingly, to have sex with him. His ex-boyfriend ends up trying to rob them and he is killed. Randy and his cousin and the crime scene detective all fall for Jewel. She, being the mascot of stupidity, uses each of these guys to get what she wants, involving a DVD player. Randy hires a hit man to kill her, and eventually the detective is killed by the ex-boyfriend's psycho brother and the assassin and Jewel take off. <br /> <br /> Seriously. That's all. I left almost nothing except a few sex scenes and an almost pornographic Liv Tyler scene while Jewel used a tube to show off her sexuality. <br /> <br /> What was the point of this film? To be honest, I think it was so that producers and directors could show their male impulses. Which I think is absolutely unheard and simply stupid. When I watch a movie, I want a plot. I want characters I don't care about the sexy woman who flaunts everything she might have. Something should happen in a movie, for heaven's sake. It's as bad as Fight Club. <br /> <br /> It'll be even worse. John Goodman is the detective dedicated to being superior. I myself wondered why Goodman would act in something as outrageously pitiful as this, but then I remembered that he was in O Brother, where are you? also. His reputation has just fallen by one level. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler was an incredible actress in the series Lord of the Rings. In this film, he is nothing but an unintelligent slut who wants nothing more than his path. His reputation has fallen by seven or eight notches for me. <br /> <br /> I am amazed, simply amazed that people work so hard to do something so stupid. The music is absolutely disgusting (having a recital of "YMCA" while the character of John Goodman is killed doesn't really fit), the characters are totally unlikely, the plot is one of the most stupid ever conceived by man, and finally, it doesn't even fit any kind. The closest possible is the pornographic comedy. If it even had to be fun. Which was not. <br /> <br /> I think I've finished ranting now. But I assure you that no one in their right mind would ever want to, never see this movie. Unless they want Liv Tyler as much as the characters, it is.
