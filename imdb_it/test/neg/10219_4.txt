According to Randolph Scott's 1950s standards, this is a disappointing and heavy-handed western star. Two or three characters could be dispensed, while two or three other characters could have more prominence. (The humor must be completely rewritten). De Toth handles the action well - as always - but his understanding of the general narrative is weak.
