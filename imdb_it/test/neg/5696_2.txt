So it's a film about space. But it's low budget. Ask, "and the effects?" The effects are sometimes good, and sometimes really, really bad. I mean bad. And I noticed that I started with the effects. <br /> <br /> There's a story here, but it's told in what I think is the wrong order. I don't mean a wrong style of Tarantino. I mean, it's said in a completely non-absurd agreement. Most are about a mother (in the future, because you know, it's science fiction) as told by her daughter, which is mainly a narrative exhibition from the point of view of her daughter. Only once you finish the first hour and hear the voice of Paul Darrow as a computer, do you realize how much more consistent the narrative would have been if he had read it. This story is so constant and inclusive, that the actors on the screen barely utter a word for the first hour. There is also a lesson here for you, emerging filmmakers: if you are not doing 2001 and want to have some action (this does), then PLEASE hire a good choreographer fighter. Otherwise, your fights will be like, well, what's in BATTLESPACE. And note that the title contains the word "battle". Ugh. <br /> <br /> I think this could be the classic scenario of trying to make a film based on nothing more than a concept. And some effects. My biggest surprise is to see the IMDb advertisement of this film which costs 1.8 million dollars. When you compare it to something like PRIMER, which has done better with a budget of a few thousand, you realize that in filming on a low budget, it's all based on history. I didn't expect much - but I was still disappointed. Two out of ten stars.
