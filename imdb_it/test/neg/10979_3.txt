This film starts from A and never reaches enough B. The title promises much more than the film has. It is superficial and full of the usual clich√©s of a story in which a boy questions his sexuality. People are pleasant, even the obligatory flamboyant type. The protagonist (Kevin McKidd) drags himself to the extent that there is a reason for him to act completely. Simon Callow, who plays a horny scale, is always worth looking at, and is by far the only reason to stay with the film. However, the garbage on the "meditations" of his group of men or on whatever is accumulating becomes extremely boring in a short time. They seem to have been thrown into the delicate mix of the film in a misleading effort to vary the setting and the uninterrupted non-stop. The same comment applies to a very strange and unconvincing campsite. Don't worry about pausing the tape so you can have a snack. Let the thing run; you will not miss anything. Hugo Weaving's character is superfluous. It appears in a sequence with one of the minor leads and does not even satisfy the rest. The outcome of that sequence is not explained, and Hugo's real estate affairs have nothing to do with history. The film is a total disappointment in the end, because there is no solution. The thing simply fades away and we are sent to the credits. This is an interlude without structure.
