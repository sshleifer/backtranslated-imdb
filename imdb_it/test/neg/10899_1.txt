If you just want blood, and nothing but blood and torture, you've come to the right movie. If you want at least a splinter of good acting, logic, history, consistency, or even a good guy who ends up, go elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I couldn't help thinking of myself, "Jeeeez, are those people mentally challenged?" Example, after being chased and seeing other mutilated people, the main actress meets an agent of police and pours his story to the policeman with tears and everything and tells him about the psychopath who drives on a yellow truck. The yellow truck pulls up and the officer approaches, talks to the boy and the truck leaves without problems. The actress goes out and says why didn't you arrest him? And then the truck runs over the police officer ... after being rammed the truck stops on the road about 20 meters away right there while the actress tries to drag the cop away but it's too heavy. (At the time) At that moment the truck stops and runs twice on the police leg. The truck then leaves. Because the actress did not get the gun is beyond me. (Which then fires twice at the policeman because the psychopath is about to burn him alive) Once through the mouth, which did not kill him (Duuuumb) and twice to finish the job. * Relax your eyes * Immediately afterwards, he turns to escape the bathroom that is about to explode and when he climbs near the roof, he turns around and the policeman is gone ... OK ... <br /> <br / > Another example, the main actress meets a woman trapped in the bathroom, spits like a liter of blood on the floor, covering about 1/3 of the room. (Probably more) After the main actress leaves to get a towel, she comes back in and everything is gone. : / They don't explain why everyone keeps disappearing. Stupid stupid. <br /> <br /> I like horror / thriller / gore movies, but this was just too stupid. I lost brain cells looking at this dribble and you shouldn't do it too.
