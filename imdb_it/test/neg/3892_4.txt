DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE! <br /> <br /> I had to understand why all the critics did court this movie. I saw it and I still don't understand. The texture is thin, very thin. After the film was finished, I did not yet know the name of the female protagonist and one of the two male characters did not even have a name in the credits, he is credited as "the farmer". I didn't care about the characters, so I didn't care about the movie. <br /> <br /> The scenery and the cinematography were fantastic, but they are also fantastic on National Geographic or The Discovery Channel. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie to anyone.
