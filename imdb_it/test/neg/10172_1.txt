This film was the biggest piece of junk I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> It is marketed as Sci-Fi when in reality it is nothing more than a Christian recruitment tool. <br /> <br /> It tells you a little about the state of the Christian church, when they have to resort to deception only to make you listen to their sales pitch. But then again what do you expect from an organization that would do anything to help protect such a huge amount of child molesters in their organization. <br /> <br /> Religion is full of nothing but sexual deviants, hypocrites, and war merchants. Let's not forget, our clumsy former president actually came out and said "God told him" to invade Iraq. And no one wondered if he heard voices or saw things? <br /> <br /> Anyway, going on the subject here. No, this film has nothing to do with UFOs, it is nothing but a religious production.
