I tried to appreciate this show, really, but I can't find a reason why anyone might like it. The narrative lines are weak, the acting is weak and unbelievable. It seems that every member of the cast has been picked up randomly on the street. And it seems to me that the whole show is just a way to let Jamie Lynn Spears switch to movies. Each episode shows Zoey as the girl that every girl wants to be her best friend and that every guy wants to go out with him. It's always perfect and nobody is like that in real life. How can people relate to a character who is just a Barbie doll? Jamie Lynn's acting is right, but she is not an actress strong enough to play the lead role in a series. All the fans of the show are just young girls who don't know better. I'm sorry if you think my comments are too strict, but if you can find a significant and profound moment in this series that isn't quickly directed to a beach party, please accept my opinions and find something worth the worth watching.
