If I heard the male protagonist say "This is madness!" once again I would have vomited. The film is a great clich√©, with false "ground under your heel" attitudes. Not a male in this film has a redeeming quality; reminds me of the films of the Soviet era with strongly politically oriented messages. I couldn't even understand WHY there was attraction between the leads, nor could I wait for the ending.
