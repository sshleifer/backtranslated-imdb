See a movie called "battlespace", what will you think? Space battles are fantastic like explosions and they all shoot each other. What do you get with this movie? Well, get SOME goodness of space battle, but most of the time it's just stupid people wandering around doing almost nothing. NO INTERVIEWS !!!! What is this nonsense ?! We have a storyteller and a ton of English computers, but that's all. The main protagonist must be the worst I've ever seen, since he doesn't even have dialogues and sleepwalkers even though scenes (literally!). Some of the things that happen are simply stupid, as if they were using a missile (like going into space) for the side of the basic transport planet, why not just use one of those elegant spaceships? In any case, the music is almost non-existent, with some boring samples without boring life, but the main thing you'll notice is the Atari sound effects that ships use ... you're kidding me. I can also say that the budget was low, because everything seems fake, which is not what you would expect from a movie, especially what a super cool space battle film should be. I seriously believe that the budget is due to double digits which is so ugly, that makes you laugh more than you should, however unpleasant it is. I'm starting to think they paid the actors based on how much dialogue they had, because theirs is very small here (if you can't already say it's my main complaint here, as I probably said 3 times already).
