This film is TERRIBLE! He proposes to disgust you and make you laugh, but he fails horribly. The director obviously has no sense of the slap stick gore comedy, and the actors are like nothing I've ever seen - they lack both the acting talent and the comedy talent. Even their attempt to languish English is really sad, and in reality the peculiar Swedish accent in the lower right corner, where incoherent dialogue is spoken, is probably the most comical and amusing thing about this film. Even the blood is terrible and unconvincing. If you crave comedy, I suggest you go to a classic lesson like the series of evil deaths or, if necessary, even the dead brain. We all enjoy a damn good laugh, but it's ridiculous!
