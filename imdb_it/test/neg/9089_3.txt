This is strictly for Pryor fans. Just because he was a good guy, doesn't mean this is more than a B-Movie. The script is horrible, unfolds around constant crime and prisoners of war. It balances between comedy and melodrama and continues to fall on his face, rendering justice neither. <br /> <br /> First is there a rather unrealistic, uninspired 30 minutes of time as a Vietnam prisoner of war? at some point the guy is playing basketball ... How much more can you indulge your audience? ... That prison is boring, unconvincing and you can already easily put one to sleep. <br /> <br /> In the United States the boy without any reason is considered a "war hero". Yet, of course, it is soon forgotten by the public and seems to stumble across all kinds of extravagant setbacks. Or are they really? We'll find out soon. Yawn. There are boring clich√©s: his sick mother, his little daughter he never meets, a high-class prostitute who falls in love with the hero, etc. It is very strange how this film moves continuously from tragedy to slapstick in an instant. It doesn't work at all. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is actually just a bad comedy and does a bad service to prisoners of war. Just because this guy was a great stand-up comedian, starred in some good movies and died from MS, there's no reason not to be bothered by this silly, unconvincing, non-entertaining comedy. But if you like Richard Pryor, you'll probably be happy to read 3 hours of Dadaist poems.
