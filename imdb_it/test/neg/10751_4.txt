A mysterious murder on a Public Defender who was trying to cancel his client from a murder that the man had been sentenced 12 years earlier. Complicating things is the fact that he escaped custody after his conviction, but the PD believes that the man is innocent of the murder and works to find the real murderer. Gig Young like PD is fine, and James Anderson in the role of the convicted murderer is actually pretty good, but the image as a whole moves only with little suspense, and despite some good actors in the cast, the performances are generally at below average. Director George Archainbaud was apparently more comfortable with westerns - he was shooting the Gene Autry TV series at Columbia at the time - but even if he tried to inject all the vitality into this picture, the script would defeat his attempts. On average, at best, the film culminates in a court scene that came straight out of an episode of "Perry Mason" and is equally predictable.
