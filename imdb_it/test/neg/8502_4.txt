Other reviewers seem to have held this film in high regard. For something done by an eighteen year old film student, I would say good, but this is not the case. If you want to see a good graffiti film, go to documentaries. It is shot with the same quality as a digital home video. The two main characters are dismal actors and, once again, it would be fine if it were a student film. The plot follows a lonely artist who skateboards around Portland writing graffiti. He is joined by another and skates together creating art. Then comes the unnecessary gay love scene. Then comes the dispute between them that is never really discussed because this film is about as much dialogue as an image of Charlie Chaplin. This film shows the gravity that street artists give to their shape, and the music is pretty, but overall I wouldn't call it a movie.
