How could someone who liked the previous JP movies even if he is going to watch this 1 hour of drivel? There are so many stupid things about this movie that is shocking !! I remember when I went to see JP as a child, it was my favorite film and franchise, acting, SFX music, directing! all fantastic, JP2 in my opinion was fine more or less the same apart from some really stupid moments (like the gymnast who kicks a raptor ... please!) but overall a watchable and reasonable cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> But the third does not make sense !! It should be a sequel that Carry is broadcasting from JP2 yet magically includes new things about the franchise that would have been impossible to miss in the two previous films! for example: 1) The "new" mega Spinosaurus - Really, what the hell !! This thing follows them wherever they go, can't escape its presence and still in the lost world (the same island) you see it once? do you feel it has anyone ever mentioned? NO! It's ridiculous!. The main character of the 2 previous films was, and will always be the T-Rex, so what does d (urr) irector "Joe Johnston" do and what does it do? Kill him! as soon as you see the huge T-Rex in all its amazing glory, it is killed and you don't see it anymore: a new Dino in the city is the excuse ... where does it come from? !!? not a single explanation! and don't get me started on the whole Dino-belly satellite phone business! 2) Just when you start to get over how stupid the Spinosaurus is, see the Raptors, apart from their new "Punk" HairCuts they look pretty believable! * Phew * will make this movie watchable? ... MISTAKEN! now they talk to each other !! and the excuse for them talking in this film and not in the first and second are ... wait for it ... Evolution! - Yes, the process of millions of years in a few months after the end of the second film, unbelievable! grumpy should have been raised opposable inches and created tools by now !! OK, I'm not going to say anything more about the plot because my nose is coming up, so I'll close up on this: Jurassic Park is a classic, JP3 is a bad sucker punch for all the original fans of the series, my favorite franchise was really dead after seeing this monstrosity (no pun) Avoid this movie like the plague
