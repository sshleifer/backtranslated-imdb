Rich vs poor. Big city against small city. White collar vs blue collar. These things are not original themes in the movies. So when choosing to involve these themes, the plot of the situation should be very original or very good. This was neither one nor the other. I never believed in the love story of the two young lovers in this film. Neither convincing nor convincing, he simply fell. Don't worry, even with a video rental.
