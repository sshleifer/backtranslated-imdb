Only once, I'd like to see Koontz's work given to a decent screenwriter, director and producer! JUST ONCE! <br /> <br /> This is a good attempt by Jean LeClerc and Chris Sarandon and an even better attempt by Victoria Tennant, but everything else is pure unadulterated garbage. The writer should be shot to bastardize Koontz's work in this way and the director ... please. <br /> <br /> History is a well-written story, but the script is rather boring, incredible and horribly performed. The only elements that work are the performances of LeClerc, Sarandon and Tennant. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, I really wanted it to work. I love Koontz novels, but they never gave them the attention, support and talent they deserve. If they put the same money into Koontz's work shoveling for the barrels, full of King's, Koontz will quickly go upstairs. But alas! Without powerful people who believe in his work, I fear he will never have the chance. <br /> <br /> As an adaptation to the novel, this film was a real suck-fest. As a stand-alone film, it wasn't all that bad, although extremely weak in many places with huge holes in the plot and a terrible, rigid and unprofessional dialogue that should never have reached the final cut. This film failed miserably to live up to its potential. If they had followed Koontz's original work, a little closer, and invested a fair amount of money for production, this could have been a much better effort. <br /> <br /> However, all I can see in this, is how beautiful it would have been, and it was not. <br /> <br /> Evaluate a 4.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
