Like 'Singin' in the Rain ',' Cover Girl 'has a trio of two boys and a girl. In "Cover Girl", Phil Silvers (Genius) is the comic relief. It corresponds to the funny part of Donald O'Connor in "Singin in the Rain". In Cover Girl, Gene Kelly's love interest is Rita Hayworth and in 'Rain', it's Debbie Reynolds. Here's where the comparison ends. <br /> <br /> Considering that "Singin 'in the Rain" is a classic American musical, "Cover Girl" is an embodied mediocrity, the story is not very complicated Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) is a dancer in the nightclub at low-cost Danny MacGuire in Brooklyn. Rusty decides to participate in a Cover Girl contest sponsored by a wealthy publisher, John Coudair, who made an unsuccessful drama for Rusty's grandmother years ago.Comair introduces Rusty to Broadway producer Noel Wheaton Danny feels offended when Rusty starts to show up late for rehearsals at the nightclub and decides to close the nightclub and go on the street entertaining the troops with his aide, Genius. At the last minute, with Rusty at the altar with Noel, he realizes the error of his ways and runs to Danny, they live happily ever after. Gene Kelly has the least developed part in the film. is that he owns a nightclub and is madly in love and with Rusty. Coudair and Wheaton act like teenagers chained to Rusty and Phil Silvers offers a little silly, but unjustified. The most interesting aspect of Rita Hayworth's performance is the scene in which she gets drunk. This foreshadows what happened to her in real life. Anyone who has read her biography will find that she did not like Hollywood, she consumed herself for a normal life at home that she could never achieve, but eventually started drinking and ended up with Alzheimer's in full force during the last years of his life. <br /> <br /> Almost all Cover Girl songs are outdated and not very melodic. Gene Kelly only has a really excellent dance number and that's the scene where he dances with his "alter ego". Previously, the trio has another number that is a pale forerunner of 'Make em Laugh' from 'Singin' in the Rain '. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way Rita Hayworth is on a pedestal. A couple of decades later, Raquel Welch had the same problem. Both actresses later in their careers would always try to find screenplays that showed their acting skills. They wanted to be known as "actresses" and not "pin-up girls". Unfortunately, "Cover Girl" is an example of how Hollywood used women to make money.
