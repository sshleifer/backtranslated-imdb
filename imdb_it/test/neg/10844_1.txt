This is a strong recommendation to anyone who reads this review that has never seen the movie Total Reality, don't waste time and money by renting this excuse for a movie. This is unparalleled, the only worst film I've ever seen in my life. I've had nightmares of this movie since I saw it. The acting was terrible and every amateur director could make a more decent movie. The film dramatically rips out far superior science fiction films, like TimeCop or Total Recall (from which the title seems to derive). I'm sorry, but I think there's more entertainment value than looking at the side of a cardboard box for two hours. If you've seen this movie before, I'm sorry for having gone through what I've done.
