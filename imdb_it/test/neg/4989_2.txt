Let me tell you that I never wanted to see this film in the first place; I had to see it one day, and I thought I guess I could rejoice and enjoy it for what it is, and it could be fun. What I got with that expectation was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, without exception. First of all, there was nothing at all humorous. The creators expected humor to be ridiculous / passable if they included sarcasm in every line coming out of Underdog's mouth and used bland scenes after scene, interpreted as aspects to "enchant" the carefree side of the audience, while still making them "ooh" "and" ah "moreover with boring action scenes and tasteless and lackluster performances that made me want to scream at everyone who enjoyed themselves in the audience. Acting was boring, humor was boring and characters / plot felt as if they had spent about 10 minutes creating their entire personalities that gave the uninspiring actors / actresses the ability to portray their characters with the minimum depth.This film is simple and simply horrible in every field and in reality only children under the age of 10 will be able to enjoy it, which, even if it is what it was intended for, does not excuse it for being so rude and cause I feel so penitent. winners, spend your money on Up, Wall-E, The Spiderwick Chronicles, The Water Horse or Hotel for Dogs for the best family / children's movies, or even Alvin and the Chipmunks is better than this filth!
