I seem to disagree with a lot of people here. but I didn't find this film so sparkling as they claimed the reviews I read. It was undoubtedly a moving story and the partition's background provided the purpose of an epic. but the film was disappointed. especially for those who have seen "gadar". despite the main role played by the solemn deol and the incessant songs, I must say that the gadar is the best of the two. the story is pretty much the same. the partition failed to create any depth in its characters as well as scenes that should have had an impact. looking beyond Kristin Kruek's accent and the tiny image, which in itself was not an easy job. the characters didn't seem too real. not that I'm criticizing the acting by any of the protagonists. it just didn't work the atmosphere was well thought out, but the film really lacked substance. not that I'm a passionate rambo fan, but some action movies have seen the film, or some character development. it all seemed like a race to the finish line. and the ending has only added to the dissatisfaction of the spectators. <br /> <br /> nonetheles, I must say that it was at least a good effort in a territory apparently unknown by the director. and if U didn't see the gadar, then you'll also like the mite.
