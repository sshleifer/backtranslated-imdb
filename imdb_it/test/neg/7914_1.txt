This film is very scary with scenes in which the Devil uses Gabriel's horn to open Paradise and pull out good angel dogs and imprison them on Alkatraz. The devil sings and dances on some songs about the joys of being bad, and at some point, he eats a live mouse. <br /> <br /> We got this movie for free with a pizza. You get what you pay for.
