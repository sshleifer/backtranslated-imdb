This film is a juxtaposition of various super bad biker characters, loosely connected but without a real plot. Some scenes are well shot. If they took the same cast and the same crew, and made a movie called Gent that was the coolest character in the film and invented an interesting and continuing story maybe it could be decent. As it is, get ready for a series of difficult characters, who do nothing but ride the desert all day and cause problems while they never get tanned and keep their hair and clothes perfect and never need to look for a house or a money, etc. There was a sort of background story about the characters, about several people killed and about a treasure that probably had to be the plot.
