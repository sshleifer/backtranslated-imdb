Someone else called this movie a "fable-horror" movie, and I think it's quite suitable. This is the concept, at least. A group of teenagers, each with their own vice, attracts the attention of a twisted barker. He decides to teach teenagers a lesson by making them part of the freak show. A nice idea, but could have been done better. The fate for some of the boys has been pushed in the face too clearly, while other characters could have been enriched more. Furthermore, the ending was a serious disappointment. No resolution or big twist or anything. <br /> <br /> But as a low-budget horror movie, it's pretty fun to watch. If you like cheese spookfests, you should laugh at this. I think one of the flaws is anyway ... that it takes itself too seriously. It's a stupid movie, and if it was a little more self-conscious, I think it would have been better. But at least there are enough beautiful carnival themes and b-movie monster makeup to make you look.
