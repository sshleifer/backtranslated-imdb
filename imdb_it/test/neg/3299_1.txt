I saw the first episode of "The War at Home" because I thought it was worth replacing "Arrested Development", kid, I was disappointed. It should be clear to everyone that this show was clearly taken away from "Grounded for Life", "Titus" and "Married ... with Children" because they are all similar in plot and general mood. The so-called "punch lines" are all repetitive and formal, and even more those "punch lines" are not at all funny, for me, they are more in line with the fact of being coarse and coarse. The main character Dave Gold behaves like a white trash criminal, who thinks he is funny and fashionable, which he is not. (Even Hillary (Dave's daughter) said it in the episode "Gaza Strip"). <br /> <br /> In the episode "Dream Crusher", Hillary wanted to be a singer {but in reality she was pretty mean}, Dave and Vicky then willingly decided to crush his dreams by telling her that she sucked. After that, he wanted to become a child psychologist and he intended to go to Harvard, after telling Dave and Vicky so and left the room, the two began to tease her unscrupulously. Also, in the first episode Dave said of Hillary's "black boyfriend" "Do you really think we'll let her go out with this guy? I'd rather drink my own urine," that line has the dumbest line in television history. And Dave makes fun of Larry (his son) when he breaks the fourth wall because he thinks he's gay and is a misfit. Also, let's not forget that he also made fun of Larry's (fat) girl. Dave is the father who should defend his son, no matter what. "The War at Home" is without doubt the worst television program for the family. This clearly explains why the show should be canceled as it spreads a racist and homophobic program. It's like the show wants to be fun for always putting that stupid laugh every time someone says something, but the jokes are all somehow forced, idiotic and pathetically youthful. <br /> <br /> Another reason the show is horrible is acting, Mike Rappaport and Kyle Sullivan are terrible and terrible actors. Rappaport must always move his hands when he is in front of the camera, not only does he do it on this show, but he also did it during his time with "Boston Public". Sullivan speaks and behaves like a kind of robot every time he plays (he did it also in "Malcolm in the Middle"). <br /> <br /> So, to wrap up this story, you have all your reasons for what's wrong with this show 1. It's not original 2. Acting sucks 3. It's not even funny 4. All jokes are the same 5.Has lousy script 6. Characters are pitiful and unlikely 7.Dad is a rip-off of Archie Bunker <br /> <br /> FOX needs to remove this garbage, because everything is better than this.
