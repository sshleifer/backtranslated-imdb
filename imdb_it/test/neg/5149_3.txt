A shot of "Wacky Chick". A beauty contestant ends up dead and the usual suspects are gathered. Another voice in the vein of the Texas Cheerleader, this is a typical example of its kind. <br /> <br /> Yasmine Bleeth transforms into her usual girl-like performance, and Jill Clayburgh does a good job while her stressed-out mother is obsessed. <br /> <br /> Some slightly amusing moments that listen to the unbearable itch coming out of the mouths of the competitors. (`I'd like to own a restaurant so that I can give the homeless food to the homeless. ') <br /> <br /> You have to ask yourself what people use for the brain when they think of a cheerleader point or a beauty crown worth killing! <br /> <br />
