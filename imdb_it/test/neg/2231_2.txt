I rented this movie, knowing it would be bad (I only saw a good sequel Disney and this was the story of toy 2), but it went much lower than my expectations. I'm a huge fan and I don't believe in sequels with Disney movies. For someone who hasn't grown up with the classics (either by looking at them when they came out or by renting them since you were born) it's a pretty story. I feel that the plot has been dragged a little too much, and it was predictable. The only thing that bothered me most was the voices of the girls of the lady and the vagabond. They were too sharp. Although most of the reviews say it's not so bad, I think if you are a real Disney fan, you shouldn't waste your time with this. <br /> <br /> We hope that Disney is not doing any more sequels than any of the other classics anytime soon.
