only if it's the last thing you do and your humor has evaporated should you ever try to look at this. If you do, watch it by yourself, invite anyone, they will never come back to watch another movie with you. It could be an excellent tool for this purpose, to invite the people you want to get rid of in life. <br /> <br /> Apparently I need to write more about his film to qualify as a review. This is a sweet irony for this film, it sums it up perfectly. after wasting my time I waste more of your time. I have a function I take everything back. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film, look at it, it's provocative, I really go ahead and watch it.
