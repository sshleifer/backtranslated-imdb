This was an incredibly bad film and I literally gasped the first time seeing Blue Screen puppets. Imagine the worst special Blue Screen effects you have ever seen, make it somehow much worse, and combine it with rubber dolls and play-doh that are badly made, which look like something from a semi-retarded pre-school art class . Then add squeaky, solo guitar pieces by Yngwie Malmstein, melodic guitar solos that are too loud and last too long. The film as a whole is absolutely horrible and makes "feeders" look like "Rashomon". It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, with every measurable metric that drops dramatically down, much like a water-soaked asshole in the perpetual, slow eddy of a broken Rest Stop toilet. However, a movie like "Actium Maximus" is not to be missed for the bad conesseuirs out there, even if only by watching clips on YouTube or somewhere. This movie is a bit openable if you can stand the race. I think this director may be mentally ill, which is a bit degrading. Watching him discuss the project, you have the feeling that you really believe you have created something wonderful. I imagine it's the "Star Wars guy" of the gonzo filmmakers. What a mess. :-)
