I happened to see this movie this morning on TCM. Bad acting, low budget and poor plot are the impressions I felt while watching the film. The only salient point of the film was to see the tender young Rita Moreno, (23), who plays an Indian squaw teenager in love with a man over 50 years old. It reminded me of an earlier version of Sue Lyon as Lolita (1962), just a more innocent Lolita. He moves up and down like a teenager of a 1950's teenager, almost as if you would expect her to be chewing gum, falling on this old man, willing to give him anything, while playing it as if it were an obstacle for him . Any man in his fifties who had a beautiful girl, a virgin and a teenager willing to do ANYTHING for him and be his bride, would be crazy not to take advantage of her. Too bad the censorship council back when this film was released would not allow more than an expansion of a character like that of Rita Moreno. The only reason I gave this film a 3 instead of a 1 is the appearance of Rita Moreno in the film.
