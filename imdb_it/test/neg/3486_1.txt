This film has the language, style and attitude towards the bottom ... in addition to the great turns of Occy (a world champion) and the great Jerry Lopez. John Philbin in the role of Turtle has surfing in the back, and the surf scenes are still the best ever. A true classic that can be seen many times. Nia Peeples is a child, and Laird Hamilton shows the first things that made him the number one surfer in the world.
