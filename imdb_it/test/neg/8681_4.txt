The positive side contains interesting information on a wide range of topics, in particular with Himmler, the SS and their research branch. It also has some good piano music, some interesting shots and some excellent photographic work. <br /> <br /> However, it is a very poor historical work. It has no clear objective and the whole thing could be summarized as follows. <br /> <br /> Himmler established a department in the SS for research on the origins of the German race. They went all over the world. They did some things and launched expeditions in all kinds of places ... (the ninths of these routes were not explored, the results were not shown and the arguments were barely refuted). They wanted to establish that the Aryan race and the German people were the same thing through the historical test. They haven't found any. The members of this research group were prominent professors, members of the SS and therefore related to the Holocaust, and after the war they were considered OK and continued to lead the German institutes. <br /> <br /> These facts in themselves are fascinating but they are never explored in depth and no coherent topic is presented in the program that condemns these people or exempts them. Nor does this seem to be the goal of the program, the objective of the program is not clear, it jumps from one topic to another. The witnesses, although presented as credible, are few and not supported. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this program does not know where it is going or why and fails to impress. The topics are fascinating but this program tries to occupy a vast area of ​​research and consequently seems not to know what is happening. I would avoid this. <br /> <br /> Even the "Holy Grail" is the German bloodline, nothing to do with the Holy Grail of Christian mythology except in passing. Expeditions to search for the Christian Holy Grail are made but never followed. The title is misleading and the content of this documentary is not convincing and incomplete.
