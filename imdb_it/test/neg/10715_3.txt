Fun With Dick and Jane he failed to entertain on so many levels. There were some negative aspects with writing, for example, it seems that one of the major conflicts was the indictment of the character of Jim Carrey, DIck Harper, but the writers have never followed that particular conflict. Basically the story is weak and mostly not funny, but Carrey saves some scenes with his physical humor, but honestly, Jim Carrey wasn't very funny in this movie, and Tea Leone could have been there just because of his looks because it was not fun. This is just another example of Hollywood banking operations with franchise actors with an unoriginal and unoriginal history.
