This is easily one of the worst movies I've seen in many years. I started watching the film, I didn't expect much and that's exactly what it delivered ... not much! In fact, it ended up providing even less than I expected. My first reaction when I saw the opening parts of the film is that I probably would have ended up giving it a "4". I thought it seemed to have a reasonably good photograph and a disturbing atmosphere. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, however, the rating has continued to go down my mind mainly due to pedestrian acting and a plot that has gone from being simply silly and insignificant to being at the same time stupid and repulsive towards the end. When the film was finished, I was willing to evaluate it no more than a "1". <br /> <br /> Don't waste time or money on this.
