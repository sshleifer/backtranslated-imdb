Stephen Seagal plays the role of a guy who is persuaded to drive an armored car for a bank run and drive in everything he meets on his way. However, the police appear to appear very quickly on the scene and Seagal smells a rat that has alerted the police. The story takes place in many twists and the hold up money has disappeared and nobody knows its new owner. Poor Seagal is caught in this trap and, of course, he is looking for the person or people who are trying to put him away for a long time. In this film, Seagal tries to be a good boy but the forces of evil are against him. Unfortunately, this is not a great movie and rather boring and too long.
