ROAD HOUSE 1948 of 20th Century Fox) is not only a rather silly noir, but it is an unmitigated boredom of a film. Rich in unconvincing cardboard characters, it is written blandly by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco, from which one would expect much more. Ida Lupino is incredible in the lead role! Lupine, a lady who was able to exude as much sex appeal as a red orange, is here under the illusion of being Rita Hayworth as a sexy Torch Singer bar-room. Handsome Cornel Wilde as his lover is wooden as usual and totally wasted is the talented Celeste Holm whose role is little more than a part. Then we have Richard Widmark who has the most ridiculously written part in the picture! When we see him for the first time, he is a good O.K. guy who runs a thriving Road House. Then suddenly - and for reasons that are not sufficiently clear - he becomes madly jealous of his manager (Wilde) when the latter tells him that he is going to marry Lupino. You see that Widmark wanted to marry her alone but - 1) He never proposed them - 2) They never had a relationship (they don't even have something that looks like a love scene together) and - 3) without telling anyone (including Lupino) obtained a marriage license. Wow! So, as Widmark had to achieve something like marital joy with Lupine after such a "courtship" is someone's problem. Eh? Well, when Widmark falls apart for the whole thing, even the film I'm sorry to say. From here the Widmark character becomes unintentionally comic! His loss of his marbles so early in the process is totally unlikely and unconvincing. Eventually he goes over the edge, becomes completely unbalanced and with a pair of doodles of Tommy Udo, he ridicules for poor Cornel Wilde before biting the dust by himself. <br /> <br /> And if this is not enough of a movie casino for you - the image is also marked by a constant use of indoor sets and studio sets. There is not a single external shot in the whole film! Added to this is the fact that 95% of the film takes place at night. <br /> <br /> In addition to an interactive print book and photo gallery, the extras also include a "Widmark & ​​Lupino At Fox" featurette. Whatever required such a documentary is beyond me! As far as I know they have never been together in a movie at Fox or anywhere else! However, this featurette is hosted by connoisseurs of the caliber of Robert Osborne, Eddie Muller, Rudy Belhmer and some others who are amazingly surprising about this boring and indecent story. All I can say then must be me, I think. But "Road House" until now was a forgotten and buried Noir and, as far as I'm concerned, it should have stayed that way. <br /> <br /> Fox would do better if they distributed DVDs of superior Widmark and so far elusive films like "Down To The Sea In Ships" (1949) and the colorful "Red Skies Of Montana" (1952).
