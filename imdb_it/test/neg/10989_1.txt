I always say, "there is nothing like a good movie". And I must say that it was nothing like a good movie! Drab, boring and boring. It was like one of those bad dreams that never seem to end, no matter how you try to wake up. I don't care about the concept of a film without words, (that is: entering a fantasy or dream world), but there must be something there to capture your imagination, not just empty images, which is what this film is. There seemed to be no development of characters and it jumped so quickly from one scene to another that it was difficult to discern any story. (Was there also a story?) It could be said that the actors were doing their best, but unfortunately the bad direction sabotaged the work of all the actors. It really felt like a kind of cinematographic masturbation ... it existed only to please the director and no one else. Great waste of time.
