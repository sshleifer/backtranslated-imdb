The film began in 1872 with a violent and bloody struggle between Dracula (Christopher Lee) and van Helsing (Peter Cushing). Dracula is impaled and dissolves into dust - even the Helsing van dies. Someone collects Dracula's ashes and buries them in a church ground. Cut to 1972 - that's where the film falls apart. <br /> <br /> We are immediately struck by the head with loud music, bad music from the 70s, HORRIBLE fashions and silly dialogues. When this was done, Hammer was losing money and decided to try anything to get success. Putting Dracula in the 70s was NOT a good idea. Fashions, music and dialogue date the film horribly. We are presented with a group of annoying children among the 20 who decide to make a black mass - "for a giggle". Naturally they have it in the church (now abandoned) and they naturally revive Dracula. It's a good thing that a descendant of van Helsing is around ... but Dracula takes care of his niece (Stephanie Beacham) for revenge. <br /> <br /> Lee and Cushing are as big as ever in their roles and every time they are on the screen the film gets a shot of much needed energy. The initial and final battles are the highlights of the film (although the ending is ruined a lot by playing the music of the 70s). The main band leader for children is also called Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame) - a really stupid name that dates back to the 1940s. The film also has the scream of Queen Caroline Munro that looks absolutely fantastic. The film is well directed and very well played, but the plot is stupid, the constant burst of 70s fashion, dialogue and music become annoying, very fast and I was basically bored. <br /> <br /> Hammer fans agree - this was one of Dracula's worst films - his sequel (Satantic Rites of Dracula) was the worst - and Hammer Dracula's latest film. This gets a 2 - only for Cushing and Lee.
