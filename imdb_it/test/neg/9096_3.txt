Gordon tops the typical Full Moon fashion, but it's normal. Combs is surprisingly low-key, keeping its performance at a more realistic level than we are used to seeing. Even the usual black humor of Stuart Gordon is ironic. <br /> <br /> The film is quite effective in showing Combs' failure and his heroic final act to save his wife and daughter. Actually you feel sympathy for his character, despite his shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Personally, I was more surprised by the nudity and borderline porn sex scene, rather than being shocked by the violence and violence of the graphics. /> <br /> Not classic Gordon, but definitely something you might like if you've seen his most famous films.
