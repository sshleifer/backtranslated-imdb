The English translation of the title in the DVD version of this film is "Graveyard of Horrors", but I think it should be a mistake. It should have been called "Horribles Cemetery". The horrible acting, the horrible editing, the horrible story and the horrible music make this a horrible movie that remains in a horrible cemetery. <br /> <br /> Horrible.
