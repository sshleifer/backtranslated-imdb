Before taking up a job as a reviewer, I never went to films like this, and so I was blissfully unaware that in the soul of the Hollywood movie there's a deeply hated spirit that thrives by putting her little knees on the big screen for everything to empathize or insult. Or is it just a particularly bad year? A bad trend? <br /> <br /> Here we have another apparently sweet, innocent, beautiful woman, transformed into a lethal weapon. The type that warns us that under each pair of flying eyes and nesting instincts lies a wild-eyed beast guaranteed to make everyone's life within 50 miles a living hell. <br /> <br /> This month's specimen is Jewel Valentine's (Liv Tyler), whose simple dreams include having her little house, a fountain in the back and a home entertainment system for the world. Unfortunately, Randy (Matt Dillon, in his first film in 3 years), the bullet bartender who picks up McCool's evening with the intention of robbing, is less materially oriented. The kind of guy who drinks beer from a toilet plunger, prefers to squat in his dead mother's house with little comfort, save his collection of snow batons. <br /> <br /> In that same low-rent bar, the devil in the red suit also meets Randy's cousin, Carl (the hilarious Paul Reiser), a lawyer with an ego the size of St. Louis. When things go south in a few hours, enter the widower detective with a heart of gold (John Goodman). The result? Three men support a large and bad crush on Steven Tyler's and Bebe Buell's leopard progeny that makes them do things that common sense will normally contraindicate. How to be personally involved. <br /> <br /> Multiple points of view and flashbacks cover the headlines of how easy it is to fall victim to your libido, especially if you are male. As each of these men connects his perspective to a confidant, his desire to own The Jewel colors the "truth" of the situation. About 70 minutes later, things meet in a reasonably fun way. But he is amused by the same source that tells you that things about popcorn actually taste like butter. <br /> <br /> MCCOOL'S is the first film by Norwegian director of advertising and music videos Harald Zwart, and his pedigree is clear during some of the fantasy segments, including one on a car wash, soap and a pipe that probably it can be extrapolated. It is also the debut project of the production company owned by Michael Douglas, who found his niche as a sleezeball toupeed in a bingo hall. <br /> <br /> Dillon and Tyler are unlikely to win the golden statues for this, although given the dimensionality of their noir-type overdone films, you can't really criticize them. Several minor roles draw unexpected guests - Reba McEntire plays Carl's psychiatrist, and Andrew Dice Clay doubles as both the Utah thug and his even more terrifying brother. (Finally, an outlet for all that aggression.) <br /> <br /> This film unintentionally talks about volumes on the dynamics between men and women - or men and their mothers. But in the end you will probably find more lasting psychological truths in an episode of Bugs Bunny. I will say that it is better, more fun, more sophisticated than other recent gems like TOMCATS, but should we really choose what to see based on what is the lowest on the misogynist scale?
