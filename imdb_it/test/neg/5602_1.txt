DeCoteau must be one of the worst "directors" working in any genre today, and it has nothing to do with his films that usually contain homoeroticism and have kids running in their matched boxers. Remember ... anyone in black underwear is satanic and wicked and wants to suck your blood / soul ... a symbolism so deep here). I simply sat through The Sisterhood to give him his right shakes, I try to watch all the horror films I can and this has Barbara (FROM BEYOND, RE-ANIMATOR) Crampton in it (I had previously been sucked into the world of DeCoteau thanks Linnea Quigley, Adrienne Barbeau and many other actresses I like). <br /> <br /> Let me tell you about The Sisterhood ... As the other reviewer pointed out, the alleged plot involves lesbian vampires on a university campus. But never a parade of young girls ("actresses" if you want) who ran dressed in bra, panties and bikinis were so boring. The film has no plot, no blood, no nudity and the dialogue is ridiculous and it seems that they were invented as they go on. The parts are put in slow motion and repeated several times to increase the execution time. About ten minutes of this are made up of characters walking on campus (oh, excitement!) That looks more like a resort hotel than any college I've ever been to. And acting is by far the worst. The only thing these girls do right is to lean forward and bend to show their bodies. The cast was so lacking in talent that I would have been shocked to see that some of them would play a one-day role on Passions in the future. Ditto for the boys. Yes, DeCoteau also squeezed other hot guys in this panty ... Guys who should be in a K-Mart brochure instead of trying to act. Do these people really need to audition or just show up in Dave's office and take off their clothes? I think the answer is obvious. <br /> <br /> I am willing to give any film a chance if 1.) it is written in an intelligent way, well directed, original and recited in a competent (or infernal, even ambitious and elegant) way .. O 2. ) is crammed with blood, nudity, assorted garbage and / or is unintentionally exhilarating. David DeCoteau's films provide NO ONE of that and do it on better than usual production values ​​for video-directed films. What a waste! So what is the appeal, especially with the advent of soft and hard-core variety porn that is easily accessible to anyone with a computer? I simply can't answer that. <br /> <br /> DeCoteau is a gay horror director and could use his resources to give a unique twist to the genre. Instead, it produces a compelling fear without an ounce of talent or intelligence shining through. Ironically, when you think about it, your films are anything but pro-gay. In reality they make homosexuality semi-drained, secret and left. The clearly gay characters in his films always try to corrupt, seduce and / or kill innocent and sexually confused voices. There is no shade here to make things interesting. The protagonists are naive and rarely prove to be strong, assertive or sure of what they are. I would understand this plot if Jerry Falwell, Fred Phelps or Dr. Laura started making horror films for the video, but from a gay director, this shows that he hardly ever thought about these cheesy squeaks.
