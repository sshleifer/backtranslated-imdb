A training story about a teenager who rebels against the church and the father of his minister in a small Norwegian village. The countryside setting is picturesque but the story is rather pretentious and tiring, with much of the film dedicated to the writing of the scriptures. It's like watching a religious propaganda film. Theisen, who made just another film, is quite as good as the sensitive young protagonist, as is Sundquist as his stern father and Riise as a woman whose Theisen is fascinated. The film aims to be fresh and charming but feels rather stale and tired. The director and co-writer Nesheim, who has worked mainly on TV, is not up to the task.
