You'll feel like you've lived a holiday in Hell after sitting down and watching this horrible TV movie. This film is an exercise in over-acting (bad acting) in situations that have proved to be superior to what they are. I won't give away the plot, but once you realize why people in this movie are running away from the movie's native man, request the two wasted hours of your life. The only advantage is seeing Marcia Brady run in a bikini!
