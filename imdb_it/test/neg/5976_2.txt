Films like this give independent films a bad name! This is simply a boring collection of vingettes, without any structure. I wouldn't be surprised if the writer was completely stoned. If you want to see a good stoner comedy, look at "Half Baked". He is not a winner, but at least he made me laugh. The film was obviously made with a micro budget. Every scene takes place in someone's home, someone's apartment or somewhere outdoors. If the writing was good and the dialogue was interesting, I would have ignored the film's budget (as in the case of Edward Burns' films), but obviously this is not the case this time. <br /> <br /> I quote Robert DeNiro of "A Bronx Tale" when I say "There is nothing in the world worse than the wasted talent". Everyone in the cast has talent. Luke Wilson, Alicia Witt, Brittany Murphy, Jeremy Sisto - all talented artists! And everyone has been in much better films. The actors gave us the best, but they couldn't go too far with such a crappy script. The only scene that I found interesting is the cameo by Jack Black, where he sings a song about being in the woods. And, of course, in the beginning there was a short strip club scene, which I also found attractive. <br /> <br /> The characters are not interesting and the story barely exists. Many films are horrible, but at least you understand their intentions. What was the intention of "Bongwater's"? The world will never know. <br /> <br /> My score: 2 (out of 10)
