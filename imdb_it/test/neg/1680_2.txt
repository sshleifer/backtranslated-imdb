An elite American military team that obviously includes two good-looking women and a guy who fails to capture teamwork, many bats, some terrorists and a Spetznaz team that acts like a gang that can't shoot straight - all thrown together in a confusing plot with mediocre acting. This doesn't have much to offer. The characters are not convincing. Even the setting, which has great possibilities, looks like something out of rural Pennsylvania, not an exotic Boreal forest in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> Bats are certainly fierce. They can also take a man and fly with him for a few meters (harpies?) Or cut off an arm. See the strength of the Delta surrounded by hundreds of bats with boys shooting assault rifles and guns and bats falling to the ground. It would be like trying to pull the clay pigeon with a rifle from a distance of 3 feet. Absolutely no trace. The dialogue is unrealistically unrealistic, with jokes and flirts between girls / boys in the middle of stretched parts of the mission. One of the team members is blown up by a mine and the first on the scene sadly stares at his body, stunned, without even bothering to take shelter or protect the area. In fact, after the rest of the group shows up, he talks about how the area is structured as a minefield - thanks for the head up bub. <br /> <br /> If you want a contrast in the way a horror movie involves a small military group it can be done well in a low budget outpost. Harvest is not the movie you want to see. In fact I think I'll give a two instead of a three if I can get past the second half. It seems unlikely at this point.
