A tough revenge: the British playwright Ronald Harwood adapts his autobiographical drama on the stage, a loud and bellowing film about the Shakespearean theater troupe of World War II, plagued by an old, windy, brilliant, but unreliable star at the end of his attack. The actor's effect assistant works diligently to get his armed and costumed owner for a production of "King Lear" (during an air raid!), But both men are losing their grip on their defeat situation. Based on the waning years of actor Donald Wolfit, whose dresser was Ronald Harwood, this acclaimed production would seem to be a welcome haven for actors chewing landscapes. Unfortunately, Albert Finney (at this point in his career, not at all old) seems too robust and quick to play the actor; Finney (and the Oscar-nominated director, Peter Yates) is unable to modulate the moods and attacks of consistency of Sir in a way that makes sense to us, so that in a scene you stop a train with the dominant echo of his voice, and in the other it is curiously falling apart. With such a wreck of a human being in the midst of a lack of health and attitude, one might assume that a dedicated assistant would do anything to protect his boss (and his future), still serving Tom Courtenay prods and badgers and prods Finney to bring rather than rest Courtenay, who played this part on stage (and was nominated for an Oscar alongside Finney for Best Actor), is much more in tune with his role, and in the end his beautiful commands and his confusion reached the only real feeling in the film. These two, fortunately, do not hit each other, and screenwriter Harwood is careful not to fall into a pattern of hate-love (which could be perceived in the first act of the film); but, without a juxtaposition of servant versus celebrity, there is nothing much to see in this portrait except for the deterioration of narcissism, the reference to what it once was. * 1/2 from ****
