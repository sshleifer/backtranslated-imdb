I'm one of those punishment gourmets when it comes to sitcoms these days - I'll keep checking them every now and then. My observation is that most of them are not very funny even those on the main networks that are getting high grades, I don't understand who is finding them gutted in a fun way. While some made me smile, none of them made me laugh out loud, usually I change channels after a few minutes. Now on the FOX network churn out new shows like changing underwear, for some reason they think they can make a good sitcom, wrong wrong wrong. They beat this dead horse so much that it got to the point of hiring only someone they can find to write a lousy pilot with a bad dialogue and just churn them out. Let's look briefly at the last piece of rubbish that Fox has baked called "The War At Home" <br /> <br /> I've seen about 5 minutes and this was generous. In this particular episode, the daughter is making her parents' mouths that make the "I am an adult now rant". The father gets fed up "OK well, go ahead and do what you want, if you ruin it's your problem" to which she replies "Well I guess she's crazy, but hey, at least I didn't have AIDS" (she cites laughter, no way that can be a live audience unless they have been paid to applaud that garbage) - I have found the crack of not having AIDS to be so distasteful. Well, hey, I don't have to look at this shit anymore. Take a FOX suggestion, stop wasting your time with sitcoms.OK well you have the Simpsons but now it's getting really old and tired as well.
