Barbara Payton is the conceited and sexy young chickie hot wife of the geezer plantation owner somewhere in a lot of jungley set in a Hollywood economic firm. Raymond Burr wears his work shirt with the top button unfastened like the big chunky plantation foreman Mrs. Payton wants to blow with the barrel. There is another girl, a kind of peasant slavery with whom Burr used to joke, but he gave her the old heave so I have the old and impressive old witch voo-doo is summoning a good spell to cast on him and on Payton's tramp. I saw it only in part because it's really horrible, so I couldn't even see the star of the show --- which I guess is a gorilla that the voo-doo witch has turned someone into something like that ..... who cares . I give this half star a possible ten. It's not even campy, just really ugly.
