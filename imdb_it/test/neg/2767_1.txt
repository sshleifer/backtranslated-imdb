This movie really sucks. <br /> <br /> Just try to stay awake for 5 minutes while watching this baloney on a cute girl (Joan Woodbury) who gets involved with the "underworld" because she needs money (and because she's lazy too to take a job from friends after offering it to her). Alan Ladd should have been the protagonist of this thing, but he is nowhere to be found for the first half hour crazy and when he shows up, he puts himself around like a constipated mannequin. A real disaster with enough talky scenes and unlikely (as well as stupid) characters to make you want someone to shoot someone, like it's really fast. <br /> <br /> Bring a pillow.
