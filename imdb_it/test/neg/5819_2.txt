This show makes absolutely no sense. Every week, two ladies go to an estate to do gardening, and each week, unsuccessfully, they run into a murder. Because everyone who owns a large house with a large garden is involved in a murder, right? But even if they somehow happened to run into a murder after the murder, would the smartest thing be to say to the police? You know, people who can actually do something about it ... But every week, these two fools go around, polluting evidence, commit their own crimes and, in some cases, cause other murders. Once the murders are miraculously resolved, there is no way the murderer can ever be convicted. All the tests have been sabotaged. And you'd think the people covering the murders would think they weren't hiring these two, would they? Yay! We've solved the murder! Now like every other week, we are going to confront the killer and, without any support, tell him that we are aware of it. There is no way to put us in danger, right? Rosemary and Timo is one of the worst shows on television, and certainly the most ridiculous.
