I was ready for a Crouching Tiger style movie and all I got was the worst movie I've seen in years. It was almost as ugly as Baron von Munchhuasen. Dead screenplay Dead recitation Dead everything. <br /> <br /> There have been some good fighting scenes, but the positive side ends here. If this film arrives at your home, it runs off a phone and dials 911 and says: "Please, help, there's a movie in my house intended to force people to commit suicide"
