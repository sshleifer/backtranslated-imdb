Family Guy is easily one of the worst shows I've ever tried to look at (though, basically, I saw The Jersey Shore). A popular success among high school and college kids who confuse immaturity with nervousness, this show is not original and stale. <br /> <br /> Given that he was nicknamed a comedy show, let's take a look at his "humor". 1. Random flashbacks / cuts to celebrities or movies or politics or anything that can be cut for an instinctive laugh. He became old after 5 repetitions per episode. Simple solution: every time you hear "This is worse than / like the weather ...", plug your ears. <br /> <br /> 2. Opportunity as an end in itself. This show is known for inserting inappropriate gags that have little to do with the general plot. Solution: look at South Park. They did it well. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that Family Guy isn't worth your time, and doesn't hold a candle to the Simpsons.
