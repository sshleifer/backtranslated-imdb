I must admit that I was against this film from the beginning, but I tried to be more impartial, I really did, but the very idea of ​​recreating a sophisticated, witty, funny, eccentric and full of character English must be questionable from <br /> <br /> The people in my house were watching this, so I swallowed my pride and told myself to be a film professional (I studied them at all, after all). <br /> <br /> As expected for an American film of this genre, the film began with a chase that was not bad. In fact, many of the action sequences are credible and this alone raises the mark. <br /> <br /> However the characterization was abysmal, the set-pieces could easily have been joined by any American blockbuster that you may have had bad luck to watch and lacked the whole character. <br /> <br /> Seeming to take a distorted angle on the original film with a failed initial robbery, the American version does the predictable thing and introduces an emotional factor with the death of Donald Sutherland's character. This allows our US cousins ​​to have many opportunities for a vengeful syphophanic search with wide-open eyes against the "evildoers" that militates on predictable excesses. This is never more evident than in the scenes with Charlize Theron (oh, good! Oh so pretty! Look at her eyes, pretty, wounded Bambi, everyone!) Who were completely sick. His entry scene, in particular, was like something from Resident Evil or Tomb Raider that were both a) more fun and b) had a better start because they couldn't spoil a game as they could with British cinema that was already chock-full of spark, people who really feel something and moments of inspiration. But I digress, the whole inclusion of a pretty girl for the sake of it seems the most bitter maneuver I've seen in a while and reveals Hollywood's cynical Hollywood success for what it is. <br /> <br /> If you like one of these actors, by the way, and you agree with one of the comments above, DO NOT GO TO SEE THIS FILM! If I had the opportunity to watch "Fight Club" or "American History X" after seeing Ed Norton in this, I would have refused. Similarly Jason Statham with 'Lock Stock' (and I suppose 'The Transporter' is ok if you like this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Sadly, all the set-pieces are drawn as transparently as possible to make you think, "Wow! He's smart!", "Coo! He's strong!", "Hey! What a tough boy!" Then there is the "funny PC" who has a "comic relief" splashed on his forehead but the whose humor content can be anticipated two minutes early. To be honest, if you've seen one or two movies like this, you could easily confuse the two as clones of the Jerry Bruckheimer stable, not that Jerry is hopelessly horrible, by the way, but just use the clichés in excess as everyone knows (or should). <br /> <br /> This is where I need to be cleaned, I couldn't do it until the end, so I couldn't even tell if the brilliant ending of the version of Michael Caine has made it but, I'm sorry, it's just one of those extreme films very rare that, if I saw it at the cinema, I would have gone out and staged a small protest outside. It's not just that it's another identical issue of Ocean's 14 or something like that (Ocean's Eleven was fine, but don't worry about the rest!) With all the pomp, glamor, fake sass and the heroism of a movie pantomime of the genus, but I could not recognize anything of the original. <br /> <br /> So, if you are expecting "ITALIAN WORK" and not "OCEAN'S 14" although poorly written with a cast and less established characters, some dishonest elements and the cut-out cardboard script, then DON'T LOOK! I don't mind people enjoying a bit of carefree fun, but this is a criminal ax job that doesn't deserve to be paraded under the title of a classic in any way. Seriously, show some pride! I felt fully justified in my outraged and disgusted reaction when I heard for the first time that the film would be made. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> P.S. Some of the action sequences are not bad at all, so add an extra "1" to the sign if you like this kind of thing.
