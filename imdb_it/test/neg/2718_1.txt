As Joe Bob Briggs would say, this film relies heavily on the talent of the actresses rather than their talent. This feast of the early 90s shows very little to redeem it, as well as showing beautiful women almost naked. Martin Sheen's little brother Joe Estevez proves once again that his film career will not be close to his brother's career. <br /> <br /> Avoid this unless you like looking at pretty women in skimpy dresses. It's the only thing that redeems him.
