Seagal fans pay attention: he doesn't do action scenes until almost an hour in this mess. Instead, Seagal escapes from numerous battles, letting Ja Rule convincingly lose every battle. Actually, Ja Rule could be an emerging action star, but Hollywood must at least allow him to hit puberty (which should happen in a few years ...) Furthermore, what kind of commando / terrorist is wearing a shirtless suit? The girl in this atrocity looks like a backup singer for Christina Aguilera. Back to Seagal - When he finally gets free, it's his stand-in (HEAVILY PADDED that looks like the bloated Seagal) doing a lot of work and making waterfalls. I don't even remember any aikido. It's just your standard kicks and punches that you would see in any turkey of straight-to-video martial arts. Not even "so-bad-is-funny", either. Simply boring ...
