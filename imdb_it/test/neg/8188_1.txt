The whole act of Joe Rogan is bile profanity intertwined. He's a smoker who joined Fear Factor, thinking it was a joke. He said he'd let people in because he didn't know how stupid people would be. The producers of the show he explained were giving the premise of messing with unsuspecting competitors to see how far they will go. The level of evil involved is a little distorted. Mr. Rogan's special is full of rants of someone who is too good for regular humans. I found it offensive and his stuff can be heard by the most talented comedians like Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock. Rogan also does a five-minute set on the word N. Overall, ignore this special.
