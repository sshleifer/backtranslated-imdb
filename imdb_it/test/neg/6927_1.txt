I really wanted to love this movie. I read the book to my daughters and loved it. The book is wonderful. This film is very far from the book. The book is splendid - this film is a terrible adaptation. <br /> <br /> In the book, Sara is honorable, kind, strong and NEVER does something spiteful about returning to someone. This is the POINT of the book! He acts like a "prince" regardless of the circumstances. An important part of acting like a princess is not giving back the rudeness. It is behaving honorably regardless of how you are treated. <br /> <br /> In the book, he resists and touches the lives of others. Other people change their behavior after witnessing his kindness and ability to endure without sinking in spite and revenge. Sara does what is right, simply because it is RIGHT. <br /> <br /> Outside the bakery, he meets a beggar girl who is poorer and hungrier than she is. It has half a dozen hot buns. It is VERY hungry. He gives a sandwich to this wild-looking girl huddled in the bakery doorway. When she sees how ravenous the girl is and watches her eat the sandwich, she gives her another. She keeps doing it until she gives 3 or 4 I think - I don't remember how many. <br /> <br /> The baker is looking out of the window. She is so moved by what she witnessed, takes the beggar girl and lifts her up as her daughter. Other people are similarly influenced by Sara. <br /> <br /> And in the book, his father died. The man next door is his father's companion - he looked for her. After all, his father didn't lose his money - the man is excited to find Sara; he takes her and Becky to her home and raises them as her daughters. And Sara has her full inheritance, of course. <br /> <br /> Miss Minchin is not a chimney sweep. In fact, she stays in her same place at school. But she is humiliated as Sara told her new guardian of the cruel treatment she received. And in the end Sara talks with Miss Minchin - Miss Minchin is trying to minimize Sara and Sara's treatment with a calm and resolute demeanor, instructing Miss Minchin that she was cruel. <br /> <br /> for Miss Minchin. She continues in her miserable existence. It doesn't matter - what matters is that Sara has a home with a guardian who loves her - and her dearest friend in the world, Becky, is now in effect, her sister. <br /> <br /> book talks about love and honorable behavior in the worst circumstances. It is about self-control and humility. This is a wonderful book. This film is NOT ANYTHING to capture the true story and the messages of the book. My wife was so disgusted that she wanted to leave the theater in the middle, but we decided to take it out. We were not rewarded. <br /> <br /> I cannot for the life of me think of a reason the film does should alter this excellent book in a bad direction. Perhaps it was the influence of the horrible script of the book in which Shirley Temple acted. I don't know - but this film is so far from the book of character and values ​​that I don't recognize it. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time - buy the book. It's unforgettable ... even for a dad!
