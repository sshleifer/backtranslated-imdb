He starts to look like he is going somewhere, so he quickly brings the main characters into a three-ring circus of remarkable stupidity that definitely destroys the characters' liking. I'm a great collector of stoner films, but this is something I wouldn't consider a valid addition. Bong's water is rubbish from the deepest regions of the dumpster, and I wouldn't be caught dead with this on my shelf. I'm really convinced that this film was created by a partnership for A Drug Free America. If you're a fan of Jack Black, then I'd say you might think 5 minutes of movies are OK because Jack Black continues his legacy of singing songs for retards. I can't really say enough bad things about this movie.
