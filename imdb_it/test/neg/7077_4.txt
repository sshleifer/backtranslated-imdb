STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very good *** Okay ** You could go out for a meal instead * Avoid at all costs <br /> <br /> The story of the title Adam (Mark O ' Halloran) and Paul (Tom Murphy), two heroin addicts in the slums of Dublin and their daily friendships around in their petty lives in search of the next fix that will make their day. Along the way they try to reconcile with close relatives and friends who have managed to disappoint and annihilate. <br /> <br /> I know that many Irish people love to drink, but it seems that some of them have problems with heroin, even for the appearance of this film. I know there is a bit of a drug problem over there, as in many parts of the world, so another humorous speech on the subject is not entirely unexpected. <br /> <br /> I don't remember the last Irish movie I saw (the film is shot in a style that sets it apart from every movie I've seen lately!) And, judging from that, obviously I'm not so enlightened about their humor how could i be. The film is pretty funny in some parts, but it's obviously another comedy that isn't afraid to arouse laughter up close. The scene where the mentally disabled boy is robbed at the bottom of an alley is certainly true of what a couple of drug addicts might do to fuel their habit, but it's still contemptible and I'm not sure it was meant as dark humor in every way but it certainly didn't make me smile! It is also in stark contrast to their previous actions in which they are seen showing their soft side swinging a child back and forth. In light of this, some may find the sad ending, others may see it only as dessert. <br /> <br /> Overall, I couldn't see the point of the movie. I didn't see any motivation in the "story" he was telling. It just seems to walk around without really engaging the public in any way. Unlike Trainspotting (which dealt with similar topics!) It was an unsuccessful effort for most of the time that led me to nod despite being a very short execution time of 83 minutes. Really no more pleasant to follow two real life junkies around for a day. **
