Well, here's the thing - to make this movie work, you'll have to accept the following - a woman who was killed is alive again at the end of the film, a detective stops questioning the dead woman's girlfriend because a journalist asked him not to , and the same journalist, struck by a beautiful blonde brought to court for suspicious behavior, ends up marrying her in exchange for the judge who puts her out of trouble. Are you following me on this? I can't tell you how many times I paused and rewound the image to repeat scenes that didn't make any sense. In the end, the blonde (Claudia Dell) and the journalist (Richard Hemingway) were married, but I have no idea how they arrived at that decision. In fact, I can't understand how the director made the decision to make this film. Oh, I suppose there is some entertainment here only because of the absurdity of it all, but it would have been nice if even a couple of pieces were suitable. However, I'm not ready to add this to my list of the top ten worst. I think that night club scene with feathered women could have saved her. But why was it in the movie? I just don't know.
