I could say that it would have been a bad one from the trailer, but the recall of the DVD box induced me to rent it anyway. Boy was I right .. <br /> <br /> Also for some reason the DVD version is VERY fuzzy and sometimes unclear (in terms of video quality). It looks like they shot the whole movie with a 20-year-old camcorder, it looks so bad. I didn't like the plot, and after seeing the movie I was disappointed. I will NOT say any spoilers, but I will say that the end was so bad that I laughed, it has already been done so many times. <br /> <br /> The whole story looks like something that came from an English paper of the average schoolboy. If I had to fix a movie as the worst horror movie I've ever seen, this could be just that. I can't believe they actually released this movie. It's not really worth the rent, or anyone's penny, unless you want a good laugh at the expense of the movie.
