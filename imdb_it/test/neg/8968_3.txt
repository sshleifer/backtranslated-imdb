Katharine Hepburn as a mountain woman who mixes prayer with positive thinking - and is thought by the local people as a witch. Kate works excessively trying to convince us that she's a hobbyist (called Trigger Hicks!), But you can see that she doesn't even believe in this unintentionally comic scenario. Robert Young, constantly smiling, plays a foreman who works on the construction of a mountain dam that becomes the first crush on Trigger ... but alas, he is married! No amount of white magic can resurrect this formula, based on a game and brought to the screen by R.K.O. with too much flowering. He is wicked and almost unwatchable. * 1/2 from ****
