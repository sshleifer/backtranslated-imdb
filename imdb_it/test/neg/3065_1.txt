Evil has never seemed so bad. They were serious. <br /> <br /> When a friend of mine chose this DVD in a half-price book store, I didn't know what to expect. I mean, based on the title, I knew it would be worth the laugh, but I didn't realize how ridiculous it would be. <br /> <br /> The first time, I lost part of the dialogue (if I could call it that) because we were too busy teasing the plot of the movie. It seems to have been written in films in less than a week, and they didn't have the budget to go back and fix some of the minor flaws. Wait, did I say "minor"? I meant exactly the opposite. For example, the main character is credited as "Ken", but several times in the film he is called "John". <br /> <br /> If the holes in the plot are not fun enough for you, take a look at the acting. No one seems overly concerned about the raids of zombies in their state, including the main character's mother, who has been missing for days while sitting in front of a fireplace reading a book. <br /> <br /> The limits of the budget puts the film are just as exhilarating. Maybe they didn't have permission to film wherever they were, because during the BIG CHASE SCENE OF THE MOTORCYCLE, the characters obey all traffic rules. The zombies, who had just killed about twenty people, actually stop at the stop sign that comes out of a parking lot. I don't even do it, but then again, I'm not a motorcycle zombie. The end of the film seems to have run out of money. It ends so suddenly that it leaves you wanting more ... Come to think of it, it ends soon enough. <br /> <br /> So, if you're looking for a good time with your friends, look for this movie. It is a great involuntary comedy.
