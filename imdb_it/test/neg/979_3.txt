I can imagine what happened to this film: a group of guys from the studio are sitting around, drinking gin-and-tonic, maybe a town, and one of them has the idea that it would be great if they could find a movie that could bridging the generation gap, which at that time was as different as Archie Bunker and Mick Jagger. Something that both university rebels and their parents would find equally interesting - for different reasons, perhaps, but still, a ticket is a ticket. What hippies are you interested in? Asia, philosophy, pacifism and wild sets and costumes. What did their parents care about? Musical, eye candy, screenplay and nostalgia. Very good, then, "Lost Horizon", the old classic, like a musical, in color. You can't miss it, right? It was a bomb. Lost Horizon, by James Hilton, is perhaps less than a classic, but not a bad novel. In general terms, he sketches a utopian society in Shangri-la, "The Valley of the Blue Moon", near Tibet, inhabited by peaceful and happy villagers who serve an abbey of very long-lived monks. Intruding in paradise is an outsider plane from Gilligan's Island (a veteran of World War I, a missionary, etc.). Each with their own rotation on the situation - which plot concerns the reaction of each of them to be presented with a choice of live in paradise, or try to return to the tumult of the twentieth century. Taken on its own terms, it is a slight pop-lit fluff, which presents Hilton's conservative British views in "oriental", exotic and familiar dresses like a fortune cookie. As guests in captivity honored by the monks, the shipwrecked is forbidden to leave the valley, but they are never forced to work or pray (not that the monks do too much of themselves), treated royally, and provided with simple but luxurious accommodation - whoever you want to run away? In this American paradise on Earth, the monks are both cultured and wise, the climate is warm, the food is plentiful and tasty, the villagers are picturesque nothingness and nothing ever changes. The sisters are chaste, but encouraged to look nice and even flirt a little (the reason is one of the most exhilarating explanations of the tantric sex I've ever read). Even their religion is not threatening: revealed as the best combination of both worlds between Christianity and Buddhism, there is very little to offend except the most loyal fundamentalist or the extravagant who know something about Tibet (which in the early Thirties was a real small number). <br /> <br /> Like a Capra movie centered around the corners of adventure / character play it was enchanting; and maybe Steven Spielburg could have made him fly, if he had been around. As a Hollywood product of the early seventies, the adventure was over too quickly, and the updated list of characters too bland, to make a big impression. Deprived of the sketchy and striking qualities of the classic B & W, the monastery resembles a luxury beauty spa in white and pale blue, and while at least some of the monks' robes proved historical accuracy, most of the other inmates seemed on the street for a morning massage and a mud bath, with a couple of golf holes in the afternoon. Perhaps Stephan Sondheim could have restored some of the grit to the story by playing the real conflict within each character's reaction; only five years later, Brian Eno would have captured the peaceful atmosphere of a T; instead, Bert Bacherach and Hal David had the task of writing the songs, which marry the melodies of Muzak with some of the most resounding New Age lyrics ever written. Quite naturally for the moment, each song requires a dance number, ranging from the simple to forget to the completely boring, and so is the script, which does not have a line that deserves to be mentioned. <br /> <br /> Tie-in with this movie there were legions - there was everything from cookbooks to posters designed to promote this film, and such was the exaggeration with which I actually went to buy the sountrack album. The only thing I can say is that it made quite an impression on me to write this review completely by heart almost thirty years later: the following month I read Aldous Huxley, bought a copy of the Bardo Thadol, and then learned about true Tibetan culture. Moan. <br /> <br />
