The teenager Tamara (Jenna Dewan) has problems. She is ridiculed by all the popular "children" for being shy, sociable, sloppy and for her interest in witchcraft. All football players and cheerleaders are particularly angry with you for writing an article about steroid abuse for the school newspaper. In addition to this, her father is drunk, her mother is not around and she is secretly in love with her supportive English teacher (Matthew Marsden). The popular boys organize a cruel joke to humiliate her, accidentally killing her during a fight, burying her body in the woods and making a pact to keep quiet. For their shock, the next day Tamara returns to the classroom with a seductive air and, dressed to kill. Yes, back from the dead and ready for the supernatural revenge against all those involved. He also takes time to have his sexually violent pop eat a bottle of beer and try to seduce his English teacher away from his wife (Claudette Mink), a school guidance counselor. <br /> <br /> Acting and writing strictly mediocre. You can also say that the people responsible for this film have seen films like CARRIE (1976), CIAO MARY LOU: PROM NIGHT II (1987) and THE CRAFT (1996) because they borrow wholesale from all three of these top films. There's a bit of cold blood (a guy who cuts his ear and his tongue and then stabs his eyeball probably the best), a bad scene of vomit and a few jokes / jokes. It is not a terrible film in any way, but not even much originality has gone ahead.
