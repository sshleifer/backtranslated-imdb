If you really like movies with ants that build dirty mirrors, eat non-ants and conquer the world with an off-screen narrative, then this is the movie for you. Basically, a couple of scientists working on a bio-dome communicate with very intelligent ants (the most intelligent actors in this film) in an attempt to try to counter their plans for conquest and extermination. Throughout the film, the two scientists (and a girl they saved from the ants) use everything at their disposal (computers, green dye and horrible acting), but without success. I guess they couldn't afford pesticides because the movie would end too quickly. <br /> <br /> The title of the film "Phase IV" is a mystery. This is not a spoiler, but "Phase I" starts immediately after the credits while you do not reach "Phase IV" until the end of the credits. Apparently the director knew that the film would be boring to overcome and therefore he put Phases 1 - 3 throughout the film as a kind of progress report: "Hang in there buddy! Just another stage until the final credits! " As an episode of MST3K, this was not very good for two reasons: 1) This is from season 0 on KTMA when they were the first to start, so riffing is not as good as in the following seasons; and 2) This film is so ugly that even J & TB can't lighten it. There are one or two Gamera references as they have just finished redoing 5 Gamera films. <br /> <br /> The film has a surprise / surprise ending, but I was so happy to reach the end that the effect was lost.
