This is what I kept wondering while watching this movie. I mean, the amount of nudity and sex was one thing, but another part of the movie that gave its genre to the adult industry was its lack of plot. Actually, I just wanted to get up and leave during the whole movie, but I insisted. I insisted in the hope that perhaps the plot would have improved, that in the end there would be a good breakthrough. However I could not have been more wrong. In the end I insisted because I thought I could write a bad review for this, at least after seeing it. I mean, don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with beautiful, sexy and vibrant women, but when the director just shows that along with a shitty story he thinks it's what the viewer wants to see, he insults us all Thinking that we're all so superficial as to want only to see burlesque from representatives of the cinematographic sector, it is absurd. My advice: take a different movie.
