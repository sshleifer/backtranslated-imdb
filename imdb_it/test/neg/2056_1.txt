Once again, I fell in love, in my roots I want a funny and bloody horror film, even a vampire. Even if it's stupid, as long as I enjoy the blood in the mix, I'm a happy camper, it doesn't take long. So I saw the cover of "Bled" on Hollywood Video and I was curious to know what it was, it seemed pretty interesting, so I decided to rent it. Why? Why do I always fall in love? Not only did this film not satisfy the satisfaction I needed for my blood and my senseless violence and nakedness, but I was bored to death. This film has the kahoonies to say it's a vampire movie and it's actually not! I'm so close to going back to the store and begging for money because this is one of the rare times I actually shot the movie. <br /> <br /> An artist meets a vampire, I think, I don't know, I'm still trying to figure out what the hell it was, but his name was Reinfield, so I guess maybe he's a guy who eats a cockroach who likes to scare people? I think, I don't know. Anyway, do you think the artist has a certain glow for the darkness, so he gives her a drug to go into an alternative fantasy where a vampire exists and needs blood to become alive? I think, I don't know. So his friends get excited and decide they want to try drugs too, I think, I don't know. So, after deciding to try the drug, things get weird, the fantasies are real, I guess, I don't know, and the vampire is now enjoying the big-breasted girls in shocked clothes. I think, I don't know. But do a couple of girls end up becoming vampires? I think, I don't know. <br /> <br /> Sorry for all the "I don't know", this is probably one of the worst reviews I will write, but it's because this film was just awful, boring and confusing. I love to see only these actors that can be said are the waiters looking for that "big chance". Not too clever that they fell into the clich√© of the horror genre, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, in this case, they should really have read the script. Because the film, the look, the feeling, the acting, everything about this movie was just bad, I really recommend you to pass the movie if you see it in your video store. Probably this could have been an interesting film with its concept of a different dimension, but why did they choose this director to show his "creativity", if he even had someone? It was a bad movie, stay away. <br /> <br /> 1/10
