I went to this film with very little in terms of expectations. I went with my girlfriend and two friends, and none of them could explain the story of Rancore 1 to me. Well, if the first one couldn't leave an impression on them to explain the plot, then I doubted it would be better. <br /> <br /> Let me summarize what the trailers tell you: the Asian lady is back and so is Sarah Michelle Gellar. Fortunately for her, she hasn't been around for a long time. That decision may have saved his career. <br /> <br /> The film has three narrative lines, and none makes sense. And even worse, none of them is developed. You almost begin to understand, and then someone dies and the story is left behind. Ok, killing people could be scary, but I was more confused about trying to develop the plot than I was scared. Jump back and forth between the three lines of history, which are unrelated ... OR ARE THEM?!?! * SOUND EFFECTTT * ~~~ The times of the three stories have been removed, and at the beginning you can say that the film will have a turning point at the end. BE PREPAREDD. Oh wait. Sorry, it's not a Fight Club or Vertigo quality twist, you could see it from a distance. And you probably imagined a MUCH better in your head ... they should have hired me. Instead of the girl who made her "SURPRISING" appearance, maybe it could have been Michael Jackson instead? That part of Scary Movie 4 scared the hell out of me. <br /> <br /> The murder sequences were terribly concluded. Unlike the horror films of the past, where a murderer comes out of nowhere, a closet or behind a door, for example, and everyone in the theater jumps (and then the fat man behind you spills the popcorn on his neck) - this lacked a terrifying pop ups. They've magnified the point where the Asian woman or child would have appeared, and you knew exactly what would happen. Instead of making the music become very loud, so silent, then a pop-out to let off steam, music gave you the time for the scary scene. If I know it's coming, it won't scare me. <br /> <br /> The film began with an explanation of what the "Grudge" is; when a person is killed during a rage attack, a curse is placed on the place where she was killed. So why does the Asian woman who is cursed by her mother mean anything to the story? And why is the resentment moving countries? This film was absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> All that was done was letting my friends blame me for making me go - we should have seen one of those Pixar animated movies. It would have been scarier.
