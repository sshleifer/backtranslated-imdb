A couple with financial problems receives a box delivered to their door. If they push the button they get a million dollars but someone they don't know will die. Press the button? <br /> <br /> This is a strange film based on a story by Richard Matheson that has some thrills but above all it's a messy affair. The trouble is there is so much to do that it seems like writer Richard Kelly didn't know what kind of movie he was doing. Is it a straight horror film with supernatural undertones? Sometimes it seems that you are talking about moral choices, damnation and the afterlife. Is it a science fiction movie? Perhaps there are many questions about that project on Mars. And what are the strange looks that people seem to have like in a big conspiracy? This invasion of the body snatchers or a demonic film takes over? I do not know maybe. And this is the problem, there are many questions, most of them intriguing, but there are too many. Little seems to have been explained and when we reach the end of the film things seem to stop and then conclude (even in an open way). I'm all for making a movie full of themes and points, but the writer Kelly fills the script with just too many things that director Kelly can't handle, or does so in such a way that every theme or storyline has its ten minutes of screen and for those minutes he holds the field before his next launch. It made me crazy. (I will not enter the two protagonists, Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, who are not very good or more likely they do not know what to do with the material that is so constantly changing) <br /> <br /> It's an intoxicating mix that doesn't work ( there are actually too many holes). I came to the end and suddenly realized that I had no idea what I had just seen. I did not like it very much, but this is not good because it is a bit lacking. I'll make a pass or wait for the cable where it won't cost you anything
