It is one of Shakespeare's joys that there can be no definitive performance - no single performance can be "right", but some may be wrong, and this is it. There are at least two things about Hamlet that cannot be eliminated: 1. His indecision and inability to take any kind of action. For God's sake, this is what makes the game last as long as it does. If you had Otello there instead of Hamlet, Claudio would have died at the end of the first act. Any production must try to explain why Hamlet's delays, because he is unable to act. 2. His sexual disgust. His total repulsion at the thought of what his mother and uncle get up to bed fill him with a total disgust for all sexual things and this means that any kind of relationship with Ofelia is impossible. At the slightest hint of sex, Hamlet vomits. So what does Mel Gibson offer us? Lusty action-man. You couldn't get away from Hamlet's character if you tried. There are many ways in which Hamlet can be played, but this is not one of them! What I don't understand is that they managed to get actors so good for the other parts - Claudio, Polonio and so on, because they couldn't find one to play Hamlet too. Mark Rylance in the part would have made this a great movie. This "Mel Gibson", whoever he is, completely disappointed the rest of the cast. And let's face it, Hamlet without the prince really doesn't work.
