Eight Legged Freaks is a modern monster movie, like a remake of one of the old "Attack of the giant [INSERT ANIMAL HERE]" - films of the 50s, 60s and 70s. Or rather, it should have been more like a remake of the, instead of what it was. So how is a monster movie made in 2002? Well, from the typical opening with some chemicals that make spiders grow in enormous proportions, they mix films like Gremlins, Jurassic Park, Starship Troopers and flavor it with a parody like Scary Movie. Gremlins is probably the best comparison, but Eight Legged Freaks was so full of stupid parodies and jokes that it was sometimes more like Scary Movie. It was too much, at least if you're looking for a monster movie and not just another joke-filled parody movie. <br /> <br /> For a film like this you don't expect much of acting, and so it did. The story, however, was extremely subtle, with only a group of freely connected events to show some action mixed with all the jokes, which led to an easily identifiable and mischievous ending. <br /> <br /> I rate Eight Legged Freaks a 4/10, and this includes the fact that the special effects were pretty good and that the noises that the spiders made were hilarious.
