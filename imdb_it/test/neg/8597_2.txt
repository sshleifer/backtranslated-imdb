The other day I showed my boyfriend a great movie, Stand By Me, a movie I showed to many people and they absolutely loved it, but for some strange reason he didn't like it. He lends me a film called Backdraft and tells me that he showed it to many people and that they loved it, but I hated this movie instead. I don't think I hated a movie so much, as this film has a score of 6.6 it's beyond me. I couldn't keep up with the five million stories here: Billy Baldwin becomes a firefighter, the casual rivalry between siblings, the casual love stories, who is a malicious story, the investigator, the fire that has a personality of own. I have only one problem that this film is not able to keep up with all these stories, they are not balanced enough to make the film interesting. I would have preferred the film to be about the role of firefighter or investigator and how it became one or what exactly is what it does and why. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a group of Chicago firefighters, two brothers. Stephen "Bull" McCaffrey, the elder brother, is obsessed with the bombardment of the fires he fights. Brian, the younger brother, left the fire academy school several years ago, then embarked on a series of other unsuccessful careers before returning to becoming a fireman. He is looked down upon by his older brother who expects him to fail in his new career as a fire boxer. Donald "Shadow" Rimgale is an incendiary investigator who is dedicated to his profession. It is called because a number of fires that have occurred have somewhat similar connections. . Martin Swayzak is a municipal councilor at the city council. He has obvious hopes of being elected mayor, but has had to make a series of budget cuts for the fire department. Many of the fire brigades believe that the cuts they made endanger the lives of firefighters. However, Swayzak was initially successful in portraying firefighters as inflated and ineffective after the firefighters were repeatedly killed on fire. <br /> <br /> I couldn't get into this film, I don't know how anyone else could, it was incredibly unrealistic and portrayed the fire brigade all wrong. I loved the way they had every action clich√© in the book to match this action movie. I also felt like there was a great talent wasted in such mediocre roles, Donald Sutherland, great actor, but such a strange role that he could have been taken by a lesser known man who had the impending talent at that time. I know that Ron was going for a great quality, but I think that playing such big actors in small roles was a mistake for this movie. I also had to joke while watching this movie commenting on how the doctor in the background was probably Kevin Spacey. The fire was so unrealistic and the film was so out there, I didn't like it and honestly I wouldn't recommend it to people, I will stick to the recommendations in my report from this point on. <br /> 2/10
