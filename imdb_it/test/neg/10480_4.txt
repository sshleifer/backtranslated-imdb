Repulsive blades of THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT (1955): the first half is deadly boring, even boring - but the last stages improve considerably with the scenes involving the unleashed "monster". In the adjacent featurette (a rather dry affair at just 9 minutes, compared to those created for the other titles in "Monsters & Madmen" by Criterion), the director Day - who admits he is not a fan of the genre science fiction - tries to justify the shortcomings of the film saying that he had a zero budget to work with (where all the scenes of the outer space were composed of archive material!) ... and I would have been inclined to be more lenient with the film film I had not recently watched CALTIKI , THE IMMORTAL MONSTER (1959) - a similar (and similarly worn) but much more elegant, from Italy! <br /> <br /> Bill Edwards as the arrogant but unfortunate astronaut - obsessed with achieving the titular prowess - at first he is decidedly boring, but in the end he manages to gather the public's understanding when his physical features become deformed and the character develops a taste for blood! Marshall Thompson as commanding officer and elder brother is O.K. as a slimmer type of Glenn Ford; previously he had acted in FIEND SENZA FACCIA (1958), another (and more successful) science fiction produced by Richard Gordon which, incidentally, is also available on DVD through Criterion. The Italian star Marla Landi, fighting against the English language, creates an inadequate female guide; even his contribution to the featurette reveals little lasting value! <br /> <br /> The Audio Commentary is another pleasant track by Tom Weaver / Richard Gordon in which, among other things, the fact that FIRST MAN INTO SPACE was intended as a double feature with CORRIDORS OF BLOOD ( 1958) is brought up - but in the end it was released as an independent version, in order to exploit the current value of the news of the current space race; it is also said that the dialogue of the monsters was nicknamed by Bonar Colleano (who, tragically, died in a car accident before the film was released!). Weaver even remembers a couple of anecdotes from the period in which he was involved in the production of the DVD film shot by, among all, the ex-cult-ish Norman J. Warren: Landi, who by then had become a lady of title , he was still ready to help bring the equipment needed to film the interview on different flights of stairs! Edwards was supposed to have contributed to the featurette but, once in London, he was reluctant to cooperate with Weaver - in the end, the latter learned that the actor had recently been diagnosed with cancer and, in fact, died in 2002 !
