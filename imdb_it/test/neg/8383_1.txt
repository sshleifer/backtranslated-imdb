This film is a nightmare! The feeling you get when you wake up from a nightmare is the same one I had when I finished watching this movie: "Uff ?? OK, it's over, what a relief!" I felt pain watching this movie, it was so bad! It's a low-cost B-series movie, that's for sure, but I don't think it's an excuse to be so bad! I saw brilliant films at low cost, with beautiful textures, beautiful production, beautiful acting and, above all, a bit of substance! This did not get anything! The plot is hilarious, it almost seems like an "American guide on how to transform ancient Chinese mythology into a ridiculous teenage film, with some children playing with the occult" ?? I don't know if the Chinese story in this film is real or not, but if it is, the "damage" is even worse! Production is simply horrible, a simple zero (what "special effects" are those?). There is no suspense. The alleged "tension scenes" are a complete failure. Acting is no better; and what about the dialogues? My God! A film that has dialogues several times like: "I'll pass by later, OK? Okay?" OK it's good. - OK? "OK, okay, bye then" ?? I'm sure he doesn't deserve more than a 1/10 score! <br /> <br /> Pity to be true!
