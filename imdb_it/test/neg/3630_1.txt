Blond protagonist, he always believes in everyone and when you bond together you can do EVERYTHING! Shy, my best friend with curly hair (torn by Gordo) wants to be a director has a secret crush on Zoey. Best Spanish Friend (Miranda rip-off) Strange smart girl Quinn (Lary Tudgemen rip-off) and Logan's popular preparatory escort (kate scam) And Zoey Max's little brother, annoying (Matt's rip-off) <br /> <br / > Zoey is the semi-popular girl, with 2 best friends. The only thing missing is the funny sacred vignette of Lizzie McGuire and Hillary Duff was much prettier. Jamie Lynn Spears looks more like toothpaste on top of a tube.
