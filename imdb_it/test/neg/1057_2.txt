(Warning: some spoilers in advance.) <br /> <br /> What an incredibly lousy movie. Iron Eagle 2 looks good. <br /> <br /> The story is as follows: Captain Holiday (Rutger Hauer) is shot down by his friend Banning (Robert Patrick) to prevent him from shooting down an Iraqi airliner full of innocent civilians. Six years later, Holiday returns to take revenge. Among other things he, sitting in a tank, chases Banning (now a colonel) and his pregnant wife on a field. He manages to shoot shells and drive the tank at the same time. After blowing up the tank from a bazooka, he miraculously survives and steals a fighter jet. With it he beats down a number of allied fighters before attacking NATO headquarters in an attempt to kill Banning's wife. <br /> <br /> An extra bonus is that Major Baxter (that party gets stuck in his office) has placed the insignia grade on his right shoulder backwards. Elegant.
