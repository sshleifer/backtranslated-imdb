Yes, Pigeon and Coburn are fantastic, and it's interesting to watch them, even though Coburn seems rather sober and boring here. It's nice to see Seattle, Victoria and Salt Lake City from the 70s and vintage cars and clothes. This is all good in this boring movie. The dialogue is incredibly bad, as is most of the acting. Ray and Sandy's motivations seem forced and unlikely. I've seen this "training to be a pickpocket" routine several times before. There is a long accumulation, which leads to nothing. Better to take an episode of "Streets of San Francisco", or one of the many great crime / caper films. To name a few, there are Bedtime Stories, redone as Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, The Lavender Hill Mob, The Grifters, Paper Moon, The Sting and, above all, House of Games.
