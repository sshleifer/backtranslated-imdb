After a plastic surgeon's wife dies, he gets his hunchback assistant to help him bring her back to life with various parts of other young and unmarried girls. This film wants to be a game by Hersel Gordon Lewis, but fails miserably. Acting is beyond evil, the effects of blood are atrocious (no, not in the best way), the plot almost non-existent and not fun to have. Salta. Do you want to know how incompetent it is? At some point you can clearly see a movie board. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Candy Furr becomes topless and again in a flashback <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: commentary with Jeffrey Hogue and Cynthia Soroka, A second film "How to make a Doll"; Sequence of titles alternated with intro by Hershel Gordon Lewis; 2 short films ("Quest of the Perfect Woman" and "Maniac Hospital"); Cover the art gallery with Dead Elvi music; Trailer for "Dr. Black Mr. Hyde", "Boots and the Preacher"; "The Doctor and the Playgirls", "The Gruesome Twosome"; "Wizard of Gore"; "Horrible Dr Orlof"; "Wacky world of Doctor Morgus"; "Proffessor Lust", "Monstrosity"; "Fanny Hill meets Dr. Erotico"; and "I, Marquis DeSade" <br /> <br /> Easter Eggs: Theatrical Trailer; a scene from "Just for the Hell of It"; and a trailer for "Ax"
