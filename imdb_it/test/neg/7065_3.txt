This film begins with an interesting set design and a promising premise, but fails to provide the assets of the cult film. Set in a gritty parallel universe in which everything is owned by the "Blump" Corporation, it is a horrible stand-up comic that finds success when a third arm grows from its back. <br /> <br /> All the potential for great cheese is here - the star of the eighties, Judd Nelson, Wayne Newton, unusual visions and strange digressions about the plot, obese women in skimpy lingerie, necrophilia - but he doesn't pay never. <br /> <br /> Rhythm is the main problem Every scene is extremely slow. Nelson's stand-up routines should be fun because they aren't pathetically fun. But every performance drags on until it's even tangentially fun, just boring. Imagine someone telling you the longest and most bizarre joke imaginable, full of gratifying self-satisfaction for how strange and strange it is. Imagine that after two hours of cloying you never took a punch line. You've just bothered to watch The Dark Backward.
