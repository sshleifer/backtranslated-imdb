Lame is really the best way to describe this film. He has a really poor screenplay, uninteresting dialogues and characters, and in essence he lacks everything else. <br /> <br /> There are too many characters and the problem is that you don't care about any of them. What the film lacks is a good and clear main character. But now the film has a bit of everything, it has a bit of a hero, it has a little bit of love interest and it has a bit of a bad temper. I wish only Ghoulies were a little less Ghoulies, but in this film they are mostly very annoying. <br /> <br /> Ghoulies should be diabolical creatures that kill for pleasure. In this film, however, all they want is to drink beer and watch naked female students. Also, someone had the "brilliant" idea of ​​allowing the Ghoulies to talk this time. This works really bad and annoying. The Ghoulie puppets have been definitely improved for this movie and they look more detailed and are able to do more, but at the same time they are much more fake than those of the previous Ghoulies movies. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the objective of this film was more comedy than horror this time. The film is like a high school comedy from the 80s (although this film was released in 1991). Humor is really the worst and most disgusting thing in the whole movie. It's so incredibly annoying and it's just not funny at all. <br /> <br /> History is not going anywhere with its history and the film is basically a big mess, which never seems to end. The plot of Ghoulies seems to have basically nothing to do with the other lines of the film, involving the human characters. The film does not speak at all of the Ghoulies who terrorize a college, with humans trying to drive them out and stop their fury. Not surprisingly, this is Brent Olson's only written film yet. He simply has no talent for this and I think he discovered this too and went back to college himself. <br /> <br /> Even compared to previous Ghoulies movies; this movie is simply terrible! <br /> <br /> 2/10
