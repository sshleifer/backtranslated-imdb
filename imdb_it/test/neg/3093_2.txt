I was sucked by the big names. Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles, Burt Reynolds and the fact that it was an independent film. Incredibly slow start: 35 minutes, two sad songs and a failed robbery. I didn't care about the characters, and the plot never even tempted me to pretend it could be realistic. I can't believe this is what makes the screen. I enjoyed watching this movie because it looked so good when it was finished.
