This is the absolutely worst show in the history of Nickelodeon. First of all, no college has a Sushi Bar, flat-screen TV and offers each student a laptop. This makes the show so unrealistic and boring. The plots are useless and incredibly boring. The actors are so bad, it makes me want to take my life. I really hate the fact that on the show, Zoey is the most popular girl at school, and the most beautiful, and the smartest, and gets the best grades without doing any work. He never had any real problems, and every guy wants to go out with her. She is so perfect. There is no one like that. Besides, I hate that everyone does everything for her, and everyone chooses it for every team or club. It's so annoying. Quinn is so hateful. His experiments are pathetic, useless and fake. Chase is such a lousy man. He says he loves Zoey, but if he told her, he would ruin their friendship. How pathetic. Michael tries to be funny, but he never gets anything. Nichole is so lively and screams a lot. You never see you do any work, or study, but you are a straight student. Lola thinks she's an actress, but she sucks (sorry my tongue). Do I have to say anything else? I think nobody. For your own sake, stay away from this show at all costs.
