I'm shocked to see that so many people have given positive reviews for this "movie". This film has no ransom. The music is not good, the acting is pathetic, I find it hard to understand how someone can appreciate this film, let alone sing its "praises". The idea is horrible, certain scenes related to the plot (like the continuous love story, even if the male romantic interest is a TESTA SHRUNKEN) are so bad that I wanted to hurt myself physically while I watched them. The fact that there is a scene in which a shrunken head flies under a t-shirt for girls so that it can "hear" it. And she likes it to be a sufficient reason for all those associated with this film to perish. The connection to West Side Story can only be a joke, since referring to such a beautiful film in such a horrible film is a good reason to destroy all copies of this film. In short, this film is horrible in every way. And if I had my way, everyone who likes it should go straight to hell ...
