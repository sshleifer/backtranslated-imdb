I imagine I was prepared after all the years I've heard of it. I heard it for the first time from Siskel and Ebert. When they said that Divine ate excrement, I had to look for it. Then a friend told me about it in 1991. He also said that his parents saw him when he came out and that his mother almost left her father on! So when I caught Pink Flamingos at Sundance today, I was prepared. For the most part. <br /> <br /> I couldn't help but be surprised by the anal close-ups and the blowjob scene. That being said, the only characters I sympathized with were Edie and the egg man. His crying scene at the beginning of the film, although on something frivolous for normal people, actually makes me sad. Although she certainly wasn't pretty, she had a pretty voice. I was happy for her and the egg man, and they actually touched me. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, acting in this production at poverty level was not good. And as for the script, how does John Waters invent this stuff? Well, at least it's different.
