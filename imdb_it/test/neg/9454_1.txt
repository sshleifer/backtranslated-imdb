How poor is this movie? Well, I took it less than two months ago and I can barely remember what it was ... <br /> <br /> I also paid a Â£ 1 for this on DVD, the old "put- a-new "cover on box" syndrome and "a bit of stupidity." All I remember is that the cast went around a lot, the use of the machines had to be too much above the budget and that a vampire was involved. Then again, I guess you can know it from the movie's title. <br /> <br /> Straight to the video junk or directly to the cheap DVD now. This stuff will be in the dumpsters deal at rental stores, supermarkets and charity shops until the sun dies. Only cockroaches will dominate the land, but this garbage will still be in circulation. God bless the dawn of the DVD era.
