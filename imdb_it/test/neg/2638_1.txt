This film was so weak that it could not even find good clich√©s to tear. I love horror movies and I will see pretty much everything, but if I had to do it again, I would have missed all this. You might think I'm exaggerating, but I challenge anyone to find something that is even remotely satisfying or interesting about this piece of junk. Not scary, not funny, not curious, it's not worth it.
