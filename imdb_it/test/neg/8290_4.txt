"Graduation Day" is the result of the success of "Friday 13th". Both films are about creative, bloody, rather than suspenseful murders. If you like that kind of movie, I recommend "Graduation Day". If not, I wouldn't do it. There is nothing new here, just the same old killings. <br /> <br /> Even if I gave the film 4 out of 10, I will say that it is not a repulsive film. It is watchable if you are curious, not creative.
