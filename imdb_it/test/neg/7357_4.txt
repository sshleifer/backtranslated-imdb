When you go through a movie, you know you're wasting your time watching the movie in question. This is exactly how I felt while watching "Darkness". I could see anticipating every turn and turning easily. It's a combination of "The Amityville Horror" and a myriad of films that deal with the occult. It is so foolish that I almost found his naivety. I can't say I'm totally bored but I found the movie too derivative for my taste. Director Balaguer√≥ tries to redo his first Spanish hit "The Nameless", but he can't make it. I admit, some sequences were pretty scary, but I just abhorred when I can figure out what's going to happen next. Also, I hated seeing good actors like Lena Olin and Giancarlo Giannini sweat so much on this piece of dreck. Finally, is Anna Paquin the protagonist of a horror film? This must be a joke. She's pretty but one of those good actors who have become a monotonous adult actor. You can live without looking at this.
