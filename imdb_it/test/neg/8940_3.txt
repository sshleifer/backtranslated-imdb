I would agree with another spectator who wrote that this film is reminiscent of the Melanie Griffith / Jeff Daniels comedy, "Something Wild", in which a rather eccentric free spirit engages with a conservative and very tidy young man, and the two pose like a pair and basically, his personality gradually has an effect on him. It melts and learns to enjoy their short trial period. This is exactly what happens here, except to include a cheap eccentric for the store, Alex (Rosanna Arquette) as Melanie Griffith and a super-cautious teenager, Lincoln (the name is not a coincidence, played by Devon Gummersall) in the part by Jeff Daniel. This film also shares the same extravagant and sudden gender change in which the disquieting and violent boy suddenly appears and things end badly. Only here, instead of being Ray Liotta who plays a comeback in the fifties, is Peter Greene. <br /> <br /> The story is about a little boy who is in his little world. He has a sort of fascination with death after his brother's suicide, and even his parents forgot, behaving in a rather strange way (the mother is convinced that Christmas will come soon, despite being August). Then, in an evening with the "guys" (one of whom is played by Jason Hervey of Wonder Years) who tries to buy them, he runs into Alex who decides to kidnap him and his friends car (with his permission of course), and leave for the mini-adventure through the deserts of the West Coast, stealing cheap shops in Robin Hood fashion and, of course, indulging in self-discovery routines while everyone asks more about the life of the other. But Alex has left a partner in his stealing business and will not go away easily. Even if we are not constantly reminded of him or of something as in the repetitive flashback or in the cut of his point of view. At least this was done intelligently. <br /> <br /> 'Do Me a Favor' (aka Trading Favors), is a mostly underdeveloped story of criminal crimes and self-discovery that is late for the first half of the film, but delivers the things a little too late when Alex and Lincoln arrive at his house in the middle of nowhere. When the directors give you enough stimulation, the film is unfortunately almost over. I would recommend that if this is the kind of story you are in the mood for, and although Rosanna Arquette always gives a good interpretation (even in a badly written film), I still recommend taking it in its best form, "Something Wild."
