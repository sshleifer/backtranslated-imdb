While design, places and photography are strengths in this film; it is a turgid and melodramatic affair that demonstrates the limits of cinema to convey the truth. <br /> <br /> The case is the use of music from the soundtrack: a mix by Gustav Mahler and Andrew Lloyd-Webber that plays constantly and loudly and makes Max Steiner grimace for his excessive use, since it instructs the public on how difficult it is; how ecstatic; how tortured being an artist is. And then the story that raises the details really matters. <br /> <br /> This intensive and kitsch exploitation of emotions was once ridiculed by Peter Ackroyd in a book by Yukio Mishima: This isn't writing, this is Barbara Cartland. The same criticism can be made of this film: a deceptive and mushy project.
