After witnessing the first incident of the Dark Harvest movie, I couldn't leave myself bad enough. After seeing that there was a sequel (or rather what I thought was a sequel) I had to increase my pain level. Seeing that this had nothing to do with Dark Harvest, it should have been a good thing. We didn't have any scarecrow killers in this, instead we got a donkey who walked around a cornfield screaming little things like "Girls!" and "Can you hear me?" sometimes. We also have two (four if you include the two girls that the director wanted the same effect as the twins in The Shining) hateful girls who couldn't play. And the icing on top of this mess should be the Grain Policeman. I should have known that this film would be terrible when the dog got an opening credit. How I managed to stay awake through this film, I'll never know.
