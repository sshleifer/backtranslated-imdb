It does not surprise me that the producers of this hopeless film could not find a distributor in the UK, and that they then had to release it as a free DVD with a Sunday newspaper. The distributors could clearly see what the directors and the Sunday newspaper could not do, that this was a film that would not recover its costs. <br /> <br /> Since it is a riddle on the riddles, it would have helped if they had chosen a leading actor who could state correctly, rather than the grumbling Vinnie Jones who seems to say "riddle" as "riell". And it would have helped if the dialogue hadn't been submerged by noisy places or scenes filled with inattentive and inappropriate music. The plot is ridiculous: the lost story of Charles Dickens could help our hero solve a series of modern murders, but also a copy of Herge's Adventures Of Tintin, because the link between Dickens and Jones is more non-existent than tenuous. And we have the ridiculous premise that an aspiring investigative journalist who gets his hands on a previously unknown Dickens manuscript, it would take several days to read it, so that Dickens's flashbacks can continue to be reproduced in the film, as if they had some connection to it. What they don't do I mean, if you found a new Dickens manuscript, wouldn't you go somewhere quiet and read it? The film ends with one of those surprise revelations that have become mandatory from the sixth sense, but in this case it doesn't surprise you as much as insulting your intelligence. If the film suddenly becomes supernatural at the twelfth hour, revealing that Vinnie Jones is a robot may have been more acceptable. It might not have looked so swollen if the film had been elegant, but it isn't. And in many places it looks decidedly amateur: there is a scene in which a table is placed with a high jump technique of the 60s, but they did not ensure that the person who was actually laying the table was completely out of the frame between cuts. As a result, you can see the things that change at the edge of the frame when you are supposed to be looking at things that change in the center of the frame. A good rule in making films is: if you don't understand how to make a technique, try something else. <br /> <br /> The real riddle is because someone thought it would be a good idea to make this movie first.
