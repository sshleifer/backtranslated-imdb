This film had such a good premise to start. Suspense, slashers, a secret society, and you couldn't really figure out who the bad guys were until the last quarter of the movie. <br /> <br /> But it contained so many stupid clichés of the worst of the old American Slasher / horror movies. Now, I love slasher / horror movies, but there are all the old cliches that have long disappeared from American cinema. For example, the old "I hear noises in the basement and I'm at home all alone and the basement light does not work, so I will go to examine the" cliché. <br /> <br /> Three examples of these clichés really bothered me until the end: <br /> <br /> 1) When Potente discovers that there may be a secret society at work in the medical school that carves bodies living, she continues to ask questions and tell EVERYONE - very publicly. In essence, he is saying: "I found you outside, come kill me because I'm telling everyone your secret". And then he wonders why he finds blood smeared on his bed and brings his roommate's severed finger into a towel. <br /> <br /> 2) Even after a boy met two weeks ago ends up on the dissection table and finds out about this secret society by gutting alive people, he goes to the laboratory where all the bodies are kept 2-3 more times FROM TESTA AT NIGHT to investigate. <br /> <br /> 3) His roommate is killed. She is chased by the killer, whom she knows, doesn't report him to the university or to the police, so he leaves school to go home to visit his parents. Then he returns to school, apparently thinking that this guy who tried to kill her will leave the past far away and not try to kill her, even though he knows his secret. It was, of course, wrong. <br /> <br /> For someone who should have been so smart (he was studying to be a doctor in the best school in Germany), he acted like a cliché in a horror movie. <br /> <br /> These things made a potentially good movie very frustrating and made me want the ending to come even earlier. In the middle of the movie, I stopped routing for her and wished she'd end up on the dissection table.
