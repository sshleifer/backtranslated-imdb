The Girl in Lovers' Lane: 3 out of 10: The homoerotic subtext in films is a well-known phenomenon. Many of the dissertations have come out of film schools on subtitles hidden in films like Top Gun and Spartacus. The Girl in Lover's Lane definitely fits the homoerotic trope. Indeed, it is so blatant and exaggerated that even MST3K, which rarely notices such things in their riffing, simply cannot avoid it. <br /> <br /> The film is about two drifters. A rich boy (Lowell Brown) who runs away from home with a hundred dollars and no street intelligence, the other is a professional hobo (Brett Halsey). Father saves the child from a gang of thugs and ends up in a small town consisting of a diner, a billiard room and a brothel. Our erudite drifter gets a second look from the diner's waitress (Joyce Meadows as the protagonist Girl in Lovers Lane) who clearly has passed the age of being demanding and whose only other prospect is the creepy Jack Elam who makes an impression of Steve Buscemi. <br /> <br /> On the surface, it looks like a strange film for the MST3K treatment. While the cast is old for the characters they are playing, the acting is actually pretty good with both Brett Halsey and Jack Elam performing well. The plot is light, but hardly the material The Robot vs. Aztec Mummy and production values ​​are inexpensive, but relatively competent. <br /> <br /> It is the strange Batman and its underground homosexual currents that make this film both terrible and fun. Halsey's highest objections to children's attempts to fuck in the whorehouse are hilarious, his inability to engage with the maid (or at least to overcome the first base) is saying, and the dozens of looks between him and the boy; a hand on his shoulder, arrangements to sleep, flip through dates with the girl so he and the child can shave each other. You don't have to be Freud to understand this underground.
