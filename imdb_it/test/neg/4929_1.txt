"Shuttle" is / was more of a boring movie that had an interesting start, but after half an hour it ended in the worst imaginable way I could ever imagine. This film has lost its story, if you can call it a story? ... after half an hour. All subsequent scenes are totally disproportionate. The driver is a kind of superman because he survives every attack with a gun, etc. Even after stabbing a leg he managed to put it in the box. But what a coincidence that there was a box in that garage. I felt really bad and misguided when the movie is finished. It could have been so beautiful if the story was far better. In my opinion, even a child would make a better story. And why send the girl with water and food. I stopped counting the holes in the plot halfway. And when the film reached its final turn almost sick, damned sick, I had completely surrendered (better to say "vomit.) The worst thing about Shuttle is actually that it can't be even worse than worse. The writer / director Anderson will learn from this lesson and will provide us with a decent thriller next time.you think it will get better in a different genre I have my fingers crossed But from now on I will read the commentary on his future films before watching.
