Jack Lemmon was one of the best actors who ever loved the screen. He could easily move from dramatic roles to comedians with ease, making most of his peers green with envy. While his performance in "Save The Tiger" is worthy of an Oscar, I think he was given it because he didn't lose the other opportunities to win the prize due to other better roles that preceded the current one. <Br /> <br /> This is also one of those pretentious movies that come out to basically show the talent of the cast, or in this case, a particular member. Too bad the scriptwriter's output does not match that of Lemmon. Don't waste time with this.
