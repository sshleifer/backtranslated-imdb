Even worse than the incredibly boring "The Exorcism of Emily Rose". He started decently, and until Mom told daddy, "See, I knew she was possessed," in a way that I told you so. It was a terrible joke, badly pronounced and foreshadowed the rapid disappearance of this incredibly ugly film. Every family member has a problem from the past with the priest. Dad begins to accuse everyone of pleasing his wife, or actually having an affair with her, culminating with him in killing his friend, then himself in the obvious immediate lucidity after realizing that his friend had not yet gone to bed with his wife. People die, others have them and at this point most of the spectators don't even care anymore. Except for their employee Miguel, none of the characters in this film was really nice, making it hard to take care of any of them. The acting was terrible and the writing even worse. I'm glad I saw it for free; even though I feel that for a film so bad someone owes me money for the time I lost.
