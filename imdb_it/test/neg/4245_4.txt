This film was a sad attempt to recreate a crucial moment in English history. The film version of Cromwell's growing involvement in the War is marginally accurate, but the overall historical accuracy of this film was far away. This film implies that the war started because of religious differences, but the civil war was by no means Catholic versus Protestant: both sides were Protestants. Cromwell was never present at the Battle of Edgehill, nor ever "saved the day". The monarchists did not win, the battle ended in balance. <br /> <br /> As another reviewer noted, Cromwell was certainly not one of the "Five Members" who had to be removed from the Chamber and arrested. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film was decent. The producers tried WAY hard and it didn't turn out to be that great. <br /> <br /> certainly could have been better.
