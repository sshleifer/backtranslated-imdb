I bought this movie because I thought the cast was decent and I like Jennifer Rubin and Patsy Kensit. <br /> <br /> First of all let me tell you that acting is not of a high standard. Stephen Baldwin makes his character seem almost retarded at times and sometimes gloomy. Patsy Kensit is so-so, but not too convincing in some scenes, and the supposed poem he spits in a particular scene in his hotel room is meaningless garbage. Mrs. Kensit is certainly very suggestive and sexy, but in the end I think Jennifer Rubin is by far the best in this movie. Ms Rubins Character is initially innocent, then sexy, while playing the character of Stephen Baldwin (Travis) for a madman. The supporting cast includes Adam Baldwin (not related to his most famous names) and M. Emet Walsh who has appeared in many films, I also noticed Art Evans who was one of John Mclane's allies in Die Hard 2. The film is decent and there are some nude scenes with Rubin & Kensit, a bit of action, but this is certainly not a fast or smart thriller. There is a particular scene when I'm in the car to commit a crime and the character of Stephen Balwin wears sunglasses and when you see him again, the area around his eyes etc. Instead it is painted black, then the sunglasses will reappear later when the crime scene goes away and the police are looking, a very obvious mistake in editing. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of both women or Baldwin, you may find something you like here, but others should stay away. This is a reasonable but insignificant thriller and is not really worth more than a couple of dollars if you want it.
