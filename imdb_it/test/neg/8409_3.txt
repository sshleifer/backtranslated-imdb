Pretty good follower for the TV show of the classic Roman Polanski. Rosemary's son, Adrian, grew up and is embodied by the creepy Stephen McHattie. After eliminating Rosemary (here played by Patty Duke) a coven of witches, again led by Minnie & Roman Castevets, prepares Satan's son for world domination. It's not really scary and light years less macabre than its predecessor. Instead, writer Anthony Wilson and director Sam O'Steen opt for a thriller that adores Satan full of lots of songs, lots of candles and Ruth Gordon trying to behave daffy and mean at the same time. Gordon is the only survivor of the original. George Maharis replaces John Cassavetes as Guy and Ray Milland, a true hammam, in the role of Roman Castevets, subtitle for Sidney Blackmer. The newcomer McHattie is the only true saving grace of the film. He's very out of his mind and looks really sinister without even doing anything. Charles Bernstein's music is appropriately disturbing, but so overused, it ends up being intrusive rather than effective. O'Steen, who edited the previous Polanski masterpiece, shows no taste or subtlety.
