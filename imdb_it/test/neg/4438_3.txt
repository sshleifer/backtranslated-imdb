The things that I find irritating on the screen, the things that excite and annoy me people who try to watch movies with me are those moments when the writer, the director, the set designer, the screen catering, or anyone, doesn't think of it until the end and, with a single act of omission - or commission - cancels all the work done by all the others who worked on the film. That moment of "Wait a bloody minute ... What happened?" that stops the dead story in its tracks. (Not that the narrative of this film needs to stop much, because anyone who has ever seen it will know that Quintet's narrative disc is solid enough and frozen before the end of the opening film.) There are many of those moments in this movie. And you will be late thinking about it too much. The film has a duration of two hours and the dialogue with script is probably five pages. There is plenty of time to reflect on its shortcomings. <br /> <br /> The film is set in an icy land. Another glacial era has begun and the whole world is dying. It's cold. Very cold. It is actually very cold on the screen. The film was shot in Canada in the winter and there are icicles and real snow and the breath of the people is misted from the mouth in every scene. Several times we are reminded how cold the cold is. People wear hats and layers and layers of clothes and walk around like over-dressed Weeble people. It must have been a horrible shot. My nitpick comes in sequence when our hero enters a hotel room. Woke up in the middle of the night by voices from the next room, he hears a conversation of vital importance for the thin plot through a large grid in the wall that divides the two rooms. I am not asking why there is a comfortable grid in the wall between the two rooms. What bothered me was the fact that the grid had not been blocked by the tenant in the long term with the noisy visitor. If you're trying to warm up, the last thing you need is a huge gaping hole in the wall that leads to an unheated unheated room. Trust me. I live like this, I saw this movie sitting on my living room sofa under a duvet with a hot water bottle. My breath was tarnishing as much as the actors. If that big hole was in my wall, I'll block it with something. Maybe it's not the best choice of movies to watch in a non-heated room in mid-winter, but the boy pointed out to me the disgusting isolation of the film.
