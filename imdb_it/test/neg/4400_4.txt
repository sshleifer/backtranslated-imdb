The Palestinian situation is fertile and still largely uncultivated for cinema. 'Divine Intervention' tries hard, and gives us a penetrating insight into the almost surreal life of those involved in trouble, but the film amounts to little more than a handful of visual jokes (certainly adorable) thrown on celluloid, while the links between they become increasingly obscure as the film progresses. A missed opportunity to say something more coherent on a very current topic.
