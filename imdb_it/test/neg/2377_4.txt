This film is a perfect example that a film cannot succeed on a high budget alone. It is obvious that there has been a lot of time and effort devoted to this: the animation is fluid, detailed and superb - the soundtrack is not too memorable except for the Celine Dion final song (at least I think it was her) . The soundtrack is a powerful orchestral material. Congratulations to the animators and music composers! 9/10. However, the story and the characters fall horizontally. It seems very "been there, done that", predictable and without interest. The characters have distinct personalities but nothing too nice. They bothered me until the end. I really tried to like it a lot, but I didn't care about the story: it was a plot of action-adventure made up of clichés. There were "jokes" that weren't funny. It was vomiting causing predictable from start to finish. The dialogue was cliché and terrible, especially the last sentence "It's not ... it gives you wings, it's love!" Whatever it was, I remember doing it. I wanted him to hurry up and finish. I wasn't the only one - the people I went with thought it was boring. Please watch the movie Asterix and Obelix Cleopatra if you watch anyone. This was a waste of time.
