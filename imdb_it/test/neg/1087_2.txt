This hokey film let me moan after almost every exchange of dialogue or complication of the plot. Patricia Arquette, although pleasant to look at, gives a performance inferior to her usual mediocrity. My friends and I coined the phrase "Beyond Rangoon" to say something really bad. A weak point for Boorman.
