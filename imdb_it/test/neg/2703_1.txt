As a cartoon, the Spytroops movie was pretty ugly. It is only 44 minutes long, but numerous battles occur with the destruction of the COBRA headquarters. A downer was the beginning of the film. An animated battle that was better than the rest of the film turns out to be a sort of battle simulation. Right there was a strong turn-off and the rest of the film has no credibility. Then there was Shipwreck's problem tied up with his parrot, and thrown into a room where nobody had checked for several days. Whatever happened to the surveillance cameras? <br /> <br /> The COBRA base had only a handful of characters, and the rest were BAT robots. Apart from many corridors, the COBRA base did not seem to have weapons, tanks, trucks or any other equipment. Then there was the silly notion that 100 complex androids could be created during the night. The plot was silly, even though it was meant for small children. Spongebob, Powerpuff Girls, and even Barney The Dinosaur pay more attention to their storylines. <br /> <br /> The characters weren't bad, except I never understood anything that Destro was saying, and Commander Cobra was foolish and not much of a villain. In fact, with the exception of Storm Shadow and Xartan, the rest of the COBRA characters were comical and not impressive. GI Joe's characters were pretty good. Scarlett, Agent Faces, Road Block and Snake Eyes were my favorites here. Shipwreck and Beach Head were the worst. Shipwreck is written as a goof ball and Beach Head sounded like a surfer from the 90s. I imagine the writer Larry Hama was trying to create a character that teenagers liked, but it was a decade away from the world. Simply listening to Spiche's surf-talk on Beach Head (Fast Times at Ridgemont High) I wondered if the new GI Joes would have smoked a dube before the big mission. <br /> <br /> The CGI was pretty good, except that Commander Cobra had a frantic spasm and the vehicles didn't seem realistic at all. The flying tank and the explosions weren't very impressive. The old-fashioned animation would have been much better than that. As reportedly Hasbro loves to do things cheaply, they got what they paid for. I had trouble watching it all, it was just boring and lacked any GI Joe soul or spirit. Even the old GI Joe commercials would have been better. In fact, the DVD included extras like four or five commercials for GI Joe Spy Troops, and those commercials were a lot more fun than the movie. The spots had more fun and a child-oriented spirit. The commercials were lively, while the film was boring.
