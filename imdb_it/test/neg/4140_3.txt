If there is a word I can associate with this film, its "embarrassment". It must be embarrassing for all those who are associated with the film, to actually see it in a theater. Everything - screenplay, screenplay, dialogues, song lyrics, direction - poor, lousy. <br /> <br /> I saw this film when I was a child. I liked it, especially because it was a fantasy, a superhero movie. It is a genre not much explored in Hindi cinema. The attempt deserves credit, but that's all there is to it. Sashi Kapoor seems to have been in a hurry to make the film. I can't understand the reason behind the casting of foreigners as Hindi speaking characters, who can't even synchronize properly (nothing to say about dubbing). The script is terrible. Assembly even more. If you follow the dialogues closely, you may find grammatically wrong sentences (which completely alter the intended meaning). Nothing special for music. <br /> <br /> The biggest embarrassment must be for the Censor card. In the film there are a couple of slippery scenes, one of which is absolutely clear (so much so that I can't even think of a metaphor). The manager missed them. The assembly team missed it. And even the censorship council missed it. So much for the motto of the screen motto that not indecent. Officials probably fell asleep while watching the film. <br /> <br /> I can't think why Amitabh went with the role. It could be because he was a good friend of Kapoor's. But the role has almost nothing for him. With wonderful roles in Hum and Agneepath behind him, he could not have followed him with a worse one. There are a couple of heroic scenes, really worthy. Otherwise, they are incredibly embarrassing (eg the arrow that catches the arrow ... probably would have been better with CGI, but it was '91 ..). <br /> <br /> Dimple and Sonam are not exactly set the screen on fire. Shammi Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor give an inspired performance, but their purpose is limited. Amrish Puri is his usual self in the role of a wicked fairy tale (leaving out the occasional laughter). <br /> <br /> Overall, an interesting concept. It could have been much better.
