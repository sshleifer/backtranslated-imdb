Apart from Frank Kress (who played Abraham Gentry), an appearance by Henny Youngman and the last few seconds of the film, there was really nothing particularly good about this film. Because it's currently rated 5.3 and adored by some reviewers it's beyond me - the film is 99.44% crap ... and exactly what I would have expected from director Hershell Gordon Lewis. In the 60s and 70s, Lewis was known to have made a series of incredibly low exploitation films, such as BLOOD FEAST and MONSTER A GO-GO. However, in recent years he has been christened "the father of gore" and has many, many fans - fans who ignore the ineptitude of his work and focus only on how revolutionary some of his films have been. But apart from the liberal use of fake blood and real belly, after all, his films are pure shit - and I don't believe in the scores of 9 and 10 for his films. It would be like putting a painted velvet by Elvis at the Louvre !! <br /> <br /> The film is about a series of terrible murders that happen to strippers. When I say creepy, it's very gory and sick by 1972 - though by today's standards the special effects seem incredibly lame. So, while in the film very deviant and cruel murders happen (I prefer not to explain them - they are of a rather sick mind and show a particularly serious contempt for women), at least they won't make you sick because they have been so badly done. cases are cutting rubber dolls and dummies. But making them do some of the sick acts, even if it's not realistic, is pretty bad and shows a lot of misogyny. <br /> <br /> The only hope in the film, given that the police are all idiotic, is a boy named Abraham Gentry - whose mannerisms and style of speech are very close to the stockbroker, David Lochary, from the first films of John Waters. While his acting is bad, he is so extravagant and funny that he kept my interest. It could be pretty funny and strangely this is the only movie I've ever made !! It was also strange that so many women wanted him - especially because they didn't look like his type. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the people in the movie, they are jerks and idiots who might not act. In fact, I was hoping that MUCH would be killed - they really did get it! None of their actors was the least believable and the director apparently never filmed a single scene - since most of the scenes in the film were worse than those of Ed Wood's masterpiece, PLAN 9 FROM EXTERNAL SPACE. In fact, for many of the women in the film, the only prerequisite for their appearance in the film is that they are willing to take off their clothes. Now I know this will seem pretty trivial, but most of them are incredibly unattractive and they seem to be drug addicts who get naked to get their next solution. When these ladies take off their clothes, the men in the crowd give them the money to put it back (wow - Henny Youngman SHOULD have said it in the movie)! But considering Lewis's budgets, these were probably the best "actresses" he could get. <br /> <br /> Overall, an annoying bucket of bile that can be worse than most other director's films ... and this is saying a lot! It's violent (but stupid), anti-women (treating them like meat and things to mutilate) and it's completely incompetent from beginning to end.
