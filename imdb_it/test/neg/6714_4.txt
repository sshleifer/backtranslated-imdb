"The Foreigner" is a story of foreign intrigue with Seagal at the center as a deep cover agent who has a package that everyone wants and is willing to kill to get. The film is not inspired by less than the usual action actions that put Seagal on the film's map (gunfights, melee, pyrotechnics, acrobatics, etc.) and much more of a twisted story, uninteresting and full of filler without sense. What a sign there is of sign and gratuitousness, while Seagal, which looks more and more like a pork chop, moves through this insipid, inexpressive and bored stroke while showing no improvement in the acting ability. Somewhere in "The Glimmer Man" or "Fire Down Below", Seagal's gestures took a nose dive and "The Foreigner" is just a continuation of that trend. Nothing here is worth looking at except for the toughest Seagal fans. (C-)
