I went to see "TKIA" with high expectations, which could influence my opinion on it. I've seen all the Dogme movies and this TKIA is by far the worst. The story is intertwined with the themes of Shakespeare's comedy: King Lear, but never fails to capture the public and get them treated. The direction of the actors is very loose, even for the Dogme-style films, and translates into indefinable acting. History lacks any dynamics, and I lost interest very soon. There are some scenes in the movie that are there to shock the viewer, but I don't think they have improved the story. Mifunes sidste sang and Festen are both Dogmefilms which has proven to be well directed and has a good storyline, so I'm looking forward to improving Dogmefilms in the future. Perhaps "An Invisible Man-Dogme 6" by Aake Sandgren will prove to further improve quality. Because he is, like Vinterberg and S.K. Jacobsen is an experienced and educated director.
