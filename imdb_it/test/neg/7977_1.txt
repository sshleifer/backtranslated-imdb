I bought this rental back for $ 1.99 in Hollywood and overpaid. I didn't expect much, but I thought it would be something to sleep at least. I immediately noticed the very weak plot, the coarse exaggeration of everyone (nobody talks like this except in cartoons) and the seemingly "let do-how-we-go" direction. I know that the participants in this casino have to be very embarrassed by this, and I'm sure it didn't help any career. as for this 35-year-old movie fan, he has now provided a ready answer for the worst question you've ever seen. <br /> <br />
