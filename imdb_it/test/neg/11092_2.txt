I don't usually classify a boring shift. I'm not great at action movies and my senses don't need to be stimulated during a movie. In fact I enjoy a good logical rational dialogue and a plot. Unfortunately, this film has none of these features. Diane Lane is the only thing she saves in this movie and even her beauty can't save him. The terrible overbearing music equals moral dialogue and acting. None of the actors actually connects and as a result the film does not connect to the public. I imagine that the scenes where the citizens are marching somewhere suppose to add to the story, but they seem to have been inserted just to fill the space. The scenes looked blurry and inconsistent. There were some nice shots of the ocean and the beach that were beautiful.
