Daft's mammoths don't come much further than this, but it's a film by Douglas Sirk that makes it all right. Except in this case not. Based on a novel by the sumptuous Lloyd C Douglas, (he wrote "The Robe"), and already shot in 1935 with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor, it has a greater lift than a cantilever bra. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making Jane Wyman a widow, but later being directly responsible for the accident in which he loses sight. To make amends he takes the medicine, becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it. (No, he's not really that stupid, he planned to become a doctor before he became an arrogant playboy). Between one moment and another, they fall in love. <br /> <br /> As much as I can prove, I can't find the redeemed social commentary and criticism of American customs that should be just below the surface of Sirk's films, (this is not too deep). On the positive side, Rock Hudson is not bad at all, (I think I'm rediscovering it), and, of course, it looks great (in Sirk's movies people live in cathedrals-sized rooms). Nothing in this film matches the best of his later work and even in terms of soap operas this is definitely daytime TV.
