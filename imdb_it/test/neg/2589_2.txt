This is so obviously a repudiation made on TV by Black Widow (1987) - even the titles of the insects are so similar. <br /> <br /> If you want a better film to "spend money", take a look at Black Widow, played by Debra Winger and Theresa Russell. <br /> <br /> These movies are tasteful at best ..! I just had to watch it all to see how it ended.
