The audience sat in silence through most of the film, with only a few, rare, occasional laughter. The Maxwell Smart character was so incoherent, I felt frustrated. When it is convenient for the plot, Smart behaves like a main light. Other times, it behaves like an imbecile. They lift many classic lines from television series, but they don't work in this version. The classic "missed for this" is fun if it is pronounced with braggadocio attempts by someone who is an obvious failure - but loses all the humor when it is spoken by someone who is qualified. To a slightly lesser extent, many of the other characters move at a dizzying pace from skillful incompetents to cartoonists. Siegfried, the main criminal, would seem to be intelligent, but he makes decisions that make absolutely no sense. However, none of the characters in the film is as incompetent as the writers of this casino. I am deeply depressed that so many IMDb users believe this was good.
