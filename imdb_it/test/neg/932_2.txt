It is as if someone had taken a fantasy video game and put it in a blender, and the resulting mixture of scenes is what we have to sit on. <br /> <br /> Now let me check in by saying how much I love Chinese fantasy movies. From the fun and foolish, to those who focus on martial arts, to the most dramatic and romantic types, it's a genre that I really like. Movies like "A Chinese Odyssey: Pandora's Box" and "A Chinese Odyssey: Cinderella" (both written and / or directed by Jeffrey Lau); "The bride with white hair"; "Butterfly & Sword"; "Green Snake"; "A story of Chinese ghosts"; "Swordman II"; "Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain"; "Tiger bowed Dragon hidden"; and other. That's why I was looking forward to "A Chinese Tall Story". One of the characters in the film is the "King of the Apes" (also known as Sun Wukong), an extremely well-known character in Chinese mythology, recounted for the first time in the "Journey to the West" stories, the epic adventure written about 500 years old does. (The story of the Monkey King and his disciples is also at the center of the films "Chinese Odyssey", among many others). Other familiar characters that appear in the film are Zhu Wuneng (the character of the pig) and Sha Wujing. <br /> <br /> So how's everything going wrong? Well, let's take a familiar example to the Western public. What do you think of Robin Hood's mythology? A well-known story from the old days. Let's say our Robin Hood movie played Wesley Snipes as Robin Hood and Haley Joel Osment as Friar Tuck. Maid Marian is none other than Rosie Perez. We also give Sir Robin an Uzi, because you never know when you might have to waste the Sheriff of Nottingham. They might even need rocket packs, and as we try, give them a tactical nuclear weapon because it could definitely come in handy. If you think this may sound like a really accurate account of Robin Hood's story, then "A Chinese Tall Story" is the movie for you! As I said above, this film is a confusing mess. In the first 30 minutes, we are introduced not only to Sun Wukong, Zhu Wuneng and Sha Wujing, but also to the monk Tripitaka (who is actually the main protagonist), kidnapped children, a "millennium demon bug" (which shoots laser beams) , a God of the underground Tree, a tribe of the lizard empire, an angelic girl in an intergalactic egg, the Lord Chancellor Tortoise, a Sea Dragon King, an ever-changing golden magic stick, a madcap babbler, wormhole in space, and the Four Heavenly Knights. All this would not be bad - the stories and myths handed down over the years certainly have all sorts of fantastic elements. But I guarantee you that Chinese mythology does not include most of the things we are subjected to in the last part of the film. (Useful tips for filmmakers: just because your computer effects kids CAN find spaceships and interesting intergalactic wars, doesn't mean that it SHOULD BE). <br /> <br /> You know that your film about Chinese mythology is on the wrong track when the director asks (and I'm not doing this, it's a quote from the comment) "I asked the composer if we could or could not have rock-and-roll music when it turned into some kind of thing like Android. "Is there a story hidden here somewhere? Yes. Yes, there is. Most of the adventure follows Tripitaka (played by Nicholas Tse "Gen-X Cops", "Time and Tide", "My Schoolmate the Barbarian") and Meiyan, the lizard imp girl (played by Charlene Choi and a computer) . Choi is the best thing about this movie. You might know it as half of the pop-pop group "Twins" and from other films like "The Twins Effect" (a funny movie) and "Just One Look" (a surprisingly good drama / novel / comedy). Poor Choi, being an elf and all the rest, is hardly recognizable with his warts, torn teeth, a frowned nose and a curved back. That is until computers grab it and embellish it, which somehow makes things worse. Tse is acceptable, but all secondary actors were abysmal. A couple of recognizable faces in small parts are wasted. <br /> <br /> At one point I was arguing with myself if "A Chinese Tall Story" was a parody. I was almost able to convince myself that it was when the intergalactic egg girl (played by a very nice fan of Bing-Bing) came out and lit a Marlboro (!) While talking to Tripitaka who practiced martial arts dressed in a Spider-Man costume ( !!). But it's not a parody. Obviously there is the typical Hong Kong foolishness, but the film takes itself quite seriously, with enough scenes of romanticism and pathos (marked with a sleigh of evocative violins and cellos) and which arouse action and adventure. <br /> <br /> You might think you could see it on a Netflix rental and it won't cost you anything. (Oh, but it will cost you, okay). <br /> <br /> Is there anything good to say? Sure. The colors are vibrant (they are the best thing about this film). And the directors certainly were trying very hard. Too bad that all this effort ended up in a film that is not much more than a bad video game.
