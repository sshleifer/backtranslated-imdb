This film is not as beautiful as I thought it would have been. There is no story, no character and some dialogue would have been nice. The effects of gore are good and sometimes it is quite bloody, but nothing exaggerated. Start with an autopsy on a man and when this is over the scene starts with the girl. Music is a classic soundtrack and fits the film very well. They should have created a 90-minute version in which they could have had some time for character development, so we can feel sorry for the person on the autopsy table. And some other information on mortals would have made this film much more frightening than it is. Don't expect a film of fear, but a nice reel of special effects.
