OMG, another bad film by Larry Buchanan. That boy didn't learn to stop, did he? First, it offers us zero-budget science fiction films and lies about famous people, and is now exploiting the Loch Ness monster as a vicious one. <br /> <br /> The "plot" basically concerns some of the South Americans who pretend to be Scottish on a camp at Loch Ness. Alas, out on the fishing hole, oops, I mean Loch Ness, there's an inflatable killer monster that sells to be Nessie, doing everything to kill people for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that the MST3K crew has never heard of this movie. Yes, it's also so bad.
