The film opens with Charlie (Jeff Daniels), a businessman who is finishing lunch in a neighborhood bar. Looks like he doesn't have enough money to cover the check. Instead of looking for his plastic, he furtively looks around to see if the coast is clear and leaves the place without paying. Unbeknownst to Charlie, "Lulu" (Melanie Griffith) was watching him from the other side of the deli. <br /> <br /> "Lulu" is decked out in what went into fashion in the 1980s with a light-cut blackberry page. She follows him to let him know that he saw what he did. He tries to deny it but he cannot escape his accusation. Thinking he's in it, Charlie is surprised when "Lulu" says he doesn't work for gastronomy and then offers him a ride to work. <br /> <br /> When it heads in the opposite direction, it begins their hopping through the Middle Atlantic Seaboard. <br /> <br /> We should be titillated as completely modern "Lulu" puts Charlie straight in humiliating situations. It's okay when the two consenting adults get a little extravagant in a motel room, but stand out when they squirm to pay the check in a family-style restaurant. Stealing work from hard working people is not my idea of ​​"savage". Charlie is a jerk. <br /> <br /> "Lulu" is an idiot idiot. She begins to pass Charlie as her husband. First to his mother (who cheerfully tolerates the charade) and then to his 10-year meeting in high school, properly programmed (an event used later by another film too good for his own "Grosse Pointe Blank"). <br /> <br /> The "marriage" is a surprise for "Lulu's" real husband (Ray Liotta) who has just recently been released from prison for armed robbery. Ray gives the two a welcome snack and shows them how bad the crime really is. <br /> <br /> I cannot add irony by writing that I looked at it for the first time by secretly entering the cinema. No, I don't do that kind of thing. I recorded it on cable TV and I assure you that I display it strictly in the privacy of my home. <br /> <br /> So I thought because I recorded it when I don't like it very much and I conclude that 20 years ago I was on a reggae football and the soundtrack of "Something Wild" has a predominant role in reggae. The credits begin with a gift from Sister Carol performing her version of "Wild Thing".
