I honestly thought this movie would be a mess, even though I really liked Alvin and the Chipmunks for a LONG PERIOD! I was very wrong. IT WAS FANTASTIC !!! It was the best film I've seen since October! In my opinion, it's the film that everyone should see this holiday season! Enchanted (I thought anyway ...) was terrible, The Golden Compass was fine, but the ending was pretty crappy for fans of His Dark Materials, and I Am Legend, well, I haven't seen it yet (or National Treasures 2) but it looks okay. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give anything away, but this movie is great for anyone, especially for kids!
