I can safely say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen and I usually love foreign films. The film is nothing but a poorly made violent pornography. If you choose to see it, prepare yourself for endless sexism, free shots for nudity and a stupid sensationalized rape scene, which I'm sure is the main attraction for people who like the film. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the plot runs aimlessly, and none of the characters is nice. Many scenes are shot from the woods surrounding the river, the girls are waiting to give the constant feeling that someone is haunting them, which was a pathetic attempt to compensate for the lack of stories to tell. <br /> <br /> Maybe I would not have wasted my time to see the film if it had been accurately described in the reviews.
