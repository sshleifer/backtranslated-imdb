I saw this film on videotape with my younger brother a long time ago, even though I was a kid who had a hearing problem. At the time I didn't have the decoder for subtitles (it was 1986, the year of The Transformers: The Movie), but I could follow the plot and understand what was happening. It wasn't my fault if I saw the animated film for girls. My father rented the video to show it to my other younger sister. <br /> <br /> A decade later and I rented the video (for 50 cents) to watch it again with closed captions turned on. My memories of this film have been completely destroyed by none other than a WRITTEN WRITING. I've seen a lot of badly written movies (like COOL AS ICE and JASON GOES HELL: THE FINAL FRIDAY), but I've never seen (or heard) the dialogues so badly, just flooding with enough madness to make my head spin with hysterical laughter and screaming in pain to endure the torture of sitting in this movie. Despite a good plot and intriguing concepts, the script must be ONE OF THE MOST ALWAYS WRITTEN FOR THE SCREEN, NO BARS! The incompetent Howard R. Cohen should never work as a scriptwriter, professional or other. I can't believe they would let the terrible script produce a film like this in the first place. Did the Japanese producers read the script, in English or poorly translated before knowing what they were in? Also sucks like G.I. Joe The Movie and My Little Pony The Movie have ransom values ​​compared to this abomination. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of 80s animation, or just take a nostalgic trip, SEE RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR THIEF! It doesn't matter if you have been ouphoric or traumatized by the shockingly animated movie with an atrociously written script, or you have not seen the film, YOU ARE AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE. The film should be displayed with the precaution to learn how NOT to write a bad script!
