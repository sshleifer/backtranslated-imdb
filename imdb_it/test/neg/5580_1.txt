Once in a while it's nice to see a really bad movie like this, just so you know how decent an actor Keanu Reeves is by comparison. The premise of this story is good: the teenagers go out on a boat, the meteoric lands in the water, the aliens kill the teenagers. What is there to love about this, if you like thrilling thrillers? But I should have known there was something when I read that it was only 75 minutes long. I thought "I hate judging movies for how long they are. Who says a movie has to last 90 minutes?" But once the DVD from BBuster was brought home, I was shocked by the awful quality of the production, the acting, the direction of this completely amateur piece of junk. The only reason I looked at it until the end is because I don't have cable TV, and I've already paid four dollars for it. However, there was a ray of light: the actor who played "Chris" is actually decent, and far exceeds this dreck. First of all, the special effects were cheap and unconvincing. Then the aliens - the costumes seemed interesting (rubber suits) but since most of the film takes place in the dark, you don't really see them! And almost none of the actors was convincing enough to suspend disbelief. Finally, I must say that the DVD jacket was made with much higher production standards than the film itself, which looked like a rip-off, so be careful when renting other DVDs. Save your $ 4 and buy a pint of beer.
