I watched this episode with high hopes after seeing it in the list of "Favorite episodes" of so many people. I'm not bragging in any way, but from the beginning I realized that they were in a sort of toy / tin box, with the huge eye looking down on them, at the kind of characters in there. Although during the episode, the questions of "Who are we?", "Where are we?", "What's out?" bring the suspense of the episode (which unfortunately I already understood), I must say that different types of characters and the interaction between them have made the episode quite interesting. Even if the turning point in history could have been more difficult to guess if EVERYONE were soldiers (toys).
