It's hard to imagine that anyone making a Tom Cruise movie looks good; really hard, but that makes it look good. Very good. In fact, it seems that Sir John Gielgud celebrates Very Good Acting Day with a clever performance. <br /> <br /> The acting of the whole group struggled to overcome the laughable and the failure. The blame was, in part, to be honest, that the plot was very similar to the original of HG Wells as well as the slaughtered carcasses of human victims in the film to their living predecessors: both were bloody and violated remains of a more attractive predecessor. But to describe a plot like this to be a bit holy means that the colander "My, this kitchen utensil has a considerable amount of holes", unless, to be honest, the holes are your bag; in which case this film will rely on you. <br /> <br /> The flaw in the other part was that these were demotivated, jobbing, DVD actors who knew very well, it is assumed, that this was their performance that would end up on the DVD shelf $ 5. And too expensive . <br /> <br /> So you should watch it? Because yes, of course, you should. You are a miserable sinner and you deserve punishment.
