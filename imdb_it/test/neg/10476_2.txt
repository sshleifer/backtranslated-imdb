John Knowles' modern masterpiece, A Separate Peace, is one of many subtle, and subtly is the watchword, the themes of love, hatred, jealousy, denial and regret. The 1972 version attempts to address this style and what the book is - A love story with the war looming in the background. <br /> <br /> The 2004 version does not use subtly, but clarity in the representation of history. What fixes you in the face when you read the novel - it's a love story, and yes maybe it's debatable, a gay love story. In the novel and in the 1972 film version there are sexual subtitles everywhere in the writings and dialogues. In the 2004 film version of Showtime these tensions were omitted and the actors were late there playing teenagers who caused mature acting by moving away from any tenderness or hesitation of youthful innocence. <br /> <br /> I didn't like this remake for more reasons. The hair that broke the back of the camels is that Phineas was given a surname on the letters he received from drawing boards! Finny is a character who has neither a surname nor a surname. John Knowles did it intentionally. <br /> <br /> Even if I accept the 1972 version, the acting was sometimes a bit amateurish, so he tried to be honest with the novel shooting in location at Phillips Exeter Academy that The Devon Acedemy was based on; which was also attended by the writer John Knowles. <br /> <br /> The directors and producers took all the Exeter students, with the exception of Parker Stevenson who attended Brooks School, to play in a Paramount movie! Class act by preppies with respect to this shot by the Canadian College, played by adult actors, politically correct, platonic version. No - The veto on this fiction tries again. The 1972 film version with John Heyl and Parker Stevenson was the real deal for A Separate Peace on the screen. The 2004 Showtime film made for the cable version was not.
