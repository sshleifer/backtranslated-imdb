Lance Henriksen has the ability to be the top name in a B series film, again with Charles Napier, Master Control Program and Joe Don Baker. As always it does a great job of being the bad guy, but the plot is simply bad (don't even get me started on the finale). And the assembly is so horrible that it could actually be a thing of beauty. Is it just me, or does it look like Joe Don Baker was in the film at the last minute? Moreover, whenever the glass is broken in this film, the editing is so anti-phenomenal. Finally, after seeing this, I imagine that David Warner is dying for Tron 2.0 to finally get the green light. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Felony, this will be the third film to which I give the score of 1/10, Iron Eagle IV and No Mercy.
