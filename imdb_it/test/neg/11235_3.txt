So when Bob and Marion Boxletter see a guy in a hotel, Marion thinks it's his long-lost brother Brian, but when he gets close to him, he seems to be someone else with just the same face. Marion manages to take her fingerprints and take her to the police and when the identity is confirmed that in reality it is her brother Brian she and Bob leave for New York after tracking down where he is. They get control of Brian, but he still doesn't know what they're talking about, but the whole couple really wants to know where Brian has the 8-year-old son Joey ... and even when they see Joey he doesn't even know them. The plot thickens. and they find themselves one day thinking of being someone else. The experiments done on people just to make the perfect killers, but the question of why they would take the trouble to put Bob and Marion in the same building is each other's outside of me. Personally Gregory Harrison played his 2 parts great, but I have no idea what was wrong with the other actors, they looked bored and lost. 3 out of 10, a bit of suspense, yes, but that's all.
