being a fan of Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney Jr I had to see this. that tripe the only good thing about this is the clips by Lugosi, Karloff and Chaney Jr.along with all the vintage clips, which don't gel with the new black and white movie. It is not even close to Steve Martin that the dead do not wear plaids, it was done great. With all the technology we have now why wasn't it done better? If you're going to shell out $ 5 and some change, know that this is really bad. but if you like Lugosi, Karloff and Chaney Jr, then watch their films. Even the wood and publisher did better than this. The new brand of the actor Redfield is rather good as an imitation of Bela Lugosi. The clips they use are; the monkey, Mr Wong, most dangerous game, lost world, indestructible man. and devil bat. this notorious Bela Lugosi classic. I believe this production has a very low budget, and shows 1 in 10.
