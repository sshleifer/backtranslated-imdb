I just don't understand these reviews! I can't help but think that they are written by the kind of LOG fans who love anything they do without wondering if it's actually good. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the program but I thought this film was a useless project. I could forgive the ridiculous plot if I left the cinema after laughing more than twice. At one point, I thought it might be just me before I realized that almost no laugh came from the rest of the audience. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much of a storyline (very few TV comedies last longer for over 90 minutes), but I thought a bit of LOG dialogues or classic visual jokes (like at the beginning of each program) they brought a movie. After 5 minutes of the 17th century plot, I was praying for it to end (I didn't know it would continue for the rest of the film). It just wasn't fun. <br /> <br /> I was simply disappointed and I can't see the story being too kind to him, although some diehard fans write rave reviews.
