From time to time I will remember that I actually saw this bizarre fiasco which is a cross between "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?", "Sunset Boulevard", Lana Turner's LSD movie "The Big Cube" and Manson's assassins which also took place in 1969, but perhaps before this so-called "film" was made! There are some descriptions of the plot already here, so I won't go into it. But it is worth noting that Miriam Hopkins plays a parody of herself: a screaming, ego-manic and dissolving actress. Maybe he thought he was making a movie that would have been as successful as one of Bette Davis's horrors. The old gal Hopkins never stopped working, so you have to give it to him. Show a little too much meat in this movie, something Davis and Crawford would never have done. And there's a scene with Miriam in the actual Hollywood Boulevard Christmas parade, which must have been filmed Christmas, 1968. <br /> <br /> Gale Sondergard is old, old, old. It's just as shocking as it looks wrinkled and horrible. John Garfield, Jr. looks a little like his father, but it's not that interesting. I think one of the Three Stooges is the tour guide at the beginning. If it's not one of the Stooges, it's someone. <br /> <br /> I was stunned to see this in the form of a commercial videotape given to me by a friend who knows all about garbage like this. Is fantastic!!!
