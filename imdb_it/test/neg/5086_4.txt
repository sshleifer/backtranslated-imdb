** Warning - this review may contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> The idea behind the character of Danny (Jet Li) is good: a kid is caught by a thug and raised to act like a ferocious pitbull , mainly controlled by the fact that the collar is placed above or outside the neck. <br /> <br /> However, the writer did not know how to deliver this idea within the limits of credibility. <br /> <br /> He has Danny meeting a blind pianist, Sam (Morgan Freeman), who must be the most confident fool who has ever been a man - along with his louse, interminable babbling, unattractive stepdaughter, Victoria (Kerry Condon). By the way, I was amazed when I learned that Victoria should have been 18 - she gave me 25 or 30 years. <br /> <br /> Incredibly there is no love affair between Danny and Victoria. <br /> <br /> When Danny finds himself, wounded, what Sam does, but take him straight home. Danny is out for 2 days, but do these lice take him to the hospital? Nooooo. I don't know if they even called a doctor. <br /> <br /> Now Danny is obviously not a mentally stable person, this is evident from the beginning, yet Sam takes him to his home, where both he and his stepdaughter could have been seriously injured or even killed by this rather strange young man. <br /> <br /> Because Morgan Freeman has taken on this insipid role in this asinine film that I can't even imagine. Surely Mr. Freeman is not so desperate for a salary. <br /> <br /> Then we have Bob Hoskins as Bart, the gangster who "owns" Danny - now you're talking about a son of a gun that's hard to kill. The car in which Bart is riddled with bullets would have rivaled the deaths of Bonnie and Clyde. We think he's dead, but no. <br /> <br /> Then we have another car accident - and once again old Bart escapes unharmed. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, we also have Danny fighting half a dozen tough guys at a time, plus a scene where Danny decided he didn't want to fight anymore. I don't care how much a person doesn't want to fight, when he's down the line of your fight or you die, I think someone would fight. <br /> <br /> As I said in the item topic - this film is about 40 miles outside the reality boundary as we have come to know. It is not just a case of suspending the belief - it is completely beyond. <br /> <br /> I also never understood why Danny's mother who turns out to be a good lady, rather than the prostitute that Bart claimed to be, became mixed with Bart and her gang and shot. Maybe it was my fault, I got distracted just when the scene started - but it seemed highly unlikely that she and Bart would ever meet. <br /> <br /> 4 stars out of 10 - and that's being generous.
