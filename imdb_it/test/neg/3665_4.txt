8 days without a script is what the DVD tells you how the film was made. It is shot in blurry videos that are sometimes used with good results, but are partially naked women who sit in a room most of the time. He is very well acted and this helps a lot. But the killer only appears once for a long time and the girls / women sit and cheat, don't try to escape or do something too interesting, so it stops until it stops after about 20 minutes. It would have been a nice short, maybe even a powerful one. Even for eight days they do very little. Why? Because they didn't have a script. How many movies have been made without scripts. Not too many. I wonder why this is so? How many great films have been made from bad scripts. Not too many. Why? Working against this important problem, the management tries and does some interesting things but with what is essentially nothing. Topless girls shot with colorless dark grainy videos that are around will keep some time, but not for the short but too long feature film. The actors deserve praise again, if only there was a script. <br /> <br /> Even the quality of the video, or its lack, is really low-end, they try to use it to their advantage and, sometimes, some shots seem to come from Miami Vice, which is the recent film. But this is not intended to compliment Miami Vice or this failed undertaking.
