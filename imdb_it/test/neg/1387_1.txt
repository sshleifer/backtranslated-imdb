Did you find the funny title? Oh, didn't you? Well, that's because you're tense. Learn to laugh because if you're not laughing, you're not living. So please lower your standards on what you think is fun for a simple infant. Now do you find it funny? Not yet ?! OK, it's because you're full of yourself and offend yourself too easily. If you're not laughing, you're not living. And if you don't like me, then send me the hate mail so I can write another review and say how much hate mail I get and try to distort it to make it look like I'm a bad ass. Are you still laughing at my hilarious title? Not yet?!?! OK that's it! You are a racist! You have to laugh or you are a racist. Why else wouldn't you laugh? Oh, it's not funny!?! No, this cannot be why. I want it to be fun, so it's !! Laugh damn !!!! Please!!! Deedeedee !! Durdurdur !! Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OK that's it. Where is my notepad and pen? And where is my Richard Pryor DVD? I need to write a few lines for my show. <br /> <br /> And ...... scene. Thank you thank you. <br /> <br /> This is pretty much what you'll get from Mencia for about 23 minutes. Please do yourself a favor and change channels when this bum show comes on. Even basic cable channels have better things than 100 times. I'm not even saying why I hate him. I'm really This show is like watching the grass grow. I'm not sure though, at least the grass doesn't steal jokes. I'm honestly trying to save your time. I also tried watching his show. I said to myself "maybe it's not so bad". But no, it is. I completely turned away when I saw his show. I tried to recover during the commercial break and concentrate on the show but I couldn't. I walked away again, I think I was thinking of something more interesting like redoing my bed, vacuuming or bending my stockings. Before I knew it, the show was over. Yes, it's so ugly. <br /> <br /> Here's my final thought - There are so many things you can do with 30 minutes besides watching this guy scream for nothing for half an hour. Don't look at a show that tries to push racism in vain. I can support shows that try to alleviate the tension of race wars, but this guy provides more racism than stop it.
