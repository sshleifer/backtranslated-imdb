I saw this movie at the 2005 Edinburgh International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This movie was compared in the EIFF program to Sideways - which I liked - so I couldn't wait to see this movie. I also liked Garden State, Napoleon Dynamite, etc ... so I had recent positive experiences with slightly weird American movies. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I found that Puffy Chair does not hold up to any of these films. <br /> <br /> I was sitting for 35 minutes waiting for something funny, witty, insightful or even slightly interesting. It wasn't like that - and the flickering camera was making me sick - so I left. <br /> <br /> This is just the second movie I came out of (the first was "Showgirls") which is slightly disappointing. Probably I could have lasted if it wasn't for the nauseating effects of the wobbly photo - but nothing in the first 35 minutes gave me the impression that I would miss something. <br /> <br /> Disappointing.
