The time I lost seeing this movie, I demand back! I felt bad afterwards, but not because it touched me in any way. It's pretentious, it tries to make the public feel bad for the people involved, but I can't care less. The characters are soulless and stupid. You don't get an explanation for some of the scenes and leave no thoughts after giving your explanation. All the students in the film have problems, but since you don't feel for them you don't believe their problems. <br /> <br /> If I could write better in English I would never stop. But I cannot, therefore, stop now. <br /> <br /> Don't look at this.
