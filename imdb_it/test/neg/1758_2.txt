His embalmed appearance was totally inappropriate for the role. His face remained too white, his hair too combed, his clothes etc. Too clean (and well adapted, especially the old hat and his father's coat in the scene where Inman comes home) for any sense of accuracy. It would be one thing if the production had allowed all the other actors to stay clean and perfect, but she was the only one who didn't get messy. There was not even a stain on his powdered cheek. Should we believe she was the only person in the Civil War with a bathtub and a mirror? Surely it seemed the only one that used them. Also tweezers; I mean, what's with those eyebrows? It looked absolutely bad! <br /> <br /> The love story was not plausible. She only went to the boy because someone told her he said he thought she was pretty. So, go tease him, then flirt with him a couple of times, and suddenly this is an equal love with Ulysses and Penelope? Please. <br /> <br /> I should have known better than expecting something better from the man who brought us "The English Patient". My reaction to that was the same as Elaine's on Seinfeld: "He sucked."
