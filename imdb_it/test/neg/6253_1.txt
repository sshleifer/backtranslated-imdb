I saw it on the rental shelves and rented everything else, so I said why not. Why not it's because it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It looks like it was shot with the home video camera. I imagine all that the budget would allow. There were fewer tits in it than I thought. Some people came out to be soft porn with some kills. The most fun part of the whole movie for me is in the extra stuff. There is a place with deleted scenes. Well, there's only one, but he's the most stupid and I think he could have brought the rest of the film. The girls walk into a hot tub and find chocolate syrup in the bathroom. Yes, it all ends up for them. Big things !!! This film is very bad. Do not worry
