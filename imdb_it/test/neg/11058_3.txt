In another case of misleading marketing, this film is included on a 10-film DVD called "Women Who Kick Butt", but even in its original cover it seems to promise Shannon Tweed in an action role. Actually, during most of the film, Tweed plays the typical whining and sensual female character that must be saved by the male protagonist, and even when trained for jungle warfare he has yet to be dragged by him! There is a female rebel who is a stronger character, but is mostly kept on the edge of the film. The male protagonist is Reb Brown, and he has some (unintentionally, I think) funny moments (like when he is electrocuted). The action scenes are misguided and poorly performed: some of the stuntmen needed some lessons on "how to get shot and die convincingly". I suppose if you're in the right mood you can find some things in "Firing Line" to laugh (at some point, we can hear Tweed talking but his lips don't move!), But mostly I was just bored. (*)
