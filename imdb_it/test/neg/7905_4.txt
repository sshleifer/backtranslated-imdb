This film was not too funny. It wasn't even too horrible. Just a fun ride on board the Soul Plane. It's a flight service owned by the black with a discotheque to throw away, a nice bar and pumping stewards. The plot takes you through the whole idea of ​​a black plane (not of race or color, but of "style") with the same style of black humor. Sometimes, there are some great rare scenes like when the main character uses the "normal" sink in the "normal" plane. Check it. There are moments of calm, however, and I find it more in the character who played the Soul Pilot. Watch to find out who he is. All in all, it's a fun movie. Tom Arnold adds to the fun with his 'cracker' attitude. This is a movie to watch when you play poker, when you're drunk, or just vegging.
