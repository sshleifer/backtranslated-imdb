If you can get over the slow start and bad acting it's worth watching. The plot was pretty decent. The father had an evil temper because he was unemployed and could not see his son except in the summer because his ex-wife had custody of him. The father was very angry and frustrated most of the time. The monster in the story wasn't too scary. The film breaks the consistency of the monster which is so incredibly strong. The only scene where filmmakers do this is one of the times when the boy is down in the basement and the monster goes to attack him. When the monster goes to attack the child, his arm is captured by a steel trap attached to a chain. The monster is about a foot away from the baby's face. Whenever in the movie the monster is strong enough to break through or knock down anything. Yet the steel trap and the chain keep him from taking the child! More than likely the filmmakers did this for shock factor because nobody wants to see one of the main characters die. The moviemakers just wanted to scare us into thinking that it could be a possibility that the child could die. Instead of breaking the coherence, the filmmakers would have had to replace the child with someone they could have!
