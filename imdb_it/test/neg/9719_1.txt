OK ... before starting the more or less constructive criticism of the film I'd like to say a few words that come from the heart ... THIS FILM HAPPENS !!!! DON'T GO TO SEE IT UNLESS YOU REALLY WANT THE BEST CHILD GIRLS AND THE RELATED NO-PLOT STORIES. So, let's go to why I think the movie is so bad: 1. There is no plot. There is no plot. The director tried to create a mystery, but the feeling wasn't right there. 2. The whole thing seems like a great promotion of an hour and a half for a kind of "gobb-be-be-but-still-similar-to-" BSB "-band ... All boys at school have abs perfect, no fat or ugly young ... there is not even a beautiful girl in the film, not even one. The main character is bathed in the pool, or all sweaty in his bed ... poor boy ... It must be terrible to go to a date sweating like this? 3. These guys can do something good with their powers? Something good? How to put out the fire in that old barn or help his friend who had the accident instead of rushing to break things and show up facing each other 4. Wood action The main character has only two expressions on his face Expression number one: sad Expression number two: try to look seductive but still looks sad ... In that boy band there are 4 types: the main character, his best friend who had the accident, the blondie or is the fourth ... what was the name of the fourth? I think he only spoke twice during the whole movie: once at the beginning (he said jumping off the cliff using "power" won't kill them) and the second time at the end when he and the blonde lost the girl ... the film could have been made without him and nobody would have noticed ... However, my verdict: 1 is the perfect score for this film. Guys, don't go see it. There's very little action, no suspense, no sexy girls. Girls - at least the actors are good-looking ... What I would advise people is to get a soundtreck of this movie - that's the only thing I liked.
