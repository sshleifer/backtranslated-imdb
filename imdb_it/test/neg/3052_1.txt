The worst movie I've ever seen! 90 minutes of excruciating film. All the ingredients to make this film a real CRAP job. Bad acting, bad direction, bad narration, bad makeup, bad dialogues, bad effects and bad reasoning behind certain actions performed by the characters. He also threw a terrible naked shot of a stupid blonde, and a blow to the breast of a stupid Asian girl, and both attempts were just scary, since these girls are ugly. Some good horror movies came out in the 1980s, but this could never be considered one of them. Kevin Tenney also committed one of the greatest sins in the narrative: he introduced characters at the end of the film (an old man and an old woman). I would vote for it under a 1 in 10 but the voting system does not work that way apparently. Since the title sequence I knew it would suck and I would return my DVD, but Best Buy doesn't return DVDs or consumer products as they call it, or so says my receipt. I have "The Dunwich Horror" and this was really terrible, but I still feel that "Night of the Demons" (an obvious Evil Dead RIP-OFF) was much worse than "Dunwich Horror". This is just like "The Howling", how on earth could the sequels be milked by this anorexic cow ??? Save your money and get the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (just to get none of its sequels) or "The Evil Dead" or "Dawn of the Dead". "Night of the Demons" is a very, very, very bad investment. Every moment was just an exasperating pain for the public, because the whole film was horrible! Do yourself a favor, DON'T SEE IT! You're saving some brain cells.
