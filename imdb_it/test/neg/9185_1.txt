John Candy really was a successful comedian. His death was a tragedy and we miss him a lot, but WAGONS EAST, in which he plays a tramp who agrees to take a group of pioneers from the wild west, is even sadder. I don't understand why he was released. The plot is useless and weak, and the lines are not there. It saddens me even more that Candy's latest film is her worst film of all time. So let's forget all about this and remember it in his best films like SUMMER RENTAL, PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES and UNCLE BUCK. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 5
