Years ago, when DARLING LILI was playing on TV, it was always the pan and scan version, which I hated and decided to wait and watch the movie in its correct widescreen format. So when I saw a cheap DVD of this Julie Andrews / Blake Edwards opus, I decided to buy it and watch it once and for all. <br /> <br /> Boy, what a terrible movie. It's so ugly and on so many levels that I really don't know where to begin to describe where and when it's so terribly wrong. Looking at it now, it is obvious to all fans of the films that Blake Edwards created this stellar vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors played gold with Andrews in musicals (MARY POPPINS, SOUND OF MUSIC, MILLIE VERY MODERN, etc.). ) But also because Andrews has been snubbed by participating in projects made famous on stage by Julie herself (CAMELOT, MY FAIR LADY, etc.) because Hollywood thought she wasn't sexy or charming enough. So Blake created this effort to show his wife in a bizarre spy story / war movie / romance / slapstick comedy / musical. DARLING LILI suffers from multiple personalities, never knowing who or what it is. Some specific scenes are good or effective but, on the whole, it does not work at all so much that it is very embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Attention, the DVD version is "the director's cut" "or, in this case," we recover all we can "from this infamous box office flop. In publishing the DVD, Edwards portrays 19 scenes (19 !!!!!!!!) from the original theatrical version inflated in this slimmer and yet remarkably ineffective version. The film moves without any idea what it is. We have 25 minutes and we still don't know what's going on or why "We're looking at what's going on. What kind of spy is Lili? How powerful is she? Have you ever been responsible for someone's death? Instead, let's look at Rock Hudson, thoroughly bored, who tries to woo Julie Andrews with a bored expression. Things They are not helped much by the inexplicable reason they fall in love. Why is Julie falling in love with Hudson? Why he and not other men she was involved with? There had to be one of his exes around, trying to win her back or trying to decipher her. his secret o This would have given us a much needed contrast to the confused action. He would also have given us a little impetus in the slow process. There is no catalyst in this story. <br /> <br /> Just look at the cut scenes to see clearly that Edwards and the writer have just had ideas inspired by the previous successes of Andrews (and Edwards). The best (or worst) example is the scene where Andrews and Hudson follow a group of children singing in the middle of a forest. Edwards channeling SOUND OF MUSIC. No wonder he removed it from the DVD. In 1970, that scene could have worked at a certain level but today, at that moment, it smells like despair. There are other elements of the plot directly inspired by other Andrews / Edwards films. The endless scenes of dog fighting are inspired by the much better MODERN MOLINO. The musical moment "I'll give you three hypotheses" was created just to make fun of the character of Mary's POPPINS of Julie, who becomes "vulgar" with Julie doing a striptease red-handed. The ending, the bird's-eye view of Julie running towards Hudson's plane, is another "wink" to SOUND OF MUSIC. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is confusing. Julie plays a singer, born of a German father and an English mother, who lives in England but sings her songs (English) in Paris. You never know exactly where the story takes place. Some moments are badly modified. Like when Julie and her "uncle" are on horseback. They talk and talk and then Julie suddenly runs off in mid-sentence. I'm like "what happened here?" <br /> <br /> The comedy numbers are not fun and worthwhile. Every scene with the French police is pathetic. Where is Peter Sellers when you really need him. Action is stupid beyond imagination. When Julie and her "uncle" are on their way to Germany on that train, Hudson's squadron shoots bullets at the train, almost killing Lili in the process. Brilliant. The funny thing about this scene is that the two leave the train in the middle of the night, but Hudson and his squadron reach the train even if they fly off the next morning. That's a slow train moving there. <br /> <br /> Musical moments. The beginning is the best part of the whole film (and the reason why I gave this film 3 stars), but its effect is considerably diminished because it is repeated at the end. Speaking of redundancy, we really needed to see a can-can dance, Crepe Suzette's stripping scene and even Julie getting naked? The "Girl in No Man's Land" is fine even if it's obvious, but that moment just doesn't make any sense because Lili sings it to a group of wounded soldiers in a French hospital, asking me how many soldiers there are have been indirectly injured by the result of his espionage? <br /> <br /> The whole project is listless and without energy. Romance is 100% incredible. Rock Hudson is too old and tired (look at the museum scene). Julie looks dazed, like she's on Valium. But what really kills this ill-conceived project is Julie who plays a German spy. Edwards desperately wanted to dispel the Mary Poppins syndrome by grieving his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good professional decision. As much as I like Julie, it's not Greta Garbo, who has made her so well in MATA HARI. Funny enough, even though Julie plays a German spy, she still finds him sickly and pretty. <br /> <br /> How serious is DARLING LILI? Even 37 years after its release, Blake Edwards felt that he still needed to work on his DVD version.
