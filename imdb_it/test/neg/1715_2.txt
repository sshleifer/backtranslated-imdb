I really liked Tycus, if not for much more than mocking production values. Dennis Hopper was fine, although I wonder if he would sign the project if he saw the special effects they were using. And besides, what was the scene with the ninja? It was completely out of step. Perhaps someone had the brilliant idea in the middle of the shoot. Oh well, this movie is great if you're drunk and you need a good laugh. Greetings.
