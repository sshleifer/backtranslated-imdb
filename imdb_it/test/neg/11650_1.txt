I'm sorry, but this really looks like a modern-day Apollo 13 knock-off. Totally unlikely (at least Armageddon FELT as a comic book! It looked like a bad High School film project), acting was a cliché how can you get, and ... land a space shuttle on a Los Angeles freeway? Come on. Seriously. Jerry, what were you thinking? And all the clichés: the wife of the pregnant astronaut, the nosy journalist who gets in the middle of everyone, the brave manager with "Go Fever". And it is something to twist the laws of physics or politics or anything else to make a funny story, but at least make it GOOD! Fact and science have been completely slaughtered for this. The spaceship has no fuel tanks in its wings, and even if it did, it could not steer by moving the fuel between them (and not even a DC-10). <br /> <br /> If you like bad acting, bad storytelling, low realism and poor clichés, this can't be beat!
