First of all, I'm shocked that there is no choice of a "0" on 10. <br /> <br /> I got bored tonight, and while I browse through the channels, I see Dr. Chopper. Since there is nothing else, I decide to watch it, expecting it to be just another lousy horror movie, with a similar plot to Cabin Fever. <br /> <br /> Man I was wrong ... Dr. Chopper made it look like Cabin Fever should have won numerous Academy Awards. I can remind you that Cabin Fever contains a scene of a hick kid kicking from a porch that screams, "pancakes !!", characters that let their dying friend die in a small shed to die bleed, and Shawn from Boy Meets World is wrong to touch a hole in a girl's thigh. <br /> <br /> So, needless to say, Dr. Chopper was a big pile of stinky smelly. It wasn't even funny crap. It reminded me of a horror film I had to do in eighth grade, called "The Campout". Except for the fact that "The Campout" had a better script (we wrote it about an hour before shooting), better actors, plots, bloody scenes and photographic works. I was hoping to get laughs from a badly done horror movie, but instead I could look at it in amazement as I thought to myself, "Was this done since the 8th grade?". <br /> <br /> The acting was horrible, the events and the different subplots were put together and made no sense, and the blood and violence were very minimal. I liked how from a small gunshot wound, people died instantly, and the only weapons the killers had were small pocket knives ... if you're going to make a horror movie, at least give the killers a crazy device murder. <br /> <br /> Besides, what the hell was the point of the girls in the sisterhood who were uninterested in their promises? A good way to introduce some scenes of girls running in their bras, even if they have no relevance to the story. And I must say that my favorite line was when the blonde tells Dr. Chopper, "I'd like to introduce you to someone ... my inner bitch." His "inner bitch" then proceeds to grab a garbage can, throw it at Dr. Chopper, miss, and go back in the terror of the murderer. <br /> <br /> Wheww .... well that was long, but I felt that I had to express my feelings about how absolutely horrible this "movie" was. I know everyone has their opinions, but if someone considers this film to be higher than a 2, they should be shot in hell ... <br /> <br /> ... seriously.
