I heard about this movie for the first time when Patton Oswalt talked about it on his cd "Werewolves and Lollipops". He said it was a lost classic that is completely ridiculous. Being a terrible movie lover, I knew I had a surprise. <br /> <br /> This film is, without a doubt, one of the strangest I've ever seen. Definitely one of the strangest shlock movies. Basically, a demon took human form years ago for a woman, the woman died or something, the demon cried blood, blood fell on the bed, the bed is now possessed and now eats. Along with fruit, flowers and chicken, it also has a taste for people. People can vary between horny teenagers, mayors, gangsters, servants or professional orgy. There is also a sick boy who has eaten the bed but who has put his soul behind an image in the room. <br /> <br /> Most films allow you to understand the plot through an exciting action. Death Bed takes a different path: basically it tells you through the narration exactly what is happening while scenes of slow and trivial murders take place. Furthermore, I must say that all those who are eaten near the bed are surprisingly silent. I would think that if a bed is eating you through the streets of a fair 5th grade scientific experiment, it would sting a little. I imagine that the nerve endings were not invented until 1981. <br /> <br /> The plot is extravagant, the direction is slow and rather horrible, the sets are scarce, the acting is quite painful and the brother is one of those the unintentionally ugliest actors I've ever seen. It would probably make a great party movie if alcohol and crafty are involved. Certainly one not to be missed.
