The social responsibility of Warner Brothers in its most direct way, with sermonization about every five minutes of how we are Americans, we do not run from trouble, we face our responsibilities. It also suggests that if you are willing to perjure yourself to protect your family from clearly deadly gangsters, you are a non-American. Walter Huston, bored, is the frustrated district attorney, and the "average American family" includes familiar faces like Sally Blane (who looks a lot like his sister, Loretta Young) and Dickie Moore, as an allegedly adorable mushroom. Both are regularly crowded outside the frame by Chic Sale, only 47 years old, but they play an octogenarian civil war veteran, who jumps heavily and "amused" joking about prohibition and moralizing about the way we are Americans, dag nabbit. His performance as an old witch of St. Vitus Dance is an annoying crap; it's as if Walter Brennan had based his whole career on it. William Wellman runs efficiently and quickly, just like his previous "public enemy", but he and the writer neglect to show what happens to this family after the happy disappearance - that is, they would probably have been canceled by the mob.
