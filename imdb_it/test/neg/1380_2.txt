I'm a big fan of comedy. Racial humor is always a bit risky but greats like George Lopez, Dave Chapelle, Lisa Lampanelli etc. They do it perfectly. <br /> <br /> Don't exaggerate, make the audience uncomfortable or * cough for cough * JOKES STEAL! But I don't want to insist on this. <br /> <br /> Carlos makes racial humor completely undeniable. His jokes are constantly shouting racial humor to the point that he is not funny or intelligent, but he is offensive. I am not one of which I become cold towards racial humor. But his execution of these jokes is sloppy which causes people to withdraw into his comedy. <br /> <br /> His humor is surpassed only by his stage presence in irritation. I feel like I'm constantly looking at him! And he runs on stage like a maniac. It's just annoying!
