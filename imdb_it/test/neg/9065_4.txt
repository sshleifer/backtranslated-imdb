OK, that's about 30 minutes of blood with no story. There is no spoken dialogue, no subtitle, not even real characters. You see three people in the whole movie (who are alive) and two are there for very few reasons. The main boy has no emotions and merely mutilates the corpses for no apparent reason. This is the whole movie. I like to see very gory movies, especially because in America the real gore is not very common in modern movies. So yes, the effects of the gore were really fantastic. But it's not really disturbing. Why does everyone think it's so disturbing? There are no characters, there are only 3 living people and 3 corpses. No one has a personality or a story. You see three corpses torn apart and you can't really identify yourself unless you identify yourself only with death itself and how this can happen very well (even though the boy lost his job and went to jail shortly after). the viewer must take care and take care of identifying with the victim. For example in a good horror movie you should really worry about the main character. Here is just a boy and a corpse. It is as deep as a puddle made with a single drop of rain. They never give you cause to worry about anyone in the movie. Everything is a guy who breaks up some bodies, then he has sex with a body. Now with the sex scene here is a strange thing, make sure you wear gloves but don't use condoms. So he doesn't care about taking some strange MST from having sex with a corpse, but as long as his hands don't get messy, there's no problem, now it's logical. I don't really like the film, I liked it that it was very gory, but when it ends there is no reason to watch it again, there's no reason to worry about it, and it's not a very compelling film. I say that if you can find it for less than $ 10 then you might get it, but if it's more than that, it's not worth it.
