* This comment could technically contain "spoiler" but surely does not contain surprises * <br /> <br /> My cousin and I rented it the other day hoping to get a good laugh at a typical crap excuse of a horror film. Unfortunately we didn't have too many laughs and we certainly didn't have too much fear. <br /> <br /> Storyline: A plane that contains the daughter of a company and some strange piece of technology hangs in an area where our furry friend lives, so the head of the company brings together a personality team , rather than skilled hunters, to recover it. <br /> <br /> For the first 3/4 of the film, things get pretty boring. It consists mainly of Big Foot shots that nestle in the trees with party members who occasionally hear it and pass it off as nothing. We also see several shots of the party through the Big Foot point of view, and he apparently sees thermal vision. <br /> <br /> To set the plot, we must look at the sequences of the group sitting around the fire that talks about the possibilities of justifying the existence and actions of the sasquatches. "maybe he can dodge bullets ... if he sees them coming". Sure enough, after we see that it can. "There are many unexplored lands where the sasquatch can live. Perhaps this is one of those that was overwhelmed." And of course it is. "Perhaps the Sasquatch is angry because the plane hit one of his family." And sure enough, this is the case. Along with those scenes, there are a couple of "Oh my God is the sasquatch oh just wait for you!" scenes, and unfortunately they are among the most frightening. <br /> <br /> So, finally, people start dying. Well, at least 2 people. In addition, the bodies of past victims are discovered. The scenes of death are rather lame. Mostly it simply leaves our imagination showing the Sasquatch that grabs them, then cutting on a different scene, but first, we're treated with some horrible screams out of the camera. <br /> <br /> So, finally, we come to watch the protagonist's final showdown with the monster. I have to admit, I found it quite exciting while it lasted. But alas, it is quite short, and afterwards we were treated to an ending that makes an half-charlatan effort to look cryptic. Then, some closing texts with a rather boring conclusion. <br /> <br /> I can't say I recommend this movie. It's not bad enough to give the Mystery Science Theater 3000, and it's definitely not scary and boring enough to enjoy like a horror movie. Do not worry about it.
