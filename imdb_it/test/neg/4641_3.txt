This film was terrible ... How can anyone think that this movie was like the "good old days" when Tim Thomerson wasn't even involved. And to make matters worse, they used clips of old trance movies. This is simply terrible. NO trance movie is complete without Tim Thomerson. I love Fullmoon movies and I've watched them since I was 4 years old. I did everything they did and this movie almost made me lose. Now I have a couple of lines to fill so I'll keep going. Their way of raising new trancers is completely stupid and also the way to send Jack back in time. What happened to the TCL camera. And finally! What happened at the end of trancers 5 where he says lina and I quote "Jack gave me something special" And she and some other broad look on her stomach. I don't know ... maybe a CHILD is in there. There were so many other places to go, but Fullmoon S'd the bed
