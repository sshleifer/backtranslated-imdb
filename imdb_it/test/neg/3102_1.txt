I saw this movie a while ago, because some of my friends wanted to rent it, and I voted down ... I tried the best I could to get the story, because some movies had said that this would be a movie that it would have been for Rob Lowe, that Pulp Fiction had been for John Travolta ... Well, we can all see that he not only failed but fell with his head down. This is actually the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad movies .. it's not even worth watching them for free on TV.
