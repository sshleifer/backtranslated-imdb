This film supports self-justice! It guarantees freedom to a black man who killed the men who raped his daughter and eventually gets scat-free! As despicable as it could be, there is also adultery in this film. The character of Connaughey has the appearance of the character of Bullock and the film has some of those stereotypes of test films (like the important news brought to court at the right time) that make every viewer as aesthetically demanding as sick! I really can't believe anyone liked this stuff. It is such a bad film that it supports false ideals that I cannot put my critic in an eloquently pleasant way. When the American people wake up and discover that they are being manipulated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by films like these, which turn reality into a bomb where there is justice for everyone if they only take it into their own hands. This cowboy attitude makes me sick and in my eyes represents all that is wrong in America!
