Let me start by saying that 1 out of 10 is too good for this movie. It is unfortunate that IMDb does not have tenths of a star ... I saw this abortion of a film in the middle of the night because of insomnia, and it was a real garbage. The plot was horrible. The acting was horrible. The film was absolutely boring. "Malachi" looked like the Shadow of Alec Baldwin (Shadow is infinitely better than that) Eve's character was so underdeveloped and two-dimensional that it didn't even catch my attention. I didn't even know his name was Eve. Don was interesting when he kept his mouth shut. The "TWIST" (if you can call it that) was ridiculous and pathetic. When it arrived, the film had done such a horrible work of building suspense or attachment to any character that I simply thought "Who gives an S ***". The only thing that made me raise an eyebrow on this film was the med. teacher was Dyson in Terminator 2 (Also a film that was light years ahead of this film massacre.) Anyone involved in this film should be ashamed of himself for wasting 90 minutes of countless people time. No wonder no actor in this film has ever had a successful career. In summary ... This film is so ugly, I feel dirty and I need a shower. The worst movie in history, Gigli was better, Prom Night (the remake) was better and I would say that Saw IV was better ...........
