My, my, my: Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance desperately needed to work to lend their talents to this turkey. A horribly confused story about Satanism in modern Greece, Land Of The Minotaur (aka The Devil's Men) is a bonfire on more or less every level imaginable. He has very few fears (always a small flaw for a "horror" film, don't you think?); weak performance; innumerable scenes in which the characters go madly alone or refuse the opportunity to remain in the safety of a group; and some rather irritating editing techniques that add nothing to the process. I was prematurely excited by the idea that Cushing and Pleasance worked together 17 years after The Flesh And The Fiends - but this film is not worth extolling remotely; it's a huge disappointment and rather an embarrassment to his most serious clues. <br /> <br /> In a remote region of Greece, strangers like tourists and archaeologists continue to disappear, and local priest Father Roche (Donald Pleasance) suspects that something sinister is taking place. He writes to his friend, the New York private eye Milo Kaye (Costas Skouras), asking him to fly to Greece to help him get to the bottom of the mystery. Meanwhile, three other visitors - Beth (Vanna Reville), Ian (Nikos Verlekis) and Tom (Robert Behling), who are all personal friends of Father Roche - disappear while they try to poke around nearby Greek ruins. Milo eventually arrives in Greece, but initially doubts Father Roche's convictions that missing persons have been kidnapped for satanic sacrifices. Laurie (Luan Peters), the missing man's fianc√©e Tom, also joins Milo and Father Roche. Together, they discover the activities of a Minoan cult of the devil cult guided by the gruesome exile of the Carpathian Baron Corofax (Peter Cushing). These mad cultists sacrificed their victims to a statue of the minotaur. Furthermore, apparently they cannot be killed by normal means, so Father Roche must use a variety of religious artifacts in his fight against them. <br /> <br /> Land Of The Minotaur should have been much better than it actually is. The plot is so extravagant and unlikely that it has all the hallmarks of a favorite cult / field. But the treatment is simply horrible. The director Costas Carayiannis has no idea how to link the narrative together in a cohesive way, so the whole story progresses as if it were built day by day. He also has no idea how to convince his cast's convincing performances, so they are left to embarrass themselves in terribly amateur (Pleasance, Cushing) or terribly amateur (Skouras, Peters) shows. What's worse is that storytelling makes no sense. Why should Father Roche seek help from a private eye that is absolutely irreverent about his convictions? How does Roche know that sacrifices occur only during the full moon? How can the minotaur statue speak? Why is one of the sacrificial victims being instructed during a vision to stab Father Roche, but only for herself is a few scenes stabbed later before having the chance to perform it? And - the most baffling of all - why does Father Roche drag Milo into the world to help him when all he needs is a crucifix and some holy water to dispose of the bad guys? These questions - and not only - will come to mind during Land Of The Minotaur .... but, unfortunately, there are no answers. Frustrating, stupid and disappointing!
