I imagine today rewarding the idiocy because whoever invented the concept of this film was not filmed on sight. <br /> <br /> This is a treat for the morons. The worst stereos of all the ghettos and films of high schools are dragged around and made even more unbearable. Every character in this film has a hiccup story beyond sympathy. We pray for a remake in which the whole school is enchanted. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** How does such a run-down school have Internet in the first place?
