The executive producer of the film is none other than that messenger of peace through transcendental meditation, David Lynch, the director's father. I wonder which of David's gurus, His Holiness Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, would have thought of this production. The hypocrisy here is as repugnant as the film itself is. It's a sure bet that Samuel L. Dieteman, Phoenix's serial killer and recreational violence enthusiast, would love every minute of it. <br /> <br /> I doubt that many would have criticized this film for its film art; at that level it's pretty good. But on a moral level, it's the most bleak movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> SPOILER COMING <br /> <br /> I think it's the falsity of the thing that saddens me the most. Moral-mindless Generation The Xers learn a trade and a small postmodern aesthetic theory at art school or film school and then engage in the arts and entertainment industry; and here is the result: a film that wallows in human suffering, injustice and carnage, many of which are witnessed by a nine-year-old who sees his entire family brutally killed by a couple of recreational violence killers who fine, they ride towards the sunset. <br /> <br /> NO OTHER SPOILERS THAT COME <br /> <br /> Who are films like this for? Obviously, sadists will love this - why shouldn't they? But who else? As I noted above, there's a good movie here, but a good technique can be applied to any topic. Why apply it to such things? Moreover, the film is very full of suspense, but not because of the graphics and the coarseness of the violence; it is full of suspense because it is well directed and well acted. I'm sure Alfred Hitchcock's ghost could explain this better than me. <br /> <br /> So what was offered here? And above all, why? <br /> <br /> Yes, our world can be an ugly, dirty, even evil place, but should we not disagree when an "artist" does his duty to massage our faces? Or worse, to catch him in the faces of those nine-year-olds who, one way or another, will end up seeing him on the home DVD? <br /> <br /> I hope people will make sure that this movie is not seen by their children. Yes, I know - honor, bernon ...
