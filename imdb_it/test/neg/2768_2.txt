I couldn't get my head or tail off this terrible film noir. <br /> <br /> The plot was confusing, the acting was fine, but the image quality was terrible! Even if I bought it in a "Gansters Double Pack" (8 films on two discs) on WalMart for $ 5.50 and when you insert the DVD, it apologizes for the horrible quality of the image that some of the films might have. <br /> <br /> The plot was turned upside down wherever I could not understand it and I had no idea what was going on ... then "The End" appeared and the movie was finished. <br /> <br /> What a waste of my time! <br /> <br /> I say you don't waste your money or time on this! Or if you also bought that Gansters Double Pack, jump on this ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
