The word "boring" is thrown too often when referring to the exact way a low budget horror movie might or might not be. I've seen a lot of B-movies. Many B films horrible and terribly inept. Some with a production value of a few hundred dollars. Ineptitude, bad acting, worse continuity and embarrassing budgets really make a movie unwatchable? Some would have no doubt the way it is. Many of which are probably big fans of The Matrix. Well, I hate high-budget movies, so I say no. The bad can sometimes be fun (Blood Freak), sometimes even amazing (Troll 2), but Boring will always be unwatchable ... Hey, like Bloodstirsty Butchers, who reminds me, I'm writing a review for this pile of garbage ... Uh, yes, anyway. This is one of the many alternatives of the late British Andy Milligan to sleeping pills. This is based on Sweeney Todd ... Great. Milligan takes a boring story, and still manages to "slaughter" her. Hey, it's very funny, I said good ... sorry, I keep getting distracted. This is not exactly easy. Come to think of it, I'll make it easier. No blood, no fear, no entertainment, only unlikely and boring people who have inconsistent conversations. this is Bloodstirsty Butchers. Oh yes, and something about a barber who kills people, and something or other about meat pies. I don't know, it's not important. <br /> <br /> For something a little more rewarding than Andy Milligan, there's always the only other one I've seen, The Rats Are Coming, The Werewolves Are Here. Yes, you heard me. But as for us we forget this guy Milligan all together, and we take something sweet like Sick Girl or Teenape Goes To Camp. Whatever you decide, know, Bloodstirsty Butchers sucks, perhaps even more than any other version of this story that is already lackluster. And this, fans of the B movie, is really saying something. 2/10
