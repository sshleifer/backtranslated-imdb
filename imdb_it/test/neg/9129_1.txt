Dear reader, watch out! This film is not really a film, although its creators have the impertinence to call it that. If you have not been advised of its content, here it is: the film is simply a sequence of images that flow continuously and try to convey a certain feeling, concept. They could therefore be called symbols. The images are accompanied by a soundtrack, whose purpose is to create an atmosphere. However, the images chosen by the director can only convey sensations to an American public, because they are, in an overwhelming number, American icons. Although the film intends to express the idea of ​​"civilized war", it fails to do so not only because of the general chaos, but also because it is too long and tiring, and I strongly felt that many scenes have not done with "war" , in any conception. To conclude, I was very disappointed by a documentary that is not a documentary, a film that is not a film, a "something" whose only strength is the extraordinary use of technology in image processing.
