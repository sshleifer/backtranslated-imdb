With all the hype surrounding the film's stars, this film left me lacking. I was expecting a much better film considering the inclusion of the talents of Murphy, De Niro and Russo, but I discovered that the film fell on my face. The comic sequences were exaggerated and the superior performances of the stars, particularly De Niro and Russo, could not save this! <br /> <br /> ** on *****
