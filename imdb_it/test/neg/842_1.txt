Having first read the novel, I do not care, for filming purposes, how differently it is scripted, provided it respects, or at least includes, the plot. For reasons known only in Hollywood, important parts of the story are completely ignored and a different storyline is added. The reason why this novel has stood the test of time is, without a doubt, due to the intertwining of both characters and the plot as a whole. To interfere with this structure is to destroy the intricate balance of the plot, and thus the narrator's intension. Although it is a matter of opinion, the casting of this film leaves much to be desired. The characters, described as very fat, should, at least, be made to look portly, to allow the character to have credibility. The days of slavery cannot be finished, or surely, the actors of this caliber would have been in revolt, with such a disguise of history. The face of Marian Halcolme is apparently virile, ... The very feminine appearance of Tara Fitzgerald does not sound true. Again Laura Fairly is described as "fair", if not "ethereal", therefore, with dark hair, she does not fit perfectly into the image of the novel. .... Aching, Hollywood! <br /> <br /> J. Hunter
