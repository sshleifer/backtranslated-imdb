I don't know what happened to director Abel Ferrara. Since the remake of "Body Snatchers" he seems to have lost it. "King of New York" and "The Bad Lieutenant" remain two of the best films of the 90s: indictments for accusations of a decade gone wrong. With films like "R Xmas" (whatever that means) and "New Rose Hotel" he seems determined to disgust and annoy his former supporters. This film has NO LIFE in it. While getting excellent performances from his actors in all his projects, the result of this jumble of ideas is certainly not a jell. Whatever the point - that the new breed of drug dealers is more or less the same as any other New York New Yawkuh bourgeoisie - it is lost in anxious mind writing and boring direction. <br /> <br /> I saw this opening night at 4-Plex in downtown Los Angeles. In the lobby, as I was buying tickets, I was surprised and happy to see it filled by a large group of racially mixed men and women in their twenties and thirties. Then they started in the theater but it was the theater that presented "8 Mile" and not "R Xmas"! The theater that shows "R Xmas" (keep in mind, this was the opening night!) It had a total of 4 people watching it, me, my wife and two other people! <br /> <br /> Well done, Abel! <br /> <br /> 2/10
