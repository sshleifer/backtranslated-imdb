I saw this film when it was first published in 1986. At the time I was young and I liked all the normal comedy available, namely; Monty Python, Jim Belushi & SNL, Steve Martin, Cheech & Chong, so I believe my judgment represents most "healthy" people. <br /> <br /> The best part of this film was the trailer reproduced at the beginning of the film for the new movie "My Little Pony" that came out. <br /> <br /> This film was so atrocious that it was actually torn from most theaters before the first week was completed. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that someone is wasting their business money to duplicate this steaming pile of human waste. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money renting or watching this "movie".
