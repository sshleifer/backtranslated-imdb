Terrible! <br /> <br /> Despite the good interpretation of Ed Harris, Diane Kruger and the strong budget (the reason for the 3 stars), the film is by far the worst I have seen of a composer, and the worst edition of a masterpiece of music. I agree with some fictional things to update a biography, which otherwise could not be so "fascinating". This has been done in AMADEUS with the best results, but this copy of B here is a flaw. Beethoven had a strong personality, but he was a sensitive artist. Here in this film, however, it looks a lot more like Mike Tyson! I also wonder if, despite his deafness, he heard all the whispers in the last scenes (could it be a cochlear implant?). I prefer to listen to the ninth on a CD with a nice teacher. Today most of them conduct modern Wagnerian orchestras. By the way: I gave Amadeus 10/10!
