This movie Oh my goodness, this movie is so poor, I'm amazed to be able to see everything .. <br /> <br /> First part Id like to say that Vinny Jones should only play a period of hooliganism in history. . <br /> <br /> Pisttolero is so unconvincing his almost comedy .. Banging in Dennis Hopper and David Carradine has not saved this film .. in fact I think it is a total comedy and like a comedy that deserves its 1 star .. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs .. Vinny Oh my god I thought I saw it all when he played that Irish Tinker: P <br /> <br /> I think the average viewer will make him realize that this movie is maybe just a kind of movie that will never be .. I can't understand how anyone can really fall into this shit
