The film is as powerful as a political statement on extraordinary renditions, torture and the war on terrorism policy. Others have already commented on these and other aspects of the film. My review may contain spoilers, so if you haven't seen the movie, you may not want to read beyond this point. <br /> <br /> Several questions are raised by this film. First of all, was the protagonist the culprit or not? There is no satisfactory explanation as to why the NSA decided to have it withdrawn and returned in the first place. Is there an innocent explanation of why he received calls from what the NSA thinks is a terrorist? If there is, the film does not seem to give it and this has made the whole film quite unsatisfactory for me. It's all well and good to make statements about whether the torture is right or wrong, but first prove to me that they tortured the wrong person, then we'll do it at the next step. <br /> <br /> If the protagonist was guilty, then what was achieved by releasing him? Perhaps, we were well trained to resist up to a certain point and then pretend to collapse and give answers that can be denied with a little research, thus tending to lead the torturers to believe that they tortured an innocent to confess without really being guilty. However, there is nothing in the film to prove that he is guilty. <br /> <br /> The various other loosers end up out: 1. Then, a rogue CIA agent released him and brought him home. What prevents the NSA from taking it back? A little advertising in the Washington Post? Please give me a break here ... If a senator is not willing to line up to intervene on his behalf, what should Corinne Whitman fear? 2. If the NSA has tracked down which phone numbers are called by whom, why couldn't they hear some calls to see if something sneaky is being discussed? 3. The plot is still even more stupid. Any criminal with more than a dozen brain cells would betray his criminal activity on an anonymous prepaid phone line, not one that can be traced back to him and his home. <br /> <br /> The entire film revolves around pulling viewers' hearts to show free graphic scenes of torture. But when you think about it more deeply, there is nothing substantial about this film, just a lot of unanswered questions and the feeling of "what, is that so? !!!" at the end of the movie.
