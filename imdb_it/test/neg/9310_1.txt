I can't stress how bad this movie is. This director took every unintelligent and unintelligent shot to make these people look "distressed". Why are their clothes so dirty? Why on earth would you want the new clark kent to play cracking? You should be banned from moving images for the rest of your life. Buddy Giovinazzo. I'm seriously offended by this madman who wants to cast real actors like hooligans and fun as a kind of clever joke. Why would you ask Clark Kent to play a crackhead? Why are they screaming so much? Why is everyone so mean? Why are those guys so dirty? Nobody wants to be so dirty? Not even a crackhead child. <br /> <br /> You have to grow and never make movies again.
