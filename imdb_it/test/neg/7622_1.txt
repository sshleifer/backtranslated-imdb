Interesting topic Pathetic delivery - script and direction. <br /> <br /> Our hero, Miles, melts and has his surgery for the restoration of life around the world. This is where the fun begins. The basic problem is that Miles has NO SOUL !!! This is used to explain his almost erratic behavior of being indirectly responsible for two deaths (I think this is the total number of deaths in 104 minutes). <br /> <br /> On the more lively side, Miles prefers the strange glass of brandy, the burning fireplaces and the young and mature cousin. The ending really does justice to this film. <br /> <br /> Some thoughts: 1. The producer $ has split up to create this tripe. J.D. Feigelson was the screenwriter and one (or only) producer. It seems he hasn't learned a lesson on "how not to bring an interesting idea to life" when you see his other writing credits. This will support the credibility of this script. <br /> <br /> 2. Now available on DVD !!! This is really scary. It should be forever "Bottom of the Shelf" in VHS format. <br /> <br /> 3. A reincarnated human being without a soul will turn into an evil entity. <br /> <br /> 4. The score offers minimal support. Not even an in-form Jerry Goldsmith could save him. <br /> <br /> 5. He deserved the 0230 time slot on TV and a more fun touch than infomercials + test models he was competing against at the time of my vision. <br /> <br /> 6. Fortunately it did not generate any sequels with Wes Craven's "Nightmare" franchise. Chiller Too: The Return Return of Miles, or something like that. <br /> <br /> Despite my rating of 1, I still recommend this film as a great example of how to kill an acting or screenplay career. This should apply to directing, however Wes Craven will be eternally exempted because of his one piece of "A Nightmare on Elm Street" 1984.
