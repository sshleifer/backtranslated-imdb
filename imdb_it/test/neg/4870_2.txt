This film is full of so many idiotic moments that you wonder why it was made. For example, they enter the sewers of the Capitol and while they are in the sewers you see signs that point to various government buildings, and then they arrive in the middle of the road! I strongly doubt that government buildings can provide public access through the city's sewer system. However, I gave this 2 instead of 1 only because of its comic value. I laughed all the time with the idiocy of all the people involved in this movie.
