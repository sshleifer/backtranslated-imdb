This was undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen, yet once it started, it was just like the real roadside car accident - you can't help yourself, you just have to watch. My eyes !!! The acting was horrible, the production was horrible, the shooting was horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible. I was glad the priest was belittled, I would have liked to have done it myself because of his poor deed. I mean acting in tenth power. I would have applauded if Chris had simply cut off all of them before turning it on by himself. And what was WITH the damned hell-wig on his head ?! I sincerely hope no one has been paid, I mean that if I were to be paid here, they would have to be paid to never try another film project, all those who were involved, never, ever again. That was just a huge piece of trash that I'm embarrassed to say I had to keep watching until the end. Don't watch it, it's about an hour and a half of your life that you never come back, and so you'll have to spend time registering on this website so you can write a comment like I'm doing now, which you have to do like a catharsis for survive the aftershocks of having seen this movie (and I use the term "film" freely here).
