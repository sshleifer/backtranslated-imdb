After some fairly OK Dutch action films, like Lek and Van God Los, Gerrard Verhage wants to make a film about the life of a Dutch mobster. Well, the gangster is a big word for Klaas Bruinsma. He's not a big international guy like George Jung (Blow) or Pablo Escobar. He's just a miserable Amsterdam guy who made some money by selling soft drugs. Things are often blown up in the Netherlands, and this film is just another example. But even then, the film could be very beautiful if the story had been told. Now there are big leaps in time: one day KLaas is just an ordinary drug addict, the next time he seems to be a big player in the drug scene. No one knows how it is possible (except for those who read the book). The acting is really bad, non-Dutch filmmakers can see one of the worst actresses in the Netherlands: Chantal Janzen. When you think she eventually strips, then you're looking at a position in the model. So: bad acting + faulty editing + crap story = De Dominee. <br /> <br /> Please don't watch it, even if other people say it's good, because it's not. I warned you
