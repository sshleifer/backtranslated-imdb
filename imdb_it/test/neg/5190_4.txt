The film begins with its most intelligent joke, and goes from there downhill (pun intended). After that there is a lot of humor and sexual situations. Beautiful women were the best part of the film. Swear word games are not meant to be jokes of central ideas, but they try here. The battle between the two groups in the local city (richies and poories) is an old tried and true system, so how could it go wrong? Well, there is no reason to envy the "requests", nor any reason to feel sorry for the poetics, so we can forget the central plot. Situational humor is all silly or sexual for teenagers, but only gigantic giggles, no real laughs. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves the comedy for this film is the character humor, with the blind providing some boxes, but rarely used configurations, and the owner of the black bar that provides humor " street "or" hood ". <br /> <br /> OK, forget the jokes, there must be some killer snowboarding shots as this was a commercial enterprise. Unfortunately, there were only 4 seconds of background action that could inspire. The rest were all "B" tricks or worse. The big moment, in which the main character rides "the goat", a men's ski slope, provided a shot in which a small avalanche eats the stuntman. This was the best boarding in this film. Any serious snowboard enthusiast will be disappointed by the quality of the stunts in the film. <br /> <br /> As for the technical aspects of the film, the soundtrack was average, which is surprising, given that those snowboarding documentaries are regularly filled with quality music. It is possible to find many errors of modification and, even if it was shot on a mountain of skis, most of the "scenario" shots did not convey any sense of real size. <br /> <br /> In general, it is worth looking at whether you have been able to completely turn off your brain and like silicone breasts. Even then, you will remember nothing of this two days later. <br /> <br /> Snowboarding is still awaiting its definitive comedy, you'd better watch a documentary on snowboarding for sure.
