When you watch the making of this DVD - they tell you what is being attempted here - they are telling the story of the bible of good versus evil and trying to preach to a major movie audience. In a modern society like ours, this is where the film fails. There are too many sheep depicted in this film. People are too motivated for this kind of preaching today. <br /> <br /> As for acting, directing and technical functions, they are well done. Chuck Norris is actually OK as an angel as Norris' unpredictable appearance as an angel is no more absurd than Tommy Smothers was in the 1960s sitcom.
