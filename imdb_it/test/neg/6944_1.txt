This is by far the worst Bollywood film I've seen so far this year. I can't lie, my wife really enjoyed this movie. It wasn't Bobby Deol or Arjun Rampal who made this film incredible, but it was Amisha Patel. She plays the role of a blind woman who gets into trouble when she almost falls from a mountain where (fortunately for her) the hero Arjun Rampal comes to save her (in the middle of nowhere). I am surprised here how a blind girl is aware of the danger when she is about to fall from a mountain, because she cannot see her environment. From this scene I started watching the movie very closely and in every scene there was a flaw in the acting of Amisha Patel. The way she plays a blind girl is bad. The only way he does it is not to look into the eyes of the person he is talking to. When I saw this movie, I respected Rani Mukherjee more with his performance in the movie Black. Amisha will never reach this level performing as an actress. <br /> <br /> However, he falls in love with Arjun Rampal. It is the story of the clich√©. Impromptu Arjun is killed by a man who is madly in love with Amisha. Amisha is desperate, but then Bobby enters the film. He also falls in love with the blind girl. Bobby Deol is a great actor from my point of view, but he can't bring the film to a higher level, where Amisha Patel buries everything deep in the ground. I have to say that Bobby deserves better roles in better films than he has achieved so far. Bobby grew up playing the first movie his adorable dad gave him. He was so bad in acting in Barsaat, but when you see him acting now, you get the shivers and believe in his every word. Only a high-potential film like a Yash Copra film has to meet in its own way. <br /> <br /> Ok, when even Amisha falls in love with Bobby, someone comes into her life. Arjun Rampal is not dead! Who believes in this shit? I do not. Why didn't they give their role to one of the bad family of the film (Shushant Singh or Aryeman Ramsay) and gave Bobby a role in one of the successful films with Amitabh Bachchan? I'm sorry if my comment sounds like a cry for an actor like Bobby to give him a great role, but he deserves much better than a movie with Amisha (the big screen on the face) Patel. This film was so terrible, that I regret having bought it.
