never before have I seen such a story of such hangers without talent being so ungrateful that their golden goose failed to testify. these spunk monkeys are pests and bad examples of friends. I felt sorry for Troy trying to connect all his friends with the Hollywood shows, but as soon as things went wrong, they left everyone at home. during the night it was a forced self-indulgent retribution effort on a man who was going against Hollywood forces to maintain the integrity of the story. The simple premise of Overnight is to try to communicate the message, "look at this guy, he blew it all", when in reality he has a strong underground following, faced with hard blows from friends and managers all in the name of getting a project done in the way he imagined it. Frankly, the only really productive par that none of these guys played in the overall performance of the Boondock Saints culminated as nothing more than extra bodies in the first bar room scene, after all they did was complain about why they were not a bigger deal based on climbing their rancid efforts on the shoulders of soldiers.
