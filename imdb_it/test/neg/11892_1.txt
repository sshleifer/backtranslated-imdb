Leni Riefenstahl would be embarrassed by the disgusting propaganda that Moore tries to call "humor". That this film, and other prevarications of Moore, actually attract admirers proves that, alas, it is possible to fool some people all the time. <br /> <br /> Let's see if we can get foreigners out. Let's see if we can extort obsolete factories. Let's see if we can add to the sum of hatred in the world. Let's see if we can pretend to be funny. Let's see if we can isolate the isolationist Charles Lindbergh. The only thing that Moore misses compared to Lindbergh is a GÃ¶ring medal. Indeed, in this film, Moore has had some self-deprecation about his schtick. In this film, Moore makes fun of Roger Smith, CEO of General Motors, as an indifferent and indifferent elitist. Moore could do it in 1989, but now that Moore has surrendered to a detached and indifferent elitism, this characterization of Roger Smith has an ironic tinge. Who really wouldn't prefer to be Roger Moore's partner?
