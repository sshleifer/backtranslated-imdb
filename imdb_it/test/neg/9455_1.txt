Bought for Â£ 1, Project Vampire is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The wooden acting, the lame effects and a terrible plot are all a movie that you have no reason to want to see. PV is one of those films that do not even have the grace to be bad in a pleasant way, instead this bile seems to try to make itself offensive boring, stupid and disgusting as humanly possible. <br /> <br /> A vampire has created a serum that sells to the elderly as a life enhancer, and those who take it fall under his control. A former laboratory intern joins a nurse to try to stop him. Someone should have stopped the producers of this junk. <br /> <br /> Nobody has reason to see this film, and in fact I am horrified by the human race because, at the time of writing, 2 people gave this atrocity 10 out of 10.
