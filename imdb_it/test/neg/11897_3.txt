One would think that anyone who undertakes a follow-up for the innovative naked servant of 30 years ago would have at least tried to honor the original with a kind of inspired vision, but no. Here we have a sort of biographical film of one of the most fashionable people of the late 20th century that does not in itself boast any style. True, the filmmakers brought together some exceptional actors and gave him a cup of scoriata to work with. Everything in the infrastructure of this film is wrong, starting with the script, which is another one of those TV movie condensations of great lives in which every other line is a "famous quote" of the subject and every other scene is an insider your -face introduction to the next key character in the subject's life. We get Swoozie Kurtz as a public relations expert who promotes Crisp as an entertainer in the United States; Denis O'Hare is the editor of a gay magazine that takes on Crisp as a film critic, and somehow becomes alienated from him when he appears indifferent to the passions of AIDS activists in the 1980s, and then returns to the fold as a friend compassionate of the dying octogenarian; Jonathan Tucker (in a beautiful performance) as a shy, insecure gay-themed canvas painter who befriends Crisp; and finally Cynthia Nixon as a performer and Woman-About-Bohemia Penny Arcade who, intrigued by the character of Crisp, offers him a place in his traveling cabaret act. Nixon is a persuasive and gifted performer, but he is given no chance by the script to embody the Arcade with his feet on the ground and streetwise. Crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a single-room apartment in an old building in Manhattan's East Village. He said he never cleaned because "after a few years the dust doesn't get any worse" or something like that. But looking at the representation of that apartment in this film you would never have had the taste of that dustiness. He frequented a local cafe on a busy street and saw himself practically every day of the week sipping tea and watching the world go by. In this film we receive a dinner that looks like something on 12th Avenue on the Hudson River. Most of the "New York streets" scenes have a sterile and unreal look with no sense of the period. <br /> <br /> The soul of this film is the great John Hurt in the title role. After almost 35 years, he still manages to capture the essence of this strange post-Edwardian English and entrust it to the third millennia. Every line of his, every gesture is exquisite. In the subsequent scenes he even modulates his vocal projection to adapt to that of a person whose life is being reduced to death. Crisp wrote shortly before leaving this realm that when one becomes very, very old, his skin takes on the character of a stinky coat that cannot be removed and yearns for death. You feel that feeling in Hurt's performance. So for him and for him this film is worth a look.
