I'm glad this was Universal Mummy's last 1940s movie. The films were all of variable quality and this film was certainly one of the smallest. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it is a very slow film, in which practically nothing interesting or exciting happens. Perhaps it would have been better if the mother had made her first entry into the film. But now the film once again spends its first 20 minutes explaining what had happened in the previous mummy films, again using archival footage of "The Mummy" from 1932, to which this film is the fourth film of the mummy that follows the story of the mummy of 1932. The film never knows how to find the right rhythm and even if the film lasts just over an hour, it still seems a bit compelling. <br /> <br /> Of course it doesn't even help the film has a rather simplistic and actually uninteresting story. The film also feels quite disconnected. The first and second half of the film do not connect with each other and look like two separate films on their own. <br /> <br /> Almoth Lon Chaney Jr. is still present. Repeat the role of the Kharis mummy once again for the third time. Too bad this time it has such a limited screen. Unfortunately it is very uninteresting to do, which is also a great waste of the mummy character himself. The film is also more full of dozens of silly actors who are playing with silly accents. It seemed to me so completely superfluous that most of the characters had to speak with an accent of the genre and in fact it is rather annoying and annoying in the points. <br /> <br /> Mom's films that are worth seeing. <br /> <br /> 4/10
