Normally I would like to applaud a film that tries to do something different or original in a genre. It is obvious that this film is a kind of parody of ninja films. And I really did my best to enjoy the movie. But I couldn't. The jokes are not funny enough! (I've seen my share of Japanese films and most of the time I like and understand the humor used in those films. "Red Shadow" is simply silly!) The characters that are portrayed in this film know that this is not a serious film and shows that everything is about fun. Watch the characters of parodies like "Hot Shots" or "Scary Movie". Everything they do on the screen is done with a straight face and they never fall out of the character! And because of that, some scenes become fun and funny. In "Red Shadow" the actors never reach him. The shadow ninja should be very clever and deadly. Unfortunately the actors don't do their best to convince us of their talent. They don't do things with a straight face. The jokes would have worked better if they did! Even the bad choreography of the action scenes has damaged the visual experience for me. I like humor in martial arts movies until the action is good. "Red Shadow" fails precisely in that department. So what remains to be enjoyed. Well, music (techno) was uplifting. It had to be like the action itself is never exciting. And there are some short dramatic scenes that are good but simple. The use of humor, the lack of stories and depths make me think that this film is meant for children. But I wonder if the kids would really like this movie. Waste of time!
