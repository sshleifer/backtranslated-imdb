A potentially good idea is completely disappointed by a weak script that throws all the credibility out of the window leaving the actors very little to work with. Roth covers it as best it can be all over; Hurt has about the same threat as a fluffy rabbit and Stamp doesn't seem to be able to decide if he's playing a former London scammer or some toff directly from Eton's playgrounds. As for the poor Laura del Sol, she does what she can, but her character is none other than the idea of ​​all the northern Europeans of the stereotypical Latin woman who is all stunned and hot temper. If you are a fan of one of the main actors do not disappoint or deceive yourself (as I suspect many of the other reviewers did here). Look at it by any means, but remain critical; you know these guys can do better.
