Most films are disgusting with high production values, this is lousy without high production values. Which sets it apart from the huge pool of horrible films. Although worse than this film, I had to give due respect to Kathryn Aselton who, I think if I had the appropriate script, it could probably give a good performance. She plays Emily the girlfriend with the perennial Josh, who often calls her "Dude" or "Man" in a non-ironic tone. <br /> <br /> But here's the thing, Emily is an almost believable character which means that soon Rhett will have to be added to the cast, to neutralize this almost believable character with an even more absurd boy than Josh. When we first meet Rhett, we learn that he is "deep" because he is filming a lizard that is PROVA that sees the world "uniquely!" Rhett then shows Emily the tape and in one of the few incredible moments of Emily, who is struck by this amateur tape of a lizard, WOW I think is the way she responds once again without the irony of sarcasm, even if slightly implied. <br /> <br /> From the opening scene you are given the warning that the camera work will be disgusting, we open up a shaky foreground of Josh as he tries to win over the spectators by reciting GOOFY! oh, how free this main protagonist is that he will act GOOFY! haha. This film could almost be a case study in the way BAD movies can be (and even if FAR bad films can enter the festival circuit, I mean in comparison to most of the circuit's shit this film probably appeared rather terrifying ). br /> <br /> I think SXSW has given this film a lesser prize (oh, south-southwest, because you encourage them, it's just cruel). But this is where I compliment this film, it's the best of the mumblecore movement. Mind you all the other mumblecore films sucked beyond imagination and generally included the grotesque nudity and the incomprehensibly bad acting, but still, it's good to be the best of something. <br /> <br /> I have not yet seen the baghead, but it seems as if perhaps they had taken some steps forward, the preview at least made it tolerable, in which even the preview of Puffy Chair could not hide the fact that he would suck. I removed the topic here, however Rhett is probably not portrayed by a professional actor, just as Josh most likely is not a real actor, but rather the director (or the director's brother, there are some mixed messages there). I think Rhett was a bit of a friend and they said hey why you don't play this guy named Rhett in the movie, the fact that Rhett is the name of the actor and the character probably means that the actor and the character are the same, to Unless I'm wrong, I'm not. <br /> <br /> If Rhett took the raccoon off his face, you would probably say he was attractive. However, Rhett, Emily and Josh come together to bring the Puffy Chair to Rhett and Josh's father. Some things happen along the way, plus bad acting, bad supporting actors, crappy camera work, an attempt at meaning. This film would not have been bad if it had not been so shamelessly pursuing a profound importance for himself. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is amateur, if you can watch this movie without paying it, as if it were on TV or rented in the library, then consider watching it, just to see if you like this super cheap style of film. I like what the duplass is doing as a whole, it makes a film with the concept of nothing, but I would like them to make a film that someone would like to see.
