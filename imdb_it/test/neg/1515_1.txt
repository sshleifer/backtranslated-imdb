Yes, this must be one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. It is absolutely bland, it has no style, the story is so subtle that you can watch television through it, and the whole movie has so many holes that you can drive an oil tanker through it. <br /> <br /> Of course, I appreciate a good B-movie as much as most white homo sapiens males would do. But this must be the worst I've ever seen. Actually, B is missing everything that makes a B-movie interesting. <br /> <br /> The entire film is based on such fascinating artifacts as characters fighting each other, various bodily functions and the complete lack of sanity about anything on the screen. <br /> <br /> It's not even funny. In reality it is quite the opposite. I even found it boring at times due to its extreme predictability. <br /> <br /> I can't find anything good to say about this movie. It was useless to look at him and I hope the others do not make the same mistake. If you pay this too, you should do a serious brain scan.
