... if you've laughed too long and need to take a break. <br /> <br /> After reading about 25 unfavorable reviews of this show, I decided to turn it on and check it out for myself. Everything that each of these people said about this show is absolutely true. Mind of Mencia is like a half hour of Mad TV, but with jokes somehow worse. One scene I had the regret of watching was "The Second Stereotype Olympics". What's funny about the black guy who has trouble swimming, or a gay guy named "Sparkles" who wins a banana contest? None of these concepts is particularly innovative, insightful or funny. Do we really need a joke about Star Wars in each episode? That movie came out like 30 years ago. Mencia's solution to fun things is to launch some stereotypes about Hispanics and launch some "beaners" in there; and let's call him a day to go home and roll around in his pile of money. Pure comic genius. <br /> <br /> Then he ruthlessly ripped off Jeff Foxworthy on a second show I saw, with a little "Your gay if ...". You could only imagine the loud laughter he got when he came across a joke by Ryan-Seacrest-is-gay. It is not that none of these has already been done to death. <br /> <br /> If you are not a big fan of the films of Jason Friedberg and Adam Seltzer, please stay away from this show. Especially when there are authentic comedians like Dave Chappelle out there who know how to joke about races and racism and are nonetheless insightful.
