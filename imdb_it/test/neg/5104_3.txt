While I have seen and enjoyed films like this one that were silent films about the Russian revolution, like POTEMKIN and TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD, I didn't particularly like this. This is mainly due to the annoying and "artistic" way the director has chosen to shoot the film. While POTEMKIN excelled in its editing style, this film used similar techniques with much less finesse - in some places the editing seemed very choppy and amateurish. Moreover, and this was really annoying, the use of zombies from the beginning of the film and at the end of the film was really exaggerated. What I mean by "zombies" is that to illustrate how depressed and oppressed the Ukrainian peasants were, people stand as dummies in many scenes. And so they stand, motionless, for a VERY long period of time, while the "bad" capitalists and exploiters of the masses walk. Give me a break! This film is a wonderful example of style over substance - and it's just a film for those who love or may neglect overly indulgent direction. <br /> <br /> By the way, the DVD for this movie has improved, in some ways, if you leave the audio commentary. This makes the film easier to follow and provides some interesting information.
