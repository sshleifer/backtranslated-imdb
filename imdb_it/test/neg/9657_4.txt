I find it incredible that so many people (probably Poles) voted for this film, giving them these votes (mostly dozens). OK, the film was fine, fun, but it was nothing special on the other. The only good thing about Kiler is the dialogue, rather not complete for the non-Poles. The script is primitive, the acting (except Jerzy Stuhr as Ryba) - horrible. It is too loud for nothing - fortunately it is not included in the top 250. P.S. The sequel "Kilerow 2-och" ("2 Kilers") is coming and it's the same story.
