First: the recent campaign of this film is a huge scam. Judging by the cover, you'd think it was some sort of scandalous movie about Kylie playing a character while having sex, taking drugs and more. This is just an economic market scheme. It barely keeps us and does none of the things. The marketing here is incredible and I am surprised that the directors have not objected. <br /> <br /> The film itself was a huge disappointment for me. It looked like an episode of Sunset Beach directed by a teenager Quentin Tarantino. And this does not mean a compliment, mind you. <br /> <br /> I think the weakness of the film is above all the story. It seems to have nothing. Only fantastic teenagers who stumble on living 'on the edge'. The characters themselves however have a certain personality, but the film does not exploit its potential. As said, there is no history of any substance here. It looks too elaborate in a nice dialogue and ends up looking like a colorful MTV ad. It certainly has this feeling. <br /> <br /> However, I think some people might like it, but I would say that there are much better films like this around.
