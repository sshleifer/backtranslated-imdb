What really surprised me about this movie is that it sounded so fake. First of all, who at the end of the 80s (when the film takes place) lived like this family? A university professor would not make enough money to support the lifestyle I saw in the film. So he and his wife's home stay would be tormented by financial woes, especially when they get cancer. Secondly, Streep is my age and most women, particularly in his class (educated, white, wealthy) lived the feminist movement. Yet this woman seems unaware of her anachronistic behavior. In fact, I felt that she was a very authoritarian woman who kept her husband an emotional child by taking care of her every need. <br /> <br /> The fact that so many people have been touched by the film is surprising. I have admired Carl Franklin's films in the past, and actually I like Meryl Streep, but gad, which is a manipulative and a liar.
