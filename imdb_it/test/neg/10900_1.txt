But it is not. The plot is not so bad, the actors are not all terrible so it should be decent. Instead, despite a good starting point, the plot drags on and suffers from many of these moments "I can't believe he / she is so stupid" so often used in horror movies to keep things going. Sometimes he frustrated me by looking at some of the decisions made by the protagonist. It also took too long to get to the good part of the film. The anticipation is great but you can't spend more than half of the movie to create it. A pity also because it got a decent exposure at the time of release and hit right before the big Halloween season. Even so I have the feeling that he will get at least one sequel, if not more maybe they will be able to build on the general plot to release something decent.
