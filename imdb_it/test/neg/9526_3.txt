As a person who knows the filmed ship and some other ships, I can't see the film just like a movie. As a film, there are some beautiful shots of the ship, most of them performed on an existing ship - apart from those in the disaster scenes, of course, and a certain room below deck. But as far as history and dialogues are concerned, I can only call it crap. None of this would have happened on a real sailing boat. No wonder the film had a negative impact on the existing ship - if I didn't know, I wouldn't be tempted to make a boat trip for sure. Surely, for Europeans I recommend turning off once the ship has run aground. After that, the supra-emotional part begins, very American that I could not bear. The images are really, really great, no wonder in a Ridley Scott movie, but if you can avoid listening to the text, it will become much better.
