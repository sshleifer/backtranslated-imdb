Ni√±as Mal is not a film, it is a bad episode of a badly conceived soap opera. <br /> <br /> Acting is no better than soap operas, I guess the writer and director saw too many Mexican soap operas and can't conceive of anything different. <br /> <br /> Forget it, go back to your soap operas to get an audience you like. <br /> <br /> Let's stop wasting time and money and give a bad name to the once respectable Mexican film industry. <br /> <br /> NOT a film OK or good, it's a mediocre soap opera!
