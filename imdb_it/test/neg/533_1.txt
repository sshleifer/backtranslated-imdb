As a science fiction and casual fan Angelina Jolie, I thought that this obviously low-cost movie could be worth a look ... maybe it had some scenes or a storyline that would make up for all its flaws. Also, it might be interesting to see Angelina while she was embarking on her star-tied career. <br /> <br /> Oh, how wrong I was. One thing I learned - at 18, Angelina Jolie couldn't act. So, to make her feel at ease, the producers launched the whole movie with people who couldn't act. Seeing this, Jack Palance (who can actually act) decided to exaggerate. Watching 10 minutes of this is enough to burn your eyes. <br /> <br /> For the horrible acting and overcoming a meaningless script, an insipid dialogue, the cinematography of the bottom of the rod ... all in all. <br /> <br /> The story presents Angelina as a cyborg programmed by his multinational masters as a murderer. Escape from corporate headquarters with the help of his combat instructor. The company sends bounty hunters after them. Stupid stuff happens. The end. I would say more but I didn't want to waste my life watching this dreck. <br /> <br /> I beg you - it's not worth watching. It is not even worth thinking about looking. Save yourself the pain and move on.
