Jude's law gives Keanu Reeves a run for his money as a wooden actor, the character of Renee Z came directly from the Beverly Hillbillies, and the two protagonists have a chemistry very similar to that of Darth Vader and Queen Amedala. The "bad guys" are the worst kind of clich√© and there is no subtle moment in the film. Unbelievable that some critics really liked this movie.
