Really, REALLY ... What the public likes (the American one!) In this so-called show it's totally beyond me. What we can learn from these series: <br /> <br /> 1. Each casino spends around 2-3 billion dollars each year to hire a satellite and a huge amount of hi-tech hi-tech cameras for their team safety. Let the FBI bite the dust of them. <br /> <br /> 2. Every security officer must have a voluptuous breast, naturally natural. The boobs must be shown all the time otherwise they will lose their job. <br /> <br /> 3. If the employee is a male, he needs to implant the breasts, then go to step 2. <br /> <br /> 4. Only in Hollywood can you openly blast the ideas of other shows, then implement them as your own and call all these "original" and "art" crap. <br /> <br /> 5. Any security with breasts larger than 39D is considered immortal and cannot die. <br /> <br /> I would really like to have the opportunity to vote with negative values. -10/10 for this!
