When I finally got to see this movie recently, it turned out to be exactly what I felt at first sight ... yet another Hollywood CG movie / live-action rehash of a cartoon franchise. Nothing special or memorable. Designed in every way possible to attract very young children and very immature adults, making heavy use of comic devices such as farts, poop and the dimensions of Theodore's bottom. <br /> <br /> This movie would annoy me a lot less if it weren't such an obvious step for the Chipmunks. Even their characters I found have been changed for the worse for this movie. While in the past each of them had a very distinct personality, they all behaved like immature, intelligent children with ADD, constantly bouncing off the walls. I was particularly annoyed to see Simon interpreted this way ... He should be the intelligent and serious nerd who acts as a "straight man" to Alvin's antics. But here is practically a carbon copy of Alvin. A joke in the film also implies that Simon alone * thinks * is intelligent but in reality he is not ... and honestly if I had never heard of the Chipmunks before seeing this film, I would have accepted. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this film is just another obvious mockery, and I am more than a little sorry that it was even made. The fact that it is a film for children does not excuse its flaws ... Excuse a stupid film that degrades a classic franchise just because it is for children is an insult to children, and every child deserves something smarter than this movie.
