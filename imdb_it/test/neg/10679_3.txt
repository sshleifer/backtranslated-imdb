Just like all the cast and crew know everything about making movies. <br /> <br /> This film is about the adventures and difficulties of a modern vampire cockney assassin, and an old woman spit with her apparently tired vampire lover. That plot itself smells like clich√©s and promises of boredom when on a small film like this, and that's exactly what you get. <br /> <br /> First of all let me say that in no way I reject the films because they are B films, in fact some of my favorite films are B films like Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter, but this lacks the mark of a mile . <br /> <br /> Anyone with any knowledge of small-budget films should know that acting is rarely compelling and emotional, but Razor Blade Smile creates a whole new dimension of softening it on the screen. Some of the so-called acting are simply indescribably bad, with characters that emit sounds of a flat falling sheet, and speech that expresses emotions and beliefs as much as the terminator after a couple of equine tranquilizers. <br /> <br /> A large part of the film is also taken up by vampiric characters, in particular the protagonist, who flaps his mouth unnecessarily, showing ridiculously large teeth and very strong exhalation. It must literally happen in almost every scene, at least once, and it quickly becomes annoying and useless, as if many looks of presumably frighteningly gaping vampire faces were used to fill some time and fill the rest of this a movie. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what some of the other reviewers believe here, I believe this film (the director in particular) is really trying to take this movie in many parts seriously. The huge number of overly dramatic action shots and extreme close-ups seems to indicate that the director really wanted people to hear this movie and make it legitimate and not spoil it, and fail miserably. Attempts at seemingly tasteful sex scenes are fun and stupid and the action sequences are sometimes simply stupid. <br /> <br /> Even the end of this film was one of the weakest and most pathetic conclusions I ever saw a movie, a B movie or not. When films like this force you to sit for hours and hours just to be rewarded with an "oh it was all a game" ending, it's actually disgusting. The conclusion of the "plot" seems an afterthought to the director who understood on the last day of shooting, because they had run until the end of their reduced budget. <br /> <br /> But I didn't vote this movie is a star, despite the overwhelming slavery, and this is the only extra point I can really give this movie. Intentionally or not, it was fun. I'm pretty sure the parts I found humorous weren't meant to be, and I found that most of the genuine gag efforts were fruitless, but when viewed with friends it's a good movie to extract the mickey from.
