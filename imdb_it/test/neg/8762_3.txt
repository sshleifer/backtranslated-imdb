There is not much to say about this except that it is probably the worst beginning of the zombie movies (I could see another, REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES [1936], before the month is out). For all the stars, John Carradine's intention to build an army at the service of the Third Reich with them, is not seen to do much! James Baskett (Uncle Remo of SONG OF THE SOUTH [1946]!) Interprets their leader, who also serves as Carradine's servant. The black comedian Mantan Moreland resumes his role as "frayed cat" chauffeur from KING OF THE ZOMBIES (1941), as well as the exotic Madame Sul-Te-Wan as the housekeeper of Carradine. Unfortunately for Carradine, his supreme success ?? your wife's zombification ?? it brings him all sorts of troubles: not only his relatives show up at his residence / remote laboratory to investigate his sudden death (which means he must falsify a funeral service!) but in reality he proves disobedient and indignant at the end persuading "his fellow zombies stand up against their master !! Cowboy star Bob Steele is also interested (even better known for his piece in "THE BIG SLEEP" by Howard Hawks [1946]) who plays a US secret agent posing as a Nazi sheriff posing! Fortunately, director Sekely would have had much more luck with his next genre film, THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS (1962).
