I found an old VHS version of this movie in my parents' house, so I thought I'd give it a try. From the beginning I didn't expect much from this film and I'm happy for this because on the whole the film wasn't going well. <br /> <br /> The acting was very poor, even for a film by Nicolas Cage. A scene with a radio controller stands out for being so painful that I found it amusing to see that this scene was not cut. The first 30 minutes of the film had almost no developed plot and I didn't know what was happening. <br /> <br /> The story itself had a chance to be decent but either the director was just bad or he was trying too hard to put his unique touch on the film's style. I was able to see everything but I will never see this movie again.
