We cut everything in the first paragraph. "The Messengers", the most recent film by Pang Brothers (Danny and Oxide), as a horror film, is profoundly negative. And just like a movie in general, it's a big disappointment. It is nothing but a heated "Sixth Sense", and as long as this image is still available, there is no reason to pay to see this turkey on Earth. <br /> <br /> Lately, horror / slasher movies such as the "Final Destination" series, "Wrong Turn", "Boogie Man", "The Ring 2" and "The Grudge" are becoming increasingly dependent on big shocks without payoff (for example, something jumps to the person on the screen, arouses a panting from the public, but turns out to be a cat or a crow or something of the kind.) Little enters into making it a real terrifying experience as "The sixth sense" , or "Signs", or some of the classic horror films of the 40s, 50s and 60s. <br /> <br /> "The Messengers" is based on the same old and tired clich√©s of these newer and far inferior films, and is therefore old, tired and - to my surprise - ended up as one of the more films boring I've seen for a while. <br /> <br /> The plot has another stupid family, led by dad Roy (Dylan McDermott, "The Practice"), mom Denise (Penel ope Ann Miller, "Awakenings", "Kindergarten Cop", TV series "Desperate Housewives"), great sister Jess (Kristen Stewart, "Zathura: A Space Adventure") and little Ben (Evan Turner), who move to North Dakota from Chicago. <br /> <br /> The reason for the move is never outlined here, but it has something to do with Dad's inability to find work and the drunkenness of Jess driving escapades. We know that there will be problems immediately because they move into a large Gothic house in the middle of nowhere; a domicile that resembles the summer residence of Munster. Oh, and the first five minutes of the movie show something really horrible. <br /> <br /> Jess hates the place (hey, who could blame her), but the optimistic pop hopes to make a leap out of the sunflowers (despite the unusually large amount of fluttering crows). But when he meets Burwell (John Corbet, "Raising Helen" and looks like Kevin Costner in the film version of "My Name Is Earl"), a traveling vagabond and expert in raising sunflowers, things start to rise. <br /> <br /> But then strange things start to happen; Jess is terrified of a violent invisible force at home (obviously, no one else, except the two-year-old Ben can see it, so it's labeled as a trail) and the crows keep wandering. Ben is also able to detect otherworldly creatures, but since he was two, he can't articulate it. Scene after scene of people telling the kid to tell them what he sees finally made me want to scream at the screen: "He can't tell you he's two years old - crazy!" Yes, having the only protagonist who can solve all these things being a dumb child is really smart. <br /> <br /> However, we are left to reflect on Jess's sanity; when and if Ben will correctly describe the paranormal visions he sees; if dad will make the sunflower thing work; if the plateau of the plains is a good boy or a villain; what is the point of George Plimpton's real estate agent; like a pitchfork plunged into the back it can only be a flesh wound; what role the mother plays in the family is; and where all the ravens come from. <br /> <br /> All this while waiting and asking for something - anything - to happen. The conclusion is really lame, and once again raises the question of how a spirit that has no physical body can cause harm to a living person. Very boring, useless and the most terrible of all, it's not at all scary. <br /> <br /> Oh, and there are many crows in this movie.
