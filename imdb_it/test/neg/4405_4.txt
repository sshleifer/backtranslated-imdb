I really wanted to love this film for all kinds of reasons - the topic is inherently interesting and is probably the main problem facing the world today and has created fascinating works (for example, Linda Grant, when I lived in modern times) usually since Israeli side of the fence. Also, a guy I like told me he thought it was the best movie he had seen throughout the year, so with such a recommendation ... <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, in fact, I found myself to nod to the points! I have to admit that I was tired and that the cinema was comfortable, but I found it too hard to work trying to identify with the characters. Once I got it into my head that it was a series of cartoons, I went, but that made it as disappointing as a sketch show rather than a movie. I liked the concept of a contained staging, almost silent, in contrast to these utopian moments - the sexy girl, the red balloon and the ninja Muslim fighter. But personally I think the film was overwhelmed. I'm not saying fiction and the plot is everything (it certainly isn't), but even a little more dialogue would have helped.
