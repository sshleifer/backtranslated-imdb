It's hard to say if this adventure with B-movie with a ham is a parody, a tribute or simply messed up, but it doesn't work regardless of how you look at it. Based on the novel by Michael Crichton, it is a crazy mix of lost cities, giant hippos, monstrous monkeys, visual effects and malicious dialogues. The first thing that destroys this tosh is the gorilla that can communicate in sign language, and needless to say that the film will not improve from then on. Tim Curry, who makes all this old rope quite useful, turns into a slice of feverish ham and sports a bizarre accent that defies identification, and Ernie Hudson, who also seems to know that this is all a bunch of old garbage.
