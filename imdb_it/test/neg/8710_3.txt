I looked at this series out of curiosity, I wanted to see if they could and with ALL this modern technology, outside the classic epic of Cecil B. DeMille of 1956, with Charleton Heston, Yul Brenner and Sir Cedric Hardwicke. Of course, I was disappointed. Yes, they all had the correct biblical characters, but they didn't give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes, which aroused your interest throughout the first film. If you plan on having a mini series, you must have "revolting" scenes, the "Burning Bush", Separating the "RED Sea", drowning "Armies of Pharoh", "building the Sethi Pyramids", could have been done with today's technology on the scale of successful films like "The Lord of the Rings" or Matrix. Obviously, they did not want to leave a lasting impression of "faith and sacrifice", which is very necessary in these difficult times.
