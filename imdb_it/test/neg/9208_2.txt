This is the kind of film that could have ruined different careers, if garbage could ruin the film career of these times. <br /> <br /> Melanie Griffith took off her shirt, and in her pre-improvement surgery days, she really should have been dressed. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels was completely wasted, but luckily for him and for us, he continued to do much better things since ... this ... this ... well, heck, piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> Strangely, all of his major actors have gone to bigger and better things, including director Jonathan Demme. Even his work here was wasted but he deserved a reluctant admiration. I mean, anything that isn't worth doing isn't worth doing well. But he did it well, anyway. <br /> <br /> Still, there was a brilliant and shining appearance: Ray Liotta, who is called down on the credit list, stole absolutely everything. Liotta was beautifully charming! Hypnotic! Fascinated. <br /> <br /> I saw this piece of garbage while it was still relatively new, in a friend's private theater. For some strange reason, my friend loved it. I think it's because Melanie Griffith took off her shirt (and, really, honestly, she shouldn't have), although she tried to say that there were other, more artistic reasons. <br /> <br /> However, I thought even then, after his first scene, that Ray Liotta would become an important star, or at least an important actor, highly respected. <br /> <br /> Despite the junk aspects of the junk script, the sheer ugliness of the whole story, Liotta almost made it worthwhile. In fact, it is worth seeing once, just to see how far Ray Liotta has come. I mean, first of all, his name is now listed at the top or near the top. <br /> <br /> Even then, even in a pile of garbage, Ray Liotta shone like a diamond. <br /> <br /> Only, if you see this garbage, prepare to hold your nose. Each main character is amoral or immoral. Terrible film Terrible cinematic idea. <br /> <br /> Added Comment: too many people respond "Was the comment helpful?" with a "no" because I disagree with the expressed opinion. Maybe IMDb should ask this question: "Do you agree with these opinions?"
