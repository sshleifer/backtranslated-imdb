Not the best of WIP, but not the worst either. Honestly, I feel guilty about this film, considering it had to be a minimum career for all those involved. Yet the acting, the dialogue, the absurd scenarios and the ever-present microphone come to me every time and certainly add to its bad film appeal. Like most Linda Blair fans, the best (or topless) awards go to Sybil Danning. Also, special compliments to Henry Silva, who is the only one in the cast who does not play his role too seriously. Watching, the film now, however, makes me look more closely at the character of Stella Stevens. She plays the chief officer, and I must ask myself if this case in which Hilary Clinton decided to adopt her current appearance and demeanor. After all, I'm sure he didn't have to look past his husband's video collection to find this movie. Not that I'm judging. I have seen it several times, and all this makes me think of what would have happened if Clinton had been allowed to install a hot tub in the Oval Office. Hmmm.
