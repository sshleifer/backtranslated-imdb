First of all, let me start by saying that I have been a devoted follower of Thomas Howell's career since "The Outsiders" and "The Hitcher". He was an emerging star in the 80s - with hits like "Soul Man". The future was brilliant for this young actor and he had the potential to go on from there and really establish himself in Hollywood. Let's put it this way: Tom Cruise had a role on "The Outsiders" while Howell was in the lead. Watch Cruise today !!! But collecting material like this will only denigrate Howell's career even more if it were possible. Why choose things like this? A small part in an important film would be of greater benefit to him than this junk. <br /> <br /> Essentially the story here takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where everyone lives underground where chaos reigns. Howell is a pastor - he protects the flock of various religious leaders by killing all the undesirables. In other words it is a hit man. <br /> <br /> The sets are so bad that they wouldn't look out of place in an episode of Thunderbirds. The use of slow movement is unnecessarily repeated throughout the film, but it is well supported by bad acting (and a kind word is bad here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown without reason, vehicles that seemed to be made from a box of Corn Flakes and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity. Oh yes, and the plot was also pathetic. <br /> <br /> I hate to write bad reviews on movies - especially those where I really like the star - but this movie is so bad I don't think for a second that anyone could have been proud of it. I'm not a director and I'm not a director, but I'd like to hide my head in the sand if I spent any amount of time and money on this film. <br /> <br /> In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to NEVER see this movie. It came free with a DVD player that I bought, but I still turned it off halfway because I was embarrassed about Howell. Come on C - give yourself a little credit and fight away from these non-hit wonders and try to get by and get a good part - however small. <br /> <br /> 1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.
