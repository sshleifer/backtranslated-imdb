2001 is one of those films in which, if you don't like it, you are told that you don't "take" it and you need to look at the deeper meaning and symbolism. You have been told that you clearly have a slow attention span, and you just want to see sex, explosions, and have the plot delivered to you on a plate. <br /> <br /> Let's take a break in the movie, right? Three minutes of darkness, with something that sounds like a dying hippopotamus in the background. So we get the initial credits. A minute of fascinating shots of the Savannah. Then a group of monkeys finds a black rock and starts killing things with bones. Cut to the first of the many 20-minute shots of the ships that do things while the 'Blue Danube' is played in the background. A bunch of useless dialogues and a group of lunar scientists finds another monolith. Cut to a spaceship too long to complement the crew: three sleeping people, two named Dave and Frank, who have just a little more personality than rigid hibernation. And then there's HAL, the "perfect" supercomputer that runs the ship. Predictably, it starts and begins to break the First Law of Robotics. Now this is something that has potential. A super-evil, coldly merciless mind that controls the surrounding environment and can predict your every move. And what does it do? Let a boy float in space and turn off the hibernation machines so that the three asleep die, leaving Dave floating in a pod. Simply use the airlock, wear a space suit and turn HAL - slowly. Then, apparently, there is a psychedelic evolution of Jupiter. <br /> <br /> Here is the film with the pauses removed: the monkeys see the monolith, they kill things. Scientists find the lunar monolith. HAL kills people. HAL dies; Dave receives a pre-recorded message and evolves into Jupiter. <br /> <br /> I don't understand that. This is me getting bored to tears for long stretches of absolutely nothing. Of course, it's realistic, but I find that I have no reason to worry. No matter the message, no movie can be good without being funny. Frankly, every character could be replaced by Keanu Reeves, and nothing would change.
