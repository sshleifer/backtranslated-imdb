The filmmakers try to depict the influence of Mondovis and Robert Parker as a parody of the German occupation of France and the reign of fascism. But they never find a victim in this movie. We hear wine makers, critics and distributors complaining that as the wine industry grows it becomes more and more homogeneous. But the film never proves that this resulted in the loss of any good wine or the exploitation of any person or culture other than the naive readers of Wine Spectator with a lot of money. If they want to pay hundreds of dollars for a boring wine, so be it. <br /> <br /> If it was a film about the diamond trade, where the market dominance of the DeBeers company translates into human suffering, the muckraking style could have been appropriate. But as it is, it turns out to be anti-American, anti-modernization and anti-capitalist. If the filmmakers had been around in the 1870s, they would probably have protested the grafting of American vines in an effort to save French wine.
