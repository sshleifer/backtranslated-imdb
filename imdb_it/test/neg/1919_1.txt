Where to start, where to start .... hmmm ... well, what about some of the stiffest, most unnatural, incredible and encamping performances you can imagine? What about stereotypical "characters", situations and places? Or what about a manipulative, cloying and completely unhappy script? I can't think of an element in this film that was original, worthy of being seen or interesting. <br /> <br /> Note to all of you Josh Hartnett / Chris Klein / LeeLee Sobieski fans - enjoy their collective fifteen minutes, folks, because they won't be famous any longer ...
