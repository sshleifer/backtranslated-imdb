This is only crushed because it has David Hasselhoff as its protagonist. Well, then let me fight it. Compared to the garbage that today they call horror, this film is not bad. He has the beautiful Leslie Cumming. He's super sexy, but he can't speak very well. There is a great scene with her when she is supernaturally raped. She shows her beautiful body. Linda Blair does nothing here like Hasselhoff. 3/10
