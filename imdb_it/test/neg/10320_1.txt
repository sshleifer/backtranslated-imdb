I saw this remastered on DVD. He had a great image of Sandra on it and said "Protagonists Sandra ...." and made it look like she had an important role. Not like that. It barely keeps us. He does what he can with the script, but it's not much. <br /> <br /> The sound was terrible. By that I mean that things didn't go together. The shots would have been fired and the number of shots did not match the sound. People talk in a car while it is in motion and the shot comes from outside the windshield, but there is no engine noise, road noise or any other sound. Kinda weird. <br /> <br /> The score was terrible. They always seemed the same few notes. Really horrible dialogue. <br /> <br /> Acting was horrible, I couldn't believe it. The fighting scenes were like a Batman cartoon without "BIFF" and "BAM". They were really lame. The shooting scenes, I mean with firearms, were ridiculous, literally. I made a rapid progress through a lot of this movie. Even then, it was too long.
