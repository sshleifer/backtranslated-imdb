I'm usually quite tolerant in movies, and very easily entertained, but this film was terribly disappointing. <br /> <br /> I saw this film after seeing on the cover that there was William Zabka (The Bad Guy of Karate Kid) and during this movie I could see that this was the only reason. <br /> <br /> This film is a tremendous waste of the actors' talent. Music and sound are terribly sticky - I couldn't believe this movie shot in the 90s! <br /> <br /> I would not really recommend this movie unless you were interested in one of the actors.
