I'm not kidding: there's a scene in this movie where a hobo hits his head on a trapezoidal tunnel and explodes (without a fireball, though) into a million pieces! He made some kids scream in terror in front of me! ... In a movie with classification G! <br /> <br /> This film could be used to convince children that Santa is a BAD! His helpers are ugly, misanthropic, exaggerated and evil! When Santa appears (here an anagram of Satan!), All 200,000 elves begin to sing "Santa Claus is coming to town" as if it were a Druid war song. Then, in the reflection of the object "Rosebud" of this film (a jingle bell that whispers suggestions about why you don't hear ringing: "doubt ... doubt ...)), the old Saint Nick appears, who looks like a stoic Donald Sutherland, his face shining like Moses of "K10C". When we hear him speak, his booming voice sounds less like an old and cheerful elf, and more like the voice of James Earl Jones has slowed down by about 20%. /> <br /> The syrupy music is out of place, boring and repetitive, does not follow any emotional thread (as in the "very effective score" of "Titanic"), but it seems simply thrown in certain points to generate feelings of warmth and magic , unable to move, partly because it does not match the imaginary of the film, there are some relics of a musical train (no pun intended) in which, from nothing, the ghostly symphonic score is suddenly thrown into a happy and happy POLKA with a child's voice on the locomotive of the title: fa semb rare the whole film as if it had been put into production! <br /> <br /> Finally, I can with some other reviewers on how, well ... "dead" everyone seems. Sometimes it seems a bit macabre. The motion-capture technique is good to allow the roller-coaster sequences like those of Kings Island to seem convincing at a distance, but up close, the "real" actors should have been used. Overall, a feast for the eyes to kill time in front of the TV, but not much else here.
