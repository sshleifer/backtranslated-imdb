I really like Harrison Ford, so I enthusiastically rented this film only to be disappointed minute by minute. Mr. Ford seemed to be walking through very hot water looking for a place to urinate. His co-star was very good and had the best lines. The story intrigued me but the error - BIG MISTAKE - since everyone is identified by a driving license or passport before boarding an American commercial plane, they left me many questions about the plot. <br /> <br /> I could have worried less about these people. In fact, the subplot of the Internal Affairs investigation was more interesting than the two lovers killed while flying in first class in Miami. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed with the director, Sydney Pollack who gave us the classic Tootsie and other films. This is a waste of time and energy.
