I think it's been two years since I saw the movie and to date it's the worst movie I've ever seen. The only thing I thought after watching this movie is that it was created for a tax reason. So after all this time I finally overturned my instincts;) And now IMDb says I have to fill 10 lines with comments: <br /> <br /> "Sorry, you have to provide at least 10 lines in your comment. or use the BACK option if this is not a new window. "" <br /> <br /> Please there is nothing left to say ... <br /> <br /> Sorry for some bad English .
