This is another movie I jumped out of Italian TV as a child: notable for his quintet of old stars, most of whom had never made a horror film in their lives (Fred Astaire, Melvyn Douglas, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. , John Houseman and Patricia Neal), deals with the long-hidden past crime of men who returns to haunt them. It takes the form of a ghost who died for the girl everyone loved (Alice Krige) but who were forced to give in after an unfortunate accident when he humiliated their ego! Fairbanks, who was in charge of the action, has two twin sons (Craig Wasson) and so Krige also directs his revenge on them. Soon one of these, Fairbanks himself and even Douglas and Houseman all end up dead. Therefore, the remaining Wasson and Astaire decide to face the ghost at the crime scene where they also have to fight with a couple of sinister tramps who somehow execute Krige's orders! I couldn't wait to see these veterans at their last legs (Douglas died before the film was even premiered, but by then he had already completed another role, while demonstrating his inauspicious swan song by Astaire) but also GHOST STORY many mood swings - while maintaining a slow pace for everything and emerging out of proportion in the mishap - to be anything but a failed curiosity. Have sex dolls (including Wasson's full frontal nudity!) And macabre make-up effects confused the waters even more and ruined the antiquated elegance inherent in the cinematography of Jack Cardiff (another long-standing notable).
