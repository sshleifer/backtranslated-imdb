It takes forever for this typically too simplistic and idiotic film by Stephen King to finally get out of the starting blocks. About half an hour is spent on useless introductions to various boring characters and their irrelevant little personal problems that could excite bored housewives and apathetic pensioners in soap dramas, but this should be the horror genre (or so I naively thought). The bastard does not seem at all terrifying, and Leonard Maltin, the notoriously innocent / hopeless and always grinning film critic, would disagree: he believes that Cujo is "really scary". (I often wonder if Maltin is genuinely cool - or simply love doing favors for his Hollywood friends ...). It is illogical and inconsistent how Wallace survives an attack with only a leg wound. And, of course, his car breaks down just when he needs it to save her life: this is one of the oldest horror movie clich√©s; trust King to use it to a minimum. The premise is imbecile, too trivial, even for a horror film: a rabid bastard attacks a family. Is that so? This kind of thing hardly constitutes a 3-minute sub-sub-plot in your average zombie movie. I think Cujo also had to guess that he was playing a turkey. Mutants have terrible agents ... But what I really don't understand is how people can actually jump into the "Cujo" book and read it from cover to cover? These SK fans must be immortal: this is the only explanation, so they treat time as meaningless goods. <br /> <br /> Bodycount: 3.
