I often wonder how films like this are made, and the most shocking thing is that people actually pay to watch them. <br /> <br /> With Aksar it seems that the director invented the story as he went along, adding twists when he liked it, no matter how ridiculous they were. The script did not exist with inhuman dialogues like "Jo Sheena Roy, Pehenti Hai, Wahee Fashion Hota Hai" and "Yeh Versace hai Madam" (yes right). <br /> <br /> Each of the characters was superficial and underdeveloped. Acting was terrible. Constumes (lycra for Udita and horrible clothes for a squat Emran), local (the many houses that were used for the interior did not even vaguely resemble a Victorian villa), screenplay etc. Etc., Just a word - garbage. <br /> <br /> For those who love Hashmi and his films, watch it. As for me, I will never go back with those two and a half hours. The only saving factor was part of the music that was decent.
