I read several reviews asking the question: "Why was this film made"? I also found that question that loomed in my mind as the hour and twentieth minute seemed to be dragging near the center, only to give the feeling that in the end it is gaining strength, when in reality it was not doing anything like that. So, "Why was this film made"? I think it's a good question for those who look at Heftig og begeistret to ask themselves. This reviewer is proud of director Knut Erik Jensen for giving us this powerful image of hope, brotherhood and inspiration with this all-male chorus, but I don't think Jensen has done enough to bring a compelling story to the table. Let me ask you this question: "Do members of the public need more in a documentary than a simple story to maintain interest"? My answer is yes, and this is where Jensen failed. Heftig og begeistret was a good documentary, but it was far from exceptional. Jensen did a horrible job with the subjects history and dedication. It was nice to listen to the songs, but over time those songs seemed boring, oppressive and a little precocious. From the opening scene where our men are singing their hearts in blinding snow, I knew I was hooked, but as the film developed, I lost interest. Why? Jensen has never brought us members of the public to the next level. He maintained the level of the playing field and eventually damaged the overall tone of the film. Was it a film about music or about men in the choir? The world may never know. <br /> <br /> Once again, I would like to say that Jensen has done a phenomenal job of finding an interesting story about this group of men who have surely seen hard times and how they dealt with this through music, but it was as if All men's choir was a group of the most boring men ever created. Jensen gave us the music superbly, but it was the characters, the subjects, of which I knew nothing by the end of the film. In the mix we had a 97-year-old man who still had a driver's license, we had a great man in a tub that sang classic American songs, we had old men who once had their hearts broken in youth, we had a little tension the youth of the choir and veteran singers, and we also had a former drug addict who had only been cleaned for eleven years. Did Jensen develop these interesting stories? No, he left them on the table. It was obvious that these singers were willing to talk about it further (see the politician who lost his political days), but Jensen seemed to free himself from those heartfelt moments and return directly to interesting places where he could sing the choir. For me, music was defined at the beginning of the film, I wanted to be presented and listen to the stories of these individual men. They were all appealing, yet Jensen seemed to ignore them completely. <br /> <br /> Ignoring the main arguments of this documentary, Jensen failed to create any kind of tension towards the end. Without giving the end, I felt that Jensen was coloring the lines. Instead of being bold outside the lines, he chose not to create any moment of sympathy, emotion, nervousness or sadness. Jensen took our subjects from point A to point B to point C without asking us to be involved in any way in form or form. I can see how national feeling made this film a huge success in Norway, but for everyone else who watched (ie ME) it was necessarily necessary. I wanted to try for these guys. I wanted to know if they would do well while traveling, or simply found themselves loved in their city. There was not a story, mostly in part to no argument development. When you look at modern documentaries (oddly enough, this film was made in 2001), you want it to sound similar to any Hollywood movie. You want suspense, realism and drama, alas, with Heftig og begeistret you get nothing of the kind. <br /> <br /> Overall, I have to ask the question once again: "Why was this film made"? My final answer, Alex, is that Jensen wanted to show how difficult times and an evolving economy can still produce happiness even in the coldest places on Earth. I think Jensen wanted to show human dedication and as a simple thing as singing can unite a population. That said, Jensen proved it perfectly in this film, but he didn't create a good documentary. When you make a film of this nature, I feel that you have to look inside the group, examine the participants in the choir and listen to each of their stories to create an ending that will grip your heart. The only thing this film captured was my attention span trying to leave the room at rocket speed. Once again, I don't want to sound negative about this film because the music was excellent and the men who sang produced a feeling of honesty, but I needed more. With documentaries becoming a mainstay of the film community, we expect a little more than what Heftig og begeistret has given us. I want to see reality and people, not just another song and a dance routine! <br /> <br /> Vote: ** on *****
