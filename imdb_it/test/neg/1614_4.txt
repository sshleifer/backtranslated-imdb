A friend of mine, who is even more interested in the cult films of the seventies than me, advised me this and in fact gave me the copy I saw. However, wasn't I as enthusiastic about the result as he was? or, moreover, Michael Elliott ?? was. The film is a hybrid of HOUSE OF WAX (1953) and THE Texas CHAIN ​​SAW MASSACRE (1974): indeed, I would venture to say that it served as the basis for the 2005 remake of the previous one, much more than "original"! So, we have an incredibly realistic and realistic wax museum (guess why?) With its seemingly harmless curator (an Amazon Chuck Connors) who is "invaded" by the mandatory group of stranded teenagers (including Tanya Roberts). He also has a crazy brother ?? shades of PSYCHO (1960) incorporated for good measure, up to the same twist ?? which should be a mechanical genius (presented in a "poltergeist" that inexplicably accompanies the first murder). The film benefits from a soundtrack by Pino Donaggio but, being so derived and not particularly well made to boot, it essentially ends up being limited to a redundant (and rather confusing) genre effort.
