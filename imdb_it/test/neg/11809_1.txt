A pre-nerd Robert Carradine, a pre-automan Desi Arnaz Jr., and an almost pre-pubescent Melanie Griffith take the road and head for Alaska with romantic dreams of becoming rich salmon fishermen. Well, their dream is as exciting as the unfortunate youth road movie. They are not particularly interesting, and the film doesn't make much sense beyond "We've put together some famous people's spawns and made a low-budget movie about their misadventures". Outside the guns of the 60s and 70s, film roads and rebellious youth films, this is mediocre, with characters developed and not involving, little witty, little freshness for the story, which is as bland as the muddy landscape of the films. > <br /> But for those who care, they will head to Alaska, and apparently Alaska was like the Wild West of the 1970s because everyone carries a gun and is rough and saggy. Robert Carradine says fascinating things like "I hope we can find a shower, my nuts really hurt". (And that's the one with Melanie Griffith!) They are quickly robbed and forced to take a job, and the local bigwig, their employer, moves on to Melanie and eventually dismisses Desi for not being corrupt. At that moment they are not intelligent and do not leave the city, opting instead to eat food for dogs or for hunger, to be beaten by the boys, and then take a ride in the car. The final part of the film leaves the evil bigwig while the trio commits a robbery, goes on the run and opens up a kidnapping scheme, and so on. The film is just kind of an end, annoyingly and ambiguously, but since they didn't bother to have much development and storylines, first of all, it's quite appropriate. It is worth a look if you are really interested in the low cost 70s rate, but in the end it is really to forget.
