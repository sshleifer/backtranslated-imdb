I had high hopes for this film. I even gave up on an evening of watching Stargate for this movie. I discovered that he had a hurried feeling and many of the key moments and facts in the Bible were missing. I might be a little tired and spoiled for the 1956 version, since I've seen one every year for the last 20 years. I doubt this will do it in the realm of the annual classic, as the other has. If you haven't seen the 19546 version, you might like this one, but I seriously doubt it and urge you to skip this and rent or buy the classic one. This has some elegant special effects but that's not what I'm looking for when I say a movie like the Ten Commandments. I was trying to see how they told the story, and the writers didn't do a good job with it.
