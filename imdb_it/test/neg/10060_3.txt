This film is on my list of the worst movies ever made. The story is disconnected and it is difficult to understand what is happening or the reason for the actions of the characters. All films must have an internal logic, and this film does not have it - the story makes no sense. <br /> <br /> To see Faye Dunaway, Christopher Plummer and Diana Quick wasting their talent on this film is a crime. Faye Dunaway is the lucky one, because she plays the victim and is killed at the beginning of the film. On the other hand, Donald Sutherland must be a fantastic actor because he manages to look good despite bad direction and bad writing; his performance is credible and manages to remain in the character despite everything. <br /> <br /> If Dame Agatha Christie were alive, she would die laughing! The film is so bad!
