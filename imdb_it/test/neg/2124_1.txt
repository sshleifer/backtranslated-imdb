There's really not much to say about this. It's really, really bad. The acting is bad, the script is bad and the editing is probably one of the worst jobs ever. It is so sloppy and choppy that it only serves to confuse the public. There is nothing to talk about plot, mostly it's a really fake monstrous fish that attacks Europeans trying to pass themselves off as Americans. Move on to this.
