I'm not going to waste my time with in-depth analysis, I'm just saying that I'm extremely disappointed that Catherine Zeta-Jones made the mistake of being in the lead role in this absurd, nonsensical, in this full of boring clichés Pathetic carefree death in the making of movies! It makes no sense to try to find the positive sides of this film, because overall it is poor in every single way, and the saddest thing is that Zeta-Jones is so intransigently dragged into clichés, that he has absolutely no chance of even showing '1% of his talent! <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie even with the opportunity to spend the night at home starring at the wall !!!
