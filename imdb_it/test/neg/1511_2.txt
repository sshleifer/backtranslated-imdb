(As a note, I would like to say that I saw this film in my annual church camp, where the whole youth group laughed at it. I bought it when I saw it on a shelf a year later, if only for the humor Derived from a bad attempt to make an evangelical film. <br /> <br /> Lay it Down does not meet the expectations of many film enthusiasts on different levels.Most of the problems lie within the impersonal acting. Regardless of the beautiful cars in the film, or the truth in Christ's sacrifice for you, as a tool for film and film witnesses, Lay it Down barely offers. <br /> <br /> The most positive opinions of films are supported by Christians who accept the message. While it is easy for a Christian to agree with the points given, the public hardly ever witnesses life outside of a clich√©. The fight scene between Ben and his brother is horribly nicknamed. there are at least three brazen r efusi in subtitles. <br /> <br /> I encourage anyone to watch the film a second time with the director's comment. It really helps you understand why the film was written as it was. The director's opinions on secular society are practically opposed to those that could satisfy the needs of a filmmaker: it shows a pedantic understanding of non-Christians, as well as some points of religious conflict; most of the editing, he admits, was rushed, but "satisfying"; he thought that the transitions and themes used too were effective; and was completely satisfied with the acting. <br /> <br /> He also included motifs of which he was quite proud: -All (read: most) names are significant. Ben Destin = "destined", Gus Pelman = "Gospel Man", Nicky D = Nicodemus. -The machine that makes the donuts is the symbol of the circulating nothing that is a life without Christ. -When Ben leaves Pete's bike, he crosses the crutches to form a "cross". <br /> <br /> I'm not doing any of these. Throw around things like that saying: while street drivers and the like "blow their brains out with guns", and how "God has control when you were born and when you die". Yes, that wasn't a typo. He really says it. <br /> <br /> I have (small) forgiveness reserved for this film. The "fantastic cars" and the "good message" do not make jacks to make this movie good. However, the film was made by a group of unprofessional individuals with a budget of less than 1/100 of "The Fast and the Furious", and the time limit was ruthless. With that in mind, I give him a score of 2/10, instead of the 1/10 I think so deservedly.
