After watching the TV commercials for this film, I marched to my local cinema expecting lots of laughs. In the end it was one of the longest 90 minutes I've ever spent. The Wog Boy failed to provide a plot with enough substance to maintain my interest and the predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes do not fill this void. <br /> <br /> A scene in which the two "Wog Boys" dominate the dancefloor of their local disco was the only one that impressed me. The only character worth looking at was "Nathan", played by Stephen Curry of The Castle, his fight with the opposite sex that provides most of the few laughs. <br /> <br /> A word for this flic is boring. Save time and watch the TV commercial while only the laughter is shown.
