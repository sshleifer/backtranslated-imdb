Paranoid Park talks about Alex, a 16-year-old skater who causes death, even accidentally, to a security guard. As the film continues, Alex faces small problems like his parents' divorce and the sexual warmth of his girlfriend Jennifer (played by Taylor Momsen who you can currently see on Gossip Girl) while being consumed with guilt. I've only seen one of Gus Van Sant's films so far, Elephant, and I can assure you that he kept all his mannerisms while doing this. Once again he has been through time. Once again he uses strange shooting techniques such as the endless shots of people walking ... maybe you like these shooting techniques, I know not. The plot seems unsatisfactory ... it's almost easy to explore for so long. The feeling I get (the same with Elephant) is that Gus Van Sant tries too hard to make an "artistic" film that makes the film lose its substance. Even Gabe Nevins was as bad as Alex, there is a difference between looking alienated or detached and looking like a robot. If you are a fan of Mr. Sant Sant then look at this, otherwise jump. <br /> <br /> 3/10
