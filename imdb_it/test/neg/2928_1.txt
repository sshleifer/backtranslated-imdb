Can this film be considered a film? Imagine the situation: someone puts a comfortable video camera on a tripod and faces a walk on the sea and films people walking or jogging along it. Then he puts the camera on a beach, buys ducks in a pet shop, opens their cages and lets them run in front of the camera. Later, he only films the surface of the water and the sound of birds and insects in absolute darkness. Is it an experiment or just an insult to public intelligence? What would happen if an unknown director made a film like that? Would we mark his work with 10? I always disappoint filmmakers who believe they can do whatever they want once they become famous.
