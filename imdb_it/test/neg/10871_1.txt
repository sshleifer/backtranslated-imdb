Larry Bishop directs, writes and guides this soft porn core, plotting less motorcycle movies on anything to do with anything. Calling it one of the worst movies of 2008 is being nice to the trash I spent while I was in the movies. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I am especially sorry for the girls, who probably think they are about to make a feature film when they actually do porn. They walk on the set for four days, they say a few sexual jokes to disgusting old men - thirty years older than them - then they take off their clothes and walk around naked for the four days they are on set. I can only assume that this was only for Larry Bishops. See shoot after shooting directly at a girls ass. Shot after shooting Bishop, he approached a casual girl and grabbed her most intimate parts, as if she were shaking hands. The way this shit has been funded is outside of me. Because Tarantino has his name on it it's beyond me, but it's slowly fading away since 1994, so I can't say I'm surprised. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes, you have the terrible feeling that only horrible (and I mean horrible) movies give you. When you see it in theaters, the pain you feel is amplified. After 15 minutes, I wanted to cry to be so stupid and wasteful, not just my time, but my hard earned ten dollars. There is no redeemable quality, or a moment in the film that creates any kind of reaction or shows any inclination that these people have had an idea of ​​what they are doing. If you don't see all those naked women often, then I guess this movie is for you. If you're eleven, you'll probably like it. You can't even laugh about it, because every idiot who did it was laughing at the crap they were doing. The acting is horrible, the writing is horrible, the production is horrible and the direction is terrible. It is not even worth it to rent it to see the traffic accident. Stay away, stay far away. You shouldn't even read these reviews. I shouldn't even write one.
