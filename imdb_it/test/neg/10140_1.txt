Reba sucks. It sucks. Talk about this horrible country singer who attempts comedy. They could also call this "generic" show, because that's what it is. It's stupid and generic. Reba, you're not funny, and I'm glad your delayed show has been canceled because you suck, and so is Brock, Barbra Jean, the red-haired teenager, that jockey boy and the twelve-year-old who was silenced. You suck, and none of you is fun. Oh, and I heard a rumor that Reba is actually a worshiper of the gay devil who idolizes Hitler and tortures animals. And he puts subliminal messages in his show and in his "music" in the hope of getting their parents killed and killing themselves! But it was just a voice. Anyway, this is the worst show ever, Reba is gay, I don't like it, I think The Office is better than this show, and this show sucks.
