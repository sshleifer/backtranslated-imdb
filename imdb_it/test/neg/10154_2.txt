my friend and I rented this a few nights ago. and, I must say, this is the single best film I've ever seen. I mean, woah! "Friend, it's better to make some beer before this cover closes" and "friend, Linda is not wearing a bra again." what a poem! woah! and it's also a wonderful original film. I mean, you don't usually find a slasher where every single murder is exactly the same. I mean, exactly! now it's originality. and almost all the transitions between the scenes are these fantastic close-ups of the psycho in the ER scrubs. how cool! the acting is so wonderful. dad was just brilliant. must have studied REAL DADS before shooting. and how many movies do you find that simply don't make any sense? not many. but this is one of those gems. I mean, how nice is it that a guy waited outside for six hours to make a joke while his friends were both inside? it's really strong on the whole I would say that this is the single biggest movie of the genre, indeed, in the world! *****
