The One is a show with a very appropriate name, especially because it is close to being the only network broadcast in prime time that barely more than one person is watching. <br /> <br /> When I first heard of The One, I thought to myself "Weee !! Another singsong show! We don't have enough of those!" and then proceeded to gird the helmet and run around the house, striking the head with blunt objects and sharp angles. Because in all honesty, the constant pain and suffering throughout the year inflicted by the fact of having only one or two realities based on "talent" running is not enough. We needed another one. And not just someone - "THE" One. The one with slightly less attractive competitors with a little less talent. The one with a little less than a point, although it is difficult to imagine a scenario where this is possible. The one with the useless filming of competitors when they don't perform included. Because I'm interested in what Johnny Sings-a-lot does in his free hours! I really do it! Now, you might think, "Hey! In the whole North American continent, less than 4 million people have seen the first episode. Does that mean the show sucks?" Well, to this I say that less than 4 million people in North America have syphilis, so sometimes low numbers bring good news now don't they? Think about it. <br /> <br /> In the end, The One could be horribly unoriginal, a show that even the broadcasting network could not be bothered to promote because they too realize how absolutely useless it is, but it is still not the syphilis! Yay!
