Two little girls reach a friendship. One tries to convince the other that she is a witch. The other is a pushover that bends to the will of the witch. The film drags back and forth with the useless interaction between the two girls, with many dramatic cuts in which they pose "shocking" questions. You know, kind little kids shouldn't ask, like, "How do you make a deal with the devil"? Oooh ... creepy. <br /> <br /> In the end, the pushover is tired of being controlled by his wizard friend. His belief that his friend is a witch leads to a tragic end. But when it arrives, you don't care at all. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that this film may have frightened a very religious Mexican spectator of the 1960s, but it doesn't hold even a fascinating relic. It simply drags on. That's boring. It is useless. No need to look. <br /> <br /> There are many here who have many positive things to say about their knowledge of the other works of the director and, of course, of the common denominator that everyone says about useless films: "Ah, cinematography is wonderful ! " Those reviewers probably have a point. But for those who have found this film without any knowledge, to those who do not care about his "photography", his "atmosphere" or his ... anything else he has - for these spectators, therefore, who only want a * good * movie that will entertain them for an hour and a half, do yourself a favor, folks: <br /> <br /> Jump.
