Probably not the same version as most other reviewers because there is no real hard core sex. What do people mean by hard core sex? The kind of hard core sex explicit in movies with Traci Lords and "Big" John Holmes? Well, in any case this is really a poor movie, I doubt that I've ever seen so many big name actors wasted on a movie. The script is really scarce and without plot, the direction and the cinematography are horrible and the editing doesn't exist. It's really an absolutely horrible movie. You could see it ten times and still not understand what the hell it is. The only memorable scene is one in which people are buried up to their necks and a giant lawn mower arrives and beheads them. Yes, you read that right, a film set in Roman times has a scene with a head that cuts the giant giant lawn mower! <br /> <br /> Trivia point. Many years ago a pirated copy of THE THING (1982 version) was making the rental round on my island and was copied on a CALIGULA rental tape which means that the pirated version of LA COSA starts with the first few seconds of CALIGULA man and woman who walks through the forest begins the sequence of the title of WHAT. This led the people who saw the pirate tape to believe that the forest scene was the opening of John Carpenter's 1982 film and they were very confused about what it meant. Well, that's what you get for hiring pirated videos. But after seeing all of CALIGULA, I don't know what it means
