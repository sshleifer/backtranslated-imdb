Some movies look and you say "Well, it didn't make sense". And you don't really mean it. You're just saying that things were overly complicated or slightly meaningless. <br /> <br /> "Bread And Circus" makes no sense. And I'm serious. And this is not because it is surreal. From the beginning, it is quite clear that it is a weak excuse to make special effects splatter. There is no script. There is no plot. There is no story of any kind. An event does not lead to the next one - that's how fundamental the bad writing here is. <br /> <br /> So what? I mean, there are tons of movies out there that fall into that category. They want to show you blood, they give you blood. Why not even talk about it? <br /> <br /> Because, in this case, "Bread and circus" gave me hope. Ok, there are some surreal elements. Vaginas, in the earth - people crawling out of them. The earth, in space, two legs on both sides. These types of images are wonderful, funny, weird, crazy. But the film does nothing with them. <br /> <br /> It happens, the film ends and it's all very unsatisfactory. I suspect the script was invented on the fly. Sin. If there had been ANY story of ANY type, it would have made a much more fun movie. <br /> <br /> The film is very similar to the beautiful car you would like to own. Then lift the hood and there is no engine. Only a small man who sells a bicycle. <br /> <br /> GRR!
