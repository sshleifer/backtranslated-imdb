Presumably, director William Shatner had a very 'darker' film in mind when it came to 'Star Trek V: The Final Frontier', but Paramount's seeds, looking at the huge box office receipts taken by his humorous predecessor, he insisted that the new movie also has a lot of laughs. So what we get is probably the weakest and most clumsy of the six Star Trek films with the original cast. There are plenty of bad ideas, and some good ones, and if you are in a charitable mood, you can watch "The Final Frontier" in the same way that you would make such an episode of the TV series. On the plus side, Laurence Luckenbill is a good actor and offers one of the best guest star performances in any Star Trek, big or small screen, ranking right there with William Windom's Commodore Decker. His portrait of Sybok, Spock's half brother, constantly raises the film when he threatens to sink, which happens too often. Charles Cooper is also as good as the fat old Klingon General Korrd; pity that his role is not as big as he is. If the story of Shatner's intentions is true, then I owe him an apology, because I was ready to blame for the incessant stupidity and the unconvincing action scenes at his director's feet. The reason is that I always thought that, of all the Trek regulars, Shatner was the least "tuned" in everything that makes Star Trek working and what makes it special for his fans. Having read his memoirs about Trek, it is very clear to me that he considered the show another series of actions and adventures that has just had a science fiction setting. He preferred the vision of Gene Coon to that of Gene Roddenberry; Coon was known for his work on the popular western series, "The Wild Wild West". Shatner also hinted that his favorite Star Trek episode was "A Piece of the Action", a stupid second season episode written by Coon. So, in the end was given the opportunity to direct a Star Trek movie, would Shatner not follow his instincts and produce an action-packed film with a lot of ironic humor? Well, someone did it, because it was called "The Final Frontier". Shatner himself definitely returns to form The Great Ham and, as Leonard Maltin points out, the film suffers from a bad case of "the cutes". In the opening scene at Yosemite National Park, it's hard to say which is worse, the super-poor special effects or the diabolical dialogue. The jokes around the equipment malfunction on the Enterprise have come all the way from "Wrath of Khan" and from this, Trek's fifth film, have thrown themselves to the ground. So he has the idea of ​​a 'skeleton crew'. A new development is an apparent romantic relationship between Scotty and Uhura and suffice it to say that one does not exactly perceive the flame of passion that burns between the two. It is a useless subplot and adds nothing. The climate scene in which 'God' is encountered does not add much; although this was a good idea in the first place it is debatable, but the scene itself doesn't make much sense. (The abilities of the creature of "God" seem to vary according to what is needed at the moment.) About half of this is a tired reconstruction of the climax of "The Search for Spock". Leonard Nimoy manages to save Spock's integrity, even as he sucks at phrases like Spock like "Take a hold on yourself, Doctor." And DeForest Kelley, as usual, surpasses Shatner and Nimoy; he really became an actor in the final Trek movies. So this Trek release is not terrible, it just isn't very good. There had to be another movie from the original Trek cast before the baton was passed to the "next generation", and it was much better suited to this task than "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier".
