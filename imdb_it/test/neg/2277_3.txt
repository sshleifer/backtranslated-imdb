Soap work boring and absolutely predictable. Mary Tyler Moore is married to Ted Danson who has an affair with Christine Lahti. Moore is a friend of Lahti and doesn't know about the scam. Danson dies in an accident and Lahti is pregnant with her child. YAWN! <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to admit that I paid to see him in a theater in 1986. I liked all three stars, but even their remarkable talents could not make it. CONSTANTLY I knew what was going to happen. As another poster said - this sounds like a PG Lifetime movie. <br /> <br /> It makes Lahti talk nonstop at some point and even Moore goes wild once! Also there are a useless series of topless women playing soccer (!!!). In addition to this it is suitable for TV. The only good thing about this was Timothy Gibbs who played Moore and Danson's teenage son. A very nice and pretty good actor. Apart from that there is nothing to recommend. You've seen it before ... and done better. Obviously it has been forgotten. Salta.
