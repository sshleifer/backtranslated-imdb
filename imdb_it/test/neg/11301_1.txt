Hollywood has produced yet another garbage that is wildly overwhelmed and disappointing for the first time. Hannibal is bad, terrible, inept, lame, funny, idiotic, invented, ridiculous and absolutely atrocious (no pun intended). Minor spoilers follow ... <br /> <br /> This film has huge logical holes - more than any Bruckheimer / Bay movie - or anything else - any film that exemplifies the indulgence of Hollywood exaggeration. It is a perfect Hollywood production to cash in on the Hannibal Lector craze, directed by Ridley Scott, director of "so overbearing-so-too-too-serious", produced by an incisive Italian producer with an inflated ego whose belief is " it matters if the film is s ** t, the money is good ". <br /> <br /> I cannot overcome the fact that acclaimed screenwriters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote this lame adapted tripe and a pretentious book by a good novelist, hack author, Thomas Harris. David and Steven - well known and immensely talented screenwriters - have wasted their efforts on a poor screenplay in exchange for fat paychecks. Another factor in the disappointment of this film. <br /> <br /> There are too many ridiculous scenes to list that are laughable in a clumsy execution and in a poor logic, eg. Mobile Starling / Pazzi in the midst of the pursuit of Lecter which makes Inspector Pazzi the victim. Not to mention evil jokes dialogues Tony Hopkins uttered with a grin and Julianne Moore, Ray Liotta and others who can't act with a straight face. Hopkins gives the true meaning of "scenario-chewing" along with Gary Oldman's acting as a deformed psychopath bent on the alleged revenge against Lecter. <br /> <br /> The effect of the blood is good, but serves only to reject rather than provide suspense which is particularly absent from Hannibal. The predecessor - Silence of the Lambs - is more credible with tension and suspense. The suspense is what made Silence of the Lamb a spectacular mix of psychological horror and thriller, not to mention superbly written and tense. The "brain dinner" sequence is so ridiculously false that it borders on self-parody. <br /> <br /> The ending is a bit blatant and idiotic - should we believe that Lecter is still a threat to society with the last shot establishing his sparkling eye is staring at you? Ooh, scary ... <br /> <br />
