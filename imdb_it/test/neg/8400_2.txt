I really wanted that I liked this movie, especially after all the buzz I heard around us. But unfortunately it didn't work for me. Paranoid Park suffers from the same disappointment as Lost In Translation - If you use very limited dialogues, be heavy in slow-motion close-ups and concentrate on pieces of fabric in the setting, then your story will magically appear deep and reflective. <br /> <br /> Much of the plot, if you can find a plot, of this film is artificial. I was not impressed by the fact that the confessional 'write it all' is the way the main character deals with the incident - So what should we believe? He grew up happily forever and wrote a book about his experiences, so was it confirmed for that terrible incident? <br /> <br /> What I suspect should be a film that evokes empathy for a young man who is without direction and facing an impossible moral dilemma, instead creates a portrait of a future sociopathic personality. He has no connection with anyone around him, and at the end of the film he has no sense of what is right or wrong. He has no management at home and does not feel anything for his friends. What we have is a portrait of a non-person, a spirit that merely goes through life while making its way onto his skateboard. I don't try at all for him, and honestly I wish he had been caught. The whole film is not centered on his feelings of guilt, but on how he intends to avoid punishment and / or responsibility for a wrong decision. Not only can he get away with it, he finds a way to subtly rationalize it. A scary and negative message, the suggestion of which is that many of our young people are so disconnected from the just and the double that they simply make the rules as they go forward, using themselves for good or evil. I find an insult to tricks for today's youth, and the director's pretentious arrogance drips densely with every step of the past and overhanging. <br /> <br /> (He killed the guard, but if you blink your eyes you miss them, whether it was an act of mercy or not it's hard to say - he may have been so mortified as to challenge his skateboard. When he runs to the security guard's car, one of his skateboard wheels is stained with blood.)
