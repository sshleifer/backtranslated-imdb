It seems that some of the previous reviewers have seen another movie compared to what I saw earlier tonight ... Actually, this movie is the reason I registered on IMDb. Surely Bobbie Phillips can "fight" and for this I give this film a 2, but the rest of this film is just pure shit ... Acting is bad, the plot is bad, the camera angles are bad, and the effects are bad. Of course, the actors are in good physical shape, but they can't act! Sometimes I like to watch bad movies for laughter, but this movie had no charm and after watching this movie I was full of regrets for having seen it. Of course, if you'd like to see mediocre fights without anything else, then this movie is for you. If not, then stay away from this movie! PS: We apologize for any spelling mistakes ... I'm just tired of this movie!
