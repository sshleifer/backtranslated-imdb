Bled begins when the young female artist Sai (Sarah Ferooqui) meets a mysterious but fascinating man named Renfield (Jonathan Oldham) and ends up in his studio apartment where he gives her the bark of a kind of tree that is used as a hallucinogen when dissolved. Sai hooks up quickly while being taken to an alternative fantasy reality involving vampire creatures. The friend of Sai Royce's photographer (Chris Ivan Cevic) worries about her as she walks away from reality as she becomes addicted to drugs, may Royce kick the drug or end up ruining her life and why the mysterious Renfield has made her become addicted to things in the first place and do the elaborate fantasy dream how travel have meaning? <br /> <br /> Co-produced and directed by Christopher Hutson this anty arty Vampire movie is practically 95 minutes of boredom and is completely worthy of all the negative comments. The script was written by the very interesting Sxv'leithan Essex (how the hell is it pronounced even in this case?) Who is also credited as a set designer and his unusual name is actually more interesting than anything that ever happens to Bled, I would say that the producers have decided to create a very serious fantasy horror film with a strong moral message about the dangers of drugs, drug addiction and date rape drugs. Most of the film is spent on the drug issue with Sai's initial introduction to the drug, how great it was the first time and how she became hopelessly addicted that will eventually destroy her life and her lives. friends. It is never explained where it continues to take this drug since Renfield only gives her a little during their first meeting but hey, who cares? Bled's first twenty minutes are really boring and boring, the next hour isn't much better before a final ten-minute chaos involving a vampire monster and Renfield reappearing. The moral elements are condescending, the elements of fantasy seem an afterthought and the horror does not exist. There is also dialogue that is terrible, each sentence tries to be profound, has a lot of hidden depth and just tries to have so much meaning that it becomes boring to listen. <br /> <br /> The concept of the film is terrible, as is the execution, since there is absolutely no violence or violence to speak of and the whole thing is set in an apartment that seems to have no lights. The fantasy setting looks a little better but is poorly seen and underused. There is no fear here, no atmosphere and to make matters worse the creators have decided to use very faded soft colors that I hate and find annoying, what's wrong with a nice colored picture? It seems to me to be a fashion with current directors who seem to think that they automatically make a cool film or add an atmosphere that surely doesn't make, most of the time it makes your movie a bit monotonous, as highlighted here with Bled. <br /> <br /> This one probably has a low budget and was shot in Los Angeles and has reasonable production values, but it's all so boring. Acting didn't impress me, I didn't care about anyone who's never a good sign. <br /> <br /> Bled is a terrible vampire movie that goes for psychological and physical horror with all sorts of parallels with real life hollowed out and what it can do little or no effect because the whole thing is so boring. There may be an audience for a film like this, but considering the other comments not so great.
