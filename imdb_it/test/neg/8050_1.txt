"Son, you have to interrupt the experiments I started !!" Too bad no one has even said this to anyone who has enlightened this green project !! I was almost literally dragged into this movie by a friend of mine for a midnight showing when we were in high school. Now, a midnight movie in a high school Friday night, you don't expect much, but come on !! And after reviewing it years later, I support my original opinion. Great special effects but what !! Most likely one of the worst films ever made. Unless you like blood and courage and see some Hollywood vets (Steiger & Hunter) make fun of themselves for a dollar. HOW DISGUSTING!!!
