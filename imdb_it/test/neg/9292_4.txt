You might be interested to know that BARRICADE was seen as a failure by the studio and set aside for a year before the popularity of ALICE FAYE reached such a high level that the studio decided to release the film despite it was never completed. Faye is referring to a murder at her nightclub in New York City - and this scene was actually in the script and it was the way the film should start. Instead, it is completely absent and what could have been an exciting sequence (including a complete number of Faye songs) has never been shot. However, the rest of the story is practically intact and has made it possible for the film to be released in 71 minutes. <br /> <br /> A tired BAXTER WARNER is too old to be believable as Faye's romantic interest and is simply as superficial as the broken reporter. Today the public would be offended by the representation of the Chinese using fractured English phrases like "I like making noise". Key Luke is one of the Chinese loyalists, but he plays his role in a simple and direct way. Arthur Treacher is almost invisible and gets the fourth billing on the screen due to changes in the story. Originally, Joseph Schildkraut had a role in the film, but his part was eliminated. <br /> <br /> A jumble of a movie that will serve as entertainment only for the most difficult fans of Alice Faye who will get a chance to see her in a dramatic role - even if weak. Charles Winninger is totally wasted as a kind man who runs the American consulate. <br /> <br /> Despite all the weaknesses, there are a couple of scenes involving tight escapes that are actually reproduced and Karl Freund's black and white photography is top notch.
