The only reason I bought the DVD was to satisfy my curiosity for the scene when Liz (Kim Basinger) strips for Joe Cocker's music: You can leave your hat! This was the best part of the whole movie. Not because the scene was good; just the song. I'm not saying it was a terribly bad film, but not so good. Especially when the exploration of male and female sexuality may have been expanded. Instead of expanding on the dangerous side of lust, obsession and infatuation and where it can lead her to drag her heels darkly from one idea to another. For example, when John (played by Rourke) is able to leave her at the top of Big Wheel, Liz (Kim Basinger) is baffled by John's bizarre experience of humor, but less shocked by his sexual adventures involving the ever wanting Liz; and as a reader mentioned, that for a woman to enjoy sex must experience the dangerous side is not convincing. This "dangerous" side is not sufficiently exploited in the film and there is a sense of anti-climax from the point of view that everything could go terribly wrong. The theme of slavery often makes its appearance but it only brings one to the brink of danger and then all is well. The film conveys the message that this type of "foreplay" is FINE! If the film was taking into consideration the pitfalls of slavery and, by extension, the ugly ramifications of sadomasochism, then perhaps it would be a good moral point. Instead the film awkwardly jumps from a "sizzling" scene by Rourke nursing Basinger and the bandage to another. In a film that could have been good, it fell on his face because he did not expand and extend the themes that the film is MAYBE trying to relate; so for me it doesn't have a plot or a theme just a mixture of ideas.
