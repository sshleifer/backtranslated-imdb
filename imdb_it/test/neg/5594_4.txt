First of all, the first thing that came to my mind after finishing this movie last night was "Why the 8MM 2 title?", Because I saw the first one obviously, and what it had to do with the plot of the first film? The only thing that was similar was the fact that the couple had to enter the porn industry and that it wasn't even necessary in the plot, because after seeing the ending that I didn't want to ruin, it didn't really make sense. <br /> <br /> A diplomat and his girlfriend are in Hungary and notice a woman swimming naked in the pool area, she is very attractive, so when they see her in a club, they decide to have some fun and have a steaming trio. But things become extremely intense when the diplomat receives photos of everyone in the relationship by post, fearing that he may become public and endanger his career, pay the guy who sent the photos, the diplomat goes mad and "kills" the boy, bringing in a murder case. He and his fiacee decide to find the girl with whom they had the relationship, but things get darker and deeper as they go deeper into what they got themselves into. <br /> <br /> What could have been a real thriller, shot in an unexplained film and not well thought out, which was sad. As I said, the title has nothing to do with the first, so we don't believe it. It's just a sexual thriller that doesn't make sense, but it's only good for those nights, because frankly this is one of those movies where it's so close to porn that it could even be labeled as a soft core. <br /> <br /> 4/10
