28 years before September 11, there was another 9/11 that represented a key date in the history of Chile, South America and the whole world. It was the date of 1973 when a bloody coup d'Ã©tat in Chile deposed Salvador Allende, the first democratically elected Marxist president anywhere in the world and ended the Chilean experiment of democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. Allende committed suicide when the military attacked the presidential palace. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this film is too biased and too nostalgic about the time of Allende's domination to be an objective representation of man and his place in history. The times were troubled and Allende was a controversial figure in the history of his country and the whole world. True, he was democratically elected, but his policies have plunged Chile into the economic crisis. He was deposed by a coup and a right-wing dictatorship followed by repression and flagrant violations of human rights, but he was also an ally of Castro who saw in his policies another way of making a revolution. We will never know if his attempt to build a socialist and democratic society would have succeeded. The film's authors take a completely pro-Allende stance, there is no opinion or point of view that tries to explain the other part, to answer questions such as why the middle class opposes him, or how his democratic views could go with support or be supported by Castro. The tone of the comments is nostalgic and apologetic, almost propagandistic. People who want to better understand this episode of history must wait for a more balanced and objective film or book in the future.
