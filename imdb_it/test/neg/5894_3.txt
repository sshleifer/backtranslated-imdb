We will never know the truth about 9/11. And this poor movie proves it. <br /> <br /> I recently saw a YouTube report stating that there are no planes involved in the destruction of the Twin Towers; that all the newscasts were supposedly equipped with shots of the same corner of the Towers from a mysterious source (probably the gubmint?), and in the sense that the CGI movies had been replaced with the MISSILES of real life that actually hit the towers .... <br /> <br /> It's a compelling video, and although I'm not a Wacko conspiracy theologian by itself, I'm still not sure of myself if real planes hit anything that day (the Towers, the field of Shanksville, the Pentagon) - because there is no aerial wreck available. (And what about those infamous "black boxes"? No one has recovered.) A million other theories abound, all of which court a drop of Truth flooded in an ocean of speculation. But you will drown in Malarkey before finding something truthful or worth speculating in THE REPORT OF 9/11, a film without a budget that is trying to close the barn door after all the horses and jihadists have fled. <br /> <br /> Scriptwriter and director Leigh Scott is obviously a worried American citizen who wanted to enlighten the public about what the 560-page report could reveal. It would be useful if his film had actors, instead of a guy who looks like David Duchovny, a chick who looks like Gina Gershon, a guy who thinks he's Russell Crowe and another guy I'm pretty sure he's trying to become Sean Bean . It would help if your operator did not have Parkinson's disease; if the lighting manager wasn't trying to save on electricity; it would help if his publisher did not have Attention Deficit Disorder, or if the soundtrack was not some esoteric new endless world order; and the cycle should probably have been inserted when people were actually moving their mouths. <br /> <br /> We can't even call this propaganda. It's too fun and for fun, I mean unwatchable. <br /> <br /> You can't squeeze this complex into a two-hour movie, but Leigh Scott tries anyway, including all those sexy phrases that made us grow to: bin Laden's intention to attack, buy weapons from Somalia, non-aggression agreement with Iraq, Mussawi who attended flight school, weapons of mass destruction ... <br /> <br /> The problem is: we know it's all retrospective, so every discussion that concerned intelligence workers have with one another smacks of hindsight false in an orderly chat. Like ingenious reverse engineering, all that is relevant is briefly mentioned so that we can shake our heads in wonder at how incompetently all these branches of the government have messed up. <br /> <br /> There is a ridiculous interrogation scene with a lubricating baby beating a guy with tomato sauce on his face. Now - this would be considered a torture if most guys didn't consider it an ignition. <br /> <br /> The slogan is: "What if the attack could have been stopped?" According to the report of this film - and, we assume, according to the Commission report - the CIA and other clandestine agencies were all set up to capture bin Laden and did not do so. All those involved in reports on "terrorism" (do you mean that you really read these reports?) Are so worried that we just want to slap them for their bad acting. <br /> <br /> However, the whole story is much deeper than the banal sound of the negligent Ku Bush Klan took over the American people after 9/11. We now know that even capturing bin Laden before the September 11th attack would not have changed or achieved anything - the wheels were moving with or without that Taliban nominee whose involvement was the possible invention of someone's fevered imagination to join the America against a common enemy. Contrary to popular belief, "they" did not "attack". As Ron Paul tried to clarify, it was a case of Middle Eastern backlash - "they" were so tired that America planted their unfaithful "down there" feet that brought the war "here". So even if George W. Death likes to say the absurdity, "We are fighting them there and so we won't have to fight them here", actually "Because we're down there, the fight was brought here". <br /> <br /> The 9/11 attack was not so much about the intricate terrorist planning as the Bush administration's gross negligence, which we know (without the Commissions poll) had all the information from the 'Clinton administration on; information on terrorist cells reaching critical mass and their intent to cause chaos. But the Texas Idiot Oil, who refused to read his Daily Briefings and would rather spend their holidays on his Crawford ranch than to spend an extra day at work, repealed the duty he swore to show - protecting the American public. <br /> <br /> And then the scum who proclaimed herself president used the attacks caused by her negligence as a political hammer against her own stupid peasants to make a second mandate, destroy the American Constitution and bring America in a Fake War based on a lie (WMD), with a country that had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks. Strangely, the film never walks near the Ku Bush Klan, offering no opinion or judgment, Leigh Scott who wants to remain neutral. Tell hundreds and thousands of rapists raped in the Fake War on Terror in Iraq. <br /> <br /> By coincidence, I realized that I was watching this DVD while wearing my "Bush lied. Thousands died". T-shirt.
