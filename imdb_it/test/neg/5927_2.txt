Yes, life has the habit of making male species stupid. And this soap opera isn't kidding when they make Perry King, presumably a reputed doctor, unable to see the evil that surrounds him. Put your trust in doctors, eh? How can someone not see what's happening? Is he so stupid? And the bad wife, with a face like a horse, goes around killing her entire family without a trace. How do you get all the drugs? This is not explained. How can you become a secretary in a hospital without any credentials? I imagine the director, Don FauntLeRoy, asks us to believe it. I didn't. I kept yelling in front of the screen for King's stupidity with everything in front of him. If the wife was so attractive, maybe, just maybe, I'd accept it. But she isn't even that. Shannon Sturges is the perfect wife and I tell you she has the face of a horse. I wouldn't cross the street for her, yet our perfect husband does it quickly. After all the cast actors were knocked out, I was not satisfied with the result of pence given to our luxury. She deserved more than her. William Moses plays the doctor's brother who unfortunately knows his outcome from day one. Nice to see at least one pretty face in this clinker. Lesley Anne Down's. She gives the movie a 2 count just for the relief of seeing someone going to look in this mess. Perry King deserved his fate. What an idiot.
