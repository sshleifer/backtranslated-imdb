This interpretation of "Noah's Ark" has made Hallmark's (and Turner's) reputation around 100 years. However, the production has its positive side ... a learning experience for neophyte film entrepreneurs in "How not to make a film" <br /> <br /> where in the annals of biblical literature and common sense can be find these quotes and situations: <br /> <br /> "Ok, guys, let's get in the saddle." "Too bad that God created the sun to shine only during the day when we really needed it during the night." "We're not kissing ... we're just whispering each other in the mouth". <br /> <br /> Lumber for the Ark building with "Georgia Pacific" printed on it. Metal nails Children flying kites. A street vendor (as can James Coburn sleep after) sell Chinese hats. Pirates attack a wooden ark, which they wish to capture, with flaming fireballs fired from the catapults. Glass wine bottles (Noah was in a state of continuous inhibition, it was a miracle that he could see the Ark let alone build it). Lady Godiva (Mary Steenberg with a blonde wig trotting around the Ark on a white horse ... still valued G) Protect the biblical pirates with an iron pan (coated with teflon?). Land on Mount Ararat after crossing the Strait of Hercules. <br /> <br /> etc. Etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> Special effects ... you have to see them in To not believe them. <br /> <br /> The list may continue. This film must not be lost; but if you want the full TV version, you need to call NBC for the screen version ... but only if you agree to absolve NBC of any responsibility for ever airing the thing in the first place. There is only the version expurgated in video stores (no pirate, etc.) ... that is, those video stores that dare to keep it. <br /> <br /> Marvin Cohn <br /> <br />
