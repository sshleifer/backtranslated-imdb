This film earns its 3 for the disgusting writing, poor technical merit and continuity problems. Some people gave this movie a 10 - and maybe it's okay if you're simply scoring it for its fun factor. However, technically this is a serial movie inept from beginning to end - produced by writers, actors and third-rate crew members. This was true for almost all the serials, because they were designed as a low-voice entertainment especially for children. And there's nothing wrong with that, but "high art" isn't !! Spy Smasher earns a score lower than average compared to other serials, because it is of even lower quality and has MAJOR continuity problems - even for a serial. It was normal for a serial to have a "cliff hanger" - a moment at the end of the episode that seemed like the good guy died but miraculously survived when the next episode began. BUT, in this film, he is much more nosy and ridiculous. You would literally see the hero die in the last episode, but in the next, they shot the scene and showed that he actually DIDN'T die (even though they clearly showed him to buy the farm in the last one)! More and more times in SPY SMASH, it seems to die but in the next episode they show it from a different perspective and somehow avoided death - even if it fell for a meter and a half in a river, fell into a circular saw or other. <Br /> <br /> Watch this film not for its quality but for a good laugh or to know how it was to go to the cinema on Saturday morning a few decades ago.
