Something strange is happening in the remote areas of the Arctic. An aviation weather station is found destroyed, its occupants disappear. An Eskimo village is destroyed. A fishing boat disappears. Spying onlookers can be found in the snow. A piece of a four-foot living organism is located near a wrecked plane. The piece resembles the half of the claw of a giant Alaskan crab. The military (Craig Stevens as an officer in the Air Force) and his experts are baffled. A famous scientist (William Hopper) and his gracious assistant (Alix Taltan) are called from New York. Hopper deduces from this inconsistent evidence that they are dealing with a monstrous religious mantis. He's right. The gracious assistant looks out of the office window and sees the hideous face with its bulging eyeballs staring at her. Drop what he's carrying, clap his hands on his cheeks and scream in horror. <br /> <br /> The mantis begins to fly south along the Gulf Stream, stopping from time to time to attack major cities such as Washington and New York to overturn buses and eat people. Military weapons do not affect him much but in the end Stevens crashes into it in his fighter jet and mortally damages the beast, which comes to earth and occupies the "Manhattan Tunnel" that connects New York and New Jersey. <br /> <br /> Stevens, a collision survivor, takes his team into the tunnel and kills the big insect with "3RG mines" despite its ferocious appearance, threatening behavior and shocking roars. Stevens and Taltan kiss in front of the body while Hopper chuckles and takes their picture. <br /> <br /> I have hum. <br /> <br /> Like the deadly mantis itself, the formula at that moment was panting and gasping in the air, floating, looking like prey not human beings but anything in the way of a fresh or original idea. As it is, they have overlooked a clich√©. Hopper should have hurried to invent a Super Duper DDT that, by itself, could defeat the insect. This is what the 3RG mines should have been filled with, rather than the ordinary explosive. <br /> <br /> The work on the model is quite good, considering what the budget must have been. Not much money would have been spent on something else because everything else is rather routine. Craig Stevens is bland, a face and style made for a TV series. William Hopper looks okay - tall and silver-haired - but his instrument has only one note. The pretty assistant is pretty simple considering her role. The part requires Joan Weldon or Laurie Nelson. They could not even act, but carried with them slight but distinct insights into molestation. Whatever would have helped this movie out of his mind. <br /> <br /> I wish the deadly mantis hadn't roared so loud and so often because you can't roar - you can't even whisper - if you don't have lungs I didn't mind though, when the monster met its end in tunnel. A praying mantis is a graceful insect in its thin way and it is nice to have them in the garden because they eat caterpillars and whatever. But when you get there, they're not very attractive. The male mantis is smaller and weaker than the female, as in humans, and when the couple is about to copulate, the female bites her head from the male, even as in humans. But at least human males know when to stop. The male mantis continues to copulate for several minutes even though it is now headless. We humans do not have reckless males who copulate with females determined by the objective. We?
