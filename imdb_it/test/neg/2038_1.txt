Brilliant acting, excellent plot, wonderful special effects! This is what I would say about this movie if I was looking at it with a bag of diarrhea on my head for the whole movie. Instead, I suffered a 2-hour crap-o-rama. Our "brilliant" story begins with some billionaire who has nothing better to do than look in the volcanoes in a vain attempt to find his lucky charm. Instead, find a 5'4 "man in a rubber dinosaur suit and some curious cave people. <br /> <br /> In his infinite wisdom (along with his infinitely large nose) he decides to enter this volcano with a team of "special" people. To travel in this underground land, do they go by plane? No. Barca? No. They use this giant soup with a "solid metal" drill at the end that I swear I saw wobble In summary, this movie it was more fake than ... Oh, it's true! This was the most fake movie I've ever seen! For those of you who haven't seen it and are thinking about sitting down on a Sunday afternoon with this wonderful movie: I'm warning you ! If you watch this movie you should be ready to cut any shred of your manhood and give yourself a complete frontal lobotomy. <br /> <br /> ECCCHHH !! The evaluation system only allows a minimum of 1/10, I give this to -10/10!
