I watched this movie, or part of it, in the hope that it would be fun to laugh at how bad it was, but it soon became clear that it was simply silly. For one you have the worst acting EVER! Lead actress Birgitte Nielsen is terrible, uninspired and unattractive. And it certainly doesn't look like the female warrior who could easily kick some veteran warrior kings, but she does. And what feminist attitude is, it's pure hypocrisy. For one, her family was killed by a woman, then joined a warrior school or something like that to learn how to fight men. Then he joins a fat servant and his child king, whose city was destroyed by Gedren. Those two characters are simply stupid and destroy the little atmosphere that the film has managed to create. After that, I couldn't stand Nielsen's painful acting, and the stupid clich√©s and lack of any real action. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger as Kalidor was the only part of this film that actually made it remotely watchable. <br /> <br /> I liked the Conan movie, but this is pure shit!
