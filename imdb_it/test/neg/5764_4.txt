A group of friends discovers the gold deep in an old mine. But taking the gold and thinking that he had hit it big, a long-dead miner who is the Hell bent to protect his treasure is awakened. "Miner's Massacre" is a cynical extreme b-horror. You have all your family clich√©s, your group of teenagers with intellectual problems, characters who move by themselves to investigate strange noises, some pop loopholes, the mysterious sheriff, the old lady that everyone thinks is crazy (played by top-banked Karen Black no less), and so on. However, it's done in a fun and unpretentious way that makes the movie incredibly fun in a "so bad, it's good" way. The characters and the dialogue are what you would expect from this type of film, familiar, routine and not original. The actors all do a decent job, considering that I've actually seen movies with a higher budget of this type with worse acting (I know what you did last summer, nobody?) And I add a little credibility to the film itself. The villain in this film (The 49'er) is obviously derived from the creeper by Jeepers Creepers, up to the brown coat, the hat and the long white hair. Like the creeper, it never talks, and it's bad to throw away. The gore is somewhat disappointing in my opinion. There are a couple of pretty gruesome moments, but too much is off the screen and the death scenes are often ridiculous (Spoiler ahead!). There is a really hilarious moment in which a girl is beheaded by the aforementioned villain, and to achieve this' effect ', the filmmakers have hidden the actress' body under the coat of the villain, with the bulging head, and put some blood fake on his neck. Seriously, you could see the outline of his shoulders! I think they could have done a little better there, even if the budget was low (and I'm sure it was, but, still ??). The special effects are cheap but sufficiently effective and, for the most part, moderately well-made for a low-budget film. Or the effects, the guys or the director seem to have something for the explosions and the fire. Almost all the scenes towards the end of the film have at least a couple of characters that burn to death (Always filmed in slow motion) or SOMETHING that explodes, whether it's a car or an old cave in the mine. Seriously, no one has ever heard the term; "Stop, drop and roll"!?!?!? <br /> <br /> "Miner's Massacre" (Or "Curse of the forty-nine years old", how come you want to call it) is mischievous and stupid, even if funny, and until you have expectations through the roof, you will be amused enough. <br /> <br /> I feel generous, so I'll give a 4/10.
