It's amazing to me that the best interpretation of this incredible story remains a comic strip made by Walt Disney in the 1940s, but it's true. Here another clumsy attempt spits confuses and aliens would be spectators with admirable effectiveness, while successfully antagonizing those of us who actually read the story. Irving's original work is short for any size and making a feature film is bound to be a challenge. You can completely rewrite the story to Tim Burton, which is a discussion for another time, or dab the old demarcation line with unintended details. The latter is what is attempted here, and if I may say, pitifully so. New imaginative and completely modern facets for personality of the character such as Crane's religious fanaticism or the desire to wander around in the good old Bram Bones ruin the intent of the story and betray a serious lack of talent on the part of the directors. By the time the famous climax of the story approached, I had completely lost interest. It's the kind of movie you expect to see stage smoke in the background.
