Dear SciFi channel: how have you been? How was your summer? I was OK, but I feel that our relationship is no longer the same and we are falling apart. I don't understand why you don't love me anymore. I just finished watching your original SciFi Channel "Skeleton Man" and, once again, you showed a blatant disrespect for my feelings by killing EVERY HOT GIRL IN THIS MOVIE !!! I mean, I understand that you are alone in this for immediate gratification. All you are interested in is producing a film in which people are cut and cut into pieces by a homicidal Indian spirit / creature / legend. So you really don't have the time to put some thought and effort into something else - like finding a Skeleton Man costume that doesn't make Skeletor's gay lover from "He-Man". Seriously, his robe looks like a satin blanket and his skull is as smooth as a child behind, almost like a Halloween-costume-for-a-6-year-old killer as he marches through the desert on a murderous fury. So we throw you a bone, because we are not looking for Oscar-winning performances, intriguing storylines or reactions of realistic characters to situations at hand. Because we realize that even if Michael Rooker, Caspar van Diem and all the girls should be trained as Special Ops agents, they are all mysteriously transformed into Keystone Kops that can't shoot or see straight whenever Skeleton Man appears. And we also expect that nothing - bullets, explosions, electrocution, nothing - can kill Skeleton Man until a minute remains in the film and we need to find a way to tie things in an orderly way. We expect to see blood and courage. But you have a talent for taking the less attractive actress of the entire cast and making her the only surviving female. And honestly, I think you do it just to put me in antagonism. Because this film, as silly as it is, has the potential to be a "bad-is-good" classic and just killing all the hotties ruins everything - and forces me to lower its rating. All I ask is that once, only once, you take my feelings into consideration and let the sexiest girls survive the movie. Please.
