Plot! Rather boring, and they could even shoot it in black and white, it was so colorless. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a scrolling text explaining the cryogenics, and asks if there is God or Satan behind it. There are some protests outside a cryogenics laboratory. Some people rob a bank and many of the thieves and guards are shot. The father of one of the thieves (I believe) organizes the freezing of his son. There is a lot of jumps around from one scene to another introducing characters without us knowing how they relate. <br /> <br /> There is a power failure, and the cannons containing the frozen people are struck by lightning, and they emerge as zombies. They wear silvery coveralls similar to a mylar, and their skin is dark green and wrinkled (it is not known why they are so bad - being frozen obviously has not kept their appearance), and they have silver eyes. They go around killing people, sometimes staggering like zombies, sometimes moving like normal people. <br /> <br /> Linda Blair continues to show up from time to time, for which I am not sure. I think his character works in the cryogenics lab, but it's not very important for the plot, and his role is very small. <br /> <br /> The film ends with some frames stuck with text captions telling us what happened to subsequent characters, who are rather stupid.
