My parents can enjoy this show, but I can't find the humor in it. What's so funny about a dentist who impregnates his assistant hygienist and his eldest daughter impregnated with the captain of the high school football team? Absolutely nothing! Sometimes it's a shock to me what people think is humor nowadays. The fault is that on shows like "The Dating Game" and "The Newlywed Game" they brought the sex issue to the forefront in the mid-1960s. Of course, the series has its touching moments, but it's not an excuse for the content that otherwise went into this series. This is nothing like the family-oriented days of "I Love Lucy" about five decades earlier. <br /> <br /> One answer I would like to know why this series plays on the Lifetime cable channel because the women of that channel think that women can relate to the character of Reba! I absolutely don't like the character of Reba Hart's daughter, Kyra. She is best described as a bumbling and bitter teenager! Funny, I wonder if the actress who played Kyra; Scarlett Pomers is like that in real life far from acting. The ex-husband dentist, Christopher Rich, is not much better. Barbara Jean, played by Melissa Peterman, is a ditsy in herself! Even the characters of Van and Cheyenne are very annoying. <br /> <br /> Something else that baffles me is why the dingbat-of-a-series creator, Allison M. Gibson, has decided to set the series where I live 25 miles away from; Houston, Texas! Reba McEntire isn't even from this state, it's an Oklahoma! Why during a season or more have they decided to make music resound like a snorting pig? What I mean is where we listen to this baritone sax played with drums that accompanies it, but the melodies are basically timeless!
