Okay, last night, August 18, 2004, I had the clear displeasure of meeting Mr. Van Bebble in a screening of The Manson Family at Three Penny in Chicago as part of the Chicago Underground Film Festival. Here's what I have to say about it. First of all, the film is an obvious rip off of every film by Kenneth Anger, Roman Polanski, Oliver Stone and Terry Gilliam that I've ever seen. Secondly, in a short question-and-answer session after the show, Mr. Van Bebble immediately stated that he had never had any contact with members of the Manson family or Charlie himself, calling them liars and saying he didn't want to have anything to do with them, that the film was based on his (Van Bebble's) on the process that had seen everything from his living room on TV and on the news (and I assume from the Autobiography and from the book Helter Skelter that they were imitated directly by the narration) . So I got a second place for the questions, I asked if he was trying to present the outsider, MTV, sexual drugs and the rock 'n roll version and not necessarily the real story. This question obviously pissed off the now sane drama who started shouting "fuck you, shut up, that's the truth! All those other movies are bitches **!" <br /> <br /> Well, in any case, I didn't even think about how ridiculous it was until the next day, when I read the slogan of the movie, "You heard the side of the laws of history ... now listen to the story as told by the Manson family. "Excuse me, if this guy has never even talked to the family and considers them liars that he wants nothing to do with, how in the name of God can tell the story to them !? This is the most ridiculous statement I've ever heard! The film was obviously aimed at sexual drugs and the rock 'n roll audience who had no problem attracting the small dimly lit theater, and it was also more clearly generated by the sexual and rock-minded drugs of a man I couldn't even watch his film without getting up every ten minutes to fetch more beer or shout a Rocky Horroresque call line to the actors on the screen. This film doesn't just distort the public image of real events (which helped shape the state of America and much of today's world) in a sort of fantasy Slasher / Comic Book / Porno / Rape dreamed by an individual obviously superficial. <br /> <br /> The film was certainly very impressive to watch. The soundtrack was refreshing as it contained real examples of Charlie's work with the family outside of his Lie album. The editing was nice and moved to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music videos. All in all this film would have made a much better addition to the MTV catalogs than to the Underground Film Festival or, for this, to the minds of every intellectual observer. I felt like I was at a Midnight Rocky Horror looking at the way the audience was dressed and behaving (probably the best part of the experience). The cast was very good with the exception of Charlie who resembled a kind of stoned dungeons and dragons rather than the role he was playing. The descriptions that the film gave him full of energy, launching ten things and being very physical about it, did not at all correspond to the slow, lethargic and plump representation that had actually been presented. <br /> <br /> All in all the film basically explains itself as Sadie (or maybe it was Linda) declares at the end, "You can write a lot of bullsh books ** or make a bunch of bullsh movies ** ... etc . Etc. ". Case in point. Even the disclaimer "Based on a True Story" is a dead gift, meaning that somewhere under this psychedelic junk to lay the foundations of a real story with content that will make and have made a difference in the world. All you have to do is a little alchemy to separate the truth from the shit, or actually, maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book. <br /> <br /> All I can say Is this, when the film is finished I took a free beer so I'm glad I went, but I'm not happy I spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be informed of close the devil for asking the director a question. Peace.
