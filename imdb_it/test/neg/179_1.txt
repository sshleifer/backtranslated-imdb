Did Beavis and Butthead make this movie? It's just so bad. Truly an unjust and unjust portrait of "bad" compared to "good" in the world of wine. You noticed that the director was trying out any of the wines of the protectors of individual wines and terroirs. The camera's work is at its most dizzying, while the content could make you sleep long. This is not insightful journalism. What I got from this film is that the director was trying to make a point about the globalism of wine by showing, for example, that the Mondavi family owned wineries in all parts of the world. Ok, this is a good start. So how do these wines compare? Mondavi Napa's taxi tastes like their Italian wines. We will never find out why no one in the film comments on this. Instead, there are many allusions about Nazism and fascism. Well, those things don't grow grapes. Hmmmm.
