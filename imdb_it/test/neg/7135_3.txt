I don't deny that I enjoyed watching all the Japanese horror movies, but everyone must be fed up with them after seeing the same thing over and over again. <br /> <br /> The film follows the story of the movie Grudge. Audrey, as requested by her mother, is about to get her sister back. But when he arrives, something strange happens to his sister and then his sister is killed. He wants to discover the truth behind the curse and later a photographer (Eason) joins her. On the other hand, it also happens to a family and three girls, but they seem to realize it too late ... <br /> <br /> In fact, I can't see the points for the three international school girls to appear in the films as they are not (quite) related to the story. The reason why the woman holding the grudge keeps killing people is not yet clear (it seems to me that they are just telling the same things I saw in the grudge). And the sudden appearance of Audrey in front of the boy is undoubtedly strange, which I suppose is an attempt to make the history of the family known. Killing scenes are absolutely the mixture of those in the Ring and Shibuya kaidan. Acting would be another negative point. Like Hong Konger, I'd really like to support Edison Chen's first effort in Hollywood, but as a movie lover, I can't really find any support for bad acting. Even other actors like the father, even if it appears only in some scenes, should have done better. What is kept well is the atmosphere of the film, especially when I watched it in the middle of the night alone. <br /> <br /> If you have time, really enjoy all the horror movies and have seen all the possible horror films except this one, like me, you can make it kill some time. But if you really like Japanese horror movies like this, you should spend some time looking at the Japanese version of the Ring.
