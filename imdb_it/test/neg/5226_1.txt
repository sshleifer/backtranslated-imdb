Wow, this is a great anti-Christian prejudice! This is based on a novel by Stephen King and he wrote this kind of prejudice first and then Hollywood exaggerates it even more. In this film we see a Protestant pastor and a Catholic priest who act like crazy and are profane at the same time. Of course, the Devil has conquered the city, so perhaps his influence is in these guys too, but they are typical Hollywood portraits. They never show a minister who speaks and acts like Billy Graham, or your local minister or priest. And - another "given" - make Satan's character the most interesting of the film. <br /> <br /> Max Von Sydow interprets the devil and makes him nice. Ironically, Von Sydow played many of these roles after portraying Jesus in the 1964 film, "The Greatest Story Ever Told." Wondering why the actors are so messed up? They don't know if they are God, Satan or anyone in between. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris, who played a lot of unlikely roles up until the last few years, is correctly thrown into this story. He and the rest of the petty characters in this movie DO NOT make it fun to watch. <br /> <br /> From what I've heard, King's book is even darker and sicker than this hateful but better built movie. Frankly, who cares. King and Hollywood deserve each other.
