OK, I saw this movie through the Mystery Science Theater 3000, but I saw the movie, so I thought I'd leave a comment on it. I adore once again how Joe gets stuck with bad roles while his brother and nephew are getting the Oscar roles right and left. Soultaker is technically what you would call the film that had to be good. It seemed that the director and the actors took this film extremely seriously and produced very vulgar effects, a story that didn't make much sense and not to mention the rather poor acting skills. This is one of my favorite MST3K episodes, simple because much of what they mention is what we're thinking about during the movie and I'll explain why in a moment. <br /> <br /> Natalie and Zach are a couple that broke and is now trying to work things out. But since Zach is in the lower classes and Natalie is in the middle class, it won't work. But as they return home, they and Zach's friends find themselves in a car accident and now the angel of death / Soultaker is following them to reach his soultaking quota. But he also seems to have had some other life relationship with Natalie and can't get over it. So now Natalie and Zach have to run against the clock that never appeared five million times a minute to save their souls and lives. <br /> <br /> Well, I guess Zeppelin was wrong when he sang that there was a ladder to Heaven, I wonder if Black Sabbith was wrong too, lol. Basically there are a lot of holes in the plot in this movie, as nobody can see the characters and can't be killed, yet somehow they can still push buttons and open doors? The Angel of Death had a very strange face and was a little distracted by the story itself. Soultaker was just a bad movie that was rushed and makes you feel so bad for Joe, the underrated brother Sheen / Estovez. <br /> <br /> 2/10
