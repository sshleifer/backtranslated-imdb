I'm not going to lie and say I don't watch the show - I do it. BUT it has a lot, and a lot of flaws. 1) The college is perfect. The drama is at a minimum. Everyone is so cute to each other, you know. Let's take a reality check. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT ANY school is perfect as a PCA. Free laptops for everyone. Great dorms. Mini fridge. If such a school existed in real life, almost no one would be a virgin for one. Two, everyone is so rich, and it's strange how no one has stolen anything yet. 2) Really unrealistic characters. First, the right mind speaks like them. They talk like a perfect teenager would. Secondly, Logan Reese (Matthew Underwood) is an extremely "hot" guy. My question is, why is the girl in that school hardly ever all about him? He is rich and "hot" now one day all those girls would have been after him, even if he was a jerk. Moreover, Chase is the dumbest person ever. He is a shy teenager who claims he is not in love with Zoey and overreacts to everything that involves Zoey. It must be LACIDA not to see him in love with her. <br /> <br /> Come on, Nick. I know you can do better than THAT. Please..
