when I first read "berlin am meer" I didn't expect much. but I thought with the right people, the right locations, the right music and fashion that you could at least make a trivial film about hip hop that everyone seems to be talking about. but eissler has failed, he is so ridiculously not authentic. it is a complete distortion of what is happening in the so-called Berlin scene. obviously it's not just about hippness, but you should expect more from a movie that is sold as "the defined Berlin movie". <br /> <br /> and, apart from all the credibility, it's really a bad movie. mediocre acting and a rather boring plot. It is interesting to note that some of the actors have shown in other films that they are actually quite talented. so it must really be a bad directing ability. <br /> <br /> don't bother watching "berlin am meer" if you are not 17, come from some small town in western Germany and want to move to the big city after you finish school. then you could really find it pleasant and totally cool.
