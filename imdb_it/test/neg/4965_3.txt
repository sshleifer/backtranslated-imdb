I read about this movie online and after seeing the generally positive reviews that the trailer received and saw, I decided to check it out. What a disappointment! Start well enough. the initial scene was rather tense, but from there it is all downhill. I see that the filmmakers were trying to do something different with this film, but in doing so, they enjoyed watching it. Those choices combined with the "C.S.I" montage, the use of music and editing, the lack of suspense, fear or humor really drag this film. There is too much foreshadowing and many "subtle" clues, so when the first shot comes early, you already know how the film will end. I gave the film three stars because I think the cast did a good job, apart from that I can't recommend this movie.
