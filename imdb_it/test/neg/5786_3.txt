Top gun without internal animosity. O class. Or money. Or cruise. An excuse for an upwardly mobile cast of next-big-thing actors to market their ability to lead a matinee, this actually has nothing to which anyone can enter. It is a pity because Charlie Sheen's opening blow opens with a great promise that is almost immediately dissipated with an absurd wedding set. Barking. <br /> <br /> Dennis Haysbert is a changing actor for me, but in this film he is fine, particularly the action sequences. Michael Biehn is a first-class action hero but not a leading man: Charlie Sheen is, in effect, the protagonist, but never a true action hero. There is a stunt cast of hundreds of people who are also worthy of mention. 3/10
