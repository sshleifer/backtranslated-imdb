I don't understand why people praise this movie. I didn't like it at all. I watch it with different people. They didn't care about anything either. First of all. It is clear that another low-cost study is trying to cash in on a history of big names. The actual shoots look like a live TV interview. The trick is bad. When you watch the movie together with the extra DVDs. You will see that there is a lot of enthusiasm on the part of the people who participated. There is no talent. There are facts that appear in the book. The facts are distorted by the invention of plays and sketches added to it. I read several books and saw several shows on this story. What I've always captured from all the material on this is that it was a serious horror story. I really wish someone could really make a good movie about this. He has always fascinated me. Bad acting has really ruined the story. The kids' situation has really hammered them even more. When you watch this movie. The boy and his problem are what you and your friends will remember and laugh. It made no sense because his brothers were laughing at what had happened to him. It was as if the witch had to be so threatening, but it was right to throw her little brother. It's a huge story with him and his little problem. I still can't get past the little girl who says "Mom said that tobacco will make your teeth rot". Frank Fox's statement and facial expression are so bad. The scene in the yard with him to get food is pretty stupid. The sound of parts of it seems to come from the psycho film. Also, the girl who flies over the bed and her little "bladder control problem" are from The Exorcist. This film lacks the talent of creativity. We inserted the film for a couple of minutes and we immediately realized that it was a pity. I also noticed that they were flaws in the quality of the film. Part of it looked like what a person could film on a home camera. I noticed that many people in the credits had many multiple jobs. This is probably the way this film was put together. Someone said I like this story. I'll take all my friends and shoot a movie with a video camera and a computer. It doesn't matter if we don't know how to act. As long as we understand it on the film and say it's fine. We brought the family together and prepared the food. Then he sat down and watched this failed attempt to make a movie.
