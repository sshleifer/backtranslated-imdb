This was done in 2004 for god's sake, what happened to our cutting-edge special effects? What happened to our rough edges but still good actors? The actors in this movie were incredibly horrible, there were one or two that weren't bad, but the rest, biggg thumbs down. I could not bear to listen to the poorly written dialogue, I mean, who the hell wrote that script? Please never write again! Special effects? Don't even get me started with special effects. Surely they could find balls of green light better and completely false in the eye sockets. It looks so old and ... frankly. Even the simplest thing to make seem real ... teeth, they seemed so fake and stupid that I would have almost wiped a tear from my eyes with boredom. How onnnn I can't believe this was shown to the public too!
