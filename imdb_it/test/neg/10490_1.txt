This isn't even lively enough to be fun. There's something out there that rips people (off screen) after a space accident (off screen) while government officials investigate (off screen) and bad actors say stupid lines (on screen), including a guy that looks like Jim Carrey with a hangover. The "monster", when finally shown, looks like an extra from "Robot Monster", but there's not enough monster it was anyway. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it's quite short. Jump, unless you want to get bored of your skull with this
