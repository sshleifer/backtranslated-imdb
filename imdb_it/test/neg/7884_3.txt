A film about a French girl who is raped by street criminals. The same rape scene is filmed in all its gory details with all the male and female organs and their interactions clearly visible to the camera. In a fit of rage, the victim grabs his friend's gun (or was it brother?), Shoots him and flees with the weapon. Meet this prostitute who has just seen her pimp tear down, mate and leave for Paris. A series of crazy, insignificant and savage killings follow, the girls seem to enjoy every murder more than the previous one. A poor boy is shot in the hole ****. There are good doses of sex thrown among the numerous killings. <br /> <br /> The film is not the most violent I have ever seen, I would say that Saving Private Ryan probably had more violence in it. If violence is what you are looking for, there are many other films out there. And if it's the sex you're out for, then I'd suggest one of those XXX. <br /> <br /> I went to see the film because of all the hype the media gave him. The film itself is not a big deal, just a lot of violence and sex shot with something like a hand-held camera. I was surprised that this film had a 15-year age limit in Sweden, if 15-year-olds can watch this movie, they should be able to watch XXX movies too.
