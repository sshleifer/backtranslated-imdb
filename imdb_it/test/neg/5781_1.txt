Be very afraid of those who love this movie. They probably inhaled too many chips of child paint. It is so terrible that I refuse to relive a plot. Oh yes, there wasn't one! This film is a true definition of what Hollywood creates for people who don't want to think about a theater. Do the bad guys win? Do the good guys win? Who cares!
