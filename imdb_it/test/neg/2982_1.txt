The ABC people forgot to do their biographical research ... so many scenes were simply wrong! The actor who played JPII was very stiff, there was no personality there. It is very obvious that this film was at the bottom of the survey of programming totems, the move is so low. The script is terrible. Conversations like "You have to follow the rules" "No, people are starving." Boring. Furthermore, the movie jumped like crazy from one event to another to adapt it to two hours. Terrible! A better use of your time would be to watch a PBS documentary on JPII. Moreover, CBS has published a miniseries on JPII which is far better than ABC. JPII was a wonderful man, and it annoys me to think that my grandchildren could get a hold of this ABC movie and think that's what it really was!
