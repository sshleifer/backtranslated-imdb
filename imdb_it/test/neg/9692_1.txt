I could not believe what I saw ... (once) brilliant actors appearing in this terrible effort that should never be done. The plots are frightening and the dialogue that grips (at first I thought it was a parody), and the abyssal acting. Everything is ugly, from inexpensive sets to fake wallpapers, a bunch of enlarged paintings. Respectable filmmakers struggle to realize their vision, yet this blasphemous and pathetic attempt of a miniseries makes it to our television, with 3 Oscar winners making appearances. I can only assume that all those involved in some way injured the writer and director and were forced (perhaps under the threat of a gun) to act in this useless trash of the T.V.
