Horror. The film about the Nazis - the Germans. The murderers of children, rapists of young girls ... For this they repent? What are they interested in doing thousands of miles away from Germany? It doesn't come to your mind is it? Are the fascists now good Samaritans? Think, kill, torture, 27 million people. No, of course, they don't want to. They were forced to Hitler, gave each of them and forced to kill: every fourth inhabitant of Belarus, peace, all Jews, gypsies ... kill the Slavs. The facts: At the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, when they were taken prisoner by the fascists (Germans), they were rebellious and brazen. We kill you all, and so on. From 1943, when they were taken prisoner, they suddenly became anti-fascists and peaceful peasants who were forced to Hitler, and personally. For such films he should be imprisoned for life for the glorification of fascism. <br /> <br /> If you want to see what they did, you went to Stalingrad, then watch the movie "Come and see" (1985).
