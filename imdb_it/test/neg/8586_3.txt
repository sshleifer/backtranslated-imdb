I couldn't wait to see this movie because the trailer made it look so good. But the fact is that this film is boring and totally confusing. There is no plot, and half of the film is a quick flash from football matches. Enlarged shots, which do not provide an overview of the games. I was constantly watching the timer, to see when the movie was finished! <br /> <br /> There's only ONE good thing about this movie. The sound!! The soundtrack is fantastic! ............. Don't expect anything from this movie.
