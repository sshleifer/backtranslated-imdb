I strongly suggest not to watch this "TV" movie if not sufficiently mature from a mental point of view, the film creates a fairly realistic simulation with the steps in which they prevent terrorism if such an incident occurs, London supposes a beautiful and cold City, while this type of war is still going on, wasting time and money to study and live, every time it passes through P Square, the feeling is really obvious, actually uncomfortable, I don't want to vote, the score means nothing, only 4 'fill the blank '<br /> <br /> Only safe and positive cities of thought better encourage the economy and investors to continue to invest time, energy and money
