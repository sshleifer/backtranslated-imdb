Don't believe the hype. If you have high hopes or have anticipated this film in any way, you may be disappointed. Even the exhilarating and talented Steve Carrell can't save this stupid, misplaced spy movie for a long time. For purists (fans of the original TV series), this film bears little resemblance to the original characters and influence. Agent 99 and Maxwell (except their names) are not simply the same characters. There are many isolated references to the original, but not enough to convince this fan that it is more than a scant shadow of the TV version. For those not familiar with the original TV series, you can't be disappointed, but it's likely you'll be bored. There are also some economic political blows in Hollywood (really pathetic and really typical for an election year). We left after the first hour and we were not alone. Some left after 20 minutes.
