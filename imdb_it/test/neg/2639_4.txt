Typical story of an evil child chasing people. I suspect that Antonio Fargas (Huggy Bear on "Starsky and Hutch") and Vincent Schiavelli didn't want to underline this stuff on their resumes (in reality, Schiavelli left this life with a mostly good resume). Sometimes I want the killers of these films to go just looking for the idiots who decide that we need a new one of these films every two months (note: that comment shouldn't be taken seriously, I just think that the coupons have lost their touch ). <br /> <br /> However, this is a film that you will best avoid. Between ninety minutes and two hours I will never return.
