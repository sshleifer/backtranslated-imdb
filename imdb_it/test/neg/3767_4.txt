Rocketship X-M should be seen by any serious movie enthusiast for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) It is one of the first - and the few - films to have no happy ending. No doubt the effect was deeper in post-war America than it would be today, but nevertheless the sad ending adds to the message of the film. <br /> <br /> 2) It is also one of the first films to deal with space travel in a serious way, using space as a valid scenario for the drama. Despite the lack of scientific background, the film stands alone as a dramatic price. It is not so much a spatial drama as a drama set in space. <br /> <br /> 3) The anti-nuclear war message is delivered in a serious way that is not lost in sfx involving large grasshoppers, men, or animals. The effect of the Martian society on nuclear devastation is presented in a crude and sincere way. The fact that the survivors of the expedition fall to the ground and as such are unable to preach the lesson learned on Mars adds another element of sadness to the tragic final. <br /> <br /> Sterno says to take a ride on Rocketship X-M.
