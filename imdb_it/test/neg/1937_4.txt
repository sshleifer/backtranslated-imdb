Reading other users' comments, the review of A666333 has articulated most of what I was experiencing in this predictable plot of the film, cliché versions of lesbian / heterosexual (ie heterosexual woman becomes lesbian while concluding that her husband is violent and aggressive ). <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the score was very disappointing. It was bland, sweet, sentimental elevator music, another common cliché in lesbian movies. The film would have had some interesting dramatic moments if it hadn't been destroyed by music. <br /> <br /> Some scenes concerning sex and eroticism have also struck me as attempts to titillate and increase the value of the shock, including parts of the final scene of the performance. The conventional "hot and smoking" moments were as boring as the excessively sentimental score. For example, during the pool scene, the women kiss, and then the camera moves along the glass of abandoned wine, the flowing water, the sound of their heavy breathing above the soft roar of the waves. <br /> <br /> The only elements that I liked were the costumes and the arobazie. They are well choreographed and the development of the attraction between the two characters was very natural during the training scenes. I genuinely smiled during those and during the last scene with the police officer. But it wasn't enough to balance the negatives or make me enjoy this movie.
