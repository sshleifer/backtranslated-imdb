The seven collaborations between director Joseph "von" Sternberg and star Marlene Dietrich were so distinct in appearance and tone, and so different from anything else at that time, they almost seem to constitute a sub-genre. Like all kinds, they have their absolute masterpieces, as well as their absolute turkeys. It's time to send the blonde Venus to the farm. <br /> <br /> After the seductive successes The Blue Angel, Morocco and Shanghai Express, in which Miss Dietrich created her cinematographic image as a stand-up comedian-singer-prostitute, someone at Paramount decided it was time for Marlene to play a mother. There is nothing wrong with this; as an actress she was equal to the part. It's just that nothing else has changed about the format. It's like The Blue Angel plus a child. Fairly correct, the story of a woman dragging the child along her escapades is a valid premise for a tragic drama, but that's not how it is played. Dietrich's journey is interpreted as a sort of adventure, using his ingenuity and his accomplices to keep up with the law. Is this not a brazen example of pre-code libertarianism? it's just weirdly disgusting. <br /> <br /> Although we may be able to accept that Marlene is a lovely mother, there is absolutely no way to buy Sternberg as a director of warmth and intensity. Despite being one of the few images for which he also got written credit, Sternberg simply can't get the arc of history. The emotional result of the film should be the final meeting of the family, but even at the beginning this is not established as something worth returning to. As usual, Sternberg's interiors are dressed and shot to look like brothels or asylums. The Faraday house is actually a rather creepy and squalid environment, and it's a wonder that little Johnny didn't wet his bed and asked to sleep with the light on. <br /> <br /> But as anyone familiar with them will know, Dietrich / Sternberg's point of view is to make Dietrich look fabulous, and in this respect at least Blonde Venus is a success. Marlene is introduced by emerging from a forest reserve in a bright and sparkling foreground, and even when she is reduced to rags, the camera still loves her. The same cannot be said for the rest of the cast, which Sternberg tended to view as stage furniture pieces. The usually likable Herbert Marshall is here reduced to a moody rumble lurking in the shadows. Even the sweet and lively Cary Grant becomes just a boring and blob in the background, and doesn't seem interesting enough to blow up Dietrich. <br /> <br /> The only highlights of Blonde Venus are the choreographies and choreographies of Marlene, in particular the famous Hot Voodoo issue in which she parodies her surreal character, emerging from a gorilla. But even these seem to have been cut and glued from a different film. Sternberg fans can greet him as another masterpiece, as they usually do, but for the average bettor it is a big disappointment. The audiences of the time did not tear him to pieces as they had done with his previous successes, and this marked the beginning of the end for Marlene's apogee. A year later would there be a new queen at Paramount ?? Mae West.
