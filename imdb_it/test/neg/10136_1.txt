Oh f * cking hell, where should I start ... First of all; this show is just another stupid non-comedy American comedy, which has pathetic acting and very poor humor. The American way of making things laugh makes everything even more difficult. How come I can hear laughter, but nothing fun happens? Rather stupid, eh? This show is only for those Americans who have never heard that there are much more fun, better and more humorous comedies - not only in Britain, but also in America (the Simpsons for example). I simply can't understand what's so good about "Reba" that lasted a long time on television. It has nothing new to offer, it underestimates the (possible) viewers in so many ways and it's simply not funny at all. I could have lived with the fact that there are such bad shows as "Reba", but why the hell they had to do it here in Finland. If I see a few seconds of this horrible sight, the rest of the day is ruined for me. Take my word and believe me - this show sucks even more than these American "comedies" do. This is simply horrible. Do yourself a favor; never look at this peace of sh * t. <br /> <br /> Well, I leave the comment for those who now better this language. Thank you for your (possible) interest.
