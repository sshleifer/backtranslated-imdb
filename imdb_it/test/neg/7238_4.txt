When I saw the first octopus film it was a laugh to see the acting of cheese and the terrifying effects. This film seemed to make up for the acting, but not the special effects. After Jaws and Piranha, of course, why not shoot a movie about a killer octopus? The octopus invades the waters of New York, where 2 police investigators try to stop the beast unleashed before July 4th. <br /> <br /> A fairly clean plot and descents but the octopus was quite terrifying, it's nice to see they did it this time but it looked like a piece of plastic ... Better for a big budget, this movie could have been a good watch. There is a constant amount of errors that would not surprise me if they did not research how octopuses live ... <br /> <br /> See this if you like cheap DVD sequels, otherwise your best view of Jaws.
