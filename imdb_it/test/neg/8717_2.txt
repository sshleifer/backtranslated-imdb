Definitely one of the smallest shows ever produced on these coasts and this is something that says something. Also many of the main actors did not linger for the duration. The fact that it worked for eight years is a sad accusation about the average intelligence and cultural nous of the Australian user. He went around in circles, with repetitive gags and badly drawn characters. Arthur MacArthur, for god's sake. have they actually paid the writers of this show? I wonder if anyone has verified their qualifications. There were tired gags on rural populations and farce of secondary order which were small imitations of a thousand British and American sitcoms that had happened before. I think that's what I hate so much, that it seems that no one involved wanted to make it memorable, original or intelligent, opting instead for the lowest common denominator every time.
