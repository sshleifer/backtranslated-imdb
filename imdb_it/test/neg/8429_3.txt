"Disappointing" is the best word I could think of for this film, especially considering the positive reviews it receives from some other users. <br /> <br /> One thing that really ruins the film is that it is blatantly partial (in both senses of the word). Not only does it present a very selective description of the games (focusing as in the case of the US athletic team) but it also contains several inaccuracies, most of which serve to exaggerate the difficulties faced by the US team. <br /> <br /> What is even more disturbing is that all the omissions and errors (?), seem to glorify American sportiness with the exclusion of other athletes (with some celebrated exceptions). For example, the viewer is led to believe that the United States won most of the medals in the Games, when in reality they won only one gold medal out of four and one out of six in total. Similarly, many athletes are portrayed as caricatures of their respective fellow citizens (so we have arrogant English and disdainful French wine). This attitude does little service to the Olympic ideals that the film should celebrate. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I believe this film would appeal to that part of the American public that is looking for a quick boost to national self-esteem. Those looking for a detailed and historically correct description of the games are invited to look elsewhere.
