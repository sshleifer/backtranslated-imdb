Since I'm not a big fan of Steven Seagal, I thought it was a pretty good movie. It is clear that his fans are very unhappy with this drama that lacks an abundance of martial arts and brute strength. <br /> <br /> Gailard Sartain plays a patriot leader claimed by a militia in a stalemate with the ATF for weapons violations. He surrenders with the intention of releasing a deadly virus. Seagal is a former CIA agent who became a country doctor who strives to find the antidote for the deadly insect that made a small town incapable. Herbal grandfather's native American remedies in salvation. <br /> <br /> Notable appearances by L.Q. Jones, Camilla Belle and Silas Weir Mitchell. My favorite in this film is Whitney Yellow Robe. It is wonderful and seems to have what it takes to take on a more challenging role. <br /> <br /> Despite the far-fetched ending, this was a decent film that could have used a lot more action.
