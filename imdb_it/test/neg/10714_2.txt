Maybe it's just that it was made in 1997, or maybe anyone who managed to get this up to a 7 has a weakness for children with AIDS. But really people, manic laughter and chaos during the retreat scene? Didn't you see it coming? I'm surprised there wasn't a baby crawling through the ceiling and a sick guy who turned to the camera. The acting was fine, of course. But for me this is just an example of a film from a moment in which situations and arguments can pass for the cinematographic language. Things happen, but that's all. There is no glue or pattern that can be detected on the screen, allowing the topic to use pre-existing emotional connections to furrow the plot, without the script doing it as it should.
