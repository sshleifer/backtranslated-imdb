First there was Tsu Hark's Zu Warriors (2001), which is visually innovative, but in the acting and writing departments, this film is now missing, which is visually almost as good as Zu (though not more innovative), but is even worse in the acting and writing departments. It is really sad that there seems to be an almost complete lack of acting and writing actors in the Hong Kong film industry. I guess you need to understand Cantonese to understand how bad and vulgar the dialogues are in the film. It's like some delinquent children are talking on the street, it's so bad. To make matters worse, the actors and actresses look like delinquent children and cannot act even if their lives depend on it. I understand that this film should be a comedy aimed at the younger generations of Hong Kong, but are Hong Kong's young people really so dead of brains that they can't appreciate anything but a youthful and vulgar acting / writing? If so, I'm ashamed of being from HK. <br /> <br /> I'd like HK filmmakers to learn some lessons from directors like Zhang Yi-Mou or Ang Lee, and finally make a film that is visually surprising and competent and mature in acting and writing departments. And stop using young singers / idols / heartbreakers as actors because they can't play a lot of fans that they can have in HK anyway!
