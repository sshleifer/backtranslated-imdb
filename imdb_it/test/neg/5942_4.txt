This film captures the brief moments between a mother and a child in rural Russia while she is dying. <br /> <br /> I am so torn between being kind to the movie or declaring it a patience test. On the one hand, the film is beautiful, with little dialogue that captures the essence of their feelings. There is really nothing to say, because everything that needs to be said is transmitted beyond words. The son shows so much care, love and patience towards his mother, which I think is a celebration of unconditional love for his family. It also reminds me cruelly that I could be in a situation like this, stuck in a place without joy, having to take care of a very sick person. "Mat I Syn" is a cruel reality. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Mat I Syn" really moves too slowly. Do I really need to watch a train passing over the horizon for over 1 minute? With my previous experience of "Telets" and "Aleksandra", I am so tempted to put "Mat I Syn" between them as a total bore. <br /> <br /> I think we should be in the right state of mind to appreciate this movie. I certainly see her beauty, but maybe I'm not in the right frame of mind.
