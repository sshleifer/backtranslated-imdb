Acting is embarrassing and disturbing, and not in a positive sense ... at all. The writing, the dialogue and the chemistry between the actors are horrible. Nothing makes sense and every close-up of an actor's expression or reaction lasts 3 or 4 seconds for too long, making it look like a Mexican Soap Opera (telenovela). Everything about writing is unrealistic, and all the actors involved make it much worse with their campy interpretations of the script. Am I the only one who sees this ??? Using the word cheesy to describe this Canadian disaster would be the euphemism of the century. Did the director even see the final cut before it was aired ???
