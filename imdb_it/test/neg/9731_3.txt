let me tell you that I did not expect much before, and watching it in the early evening during the opening night should have helped. I think it would have happened if there were more than 20 people in the theater. <br /> <br /> It sucked so much. the acting was at most robotic and nothing was really explained until the last 30 minutes of the film. I guess it was their way of distorting the plot; keep everyone in the dark on crucial information to understand the direction of the films until the end and then explain things and hope that it feels like a twist. <br /> <br /> Unknown until the end of the film: -What the Eff is a dark one? the CG was nice but I want to understand! -why can't powers be desired? especially if mass murder is the ultimatum. -Why is she willing to send the powers so badly? your normal later, right? - who farted? <br /> <br /> approximately 50% of the minutes with only men on the screen, they were shot with them in wife hitters, sleeveless shirts and then a breathtaking scene of all the teenagers in the silliest ride speedos knowing to have ever been produced. I swear you could see the beginning of the boys ... well, it was close to the soft core. And of course there was a shower scene, and to mix it was DUDES. Head cracks were plentiful, a sausage fest going on. But there was a scene of a single girl where nothing could be seen and she wandered around the bathroom of the most beautiful dormitory for about 12 minutes. Then there was a girl who talked to PJ. the other thing I couldn't get over was the amount of driving that Caleb did in his SUPER COOL Ford Mustang GT. it was a commercial for Ford about 1/4 of the film. <br /> <br /> Not seeing it. or go see it with a friend who likes to make fun of bad movies. then it could be worth it. but don't expect anything breathtaking.
