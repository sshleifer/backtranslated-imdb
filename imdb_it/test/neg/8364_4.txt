Last night I got to see a first preview screen of Prozac Nation. Because I love everything that Christina Ricci does. At first I was very excited, but as the film went on I started wondering where he was going. Based on a true story, it is simply the character of Christina Ricci and her struggle with depression, drugs, friends and family, as one can probably tell from the title. I think this movie was moving too fast, and it was too dramatic. I would say that there was a dramatic moment every five minutes, and the film went through his life extremely quickly, and this left no room for us to connect with the character of Christina Ricci. Christina Ricci's performance was fantastic as always, but Jessica Lange stood out throughout the film, and I believe that the success of this film will be everything for her and Christina Ricci. I would rate this 4 out of 10 and suggest you rent this or read Elizabeth Wurtzel books that are good and definitely worth a try.
