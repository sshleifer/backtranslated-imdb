Luchino Visconti was and is one of the most influential cultural figures of his generation, but Adam Low (the director of this thing) allows Helmut Berger to have the strongest voice! How can it be? What a missed opportunity! We come out of this ordeal knowing less of what made the Master great and more about the things that shouldn't matter. The beautiful images belong to the world of Visconti, the embarrassing interviews with artists like Berger and Zeffirelli in the small world of Adam Low. A must to avoid!
