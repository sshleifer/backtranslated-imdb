I don't know why IMDb lists all Ghoulies films as theatrical releases. They were all directly to videos. The same with the Puppet Master series. Why hasn't anyone noticed this yet? Right, somehow you ran into Ghoulies IV, probably scrolling through an old video rental shop abandoned since 1993. You looked in the discount section and found this ... Look at the back and front covers. What do you expect, The Shawshank Redemption? It is not necessary to review this film so critically. It's the fourth GHOULIES movie! I bought it on DVD for ?? 6.50 why ... was it ?? 6.50 .. I knew it wasn't Kubrick's material. And I was right. An incomparable DVD without extras, not even a trailer, boasts an untreated movie. <br /> <br /> Actually it contains the star of the first Ghoulies film, Peter Liapis ... who didn't have many "big" roles apart from those two films. And I don't see why ... He's not too bad an actor and he's pretty funny. But I imagine that if you play a leading role in the films of Ghoulies, Scorsese and Tarantino will lose interest. Also present is his idiotic companion Bobby Di Cocco, who despite having a very small resemblance to Al Pacino (very small), does not preserve any of his acting skills ... A complete idiot who is just embarrassing to watch. Then there's Stacie Randall - obviously a porn star, I don't need to take a look. He looks very sexy, even if his costume, his character and all that he does drag down the credibility of the film, which is not an easy task for such a film. <br /> <br /> Then there are the Ghoulies themselves! Even those who manage to disappoint us. Ghoulies III had them start talking, mistake no. 1, but Ghoulies IV goes a step further. Instead of being puppets, this time the Ghoulies are actually CHILDREN in COSTUMES !!!! The directors have decided to run that extra bit to insult viewers. Furthermore, there are only two of them, and they are not the highlight of the film, since they do not appear to a large extent. However, sometimes they are MILDLY funny ... And they are not even bad this time. <br /> <br /> This is really an exhilarating thing, it's amazing that I'm really able to enjoy it. I don't know why ... Some of the black moods are actually funny, even if the script is mostly effortless. Imagine that Satan is the only threat to you that will "kill you, slowly ... painfully ...". <br /> <br /> But at least the Full Moon didn't have any involvement this time. They? Yes, a very bad and cheap film with a production value of 0, but not so bad as to be in the ranks of Puppet Master 1/2, Lawnmower Man 2, Surviving Christmas or even Ghoulies III.
