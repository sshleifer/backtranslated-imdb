SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I love movies. I've seen a lot of movies. I didn't think I'd ever see a movie I really hated. Son of the Mask ruined it. Son of the Mask is so bad that I won't even make a detailed comment as I usually do. In fact, I won't even write much. I think you all should know that this movie is horribly terrible. And poor Jamie Kennedy. It was great in Scream, but now this movie! Moreover, this film takes a movie on SMO-CAN and turns it into this movie for kids that even children won't want. This film also includes a very rude humor. Like the woman of the nose. He has a nose for a head and when he sneezes white stuff vomits from his nose. There is also a parody of exorcists. Yes, a children's movie has an adult parody. Maybe they thought adults would like it. Frankly, it made the film even more flavorful and raw. <br /> <br /> Here is the basic and stupid plot. Tim Avery's dog gets the extraordinary Loki mask and turns into a cartoon dog thing. When Tim pays more attention to the child with special powers, the cartoon dog becomes a scam of Wiley Coyote. Then Loki takes the child with incredible powers and Tim and Loki have a really vulgar animated fight. Tim wears the mask. Everything ends up happy. Too bad this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> Overall, the original Mask was a fantastic Jim Carrey film. This is basically not it. Please, please do not rent, buy or download this movie. I made a terrible mistake by renting it. I don't want you guys to make the same mistake. I feel horrible that I could not write a detailed comment, but really, what is there to comment? <br /> <br /> 2/10 I would give you one, but come on, it's basically a film for children. <br /> <br /> Recommended films: The Mask.
