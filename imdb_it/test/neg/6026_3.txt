I seemed to find the best trailers in the film. They did their job and made me interested to look UNKNOWN. Interest soon fell. A simple premise that warms the landscape. Five men wake up in a chemical warehouse without knowing why they are there; not to mention how the hell they got there. Confusion and paranoia bring with them fear and distrust. The men learn that a kidnapper is coming with the intention of killing his hostages. Now men are measuring each other trying to distinguish if everyone is a victim and who can actually be one of the kidnappers. The cast includes: Jim Caviezel, Greg Kinnear, Joe Pantoliano, Bridget Moynahan, Barry Peppper, David Selby and Adam Rodriguez.
