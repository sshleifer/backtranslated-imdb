Come on? FANTASTIC DRAMA ON THE SCREEN? Are you kidding? I wouldn't put Molly Gross awful to play at school! Where did these people learn to act? Borrowing some documents from their neighborhood actor? Terrible plot, horrible acting. Heh ... why are you taking us for a fool? What can I say more. I understand that this is a television production and the acting should not be Citizen Kane. But nevertheless they should try it harder to earn their money. And apart from what can be said IN 10 LINES for a simple film like this? Do you want an article in the morning newspaper? To say what? Worst movie in the decade? OK, you want it - you have it!
