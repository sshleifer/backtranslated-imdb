This is undoubtedly the STUPIDEST movie of all time. <br /> <br /> I don't know who is more angry with the idiots who did this or my video store for actually bringing this piece of shit! ! <br /> <br /> I can't even name all the wrong things with this horrible movie to be desired. <br /> <br /> All the dialogues seem to be made of commercials, and the acting is the worst I've ever seen in any movie - EVER !! <br /> <br /> There is nothing in the script that can please any decent person, in fact I don't think they even had a script, they just invented everything as they went along - and you can tell. <br /> <br /> The "women" (ie the men dressed in drag trying to look like women) in the costumes seemed so ridiculous, I guess they were trying to be sexy but - NOT MUCH !! Especially the old-disgusting one. <br /> <br /> There is nothing scary in this film, the only thing that is scary is that someone else can actually rent it and watch it. <br /> <br /> No brains needed to watch this, you have to be a total loser for wanting to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't forget-- I HAVE NOTIFIED YOU !!!
