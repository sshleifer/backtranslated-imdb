I found this film a complete waste of 96 minutes. Jones was a strange child and he is seriously messed up! In my memory, that could be wrong, wasn't he only 16 or 17? ** Spoiler ** because he left the university and rented an apartment with two crazy girls who are competing for the boys for a long time? and the cowboy who lives under the jones scared me too, as he knew that what had happened in the apartments didn't overtake me for a minute. I don't understand his way of thinking about the girl who took pictures for fun and stayed in his room when Mandy Moore was always over and it was pretty obvious that he wanted to be more than friends with him. I don't find this film funny or artistic or dramatic or anything else, I found it to be stupid and a complete waste of time (D- F +)
