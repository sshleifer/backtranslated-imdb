I seem to be in the minority, but I thought "Radio" was pretty awful. It seemed to contain almost all the clich√©s in these types of "moving" films. <br /> <br /> The motivation for the characters who fall in love with Radio has never been really explained. We just had to accept that everyone loved Radio except for a couple of bad apples. <br /> <br /> You could see almost all the great moments of history at a distance of 100 meters. When the movie wanted you to be "Awww" or you pulled out your fabrics, I was rolling my eyes and hoping to see "Rudy" instead. <br /> <br /> There were some good cast interpretations. Too bad they didn't have a better film in the desire to appear.
