A group of young adults opens an escape route for the spirit of Elizabeth Bathory when they recite her poetry from a video game that presumably represents a seance. The only one who dies in the game is Miller (Adam Goldberg) who is found dead in the same way he died in the aforementioned video game. While the characters of the others did not die in the video game, their poetry recitation instead triggered the video game in reality with CGI characters that wander around and kill each of them, one by one. They must follow certain methods using a mirror and nails to defeat Bathory and save their skin. <br /> <br /> If this premise seems stupid, it is because it is so. The characters are ho-hum rejections from WB's bad television programs, this time allowing the vulgarity to explode. This film follows the slasher rules, but does not show much violence or blood. Stay PG-13 safe with most of the death taking place off the screen. There is a scene in which the true hero and the heroine run from the characters of the video games that pursue them. Yes, it's so bad. Nothing to recommend. Good-looking casts including Sophia Bush as the appropriate October.
