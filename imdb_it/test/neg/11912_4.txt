The Shanghai Cobra starts as a gangster movie, with a dinner scene drenched directly by Shack Out on 101 or Gun Crazy (the first). Unfortunately the film then proceeds to walk its tired way through a standard formula of Chan that is just revived by the always wonderful Mantan Moreland. It's as if director Karlson had run out of half his budget in the first five minutes, getting the set up as he wanted. Look at the beginning and think about The Phenix City Story.
