Well, after seeing "Beginning" I thought why the hell they burned Schraders' version and made the poor one. But now, after seeing "Dominion", I deeply understand this decision. They didn't do much better too. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but this movie is really crap. Some good moments, but a really boring story and some of the main holes in the plot are killing this movie. <br /> <br /> I thing the Exorcist-story has a lot and in a prequel on this you can build on a lot and give references that the public would like to see. But there is so little of everything in the film. The effects are really bad - not even the television standard.
