JP3 does not have Spielberg's touch. It is a real assault on the senses with dinosaurs "in the face". Watching this movie was a bit like a roller coaster from hell. <br /> <br /> The script is lame; at the same time he asks and leaves too many unanswered questions. Also, we don't really appreciate humans in the movie for everything they are worth. For example, William H. Macy is too talented to compete with dinosaurs for our attention. And Laura Dern was particularly nice in JP1; in this film, it's barely a blip on the radar screen. <br /> <br /> The entire experience of JP3 was t o o m u c h. Too much noise, too many surprises, too many characters in extinction, violence too predictable and free. <br /> <br /> Word for the wise: voted on this island. <br /> <br /> (I voted as a 3 for special effects, I removed the other 7 points to have absolutely no originality.)
