"Midnight Clear" has a great premise. A group of overly educated and overly bright GIs are sent by incompetent leaders in a vague mission to patrol an isolated farm on the eve of the Battle of the Ardennes. The GIs meet a group of regular German clients exhausted by the battle, and it becomes clear that they no longer want to fight. <br /> <br /> Here is the problem. It's really quite simple. If the Germans want to surrender, they do and this is the end of the film. If the Germans want to fight, they do and this is also the end of the film. So instead of being GIs and Germans, they play with each other, even throwing snowballs at some point. Interesting for one or two scenes, but soon it becomes very annoying. After all, these are GERMANS. The enemy. Nothing in this film makes me think that they should not be taken prisoner or shot. The film does not make them more human. In fact, much of what the German characters have done has prompted me to shoot him, including a scene in which the German officer refuses to deal with a Jew or to surrender to a simple troop! Why should I care about these characters? Shoot them and move on to the Battle of the Bulge. It's much more interesting, though. <br /> <br /> A good scene: The GIs are returning from a reconnaissance of the German position, where they had the Germans in their sights but did not fire. As they walk through a clearing, they realize that a group of Germans have their Mausers leveled against them. The Germans are about 100 meters away. The GIs then do something that I've never seen do in any Sillywood films. They throw their guns and raise their hands! Unusual as this may be in the movies, it's a completely reasonable reaction to having a gun aimed at you from that distance. Although it seems far away, it is actually a point blank range for those rifles. I will discover the odds that someone who is working on this film has been a croquette!
