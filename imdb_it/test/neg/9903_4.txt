I think "category 6: day of destruction" was very unrealistic. Digital effects where you like a cartoon for children. <br /> <br /> The actors did not act realistically, for example, when the girl was killed, she acted as if she had sprinkled with tomato sauce. <br /> <br /> The film was boring, but I saw it because it was on. <br /> <br /> The only interesting character was Tornado Tommy, it was fun! <br /> <br /> Keep the real special effects. <br /> <br /> I liked the comment: "What? We did to piss off Mother Nature?" <br /> <br /> I don't know what else to write to fill the ten lines. What else can I say that the film is so boring, I think my comment will be just as boring.
