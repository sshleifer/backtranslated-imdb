When I saw this movie for the first time in the theater I was so angry. In my opinion it has completely blown. I haven't seen him for a decade then I decided what the hell, let's see. I'm watching all the hellish movies to see where it went wrong. My hypothesis is that it was with the sequel 5 that he was the first to implement the whole "I'm in a dream omg I see strange things, oh no, what's happening, oh it's a dream, oh it's not a dream, oh wait I see something spooky plot, oh it doesn't matter. " Those sequels don't even require opening the box, or sticking to the rules of the first 4 movies that if you saw the pinhead you're pretty much screwed up and dead. The first 3 hellraisers remained faithful to this plot that made it so scary in the first place. Nothing fancy, nothing strange, the box opened the boom they came. Kirstey was the only one able to bargain, first because of Uncle Frank. Then because he had information on coenobites. This film at least tries to stick to everything, even if it was a bad story, it was still a bit harmful. No, I'm sure part 5 was the first part to completely and completely destroy the hellraiser series. Now they are redoing 1, and I don't even think I'll watch it. Oh, who am I kidding I'll probably do and I'll probably be disappointed .... again.
