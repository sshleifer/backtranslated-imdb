I saw for the first time a poster advertising this film in a street in Helsinki, Finland, in June 2000. What caught my attention was the proud proclamation that advised all readers that the film, even if French, had been "banned in France". Returning home to New York, I discovered that one of the "Art House" theaters in the City was projecting the film, and so (with my Finnish girlfriend) I decided to see what it was. Boy, did we ever do that. <br /> <br /> From the comments read here, and the reviews I knew the film was violent and sexually explicit. Not necessarily offended by either of these two conditions, I went with an open mind to see what had upset the sensitivity of our Gallic cousins. Presumably, as anyone reading this will know, the story involves two women embarking on a crime and a spree of murder in France (the film has English subtitles). However, the resemblance to "Thelma and Louise" ends with that; sex is unusually graphic (and in abundance) as is violence (a lot of kicks to death, and a lot of blood and other organic substances that splash after the impact of bullets). <br /> <br /> At the intellectual level, one could say that the true essence of the film is the relationship between sex and violence (as manifested by the only sex that these women know: one is a small prostitute, and the 'another has earned money from time to time performing in pornographic films When, during their descent towards crime and murder, they have the upper hand over their sexual situations, they react only with the same violence and brutality that they themselves know and understand. It is important to note, however, that the victims of their fury are not only the gruesome men interested in terrifying sex (of which there are several) but innocent bystanders, for example even a woman at the ATM. <br /> <br /> I myself do not understand why the repeated shots of the "porn film" were all that was necessary (except to describe physical contact as cruel, tasteless and degraded) and the relentless blood became rather n ooso after the first violent spasms. <br /> <br /> It is a crude and raw film, but in all honesty, it deals with coarse and rough people and equally unpleasant circumstances. From a certain point of view, the lives of the French subproletarians are explored, and it is rather sad; a travel diary for France certainly isn't, maybe that's why the French banned it. <br /> <br />
