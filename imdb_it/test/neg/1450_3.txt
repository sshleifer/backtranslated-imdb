Advantages: Mary Boland is delightfully good as always (I will never get tired of her superior cruelty, especially in "The Women" and "Pride and Prejudice"). BATHROOM. Fields short role is fun, even if the famous billiard scene is a bit welcome because it seems to go on for ten minutes. The antics of the film, typical of the period, are grandiose. Also, a nod to the hotel lover of Alison Skipworth; I'd like to see more of them (Marie Dressler reminds me, another personality worthy of praise). <br /> <br /> Minuses: Gracie Allen. An irritating and unpleasant presence whose annoyance has not equaled the success of Adam Sandler. The almost falsetto nasal dyed with an accent of unknown origin ages in its very first scene. This is the first of the Burns-Allen movies I've seen and while I (like a great classic comedian) try to try at least one movie with all the major stars of the comedy, this is definitely a team that I won't call back. His timing and interpretation of the material are totally off. An incredibly mediocre talent. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: a comedy OK, but the gags are few and far between. And at only an hour, you can expect this to not be a Hollywood grade A comedy. Recommended only for Boland and Fields fans who want to see all their work.
