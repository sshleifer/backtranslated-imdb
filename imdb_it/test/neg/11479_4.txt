I love comedies and I love independent films, but this was too slow and the humor was extremely regional. I imagine it would have been better if the main characters were nice, but they were just typical types of gen-x loafers, just like the people who caused problems in high schools for forty years ... I can understand praise for a young indie director when he deserving, but this is an extremely mediocre film.
