This is a mediocre film by Jackie Chan and one of his worst James Glickenhaus has ruined it! All the characters are decent, I guess, but the story is so-so, however Jackie Chan is still unbelievable in this even though he seems bored. Jackie and Danny Aiello have never combined chemistry, and it's been a bit boring a lot of times, however the ending was above average and managed to be quite fun, and did some good stunts! I haven't seen the Hong Kong version yet, but I'm sure it's better than this stupid, plus the turn is very predictable! It is really lifeless and tasteless, and I don't blame Jackie for not looking happy in this, and if she hadn't acted in this it would have been unbearable and completely unwatchable. The opening should be memorable, but it's nothing I haven't seen before and done better, and I thought the whole movie was pretty lazy and could have been a fantastic movie if Jackie had control over it! it has no root for any of the characters. This is a mediocre film by Jackie Chan, and one of his worst James Glickenhaus has ruined it !, not even recommended for fans of Die hard Jackie Chan. The management is terrible! James Glickenhaus does a terrible job here, with an extremely bland photographic work, wrong angles and keeping the film boring most of the time. The acting is so-so. Jackie Chan is AMAZING as always, however he is not his usual energetic self, and he looks bored and stripped for the whole film, he has had no chemistry with Danny Aiello, and I don't really blame him either! (Jackie rules !!!!!). Danny Aiello is OK here, as Jackie's partner, but his character is a bit of an ass, and he never had a chemistry with Jackie, he did OK, I think. Roy Chiao is decent as the main villain, but he was just doing the movements and it wasn't all that threatening, it's damn cool anyway. The rest of the cast is average at best. Overall, it's not worth your time or money. * 1/2 out of 5
