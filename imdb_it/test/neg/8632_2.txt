If you had to choose the most depressing movie, try being suspenseful, I saw that this would be it. I know how good the original should be, it would be better to be better than this. The film is so gloomy and depressing, but it's not even interesting to look at: I've seen depressing "thriler" movies that have been saved due to the suspense of countering and balancing the dark quality. The fading didn't have this, this was so worrying to watch to begin with and there was nothing positive about making this a classic type of film. I think another IMDb poster was right to say that this genre has just seen the thrillers made in a much higher way. I completely agree: I would recommend skipping this, maybe one day I will look at the original but I doubt it. I give this a 2 out of 10.
