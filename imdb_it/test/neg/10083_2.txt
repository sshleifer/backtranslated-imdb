I would like to comment on how girls are chosen. because it is that more and more white women are chosen then they are black women. each episode is more and more white and then black women. like saying that white women are more beautiful than black women. For once I would like to see more black and then white women. and not only is your show like this on many more and more white shows. but I would have thought that you, as head of the show, would see it yourself and have more black women on your show. but you are just like the rest trying to behave as if you were so right and kind. you're just a big hypocrite.
