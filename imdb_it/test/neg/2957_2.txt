This film is too long. I lost interest for about an hour in history. Saratoga Trunk tells the story of Ingrid Bergman, who is the son of an important man from New Orleans and her lover. After his mother dies in Paris, Bergman returns to New Orleans to shock his father's "legitimate" family and blackmail them. He meets Gary Cooper, who is likewise seeking revenge against the railroad magnates who cheated his father out of his Texas land. She draws him into her schemes, and the film culminates in a Saratoga resort. Long and boring, but worth a look if you're a fan of Bergman or Cooper. The Dwarf Cupid provides the only bright spot in this tortuous story.
