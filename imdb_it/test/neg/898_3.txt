I didn't really understand Barnens O ?? it's one of the strangest I've seen. The soundtrack was quite unusual as well ?? written and performed by Jean Michel Jarre, it makes the film more strange than it used to be. I have to admit that I was about to change it and look at another one, but sometimes the film seemed dumb or boring to me ?? or confused. Are there any sexual references in that movie ?? they too are a bit messy. Probably the only sentence I will remember is "When you're alone, you can control things" ?? and "I'll show them" - or something like that. Was the guy in that movie obsessed with not growing up? "the last summer as a child" he once thought ?? and he certainly lived to the fullest. So if you have a few spare hours you can watch this movie ?? but you won't miss much if you don't.
