This is a lame comedy. <br /> <br /> Here's why: a man and wife sitcom. All right. <br /> <br /> The husband is a shower bag. The Wife is Einstein. <br /> <br /> How original is it? <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller is the same guy as Seinfeld. <br /> <br /> The gags are lame. No witty words. <br /> <br /> I've had enough. Stop it now. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: Stupid. The destruction of the average white boy continues on ABC. The worst part? Kevin James is actually a funny comedian. He's not here. Leah Remini is a great pleasure for the eyes, but it is unlikely. Wasted talent is the word. Bad sitcom.
