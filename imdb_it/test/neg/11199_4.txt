I went to see this on the strength of Albert Finney alone. He is one of my favorite actors and rarely manages to deliver. I'm not sure the plot is interesting or just silly: it's about a little boy being born, but while his mother goes into labor, he refuses to go out! This puts God and the entire human factory in crisis and Albert Finney is called out of purgatory to try to convince the boy to change his mind and decide he wants to be born. So Finney takes the unborn child on an adventure in the Big Apple hoping to show him all the reasons why he should want to live. <br /> <br /> Despite the plot's ridiculousness, I could have accepted it if the director had not tried to turn this into a typical Hollywood sentimental moralist film. From a directorial point of view, the film was made unbearable by a horrible soundtrack of sentimental music that Hollywood directors seem unable to resist. <br /> <br /> He further slaughtered the story a little outside the box by giving away his hand at all times. Whatever plot twist was in store, it was completely revealed by the way the story unfolded. It was as if the director thought that the audience was just a group of idiots who can't see the obvious suggestions coming from a mile away. <br /> <br /> Even Finney in his performance, although satisfying, seemed a little awkward and out of place; and the boy with the curly locks, even if he had to be cute, was actually rather boring. Bridget Fonda seemed intent on duplicating Demi Moore's performance in "Ghost", shedding tears without warning. <br /> <br /> I understand that the film was unsuccessful until it reached US distribution, which is surprisingly I think it has the potential at the box office to be a modest success, appealing to children and emotional adults. As for quality, it's not a horrible film, it's not very nice. (4 out of 10)
