I had never even heard of ONE DARK NIGHT until someone mentioned it on a horror bulletin board here recently, and reading in it, I gained interest due to Meg Tilly's involvement and acknowledging that it was a concert for Friday 13th VI: JASON LIVES director Tom McLoughlin. Unfortunately, sad to say, it's nothing special. The premise is familiar: a university student must survive the night in an old mausoleum until the morning to join a sisterhood. That girl is a young Meg Tilly, like Julie, who wants to show her loving and caring boyfriend Steve (David Mason Daniels) that she can make her cruel and conniving ex-girlfriend, Carol (Robin Evans), regardless of tactics she pulls to see it fail. Together with Carol's band is Kitty (Leslie Speights), always with a toothbrush in her mouth, and Leslie (Elizabeth Daily) who doesn't really want to cause Julie such problems. While Leslie insists on leaving Julie alone while staying in the mausoleum, Carol and Kitty plan to torment the poor girl. Meanwhile Steve searches for her while Julie, Carol and Kitty encounter an evil they could never imagine ... the corpse of a newly ill "psychic vampire", whose telekinesis was dangerously powerful, will try to empty themselves of life force. The only one who can help these girls is the daughter of the dead, Olivia (Melissa Newman) who has the same psychic power she has. <br /> <br /> I think that many will find the unusual evil Threatening the mausoleum the exciting, certainly different from what you normally see in the coupons that were out right now. Like the character of Adam West (.. he was Olivia's cynical husband who found ridiculous the idea of ​​his father's power), I had a really hard time adapting to the sticky plot, and personally I never found anything in the film to be enthusiastic about . The mausoleum for me has never been so spooky (.. it can't reach the same kind of disturbing quality captured by PHANTASM) and the corpses that are used to attack the girls are ridiculously unconvincing (.. there is a great scene in which one the face of the corpse melts). I have a weakness for low-budget films from this time, but I have never been able to find a reason to get involved when you have this unsatisfactory corpse that shoots the electric bolts from the eyes that make other bodies get rid of their crypts to obey their master It is too foolish to take seriously. Carol is your typical blonde bitch who wants to punish a good girl who comes out with an old flame. Steve is the typical, clean and penniless American boy, handsome and tender, who becomes the hero who tries to save his girlfriend from whatever sinister force is at stake. To remedy the small budget, director McLoughlin tries every trick in the book to excite the audience, using a series of ooga-booga effects such as corpses that pursue young girls, chairs that tremble and tremble, doors that close and objects that levitate from only. The film obviously has its fans, and I'm glad I had the chance to see it, but I was a little disappointed that ONE DARK NIGHT wasn't the horror sleeper I was hoping for. Adam West has a very small role in that the worried husband hopes his wife withdraws from his depressive state towards a father who has nothing to do with her. Melissa Newman is the troubled Olivia, recognizing that she must stop her father once and for all, otherwise she would have continued to prey on the living. Donald Hotton is Dockstader, a partner of Olivia's father who informs her of what he was. I wasn't particularly impressed by Tilly's performance here (... she was almost always scared most of the time), but from that moment on she would have had the chance to prove that she was able to prove herself bigger. This will undoubtedly have a certain value for those who have looked back at that time, for the purpose of nostalgia could seduce movie lovers of this era.
