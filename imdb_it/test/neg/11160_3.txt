Arnold fans will giggle with joy, mindless action fans will startle, and Catholics will complain. <br /> <br /> Illogically written by Andrew W. Marlowe and directed by Peter Hyams, * End of Days * extracts The Terminator from his open backed hospital suit (Arnold Schwarzenegger's return to the big screen after the heart operation), while blowing things up in Mysterious Ways and blasphemy in Bible verses to give Catholics something to complain about. <br /> <br /> It's 1999 and doom authors all over the world live in trepidation of their computers by friction and losing their downloaded porn. Although the technological stench of Y2K throbs in the streets of New York, the former policeman becomes an alcoholic security guard, Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger, with the usual "dead-wife-and-kid" back-story due to Loose Cannon), must challenge theological waters to save the 20-year-old virgin Christine (Robin Tunney) from being drafted as ?? wait for it ?? Satan's bride. Dun dah daaaarrrh! Stupidity follows. <br /> <br /> For every antihero, there is his anti-Christ. Gabriel Byrne is the devil here ?? and left to celebrate as if it were 1999, on a mission to impregnate Christine with the Anti-Christ between 11pm and 12am midnight, December 31, 1999 ?? ironically, in the hour when all the porn will be lost ?? thus bringing the end of days. Being able to read minds, evoke hallucinations and use magic without limits, it does not happen to Satan to accelerate the impregnation process by appearing months before and courting Christine as an adolescent model and then easily closing the panty raid at the appointed time; instead, he appears on December 28 as a Keyser Soze Terminator and wonders why he doesn't welcome him with his thighs open? (See above comment re: stupidity.) Here is a film in which nothing makes sense when it is pronounced, not to mention after contemplating its veracity or mythology. A priest (Rod Steiger) tells Jericho that "666" is really "999" upside down with a "1" in front. So wait - * Prince * is the Anti-Christ? <br /> <br /> Satan Soze chases Jericho and Christine (J and C ?? take?) around the city, doing nothing that can actually precipitate their capture. In one scene, Satan recreates Jericho's wife and son to tempt him to reveal where he hid Christine. But if he can see so deeply into the mind of Jericho in recreating his family with enough nuance to inspire nostalgia, why can't he see where Jericho hid Christine not ten minutes ago? <br /> <br /> Satan can make an assassin speak without a language, yet he cannot make that murderer unjam a semiautomatic weapon. And when Jericho shoots Satan point blank, is Satan courteous enough to open his shirt to reveal the wounds that are closing, so Jericho will not be unduly worried about Satan's health - not health to go around with open bullet wounds? In fact, instead of simply owning Jericho to get close to Christine and rape her, Satan spends so much useless energy on side projects (crucify the tongueless boy, blow up Jericho's partner (Kevin Pollak) and then save him, and then do it explode again, ridiculously fighting Jericho when he could turn it off with the effort of thought) that we wonder if a more efficient murderer / lover shouldn't be put on the case ?? for example, Antonio Banderas. <br /> <br /> What I find most valuable in * End of Days * is Arnold's courageous attempt at The Method: "sad" means to curl your eyes and not blur anything with a foreign accent; "depressed" means to lift a bottle on the lips and not blur anything with a foreign accent; "mortally scared" means to widen your eyes and not blur anything with a foreign accent. There is certainly a model here, if only we could decipher it. <br /> <br /> In the end, the devil is not sent by the holy men whom Catholics pray to free themselves from apocalypses like these, but from the Jericho atheist. While the timid men of an impotent god exhort "faith" and vibrate in their cells without doing anything about Satan actually walking among them, the Prince of Darkness is foiled by a nullifidian with a big gun and a foreign accent. Which clearly says something that Catholics blindly refuse to hear: that even if the Devil were to exist, those who were indoctrinated to fear him unconditionally and irrationally would not be able to evoke a belief in his downfall, let alone act towards it . Furthermore, they may not really want him to be defeated, because only through his contrary polarity the existence of their god becomes sustainable. <br /> <br /> Because it is written in the Book of Revelation: "And the Prince of Darkness will descend upon the Earth without a solid game plan, and impregnates a virgin on a date that will have no meaning until the Gregorian Calendar of 1500 adopts the numbering of the day that will put it in sync with the equinoxes and syntax of Domine Year that will annoy reasonable people for millennia, at that time, Christians will have forgotten the actual date of birth of Christ and appropriated of the pagan Saturnalia festival in its place, and the Prince will carry out a revolution through tight purple pants and members of the ambiguous-lesbian gang ?? "I can believe that people are drained of blood and crucified and that the alcoholic is built like a Mr. Universe; I can believe that a giant and supernatural monster can't kill a boy armed only with a foreign accent; I can even believe that the devil has to perform some rituals of the thirteenth century Celtic druid as foreplay - but what I can't believe is the twenty year old virgin from New York in 1999. <br /> <br /> Especially around Prince ...
