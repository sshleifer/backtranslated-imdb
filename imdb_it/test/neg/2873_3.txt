wow ... I just watched this movie ... Americans have this stereotypical vision of Hindi movies like, ALL Indian movies have dances, songs and a love story .... It's as pathetic as it is far from the truth that it is. This film simply exposes the stereotypical Western vision of Hindi films. Horrible acting, horrible direction, horrible cinematography. And all this from a Hollywood director. Most Indian films today are much more content-driven, realistic, touching and meaningful than this piece of shit. Indian cinema (not only Hindi) also covers a variety of different topics. Just like most other Hollywood films these days, this shows a very stereotypical view of another country, where the truth is thrown out the window. This is a highly NOT recommended film. Look at good Hindi films like black Friday, eklavya, omkara, khakee, awarapan, gangster, don, zakhm, dor, sholay, mother India, lagaan ... Those films are what real Indian cinema is.
