A sprawling comedy, ambitious, without plot, which has no dramatic center. It was probably destined to have an epic vision and a surrealist touch (at least in some episodes), but the separate stories are never elevated to a significant whole, and the laughter is few and far between. Fun end, though. (* 1/2)
