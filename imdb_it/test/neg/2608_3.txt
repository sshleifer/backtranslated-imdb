He had his moments, but overall when I looked at this cartoon as a child I was bored to death. The only thing that made me look was the fact that it was a cartoon, probably my first exposure to souls. It's also one of my less favorite souls, I remember that others were about a giant ship in space that didn't make sense, but it was more fun because they were in space. I also remember one with these people dressed as birds which was a bit strange, but more fun. I don't like car racing very much, I'm not and I'm not one yet, so it's probably one of the reasons I didn't care about this show, even though today I'm a passionate fan of anime. Even the characters were a bit stupid, and then there were horrible scenes where practically no action took place that was probably used to reduce animation costs and to fill the show. The gadgets in the cars were fantastic and gave me some fun then. Overall, I find that this show is quite unwatchable compared to new animations and some from the same era, but this is just a personal opinion. I'm sure many other reviewers love the show which is nice.
