If it were possible to give negative stars I would do it for this stinkburger. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong. LOOOOOOVVVEEEE a good lousy movie. I'm a big fan of movies like Octoman, Wizard Of Mars, Queen King and others. True classics of B-Cinema. <br /> <br /> But this film does indeed make Jack Nicolson and Boris Karloff in The Terror an academic prize winner !! The Dialouge is so unnecessarily long-winded, and mostly used inappropriately. (ex. "I will now Condensate (yes, condensed !!) to your desires. The acting could have been much better if they had had some logical lines. <br /> <br /> The story? What a story, A the count is "exiled because his wife was leprosy? I'm still not sure about this count. A (rich?) fleet and the captain of one of his ships crashing on the island? People act unnaturally? OK, I like the camp in b -filmi much, there is a lot of charm, but this is just stupid..more stupid.a salty sea captan who sounds just as experienced as a university professor? A fleet owner who is as insipid as they are (I felt this guy had no idea how to play it, a scene is Spanish acting, the next English / European)? The count, who is not sure if it is a reincarnation or really DeSade (Don't ask me how DeSade calculates this, after 4 beers my wife, friend and I still couldn't understand it. <br /> <br /> The f fear actor? I could show this turkey to my little grandchildren and worry only that they sleep the first 60s horror movies, and some still have good shocks, but this thing ... never had a shock, or even a hint of fear. <br /> <br /> On the information on the back it says, "This film contains such vivid and degrading scenes that will overcome your worst nightmare." THE ONLY degradation is WATCHING THIS FILM. It's 90 minutes (the case says it's 74 minutes) of your life that you don't come back. <br /> <br /> I only paid a penny, yes a dollar, for this and another movie. I still feel indebted to 50 cents even if I sit down. <br /> <br /> In summary, Dungeon Of Harrow had NO ONE named Harrow, but he had a nice cardboard dungeon.
