No Holds Barred is a film that should never be taken seriously. It sucks like a serious movie. See it more in the way you should Plan 9 From Outer Space. I am one in the same as both are so bad that they are funny. The funny moments in No Holds Barred are usually the ones that shouldn't be. When Rip (played by Hulk Hogan as he alone can play them) he grabs the limo driver off the front after his first encounter with Brell's deception (Kurt Fuller) and is a part of the movie that every person should see. It could be the funniest scene ever, I swear. <br /> <br /> However, as someone thought this film would make money, I'll never know and probably that person should be beaten into submission. I hope they have at least been fired. This film earns 1 out of 5 on my scale and that's just for the unintentionally funny parts.
