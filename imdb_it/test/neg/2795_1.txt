PU WITH CONTAINING SPOILERS. This film was the worst movie ever. I couldn't even see it all so badly. This movie is actually worse than a scarecrow that is saying a lot. This was worse than those terrorists who sometimes terrified the toon was sometimes funny. Not even the film's blood was good. The shootings were false and the acting was worse. Please do yourself a favor and skip this. If you see it at the rental point, run to the other side. There is nothing good about this movie. If you want to see a good scarecrow movie, look at the Scarecrow Night or the Pumpkin Head. If you want to see a new cheese movie, look at Scarecrow. I consider this film a 0.2 out of 10. It is so horrible that this film really is. THE WORST MOVIE EVER.
