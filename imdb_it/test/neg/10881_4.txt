Continuing in the sequence of films "stalker / slasher" in the vein of "Wolf Creek", "Hostel", "Joy Ride", etc., "Rest Stop" arrives. The most non-original and useless of all. <br /> <br /> Let's start, reasonably promising, with the violent death of a pretty girl in a dirty bathroom. <br /> <br /> Here is where interest is lost. So let's go to the couple of clich√© road trips to Los Angeles with their eyes on celebrity. . . that, by making films like this, they will never get. <br /> <br /> From sexual amusement in the park, the driving couple, arguing to the bottom, to a deserted and disgusting rest area for the girl to use the bathroom. Innocent until he leaves and discovers that his boyfriend has disappeared and realizes he is being haunted by a lame version of the "Ride Nail" Rusty Nail. . . just going around in Mater's "Cars". <br /> <br /> Honestly, if this had been directed / written / produced / played by anyone else, it could have been pretty good. But no. <br /> <br /> Because then comes the ghost story. Yup. . . you guessed. A lot of "oh, I'll help you, but wait, you're dead" to "wait for this stalker to be a person, a monster or a ghost?" <br /> <br /> But wait? Who comes to the rescue to save the girl's life and maybe the movie? That brother of Lawerence. Excellent. We are saved. (sarcasm) Oh wait, no, we're not. <br /> <br /> Sai. . . if you want to laugh pretty badly, or if you get free rentals like I do, try it. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, you'll learn how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
