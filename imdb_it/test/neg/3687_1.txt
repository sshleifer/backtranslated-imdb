I've never made comments here on IMDb, but as I've seen this movie, I can't be quiet. I just created my account here just because this horrible movie. in two words, this film is PURE CRAP. the film makes no sense! Nothing makes sense in this film. Watching this movie was painful to the end. I don't understand why Val Kilmer agreed to make this film. It plays a secondary role as a gang leader, says a few words, and it's there like 5 minutes in total. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD based only on the name of Val Kilmer on the box and the interesting photos on the cover. <br /> <br /> As stated in another review, Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back !!! The title of the film itself gave the idea of ​​the evaluation that everyone should give: ZERO
