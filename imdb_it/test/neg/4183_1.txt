This thing. oh god this thing i can't even call it a movie. a movie is something that does something. goes somewhere has some semblance of plot or SOMETHING. I don't know how I'm doing it, I really don't. first I say that the dark fields are the worst film ever. and I thought it was. then the pirates of the ghost island showed me that I was wrong. and now, for the third consecutive time, another film goes far beyond the duty to prove myself wrong. <br /> <br /> (sighs) OK. Dark Harvest II: The Maize. Sir, this is terrible. Let it be uncomfortable for you. The man perceives that his daughters are in danger through some magical psychic powers that he apparently got from his popcorn Act II and runs to find them in a cornfield. Of course this is the largest cornfield in all of existence, being the size of wheat fields by Jeepers Creepers, Children of the Corn and Signs combined. the main character, whose name is Shy (fantastic name btw), crosses a corn field .... finds ghost girls, talks to them and ... goes through a wheat field. digs a little ... and runs through a cornfield. and the incredibly sad thing? I'm not really leaving anything. This is pretty much the whole movie. The only thing I could leave out is how it is chased by two policemen who want to arrest him for ... I don't know. pretending to be an actor. I didn't care about this point. He leaves and the police is - something different - from the killer off screen. holy shit is there a killer? apparently yes, there is how almost 4/5 was introduced in the film. but wait! then he runs away for a while and there, you guessed it, the more he runs through the cornfield and digging. Then there is the ending where he saves his daughters. huzzah. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this film is, it's boring. it is INCREDIBLY, INHIDENTLY, TREMENDOUSLY boring. I can't explain how atrociously this thing is dull. nothing happens, the characters are as attractive as a root canal, and it's only an hour and a half of NOTHING. The ONLY good thing that came out of this film was that my friend and I could have found enlightenment due to the near-nirvana state that this film put us after the effects of drugs in our brain had to take over to survive. During the madness that followed, I found embracing a much more pleasant wall and my friend found a new passion to laugh hysterically while leaning all over the floor as if he had an attack. This is the kind of madness that this film brings. it's not just bad. it hurts the health The cover looks fantastic with the image of a terrible scarecrow assassin who I would totally consider a horror disguise, but this was THE most misleading box ever. DON'T LET IT EVEN GREETINGS! DO NOT watch this movie. watch a better corn film. ALL corn films are better. don't let yourself be taken! they don't! 0 out of 10
