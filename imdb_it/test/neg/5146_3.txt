During production, this LWT series was titled "Rocket To The Moon", a title that everyone on the set at the time thought was quite poor. Then came the news that it was titled "Reach for the Moon", as if this addition of this new word evoked heavy metaphorical meanings involving the relationships and aspirations of the characters. This same heavy lack of subtlety and understanding is clear throughout the fabric of the entire series, and the same story of the tired and boring love triangle is actually extended over 7 episodes! Any television program that decides to use the "love triangle" plot even for a single episode pushes it, but spreading it over seven episodes is unforgivable. There are reasons to look anyway, with the Isle of Wight scenario that certainly provides a beautiful scenery, and the seemingly effortless performance of Lynda Bellingham that hits all the signs of the right comedy. This, however, is not enough. A number of performances are remarkable, especially if placed against the static and emotionless desolate land that Jonathan Kerrigan defines his face. I have already mentioned Lynda Bellingham in the role of "fussy mother" (yes, as far as character development and background are concerned), but I was struck by actor Maurice Roeves (who is by far the most experienced actor in the cast , appeared in all classic films such as "Oh What a Lovely War" by Richard Attenborough and "The Eagle Has Landed", and on TV as Baywatch, Holby City, The Bill, Eastenders, Cheers, Doctor Who in the 80s, Star Trek, and even going to Hollywood with Sylvestor Stallone in 1995 Judge Dredd) whose performance reminded me a lot of the teachers I met - often incompetent men, whose lives are tinged with a very sad vein. It's nice to see that Roeves is still working, having also appeared in the 1998 British film "The Acid House" and, even more recently, alongside the wonderful Maria Bello and Sean Bean in "The Dark". The main reason to watch this series, even if its appearances are very few. Another actor who does his best to elevate the program is Ben Miles, in the role of the "typical man" brother of sex (once again, what an original character!). As with Roeves, the CV says it all. After raising it, Miles appeared in the Hollywood movie "V for Vendetta", and in the 2001 star movie "The Affair of the Necklace", alongside Brian Cox, Adrien Brody, Christopher Walken and Jonathan Pryce. Unfortunately the quite capable actors I mentioned are resigned to relatively small roles compared to the dramatic driftwood that is Kerrigan and Saira Todd, who seem to have been in Casualty for too long and have not yet learned to act. Even the tolerable Frances Gray is forced to suffer in the presence of such fetishly fetish mannequins, and unfortunately for her, the lasting memory I have of her from the set, is of the CEO asking for another shot of a relatively complex shot because during the take it, she unconsciously "pulled her panties out of her crack!" Familiar faces appear in each episode - child actors from CBBC programs and dramas like "2 Point 4 Children" and other spot regulars like Mr Ben's ("they will remember me for that"), Lynda "the Oxo lady" "Bellingham, and others I don't even want to remember. Each episode tries to "tackle problems" like teenage pregnancy, destructive pupils and rocket building (!) ... things that Grange Hill was doing better when my parents were young! , this series was a disappointment and a wasted opportunity to create a really interesting and well-developed drama series. Unfortunately, for them they took the easy way, both in writing (mostly) in casting, I would recommend "Waterloo Road "that" The Street ", to fans of a good drama - the latter in particular that managed to achieve this goal. If you like the Isle of Wight, do not" reach the moon ", instead look for the brochure of the the holidays - probably contains more character development!
