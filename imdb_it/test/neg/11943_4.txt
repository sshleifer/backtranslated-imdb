Yes, I wrote well. This film is so predictable, the current word needs additional letters to exemplify predictability. From the moment the main characters and the situation are introduced, it's time to paint the numbers on where this plot will take us. The prefiguration was as thin as a two-ton club. You could take numerous dialogues and anticipate the role you would have in the final. <br /> <br /> Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhardt did a decent job in non-committal roles and Abigail Breslin played the cute role admirably. It's just that the film has brought absolutely nothing new to the genre of romantic comedy. The love story was warm and the laughter was weak and few. Sure, it's an OK movie if you have nothing to look at, but you won't miss anything by missing this.
