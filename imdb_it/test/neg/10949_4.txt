The concept: shows 4 families of different ethnic groups in the Fairfax district of L.A. getting ready for the family reunion at Thanksgiving. I loved Soul Food and How to Make an American Quilt (I think there is a law that Alfre Woodard must be in all these films) that offered a pastiche of family traditions and was prepared for a gift. Instead, I felt cheated. About 40+ characters trot, and all but two are cliches of a note without any finesse. Writers and the director should spend a few more years learning life and learning how to love people of different generations. Instead, there are a lot of ** holes that come together on the day of Turkey to act like an extra hateful hole. Now, to a certain extent, this is what makes Thanksgiving. But not this wrong. And why worry about having Julianne Marguiles, so give her absolutely nothing to do. This was a matter to be overcome, and Mercedes Ruehl is a standout, but I give it 4/10.
