I was looking forward to this movie. Being an old fan of Robert E Howard, mainly from a Conan point of view. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much and thought they couldn't mess up too ... Oh dear - how wrong I was .... <br /> <br /> flaw was that it was pretty boring. He had to compress with a nice help of supernatural actions, sword fights and the like. <br /> <br /> You have some blood, but everything else was simply lifeless. The central section seemed to involve 40 minutes in a muddy forest with slowly drawn horse-drawn carts and even slower dialogue and character development! <br /> <br /> On the positive side = Costumes and effects were fine, but not enough to keep your interest. <br /> <br /> I think it would have been better to reduce the gore, increase the time and get a score of 12A. As a child of ten, maybe I liked this movie. Probably about the age when I was reading Conan's stories pretty funny. Perhaps this says a lot about my anticipation of the film? <br /> <br /> Or ....... You really go "Art-House" with tone, direction, etc. But this is quite high risk so far. As for the Box Office. <br /> <br /> Oh well ... Maybe Conan's next film will compensate?
