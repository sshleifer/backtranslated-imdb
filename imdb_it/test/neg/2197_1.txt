We can conclude that there are 10 types of people in this world. <br /> <br /> Those who understand the track and those who do not. Those who understand the track put this film in his grave along with hackers, while those who enjoy this film for the sake that none of these crap could happen. Always. <br /> <br /> For a film that tries to be a modern movie with fiction applied to it. He has failed. Horribly. Only an 11 year old and below can enjoy and only 30 years can be scared to have their own identity. It is lost in the main market for a resale value (I watch it now is more boring than when it was first released).
