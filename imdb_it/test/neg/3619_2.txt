Snake Island is one of those films that, while one sits down and observes his incredible level of stupidity, makes one wish that the camera was never invented. The real reason why Plan 9 From Outer Space will keep its honored title of Worst Film Of All Time for some time to come is not so much because of how bad it is. It's the fact that it's the funniest bad movie you've ever seen. Snake Island is the other kind of evil. The island of snakes is so bad that it is atrocious. A stupid premise is combined with a script written by monkeys who beat typewriters on transparencies that were then superimposed to resemble dialogue to make the most obvious problems here. Shot entirely in South Africa, the environments in which the film takes place are the only element that can truly be considered well-made. Many shots involving snakes consist of so surreal-looking close-ups that one begins to wonder if the snakes are CGIs, puppets or real snakes that have been fed with really heavy drugs. <br /> <br /> The stars of William Katt, if you can call it that, like an author traveling to an island resort on what appears to be a river ferry. Coming with him is an assortment of very generic and undefined characters. It's all about random screen writing about who survives to the end, but it looks like Katt is contemplating firing his agent. The rest of the cast seems to come from the acting school of Home And Away, where every contemplation of an unpleasant plan is accompanied by eyes wide open in an open mouth and flashes in every direction. The sound effects are often worse, with a memorable scene in which a double-barreled gun sounds like rather flat sound effects used to accompany gunfire in games like BioForge. Meanwhile, snakes explode continuously or jump around randomly. It would have been more accurate to call the movie Snake Holocaust. <br /> <br /> Of course, no Z-quality horror or sci-fi movies are completed these days without free scenes of single women stripped. Almost all the women in the cast take off their clothes, the film starts to become less Snake Island and more Snake Island Orgy. But like all the worst batteries, all that's really in this case is a lot of setup without any real profit. Sex scenes never occur, and the death of the characters is so flat, so uninteresting, that the whole movie becomes useless. Unless you think of watching William Katt go through a sultry forest wearing an unsuitable cricket gear and snaking snakes in all directions with a cricket bat as a reward. For the record, I don't. I used to think that Anaconda was the worst movie ever made on predatory snakes. I was very, very wrong. At least Anaconda had a snake that could be feared if they stopped disbelief for quite some time. Some of the snakes that have been shown to kill the human cast are no bigger than the laces of the combat shoes I wore. <br /> <br /> So we have the checklist for bad horror movies that run well. The unrecognizable and irrelevant cast is considered, as are the poor audio and visual effects. The dialogue is so unhappy, so inappropriate, that I've seen better write and deliver during some of the school performances I have performed in many moons ago. Unfortunately, where Snake Island falters in this regard is the fatal area for all bad movies. Essentially, forget about being so bad that it's fun. It's so bad that it stops being good after the opening credits and becomes painful when the cast starts talking. Compared to William Katt's performance on Snake Island, Jon Voight's performance in Anaconda was as Oscar-worthy as that of Russell Crowe in Gladiator. Not that Voight or Katt are necessarily bad actors, but with a material like this, you find it difficult to say a single word naturally. Listening to a few lines here was like being the victim of a violent crime. Your mind tends to empty the experience, primary as a self-defense mechanism. <br /> <br /> Due to the aforementioned failure to be incredibly bad, I gave Snake Island a two out of ten. My special soundtrack for films so bad they can't be good, but not enough to entertain. It's all so boring or useless that you could even look at the test pattern. The correct way to do the "crap" is S-N-A-K-E-I-S-L-A-N-D.
