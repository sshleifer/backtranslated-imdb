An exclusive sequel to John Carpenter's Vampires, this film takes place in Thailand and involves a sect of evil vampires, who love to kill people and a sect of good vampires who don't. Although it is an interesting idea to set a vampire movie in Thailand, the writers don't seem to do much with exotic settings. This film could easily have been set in Los Angeles. Which brings me to my next point, which looks very similar to Blade Lite. We have the soundtrack of rock, the battle scenes of martial arts, the drainage of a disco and, of course, many sharp objects that run through vampires. What we don't have is budget and talent. Yes, the hero is a good martial arts fighter, too bad his acting wasn't so good, and there's a lot of decent wire work and tons of fighting sequences, maybe too many. The problem is that they don't have the same impact as those in the Blade movies. Maybe it's just that the film has a "been there since" I hear. <br /> <br /> However, for me the biggest problem was that the directors didn't take enough time to establish the relationship between the protagonist, played by the buff and bland Colin Egglesfield, and his girlfriend. She is kidnapped at the beginning of the film after a vulgar exchange with her boyfriend. At this point we have no personal interest in her well-being and no reason to believe that her boyfriend would be willing to risk his neck to save her. This is one of the biggest disadvantages when it is the main thrust of the plot. <br /> <br /> In the end, you could do worse than waste 85 minutes of your time with this, but I can think of much better things to do with your time, like renting any of the Blade movies.
