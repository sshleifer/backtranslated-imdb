This film has good performances, as others have pointed out, but suffers (as others have pointed out, except for the people who are apparently or the friends of the director or cast to explain otherwise why they would consider it a "10") from some padding self-conscious and self-absorbed film schools and excess plots. This is the kind of storyline that Sex In The City could handle in a half-hour episode, so there was no reason why it was even an 88-minute movie. A perfect example of a wasted movie is fast forward editing in the first third of the film. Some of the background is well deserved, but too much time, for example, was spent on Daria's character with the anal sex boy and the back of Paulie, who was not a realistic character, although the actor did a decent job with lines has been given. <br /> <br /> The worst aspect of the film was the level of the amateur parts: from typing errors in typed material, to bad jumps and changes, to bad camera positions, to corners, to lighting problems and , so blatantly, to a poor script written with a poorly developed concept. If the writer (even the director and the protagonist) had collaborated with someone, he might not have ended up with a 100% rotten score on Rotten Tomatoes, which goes beyond anyone's ability to truly believe the people who gave him a 10 evaluation system here.
