What can be said of this independent effort besides the fact that it was shot with video cameras, and that it is by presumption or budget constraints, does not make it easier to see this variation on a Romero theme. I was constantly reminded that I was looking at someone's school project, at best, in the worst economic case. <br /> <br /> The writer / director Georg Koszulinski (who also appears in the film) does some interesting things with archive material, but says more about his editing style than his directing style, which consists of firsts in-camera plans with cameras that made me think I was watching public access television instead of a real honest-good movie. br /> <br /> The story copies and pastes fragments from various sources, including the already mentioned DEAD trilogy by Romero, THE ROAD WARRIOR (digging that movie of a "future" that looks like the past) and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. <br /> <br /> What results is the value of an hour and zero of zombies that track and eat humans. (Okay, the "humans" in this case are clones, but that doesn't change anything. It's the same menu.) <br /> <br /> The year is 2031, and the first strand of people who were cloned nineteen years ago they started to malfunction, particularly in the food area. Of course, when clones go wrong, the first thing they taste like is human flesh (or, in this case, cloned human flesh). It is not safe to be at home, it is not safe to be outdoors. It's only a matter of time before the demons eat meat devour our heroes. Have you seen this before? <br /> <br /> I don't mind that people rob Romero, if it's done right, but no new territory is covered in this film. IT'S NIGHT OF LIVING DEATH meets THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, shot with cameras. What is particularly disappointing is that the DVD cover seems to have been shot, at least, with an 8 mm film. This wouldn't have been a problem with me if the story wasn't as cheap. The film offers a bleak view of the future where technology has evolved to the point where human cloning is possible. Should we continue to clone our favorite movies?
