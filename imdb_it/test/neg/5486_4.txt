Now I have seen some films by Pedro Almodóvar, but this should be the most disappointing so far. This film seemed to lack the light-heartedness that is usually everywhere in his films, and the story never interested me. Many directors of Almodóvar appear in this film, so it's not like there was a lack of talent on the screen, but this film seemed more serious than his other films. If there was a comic side to this film, I certainly couldn't find it, and it was made for a surprisingly weak film.
