'Til There You You is one of the worst movies we've ever seen. It fails in every respect. Jeanne Tripplehorn was better (as an actress ...) in Waterworld. In comparison, this film is Dungworld. When a character stumbles once, or even twice, during a movie, you can understand it. But the character of Jeanne falls, stumbles, stumbles so often that she could have a bit of Jerry Lewis in her. In his defense, every fall (prat?) Was probably blocked, choreographed and tested. And tried. Although this is bad enough for a film, the actors (Dylan McDermott and Jeanne Tripplehorn) seem to spend most of the plot going "out for a smoke" or trying to find a place to smoke. If the film was a diatribe for not having a place to smoke - Ok - BUT, it's not. <br /> <br /> However, for how long this movie works, it's too long 10 minutes after the running time. /> <br /> Oh, Jeanne Tripplehorn, ALMOST acting in a public forum meeting. ALMOST SEE you break life into character. Oh, it's almost as convincing as his scene that screams to Michael Douglas in Basic Instinct - hmm, in retrospect, not really. <br /> <br /> This is a film to be avoided at all costs unless you need a cigarette and are trapped in anonymous nicotine junkies or forced to watch HOOPER's outtakes (Burt Reynolds). And even then, toss a coin or go to sleep.
