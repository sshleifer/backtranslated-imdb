Maureen O'Hara is always beautiful and attractive. Here she plays a terminally ill actress. We don't know with what. It's a bit of a forerunner of "Love Story" in this sense. <br /> <br /> William Bendix is ​​good, like most of the supporting cast. John Payne is destined to suffer but looks like a sleepwalker. The girl who plays the child that he and O'Hara adopt does his best with an invented plot device: Sure! Adopt an orphan. She will live after your wife's death. It's a sweet film but it doesn't seem sincere to me. I was hoping to be moved. I was, with the kindness of O'Hara. But I don't like feeling manipulated.
