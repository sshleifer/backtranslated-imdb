Stay away from this ... No, I'm really serious - I know you might think this is a Hong Kong B-style action movie, fun, campy and stylish. I did it, but believe me, it isn't. In fact, the only precise thing about this description would be the word Hong Kong, and therefore used only in a strictly geographical sense. <br /> <br /> Yes, Donnie Yen co-directed it. Jackie Chan has a cameo. The boy Ekin Cheng, from Storm Riders, is the protagonist. He's got vampires. It should be good - or at least fun, fascinating and full of action. Once again - it is not. <br /> <br /> I could digress about why this movie sucks - I could dissect it, turn it into small shivering pieces. But where to start? There's so much to hate ... <br /> <br /> To make it simpler, and to give this hate-fest some credibility, let me tell you that I'm usually a big fan of Hog Kong's movies. The heaviest dramatic material as well as the lightest and / or comedy action. Really good movies as well as really bad ones. I can spend hours of bad subtitling, jokes enough to make the first pupils look up. I can handle lovers as chaste and unmarried as a nun convention, and pretty much anything else that the average movie-goer would beat with their metaphorical fingers on their way between action sequences. Also, Hong Kong or any other source - I like it when a movie moves from doing bad to bad enough to be good. <br /> <br /> But this - Arrgh! It's just a horrible thing, stupid, unwatchable garbage. Far from being funny or fascinating, it's actually painful. Thus derived from the action makes a Bergman film similar to the Texas chainsaw massacre. <br /> <br /> Why? Why waste an opportunity like this?! This could have been so fun!
