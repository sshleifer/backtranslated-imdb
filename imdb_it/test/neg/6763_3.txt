Jeff Morrow is Leslie Gaskell, Barbara Laurence is Vera Hunter and John Emory is Hubbel Eliot. Together with some members of the Air Force staff and a cartoon fanatic, they are in charge of a super-secret underground laboratory on the west coast. Morrow is thrilled when he discovers a meteor passing through the atmosphere but is not offended when the meteor decides to dive into the Pacific Ocean and emerge as a fantastic car on the Mexican coast. <br /> <br /> No one knows what this colossal block structure is. Obviously it is a sort of carpored artifact because it is all formed by right angles with a kind of bald sphere partially visible at the top. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the machine, nicknamed Kronos, comes from some distant planet and was sent here to steal the land of energy. You see, here on earth, we learned how to convert matter into energy, but on the planet of Kronos they discovered the other half of the equation - how to convert energy into matter. And now they are running out of energy on the other planet. Are you taking notes on this? Well. <br /> <br /> Perhaps you will be able to give me some of the scientific questions raised by Kronos's mission. For example, if Kronos builders can convert energy into matter and vice versa, why not just convert some reserve material into energy instead of sending elaborate machines to extinguish lights in Los Angeles? But it is doubtful that even writers could explain it. The reversal of the polarities of two antennas is described as an "anthropic conversion", which means a "change towards the human", which makes no sense. But it does not seem that any of the sciences makes sense for that matter. The diagram that Morrow draws on the board makes the current go in the wrong direction, from positive to negative. <br /> <br /> There is also a problem with Kronos locomotion. He marches along the coast, threatening "populated areas" (read Southern California), but has no joints in his two or three legs. These strains slowly hit up and down, crushing some people. The film doesn't do much with these crushed people. They are shown as Mexican farmers, so maybe they don't count too much. Even the USAF launches a hydrogen bomb on Kronos - while in Mexico, beware. No one raises their eyebrows. <br /> <br /> Not much acting is required and not much is given. Jeff Morrow has a distinct and resonant voice, great for radio or for voice over TV. His face is less expressive. He has only one expression, no matter what the situation - a tight smile, as if he had had himself photographed at Universal Studios Tour. Barbara Laurence had a fine and golden quality when she did "Street With No Name" some years before. She was a thin seventeen year old as Richard Widmark's wife. Here, her care and behavior reduce her to the level of the film actress B, although she is still beautiful. It's always nice to see Morris Ankrum in one of these films. He made so many, I confused them. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film appears flat, I'm afraid. (There are some nice shots of a B-47 in flight, though.) The sets reveal a low-budget venture. This is not necessarily negative in itself, but there is nothing to compensate for sterile settings. Little tension in the script, no display by the director and little effort in the performances. <br /> <br /> You could enjoy a little - a relaxed high - because this is clearly indisputable. It's just that there are so many better movies out there.
