Persuaded by the 7.0 points in IMDb, which is quite good, I decided to watch this movie. However, I found this film a bit boring (about 2 hours) and full of clichés, a little girl who has more personality after a childhood trauma etc. Tamer KAradagli is calm in this film, dialogue movements, etc., You will have to see him, he is rather the tough cop you see in American movies, perhaps copied too much. I would describe this film as a normal American thriller with a Turkish twist. Unfortunately once again I am convinced that comedies and dramas are the only genres that are worth watching in Turkish cinema. However I gave this film a 4, it's too boring and full of clichés
