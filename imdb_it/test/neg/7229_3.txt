As if the world hadn't already had enough cheap Jaws imitations, writer Boaz Davidson decided to make the sequel to his Ropey-but-reasonably fun-pleasing creature-movie, a complete rip-off of Spielberg's classic, up to have an interested policeman whom no one believes, and a mayor more concerned about his July 4th celebrations than for people's lives. <br /> <br /> Even in the hands of an extremely experienced director, it is unlikely that this derived junk could have been anything other than the garbage of Hokey B-movie, but with Yossi Wein (yes THE Yossi Wein!) who call the shots behind the camera, a man with a fraction of Mr. Spielberg's talent (estimate about 1/10000), Octopus 2 is guaranteed to be as ugly as you might imagine! <br /> <br /> The predictable and extremely clich√© plot doesn't deserve to be described in great detail (it replaces Jaws Amity Island with New York and Bruce the Shark with a giant octopus gum and you get the juice), although several points on the film ar It is definitely worth mentioning, simply because they are so funny: all octopus attacks involve actors struggling to make real giant tentacles look incredibly fake, which is hilarious; The capital of Bulgaria, Sofia, is not convincing for New York, and the excessive use of archive material makes the illusion even less convincing; above all, a stupid sequence of dreams that sees the rubber octopus attacking our hero at the top of the Statue of Liberty, is not only incredibly stupid, but also has some really terrible special effects. <br /> <br /> Even the Davidson script I know when to stop: there are several points in this film where it could (and probably should) have ended, but the action goes on forever, with the octopus that survives several explosions and causes a tunnel to collapse (trapping the film's love interest and a group of kids) before being swept away by the hero. <br /> <br /> Sometimes very silly, always terribly technically, but never really scary, this smelly STV could find fans among those who actively seek out cinematic junk. However, most normal people should be warned to drive well.
