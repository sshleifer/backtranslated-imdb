Just like most people, I couldn't wait to see this sequel to Ocean's 11, but I'm really sorry, I have to say. It stinks because there simply isn't a good script, it was just cheap. I hope the producers will donate all the money that this film has made (or will do) to the tsunami victims in Asia, so this film will have at least a good reason to exist. It's so bad that I can't even write a decent comment about it, but ... I still recommend the creators of this thing to make "Ocean's 13". The 13 of Ocean will be the same thieves who are trying to steal a well-hidden script somewhere in Hollywood. The thirteenth member will be a foreign scriptwriter (perhaps Russian) who knows all the tricks to write a copy of this well-hidden script, so that they can replace the original that they will have to steal. Or they need to find at least 13 people to write a decent script for a film in which not only Julia Roberts plays herself, but also all the other members of Ocean's movie stars. 13 people because it is the lucky number of the character of Andy Garcia.
