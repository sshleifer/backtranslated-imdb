I remember when they had a big problem with this when it came out. They showed clips every week on WWF TV and everyone was excited. The opening weekend debuted at number two behind Indiana Jones and the last crusade. Then he took a dive. Critics hated this movie. I don't remember seeing a good review. Everyone agreed that it was ugly and sometimes grotesque. I didn't know they wanted to say then, but now I do since the film makes references to gay bars, women are slapped hard and almost raped and a disgusting bathroom bar with overflowing urinals lol. When I was younger, I didn't care about that. It was Hulkamania, brother !!! <br /> <br /> Now I find it rather ugly, but still fun to watch once in a while when paired with Bodyslam (which has a better plot). First of all, the acting skills of Hulk Hogan are not great. it is as one-dimensional as the character in the wrestling ring. And actually, Rip and Hulk are not far from each other. Kurt Fuller is a good actor, but he's not good at playing the villain. He's better at comic characters and nervous dramas. He is not as credible as Brell. There is not much character development in this film and those who suffer from it are the characters of Randy, the brother of Rip and Charlie the trainer (In wrestling his anthem of a coach who escapes from a wrestler to the lol ring). Tiny Lister plays Zeus as it should be played, so there is no problem there. Joan Severence is passable and for all you softcore hounds, she has a lingerie scene lol. In the end, you understand, what's the point? <br /> <br /> For this (as with other films or wrestling films that include wrestlers like the main star), turn off the brain. You will have more fun if you do it.
