Corey Haim plays a kid pairing with a dog to catch a giant troll and an OAS hit man (Michael Ironside) with 30/30 and homemade bombs (which seems plausible considering Haim) Oh and he also protects his mother his girlfriend even in this watchable but disappointing adaptation of a decent story. Corey Haim is terrible, of course, but the sheer momentum of the film and the imposing presence of Ironsides make this film at least modest. However the plot is ridiculous and it would have been nicer if we could have seen a monster or at least another gore. At least it's something different. Also it is quite probable that this film will be the last teenage movie for a while to show a teenager making bats. <br /> <br /> Matt Bronson 2/5
