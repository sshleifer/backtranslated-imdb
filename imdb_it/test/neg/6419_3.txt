Has a college acting exercise been filmed and released as a film? The ant and stylized posture of a "horror" soap opera for people who don't like horror movies, but who want to be able to tell friends that, yes, they saw a horror movie. It also features soap opera music. <br /> <br /> Do the books that fall from library shelves scare you? Do the doors terrify you? Then this movie is for you. Have you ever been kidnapped? Yes, most of us have. When you were raped, was he simply ignored, why was the rapist a cool guy? What is scary is not this film, but the vision of this director of the world. <br /> <br /> And then the little twists aren't even original. This is a movie for people who have never seen a horror movie before, who don't want to see one now, and who want to see another movie about everyone conspiring against the weird guy.
