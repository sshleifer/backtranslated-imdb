I checked it out at the Vancouver International Film Festival and it didn't impress me. <br /> <br /> The only area of ​​the film that I liked was the commentary on the film production. For the most part, this film seemed random and somehow fantastic (I don't say it in a complementary way, anyway) and just silly. It was as if he were mixing fantasy with everyday life, which may seem intriguing in some films, but the fantasy simply seemed to be uselessly perverse. <br /> <br /> My criticisms of this film are not about the actors, rather the story itself. I found it boring and narcissistic. I wanted my money back, but considering it was a film festival, it wouldn't have happened.
