A couple is divided during a vacation. The first scenes lead us to believe that Barney, the character of Jeff Bridges, has kidnapped the girl in an inexplicable but premeditated kidnapping. The film comes out a few years later, where, despite a new love interest, Jeff (Kiefer Sutherland) is determined to resolve his disappearance. <br /> <br /> The plot is decidedly intriguing, but there were some really wrong decisions made during the making of this film, which culminates in a rather poor job. <br /> <br /> OK, here we are. The scene of the kidnapping - apart from two serious errors of continuity, there is a point where Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are forced to perform a small pet-signed love ritual that is drowned by an excess of sentimentality to nausea . We know they are in love; the speech "I solemnly swear to never leave you" only a few moments before was a big thank you. Jeff Bridges' robotic accent is another example. What is it for? Starman is back and it seems that after a decade on the planet, it has become bad. The entire plot is therefore able to be solved by introducing a useless character who, with a rather fortunate turning point in destiny, has rather miraculous powers of observation. The same climatic sequence has essentially been done before only much, much better. It is full of further annoyances and another blitz of blinding continuity. I could go on, but something positive must be said. Suddenly, Kiefer Sutherland is the only one to save face with a fairly decent performance. <br /> <br /> The 1988 original with the same name (modified by the Dutch title "Spoorloos" for the English-speaking public) was recommended for me, only for an online rental company to send me this error later version of Hollywood. I was surprised to find it was Directed by George Sluizer and would be interested in knowing his rationale for the remake. I am reliable and fortunately informed that it is of a much higher quality in all areas, including the plot. Horah for that, but it really doesn't take much.
