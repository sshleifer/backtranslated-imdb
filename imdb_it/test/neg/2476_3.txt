Nothing in this film is exceptional or terrible. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is what kills him. The bland is not only good. I can't say I expected better from Will Smith, but I definitely did Kevin James of "The King of Queens" - but, hey, I'm getting used to saying it a lot lately. This film tries to make its mark as a witty romantic comedy, but it never hits the target. In fact, it never hits * anywhere * inside the target. The allergy scene is disturbing; the fact that Kevin James can't dance is something that doesn't exactly capture anyone, so it's (in a movie like this) not funny. This film constantly tries to win your heart, but always with the wrong stratagem at the wrong time. Some parts are okay (but I'm looking for my brain for examples), but I really think this movie should be avoided.
