This film is about a group of women (perhaps not of high reputation) who are heading towards a small fort to take possession of a property of their recently departed uncles where they plan to open a shop. Upon arrival in a nearby city they discover that no one will go there (even if it is only 15 miles away), so they walk. When they arrive they find that there are no soldiers but a good amount of people who have taken over the use of the fort and built a small town nearby. They soon discover that something is not right here and Fort McMillan (Ft. Doom as the locals call it) is in serious trouble. <br /> <br /> Rather than entering the storyline, I will make some comments about things I noticed about the film. First of all the acting is very flat, only a few people seem to be real enough to believe it. But my first thought was of poor acting, but in the end I watched some of the outtakes and these same people became alive. So my only thought is that that's how the director wanted it. In addition to bad acting, I have a big problem where people don't react directly to a certain set of circumstances. Take for example no one would take them to Ft McMillan for any price, even if it is only 15 miles away. However, when we get to the fort, we find that it is well managed by a decent population of people, who must receive supplies from someone, not to mention mail, etc. Should take place in 1867, however we can see the railcar has electric lights (they are not at least in order) and a locomotive engine that is at least 30 years later, not a general style of locomotives so popular at that time. There are also places where you can see paved asphalt, (and maybe a car at some point, I didn't want to bother you to go back and look) and other anachronistic objects. If they had followed the rules of the "world" that they created and let the actors be actors, they might have gotten a 4 from me instead of the 2 I gave, and they rewrote it about 4 more times that it could have done even better.
