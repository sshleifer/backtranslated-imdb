Jack Black and Kyle Gass interpret fantasy versions of themselves in this comic show for their contour band Tenacious D, an art-rock ensemble with satirical and pointed lyrics. An ex-runaway obsessed with heavy metal and a living idler on the beach, pretending to smoke and pretending to be a rock god, meets and forms a band (the desires on both cheeks are the moniker of the group ). Opening with a fun prologue that lets a Twisted Sister video from the 80s escape, "The Pick of Destiny" is a pretty well-made film for older kids; from time to time it looks like nothing more than a middle-aged variation of "Wayne's World", with playful interludes and a meeting with Beelzebub, but Black and Gass have an extremely comfortable relationship (they have also worked as producers, have written script and all the music). Obviously the target audience will leave, even if the inspiration is a bit low, in particular in the second half (just when our heroes impulsively overcome the policemen in a pilot car). The musical sequences are much more successful than the satire attempts and, for the first thirty minutes or so, Jack Black's manic enthusiasm is contagious. * 1/2 from ****
