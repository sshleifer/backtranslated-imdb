To be honest, I've never read one of the comics and I don't remember parts 2 and 3 at all. I can compare myself to the first part (Werner - Beinhart) and this one is really disappointing compared to part 1 and compared to most of the others movies I've seen in recent weeks. The first few minutes seem to be just a useless clone of the introduction of the first movie and then it's getting even worse. There are some good (funny) scenes, but in total it's just another boring second-tier test of the German film industry that can't be successful (almost as usual). One good thing: the film is quite short (75 min.) The bad thing: it only contains stories and lines for 45 minutes;) -> Don't watch it
