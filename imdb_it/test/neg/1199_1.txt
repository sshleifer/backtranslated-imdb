OK, the idea is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 1. Children do not own airplanes 2. Children do not run airplanes with dirtbikes 3. It made the Air Force look like a complete idiot 4. The father of children would not jeopardize the his entire career to allow his boyfriend to cheer him on 5. None of the two a reserve colonel <br /> <br /> The sequels, I'm sure they were worse than this tripe. The soundtrack is the only saving quality of this celluloid waste. I'm sorry but I don't understand why anyone in the world writes directly and produces such priceless junk. Is the Iranian Air Force lucky to tear up a couple of parts for an aging F-14, and this kid doesn't divulge 1 but 2 fully loaded and powered F-16s? Give me a break.
