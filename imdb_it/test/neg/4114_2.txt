Ray Bradbury, run and hide! This sticky version of his 50s story about time travel and the effect it could have on de-evolution is not well known from theatrical racing (did he make it?) And now exists as a DVD on the shelves released during a slow week. <br /> <br /> What appears to be a fantastic sci-fi thriller from the opening scenes deceives us quickly while computer-generated graphics are reproduced unaltered in a film that should be different "travel back in time to a important company sells macho guys in 2055 the chance to hunt dinosaurs by paying exorbitant fees to travel back in time to prehistoric jungles.A slip of the foot / butterfly while on one of these adventures and the course of evolution is altered with waves of the time that they follow rolling on the planet changing everything for the plants and the man-eating beasts. Of course, there is a beautiful damsel who knows how to reverse the process and a massive man who risks his life to act on his orders and everything to end is OK. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is the story ... and the most surprising fact about this mess of a misunderstood movie is that it attracted some what a talent to represent flat cartoon characters. Edward Burns (all buff and hunky) is our hero of the day, Ben Kingsley is the bad corporate man who wears a ridiculous white wig, Catherine McCormack is the creator of all women and Wilfried Hochholdinger is bad - all are superb actors and would have you should have known better than to line up with this flop. And the saddest thing is that for those who love this kind of sci-fi thriller the creative department has run out of the most courageous animations to get on the screen for a long time. A must lose.
