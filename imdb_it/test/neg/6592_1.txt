You might suspect that the plot of this film was written during filming. It starts as a "punk versus vigilante" movie, but in the middle of the film, the plot suddenly changes when the vigilante turns into an honest man with his honest girl and his honest gym and has to fight "businessmen" corrupt that you want to turn down the gym at any cost to build a mall or something. Then, the plot changes again, and we forget about corrupt kids. The villain is now the protagonist's friend, who thinks he is a ninja. The boy becomes "crazy bad" and wants to win a martial arts competition at all costs. Seeing this movie is like having a nightmare with the television on.
