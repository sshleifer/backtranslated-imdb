I came across this movie while doing channel surfing and it seemed to be another badly made Christian movie on The End Times (which I find rather funny because they take it so seriously). To be honest, I only saw the last 30 minutes, so I lost the part about UFOs and Sci-Fi material. But it was long enough for me to categorize it as an embarrassing and terrible representation of the Christian faith, as well as a rather pathetic film in every artistic sense. <br /> <br /> As a script, the script was terrible, the acting was mediocre and the pace was poor. Cinematography and direction were sub-par: no interesting graphics, no layered plot, no creativity. Don't just blame the budget: films can still be interesting without special effects. This was not. Christian films cannot excuse their mediocrity and originality in the artistic sphere only for their message. And the message here was hardly "Christian". <br /> <br /> ** Disclaimer: the rest of this comment is for Christians ** <br /> <br /> First of all, it is not ethical in any business for bait-and-change your customers . I don't like being told that I can win a free iPod just to realize that I have to spend $ 300 in participating stores first. Non-Christians do not like being told that they are watching a science fiction film and then they are bombarded by Christian propaganda that has all the subtlety of a hammer. The hidden agendas don't make you win friends, let alone get converted. <br /> <br /> Secondly, you should not use overt threats to convince people that your beliefs are true. The actors who represented Christians broke away from senseless and complacent bullies when they were dealing with the skeptical "unbeliever", even going so far as to stage the kidnapping to scare him. Dialogue of representation: "Turn to Jesus - OR GO TO HELL!" "Well, don't believe me BUT YOU ARE SORRY!" "The day you die, I guarantee you will want you to have paid more attention to this stuff of Jesus - WHEN YOU ARE IN THE BABY OF HELL!" OK, I could go overboard, but it certainly came out the same way. If you think this is a "clear message to Christ", you are wrong. I don't remember Jesus using threats and coercion. And I don't think people can make a genuine decision to believe in him out of fear. So, Christians, please don't use it as a "witness" for your "unsaved" friends. It is heavy, offensive and inaccurate in portraying a true Christian message. <br /> <br /> Third, theology was bad. In addition to characterizing Jesus as a means of infernal insurance, he did not give space to discussions or discussions and did not attempt to address the question of whether UFOs or alien life could exist. Instead, he offered a pat answer: "UFOs are the devil's scheme to deceive people when kidnapping occurs", which is neither biblical nor widely accepted by most Christians. Since the Bible does not mention UFOs or aliens, you cannot use it as a source to draw conclusions one way or another. The abduction is not necessarily a widely accepted and valid biblical concept, although nowadays most evangelical Christians seem to believe it because of a series of popular books. If you do your research (as many supporting critics are suggesting), the idea of ​​two comings of Christ (the first as kidnapping) is a relatively new phenomenon in the tradition of the Church, popularized by some itinerant evangelists around the 20th century. Most Orthodox Christians will probably find the message of this film to be a rather large trait based on many unsupported assumptions. <br /> <br /> Basically, this film lacks the brand both as a useful piece of entertainment and as an accurate representation of Christianity and its beliefs. I would not recommend it.
