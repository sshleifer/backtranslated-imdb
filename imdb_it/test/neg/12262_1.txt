This movie could have been great, but it wasn't. Between the cesspool of the hopeless and the friends of the filmmakers who wanted to lend a hand, there are some mild traits of talent. The main protagonist of the film has a leading role. He is convincing and has those awful Italian eyes. However, he collaborated with the worst rejections of actors anyone has ever met. The film's opening scenes are among the worst and most embarrassing. Looks like Gay Porno. Fortunately no one has taken off. The rape scene that continues to be mentioned is rubbish. The prison sequence was the best part of the film, although irrelevant. The soundtrack of the film (if you can call it that) sounds like a kid trying for the first time to use cooledit and some sample CDs. It's boring, repetitive and extremely lame. In reality, the whole film is lame. Get out while you can still!
