The Bone Snatcher is about a group of miners who go in search of a missing miners' crew in the Namib Desert. When they find them, they are nothing but bare bones and cannot have been dead for more than six hours. History keeps you interested in what exactly caused this. The characters are pretty good, and the acting is pretty good. <br /> <br /> About an hour and ten minutes after discovering what is causing the bone cleansing, sigh "oh, this is really stupid." The film is ruined by bad writing and a non-exciting ending. Until then, the film was pretty good, and it's a shame that it took a bad turn. So I can't recommend this movie. I gave it a 4/10.
