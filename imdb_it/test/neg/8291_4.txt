"Graduation Day" was released in May 1981, at the height of the slasher movie craze. At the beginning of that year, fans had been subjected to films like "My Bloody Valentine", "Just Before Dawn", "Friday 13th Part 2" and "The Burning" and the theaters expected movies like "Halloween II", "The Prowler" and "Happy Birthday to Me". I've seen all of these films, and of all the famous "Celebration Day" of 1981 is by far the worst. <br /> <br /> What is "Graduation Day" is a low budget film-making exercise with bad acting, bad writing, useless characters, useless scenes, unnecessary nudity, style dialogues and an editing experiment which didn't work very well. And who could forget the classic disco music of the 80s that plays throughout the film (the music of the opening scene is only matched by the music that plays during a hunting scene). However, when renting a movie like this, a person should be aware that such details will be present in this film. So why is "Graduation Day" not considered a classic like "Halloween", "Friday 13", "A nightmare on Elm Street", "My Bloody Valentine", "The Burning" or "Prom Night"? Why are fans still looking for those films, but ignoring this without attention? <br /> <br /> Where the slasher films must succeed above all other areas is in the rhythm. There is nothing worse than a slowly moving slasher, and "Graduation Day" moves rather slowly. The most aggravating part is that there are many opportunities to speed things up; there are numerous useless characters that are introduced and that never have the chance to be a suspect in the murders or to be a victim. There is an unbalanced teacher, a stressed headmaster, a shrewd secretary, a school security guard, a clueless detective, an alcoholic adoptive father, an unreasonable grandmother, and a mother for a previous, yet grieved victim. All these characters could have a reason to kill or a reason to be killed, but they are all wasted. The worst part is that the story still focuses on them, and sometimes designates whole scenes just to enrich their character. But for what? <br /> <br /> What amazes me about "Graduation Day" and its small fanbase is that people are no longer surprised by the scenes of death. Fans go wild for the death scenes such as the raft massacre in "The Burning", the death of the washing machine in "My Bloody Valentine", the death of the kabob in "Happy Birthday to Me", the death overturned on "Friday 13th Part 3 ", and the death of the hot tub in" Halloween II ", and even the death of the machine in" Madman ". But where is the respect for some truly unique deaths (even if fat) in the "Graduation Day". A victim is skewered through the jugular with a fencing sword, while another gets that sword thrown at them like a javelin. The best death includes spikes under a landing mat. Why are these deaths not as famous in the genre as death in the most popular slasher movies? <br /> <br /> The "Graduation Day" strives to be an exceptional and unique film, but there is only one logical element and the rhythm that really ruins the whole experience is missing. It's not the worst of its kind (try checking "Don't go into the woods ... alone") and there's a bit of suspense, plus it offers what the fans are looking for (blood, blood, nudity, sex and nostalgia) but "Graduation Day" will not be remembered as one of the greatest slasher films ever made. It is not a question of budget - almost all loggers have a limited budget - however it is a question of ideas, creativity and skill. This is all the kind of movie making is ... <br /> <br /> Recommended for hardcore slasher fans. Fans of general horror might get a little bored and people who don't have much interest in horror should stay away. It is not the worst film ever made, but it is far from being the best.
