It makes "Invasion USA" as "Apocalypse Now". This can only be recommended to US skinheads, John Birch supporters or militia members. The message is very simple: let's shoot everyone - gooks, commies, Latinos, everything that is not American. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, this is misinterpreted, poorly scripted, misinterpreted, incredibly stupid but not funny at all. This film could be used as a toorture device by CIA torturers. oops, sorry, there can be no US torturers because they are GOOD
