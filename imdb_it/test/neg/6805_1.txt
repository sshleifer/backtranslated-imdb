For all those who want to know something about the real Diane Arbus, or who appreciates psychological truth, this film is abysmal. Arbus was a brilliant, talented, restless and tormented person, but this film portrays her completely self-involved and truly bizarre in her taste and judgment. Kidman portrays her pale and vague, while she is a person who has challenged people with her charisma. The totally fictitious relationship that is central to the film is quite incredible, and Robert Downey is really irritating in his ironic portrait of someone who seems to think he is superior to the rest of the world simply because of his affliction. The film describes this meeting as the source of Arbus's interest in the "freak" phenomena, which is a really trivial explanation for the inspiration behind some of the greatest photographs of the 20th century. The mystery to me is why people of talent and intelligence have chosen to be involved in this film in any way.
