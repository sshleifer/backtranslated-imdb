There is so much to love about this show, it's hard to know where to start. Unpredictable characters, horrible plot, terrible writing and terrible acting. Don't even get me started on the hateful theme music. <br /> <br /> In addition to all this, the show is not in contact with the US public due to the heavy Canadian references. "Oh, say Derek, will you go to Queens College in the fall? How are you bean? We should go hunting." <br /> <br /> Granted, other shows are filmed in Canada for financial reasons like Stargate: Atlantis, but while those shows may have suffered some annoyances (as Rodney calls a ZPM a "Zed-PM") the show does not he focus on life in Canada. <br /> <br /> MTV runs Degrassi (another show based on the experiences of the Canadian teenager) during daylight hours when no one is watching to fill the time (most boys are at school when it is aired). I bet it's for the same reason. The shows that focus on teenage life in Canada do not translate well into an American audience. <br /> <br /> This show should be canceled and the remaining masters burned in a furnace.
