I love his martial arts style, he is fast, close and oh so fast, but it seems his films are increasingly becoming a crime quality lifestyle and less meaning ... I thought he was out to carry on a deeper message. At least some of the films had a hidden meaning or agenda, this one had some good redeeming qualities of the character, but the rest was so far away. I was very disappointed. Martial arts also suffer. I hope to see a more devoted Segal in his future films. This film also fails to maintain the plot, there are too many gaps, so thought is lost. Too many things are cryptic without a solution.
