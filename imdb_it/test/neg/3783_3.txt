I'm giving a three instead of the lowest number it deserves because of its history. A full-length film made by high school students! Show this too, but it's part of the charm and charm. Check out some of the things that George Lucas did at UCLA; this is better. Perhaps because of a group effort. <br /> <br /> A monster made of toxic waste and too much garbage - these guys were way ahead of the times! - begins to devastate the city of Milpitas during a high school dance. The monster destroys at random, leaving footprints and stinky prints. <br /> <br /> The film has people from local TV and radio, the mayor of Milpitas, the principal of Samuel Ayer High School and a group of high school students and their parents, not to mention their daughter of the mayor as the ing√©nue. <br /> <br /> Fool? Yes! Fun? Yes! Big screen writing? Come on, they are tall, untrained students! Copy that comment for acting, cinematography, directing and so on. <br /> <br /> Milpitas is right next to San Jose, in the heart of Silicon Valley; maybe one of the graphics geniuses will update the video in some way. Now there is a challenge.
