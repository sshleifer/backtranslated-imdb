In no way should this too simplistic script, fundamentally a character, be interpreted as functionality entertainment. Actually it has enough material for a short eighteen minutes, and that too could weigh on your level of attention. Zero characters are developed besides Noble Willingham. The endless close-ups of lips and phones are inducing sleep, and the script is so underdeveloped that a chimp could have written it. Actually this whole sad thing shouldn't even have been put on film. A tape recording would have been more than enough to put you to sleep. Definitely not recommended. - MERK
