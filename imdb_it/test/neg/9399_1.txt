Ridiculous and nauseating little throat with terrible acting; inept, superficially and condescendingly dragging all the most banal clich√©s about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and middle age. The main actor makes a nervous grimace as he walks through the film, striving to portray the appropriate level of self-satisfied complacency and complacency for the unworthy character and script. I'm sure the book was bad, but it couldn't have been so bad! The camera is permanently fitted with a yellow "vomit" yellow Tuscan filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun was not Tuscan enough?), Which they forgot to remove when the scene moves to Rome and (with what imagination!) . You have never seen the white marble of the monument of Vittorio Emmanuelle in Rome that seems so yellow ... I mean Tuscan. One of the worst movies ever, so it's worth a look.
