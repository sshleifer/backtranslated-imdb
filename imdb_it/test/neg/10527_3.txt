This film was disappointing. After 15 years, when some reviews on Mariel Hemingway were brought to mind, all the regrets I heard about the film came back. While I remember Peter O'Toole, I was completely oblivious to the fact that the female lead (okay - she was little more than an object of discussion in the plot) was Mrs Hemingway. I saw this movie in the days when I wrote movie reviews and warned people, because the stories didn't work, and fifteen years of my subconscious trying to fix things up still didn't make sense of the flow of ideas. <br /> <br /> Part of this might depend on how it looked, after the original film (whatever it was) was shot, a publisher came and tried to put something together. I don't know if this had been a project of a previous head of study, and so it was sabotaged to discredit him by his successor, or this was a disaster from the original script that rescue attempts were not successful. The theatrical version did not work.
