The Auberge Espagnole is less fun and less interesting than any episode of Dobie Gillis. Where is their Bob Denver? Do they even have a Dwayne Hickman? A Frenchman moves to Barcelona to attend classes. He moves with other students who are not more interesting than him, and they do and say uninteresting things. This film is incredibly bland. The only bright spot was a beautiful French girl who played a Belgian lesbian. He puts his hands behind his head and reveals his shaved armpits, not the usual tufts of dark, stinky hair. But bare underarms don't make a good movie. The Emmerdeur was fun, as was La Cage aux Folles. L'Auberge Espagnole and Le Placard ask you what's wrong with the French comedy.
