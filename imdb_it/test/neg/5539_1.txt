I just wanted to leave a brief comment since I don't listen here, but I just watched this movie, the version I just rented was released in 2005 as far as I know and actually was called "Don't go to the attic" I just realized that it was the same film by Devils Harvest in search of some actors who seemed familiar in the film. However I am in Ireland so maybe this was only released here and in the UK now, but this is what they call here .......... I really don't like it because I wouldn't recommend this movie. The only words I have come to mind when looking at cheeses, cheeses, cheeses! My only sign out of ten is purely for the only small point: o)
