This film has all the potential and qualities of a great feeling good, a great love story ... the cast is perfect, the images work, the original premises work, the characters work ... but the story goes from one chess move to the next in a more predictable way ... not a character in the film has a depth or depth explained by the director. All we know about the character of Catherine Zeta-Jones is that she is obsessed with her world ... no one is allowed to enter and no one will challenge her world ... so obvious ... but the remaining characters all have the their dimensions that have never been explored or exhibited ... The character of Aaron Eckhart had much more to offer the story but was not allowed, the character of Abigail Breslin is so easy to understand that his performance is rather predictable and fake .... in the end everything returns to the forced and turbulent world of Catherine Zeta-Jones, for which the public never falls completely in love ... honestly, her turbulent world is not much more than a portrait of a selfish, obsessed, spoiled woman that most people would not have much time or sympathy for the real world. The director had to make her a hero and he never does ... in the end, it is the character of Eckhart who eventually wins because he wins. <br /> <br /> It is not a lousy film, just a film that could have been much better with more depths of personality allowed, explained and exhibited. Cheers
