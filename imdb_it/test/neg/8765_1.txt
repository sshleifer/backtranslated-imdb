This film was terrible. The acting was terrible. The script was horrible. What was even worse were the shots and the sound of the camera. Half of the times when the voices didn't match the actors' lips and the different camera angles in the same scene would have been completely different. The worst part was when one of the actors was at the top of a huge cross-shaped building. The building must have been 50 stories high and probably 100 feet wide. However, when the actor was at the top of the scene in another shot, they had "recreated" the top of the building. The width of the building had been reduced to about eight feet wide. How could a building hundreds of meters high eight feet wide? I know the film was low budget, but it's unforgivable. The film itself has simply pushed ideas about a "kidnapping", so actually with a plot or a point. This reduced the script to pure junk, the characters seemed to sell ideas in their lines rather than convey emotions and move the film in one direction. It was a complete waste of time watching. The film gives Christians a bad name if it is one of the best Christian films currently in circulation.
