Oh my God, oh my God. My life has been drastically wasted by this stink pile. I'd rather chew my arm than watch this movie again. Painful plot, painful characters and two painful hours. <br /> <br /> The best way to describe this film is as follows: - I'd rather pin my eyes and cut my brain than look at another minute of this tripe. <br /> <br /> The advice is to feel good and let your local policeman do you a favor by removing this garbage. <br /> <br /> Lin, you told me it was fine !!! ! <br /> <br /> Goodaleebyeload.
