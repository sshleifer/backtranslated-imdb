In a word, god-terrible ... too many holes in the plot .. um, yes ... Who brings their child to dig a corpse in the middle of the night? and what happens with his wife who steals the skeleton ... who does it? why exactly did the shrink get stabbed in the neck? and all that dog business ... I mean really! Having Sparrow's narrative from the start has also completely destroyed the suspense for me .. I mean, if he's telling the story, he clearly lived to tell it, so there's no chance of him being fired ... where's the suspense there? <br /> <br /> Of course, you expect holes in the plot in a film like this. But there are so many that I completely lost track of the story because of them. What kind of name is Fingerling? O Toppsy? Why did his wife dig the body? (Who does it?) Or get into that crazy madhouse alone? and where do all those candles come from? Why does the writer have his PO BOX in the crazy book ??? I mean, come on ... And the book does it happen to find the way to the bookstore next to the wife's bakery ?? Too cheap ... Oh and Happy Birthday Honey, here's a book about a serial killer .. What a THOUGHT gift! The book is about 20 pages long, half of which are empty, and it ALWAYS drives you crazy to read it. If he is really obsessed with this book, wouldn't he have read it all at once? <br /> <br /> A little convenient for him to run into his future wife (bringing a cake!) About 23 seconds after being released from a mental hospital .. how old was he? 36 ?? <br /> <br /> I was the only one in the end to cheer on the bus to really send him down? It's not good when you're rooting for the main character to bite him at the end. <br /> <br /> It seems that this was written by the committee .. I imagine that the first draft probably had nothing to do with the number 23 ... It seems that they needed a deceptive hook to expose the public to to think that there was something supernatural going on, when in the end it seemed to have nothing to do with anything. I mean, I didn't expect the Godfather or anything, but everything about this movie was a total disappointment. Without all the things of numerology, this film could have been OK, instead of some extravagant Se7en knockoffs. <br /> <br /> Not scary, unintentionally exhilarating and otherwise a total snoozer.
