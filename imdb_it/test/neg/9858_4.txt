This documentary was neither professionally nor objectively realized. It all took place as a theory of conspiracy by IBM to win the game in question just to make money. Garry Kasparov has a problem with the ego. He was swelling before the game and when he lost, he didn't like it. I remember playing chess against computers in the 1980s and it was not too difficult to win. As time went by, I started losing and didn't like it. Today, I simply don't play against computers anymore because they are just too good. Not only that, the games are not interesting and lack the charm of human games, in which both sides are more likely to make mistakes and open the game to exciting possibilities. This documentary continues to show us images of The Turk, which is an ancient game of chess that has been controlled by a human being. From the beginning to the end we are led to believe that IBM short of literally hiding a human GM in the back of their closet-sized computer. I'm a computer scientist and I'm offended by the idea that just because Garry lost, IBM must have cheated. I know how computers play chess. It's not magical and it's not a mystery. They can be trained, have a huge amount of knowledge of chess and they will certainly see the positions and possibilities in an unprecedented detail compared to humans. It's not really surprising that Deep Blue has won. Maybe at the time it was. If it happened today, given the ever increasing processing power of the machines; people wouldn't blink. If a car couldn't design at least with a GM today, people would think the program was weak.
