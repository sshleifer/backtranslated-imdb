My friend and I rented this movie for 3.99 for the blockbuster. If I had known how awful this movie would have been, I wouldn't have paid a penny. I did not warn for this bs. Acting can't even be called acting, the inevitable sex scene is embarrassing, and you can say that both girls feel completely uncomfortable doing it, and the bad boy ... god, he couldn't say he would attack Emily And the musical signals ... my lord. This film makes me want to cry. Never rent it. In fact, if you happen to look at it, calculate your eyes. This film is not of God, it is of hell. I'll just take the last few lines to write bla bla bla shiz because I don't want to continue with this review.
