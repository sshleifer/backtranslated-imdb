Of course, HOTD 2 is better than the crapfest Uwe Boll which was the first, but it's like saying that drowning is better than being chopped alive. OK OK, I'm a bit harsh with this, except that the adaptations of the Zombie movies on video games always leave a bitter taste in my mouth. Resident Evil was fine, but its sequels are pure junk. The first HOTD was more fun than anything else; Uwe Boll saw it. And HOTD 2 was ... better? The value of entertainment was there, the chicks were there, the blood was there, but ... is that so? The script, although subpar, was better than the first. But the script hides horribly written characters, stupid action sequences, clichés and a trailing ending that reaches a level of ridicule that would make the Bollmeister very proud. But, it could have been worse, right? <br /> <br /> HOTD 2 stars Sig Haig (Yes, Sid Haig) as a mad doctor looking for a cure for death. As you can imagine, everything goes to sh * t. A nearby College Campus seems to be the center of the Zombie (or Hypersapien?) Epidemic? And, as one might expect, a group of Commandos and two zombie scientists try to save the world by going there and neutralizing the problem. Their main goal? No, it's not jumping. Instead, they must get a zombie blood sample, so they can create a cure for the deadly virus. Between this and that there are bland interactions between the characters, an unbearable amount of clichés (but hey, at least the black guy is not the first to be killed), and decent looking Zombies. <br /> <br /> Acting is acceptable. Who would have thought that Sticky Fingaz was a passable actor? Not me. Emmanuelle Vaugier and Ed Quinn shine a little like the protagonists. And the supporting cast was also passable. It was all passable. <br /> <br /> The effects of makeup on the Zombies were good, it could have been worse as in the first HOTD: only boys running in dusty mummy suits. Even the blood was ok. Inexpensive shoes and even the most economical tensions are almost non-existent in this film, which is a good thing. The action sequences were as stupid as f * ck, but at least there were no zombies that fought with the sword or that ridiculous slow motion bullet effect. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is aimed only at zombie fans, arcade video game fans and those who want to rent a cheap horror movie for the weekend. Apparently there will be a third as suggested by the ending, but I wouldn't count on it. Unless Uwe decides to do it. A 4.
