On Friday night Jonathan Ross must have the Ross managers massaging their little sweaty palms. They know the BBC has no imagination when it comes to talk shows, so when they have Jonathan Ross at their disposal, they're pretty sure they sit down and let a semitone command this slot in prime time. <br /> <br /> Ross Spends of the show that rules his ego and smiles about how much the BBC is paying him. The show is a complete copy of many chat shows in the United States - Leno, Letterman, Conan O Brian, the list goes on - but he and his team have clearly seen what works on the masses can also be done for mute masses in United Kingdom also. <br /> <br /> The unfortunate situation - no competition? Parkinson has gone from reality to the fact that he has never been so good except to rule a celebrity ego. Can't we have someone more fun and brash about British Screens instead of Jonathan Ross? Once Ross has built his ego enough, then he will proceed to the very boring concept of rigid celebrities in the green room - so trying to get on with each other. If an A-Lister is present (which is so often these days - since there are no other chat shows to turn to - to promote their latest film) - they will spend the next hour either flirting with them or trying to be their best friend in the universe. Sqeamish when he had Ringo Starr in the head - a man who cares nothing for ass licking - Ross was genuinely asking for his cell phone number (as a common policy on this show is for Jonathan Ross to get everyone's number so he can be seen in the right company when it is not working). Obviously Ringo said how it is - and he simply said no I don't like you - dead pan serious. <br /> <br /> Ross must be cut from all Awards and TV shows - the masses will surpass him.
