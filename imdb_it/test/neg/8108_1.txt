No spoiler is needed to avoid this ... well, weird movie. Canada becomes part of the United States. OK. So, I guess I'm unusual, but I was expecting something about the implications of Canada becoming part of the United States. Silly me. Continue with this film and you are at Cloud Coocoo Land. The opening premise has nothing to do with the rest of the movie where you (trust) don't care about a squat for any of the characters. Slings and Arrows and Due South must be among the most imaginative series ever. But in this case, Paul Gross, I am so sorry to say, he had no idea of ​​making a coherent film and he wasted a lot of talented actors in the process. A real disappointment.
