This movie was really stupid and I thought it wasn't so bad and I could tolerate a movie about a bed that people ate. Then the part near the end where the boy has skeletal hands has become the icing on top of a bad movie. I could see the screws in the plastic skeleton hands for goodness. His brother was still alive and moving when his hands were bare. The funny thing was that he could still move his hands that wasn't right. Without the muscles, you can't really move your hands but did it. The brother would have had to bleed to death even before moving his hands. The film was not exceptional but was fine until the hand scene. I was laughing so hard that I don't really remember how it ended. It had something to do with foam or something.
