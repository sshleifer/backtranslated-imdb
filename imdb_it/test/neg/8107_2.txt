I wasn't sure where it was headed until the end. when it was discovered that it was a liberal conspiracy to deliver the world to European cheaters and the United Nations. What a load of right-wing raw food! Incidentally, the fact that Canada joined the United States did not have much to do with the plot and the idea was never developed. The only point seems to be that it made the main character eligible to stand for the President (but they could have made him American and dispensed with that). In any case, this was a bull load and does not deserve your time. If you don't want to see this kind of thing done right, take a look at the brilliant BBC political thriller "State of Play".
