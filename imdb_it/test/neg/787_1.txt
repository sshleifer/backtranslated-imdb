This is my first review on IMDb.com and probably the first written review of a movie I made of my own volition, not for some class assignment. I think the fact alone says something about this movie ... it's not a good thing! I'm not an expert journalist or critic (even though I saw my right amount of film), but I found this film so terribly painful to watch, it was necessary for my own tranquility to let off steam on the experience. Where is it better to do it than IMDb? As I forced myself to sit through the film, physically writhing from the inability to connect the dots, I was sure there would be a "light at the end of the tunnel" - a revelation to explain what in samhe. -. Ll. was happening. The film ended and I was enlightened like the dog ****. After several rewinds to review some scenes, I could not conclude anything sensible. I found myself wanting to shout "Does this make sense to anyone?" I would advise you not to waste your time, but again, if I were you, I'd probably do it myself. If this is the case, bring a crossword or something like that so you don't get bored.
