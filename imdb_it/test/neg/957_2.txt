POSSIBLE SPOILERS - <br /> <br /> I love Dennis Quaid and I like Meg Ryan. I couldn't wait to see them together, being married and everyone, I wanted to see their chemistry on the screen. Ok, having said that, I think they are actors, their off-screen relationship was not to permeate their performances, especially with this script. <br /> <br /> How stupid a professor can be to glue himself with anyone. I don't remember the original, but I can only assume that O'Brien was probably handcuffed to his protagonist, probably in a more inevitable way. If I were "tied" to someone I would be pretty angry. The crush that I would have certainly dissipated quickly. Meg didn't even bother to show a little surprise. Dennis should have kicked and screamed. All that part of the film was so horrible - especially Meg who has to go to the bathroom (No. 2) between bins in the dark at night. Ewww. No way f ***** <br /> <br /> What does it have to do with Dennis socking every single suspect in the film. Sock first ask questions later. Not one, not two, but too many times - I could have counted if I was so inclined. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the film was Nick and his family drama. Too bad he couldn't have become more of the plot. The alleged off-screen drama that leads to this tragedy. I think it could have been written without distracting from Dex's research. <br /> <br /> My fault is the writer of this script. Unless the director and others have adjusted it so much as to be unrecognizable. <br /> <br /> I won't even go into the real reason why poor Dex was murdered. How ridiculous it is. Even when Dex faced the real killer and the reason was explained, (a real "film noir" moment) everyone on the screen seemed bored. Oh, _____ it happened. Oh. (yawn) "Dex also says this is a foolish reason for a triple murder Oh the tension, you could cut it with a spoon. <br /> <br /> If anyone but Dennis had been in this movie, I have to give him 1 / 2 stars (just because I've really seen worse), but in this case 1 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> For the stars Dennis and Meg, see EVERYTHING.
