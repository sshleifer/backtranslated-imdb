The guy mentioned to sue for the wasted 1.5 hours of his life, I can't disagree on that. The film started as a sort of classy cam project, and ended up in a dark room. whenever the completely naked girls magically appear everywhere, I know I write the script or have something to say about it. But this is like a bad copy of the saw remake with a negative ending. Think of a man who actually wrote this story, sick. This is really a shocking movie, I can't say the horror isn't. It's just the brutality and violence that made me sick. It's really frustrating to watch a movie without ending, it's like a bang in the face. the movie is finished now you can go home. <br /> <br /> cons -cam -lighting (althrue I think it was supposed to be) -overdone -next <br /> <br /> versus -realist in the face - the processing was good in my opinion -can suck you in <br /> <br /> Overall The film is NOT my taste for the film, the most humorous wanted to let us know that these things happen, and the man wrote his little fantasy. If you've ever seen movies seen? they all had a moment of comfort in something to hold onto. This ? not. Maybe it's just me, I'm too soft but this movie made me tremble, and the story is really short, the sick man kills the girls slowly. But the actors sucked you into this movie with every shot you could almost hear. <br /> <br /> And to be honest, I was quick to judge this, is it a terrible movie? no it is not. it is an exaggerated example of reality, this is a true how it could arrive. But don't watch this movie if you expect a great mystery or a real storyline, or even some kind of story. the man takes the girls in a dark room and kills them one by one, this really is.
