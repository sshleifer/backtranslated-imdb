It's terrible, you won't believe it. The score is annoying, the shooting is very bad, for example sometimes you see the shadow of the cameraman appear on some faces of actors. The quality of the film is very bad, it seems to have been made in the 1920s. It's terrible. There is some blood at the beginning and through the film, but always turned too dark. No gore without effects. The director made a better one like Blood Rites. But there is a human following out there, because trying to find this cheap movie is not so difficult, but you have to pay it to earn money. Surely this will enter my top ten of the worst horrormovies of all time, I don't know if I would call it horror. There is too much talk, you will become bloodthirsty after seeing it
