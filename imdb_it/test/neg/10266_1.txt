Please, why on Earth did Bava have to add insult to injury by making this pathetic piece of shit worth following? <br /> <br /> To begin with us, "viewers" at home are treated to a narrative by some strangers -bat informs us of the subsequent events of the previous episode that indicate the triumph of mankind over demons, (yes quite right). <br /> <br /> I can tell you "right now" that this is not in any case what-have something to do with demons as this is a completely new story with a completely different background. Bava as usual, makes a casual appearance that doesn't even seem to fit into the main context of the story. Acting in this beyond the terrifying and the whole concept of demons appearing through a television, Oh God, I have no intention of moving forward. Go see for yourself. <br /> <br /> As usual you will be treated with ridiculous dubbing, scenarios to fuck that don't make sense and above all unanswered questions. As is typical of a sequel that extolled the first batch of shit. <br /> <br /> Overall if you are one of those Argentophile DVD collectors, then perhaps you will want to make this attempt otherwise you will avoid like the plague, not close to the first, so you may want to avoid the plague.
