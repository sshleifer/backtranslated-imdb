Could anyone explain why someone would like to create a "British neo-noir" crime film with an almost entirely American cast? The accents pronounced in this film are damn terrible! But completely in line with the performances, which are so wooden, you're afraid to find a meeting to set the cast on fire. <br /> <br /> Really, what kind of disgusting, cruel, cynical cruelty is this? Even the neo-noir films have a character for which you try or want to try something, even if they are miserable and doomed; they have at least some decency for them, some feel that what they did is wrong, or that a seemingly good plan went wrong, and that they somehow got stuck with responsibility for it. <br /> <br /> Not in this stewed stew. These characters are putrid, they betray each other, themselves and the public. <br /> <br /> Also, note that they are low lives - all right, nothing wrong with that - except they seem to live a life of luxury For a movie that is supposed to be spiteful and desperate thieves, the note key here is - ennui. It's all so terribly boring and boring, doncha sa. So we tear up some people or maybe kill them and go fuck in a luxury hotel. What an ambition! <br /> <br /> Gooping this whole mess on a bottom of marshy slime are: boringly irregular rhythm; predictable "action" sequences that are not; banal and incoherent scenography; camera-work and custom-made TV editing; forgettable score; and a whole lack of imagination or innovation in production and management. <br /> <br /> Interesting, unlikely, and for the less passionate observers (or masochists) like me, absolutely unwatchable. <br /> <br /> There are other bad things I would like to say about this unpleasant film, but they would not print them here. Suffice it to say that you can probably find something more useful to do with your time than watching this movie - pretty much anything, actually.
