What can I say about this? Such a great prestige production - but in the end? Wasted time, wasted money. <br /> <br /> This work is historically a disaster. Just a few examples: <br /> <br /> * Augustus is often called 'Gaius' - its name (Pronomen). But the old Romans did not use this name. Correct would be the surname (Nomen Gentile and Cognomen) or "Ottaviano", "Cesare", "Augusto". <br /> <br /> * Livia was shown as a tyrannical wife. But this is historically wrong. <br /> <br /> * Iulia was shown as a beautiful girl - but she was not one of them. Adultery and (perhaps?) Prostitution and arrogant behavior were the cause of his banishment. <br /> <br /> * He was not in his father's dying bed. She was never allowed to let her be banished. And she's about 50 now! Not as young as she was shown. In the same year, Augustus died, he committed suicide, because Tiberius stopped giving her a pension. <br /> <br /> * Augusto was much more scrupulous than this movie. But the author and the director seem to believe in Augustus's "Res Gestae". <br /> <br /> What remains? Historically extremely dubious, bad acting, bad construction and equipment - 2 points out of 10 - one for Peter O'Toole.
