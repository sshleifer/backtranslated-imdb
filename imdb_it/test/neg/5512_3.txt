This film is a desperate attempt to ride the skirt of the success of the Star Wars movies. The film uses recycled footage from "Battle Beyond the Sars" which is another Roger Corman Sci-Fi Turd, but at least that's better than "Battle Beyond the Stars" - there's no real acting in this movie (but it's a Roger Corman film: what did you expect? Once again the whole soundtrack was played on a keyboard / syntactizer, the sound effects were recycled by "Battlestar Galactica" - there are no special effects because they were recycled / re-arranged spatial scenes of another film, the costumes seem like something that was recovered by the 1981 Salvation Army. --ironicaly, the kid in this film gives a helluva performance, and would re-emerge again to star in the Sylvester Stallone film "Over the Top "- I give this film 3 stars out of 10
