I like CKY and Viva La Bam, so I couldn't resist this when I saw it for £ 1.99 in Gamestation. It is the debut film by Bam Magera, written by himself and Brandon Dicimaillo, and protagonist of the entire CKY crew (Ryan Dunn, Raab Himself, Rake Yohn, Jenn Rivell, Don Vito, etc. etc.). Brandon is also responsible for the art direction - which is one of the film's greatest merits - it is rather CKYish in its color style - but it also shows progression. <br /> <br /> Basically it follows (very vaguely) the breakup of Ryan Dunn with his girlfriend Glauren (played by Jenn). Vilo (played by Bam, which takes its name from Vilo Valo by chance?) And Falcone (Bran) interpret his best friends making chaos by doing various acrobatics. <br /> <br /> It's a bit like CKY movies but with a linear plot (which is very simple indeed) and poor acting. His strange, the usual super-fascinated band seems to have sucked life from them when they found out what they meant later. <br /> <br /> The acting and the script are pretty scary for the most part, but the second half of the film is much better than the first (90 minutes is a trait for the film), and there are a number of factors positive, like Tony Hawk's cameo, Dicimaillo's subtitles such as 'The Futurstic Invention Awards' and 'The Diamond Bike', the soundtrack is also very strong (it's not ALL the cKy and the HIM - in fact the Bomfunk MC's steal the film in terms of music usage). In the second part of the film, the sense of fun is much more real - especially since Don Vito has a fairly important role in the second part - and seems to steal every scene in which he finds himself. <br /> <br /> the film will appeal to those who like the CKY antics, but only for the basic material and not for the filler crap or story line. Oh, and someone will tell Bam that skating setups, especially in movies, are tough 1998. <br /> <br /> However, the best part of the DVD package is not the movie - but the 40 minutes of Making Of 'doc. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of the documentary deal with Raab Himself alcholism and the true feelings of the crew towards each other surprisingly candidly (as usual Bam comes across a dick, especially towards the Raab's drink problem and Ryan Dunn looks like a really nice down-to-earth guy. The last ten minutes of the documentary have to do with a friend (who is a rare member of CKY) trying to kick the heroine while he is with the Magera family with the crew - and a unitary side of the band (in particular Ape and Ryan) really comes across - an amazing gem in an otherwise boring DVD. <br /> <br /> For £ 1.99 I am very satisfied - although I hope that Bam will remain as improvised and short skits from now on.
