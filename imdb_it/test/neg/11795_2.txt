This film is a good companion to Blair Witch, because it hurts so much that BW is right. Like BW, this pretends to be a documentary of spectral events, with each member of the team controlling his camera. <br /> <br /> The sense of reality is never there, however. The participants are poorly written cliché characters and the events taking place are equally cliché (the cat jumping out of a closet, a chandelier falling down, etc.). Even the dialogue drawn up and the inept improvisation of the too attractive cast leave something to be desired. And worse, the supposedly participated cameras have recorded too many events too perfectly to be even remotely credible. In fact, with some modifications, this could have been a parody of Blair Witch. In fact, there is a scene where the blond historian is eating a sandwich with a huge cockroach that is actually quite funny, reminding me of a similar coarse scene from "Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me". But in the end the event is played straight, without lines. It is hard to say what the intent with The St Francisville Experiment was, except to stock up on some stray cash. But it is rather sad when the only real interest I could find was if the historic blonde would have had her shirt tied up in a particular shot or not.
