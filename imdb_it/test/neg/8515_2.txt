I'll give it a two because it has a lot of music, otherwise it would be one. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time tonight and it is the first "Road" photo I saw. I expected waaaaay better. Robert Osborn says this is the best of Road movies. If it's true, I don't need to worry about seeing others. The best thing about this film is that it has a lot of songs in the first half, but this is balanced by a single production number with dance in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't like the movie. Neither Hope nor Crosby came across so well, their characters weren't very charming, the movie wasn't funny at all, most of the dialogue was just satisfying, there wasn't much action, there wasn't much entertainment. br /> <br /> The film was not what I expected. I expected more "Road", but not much. They quickly reach the building and then most of the film takes place there, until the end. I also expected much more than the famous "street" style of breaking the fourth wall, in which the characters speak directly to the public or comment on the plot. There were only about 4 examples of this. One of these is an example of the non humorous humor of this script: <br /> <br /> (Hope sums up the plot so far in Crosby) Crosby: I know all this! I hope: Yes, but people who have reached half of the image do not. Crosby: You mean they lost my song? <br /> <br /> Those are two weak bars, but at least they are actually jokes. Most of the rest of the script doesn't even have jokes. An example is: <br /> <br /> Crosby: remind me to throw you a piece of cheese in the morning. (Indirectly calls Hope a mouse). <br /> <br /> It's not funny at all, it barely even qualifies as a joke, but this is the kind of non-joking dialogue that carries most of the movie. Many scenes don't even come so close to a joke, simply by using an uninteresting generic window like: <br /> <br /> Crosby: Hey, whadda ya 'you take me? Do you think you can just throw me into dogs? I hope: well, why not, you did it to me right? Crosby: Yes, but it's because I was looking for us. You're not looking for anyone. I hope: Oh yes? Well, then why did I pay the check? <br /> <br /> (the above is only from my memory, it is not exact but it illustrates what I mean). <br /> <br /> And so on .... just a generic dialogue without lines. <br /> <br /> My vote: a waste of time.
