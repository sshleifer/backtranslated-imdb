Nuff said. An undercover policeman from the state capital is sent to a small county where the current of the full moon is rampant. He ends up getting away from some local clans who have no idea they are an undercover cop (so they go by car with the same stupidity as always). Soon he will take care of a woman and her three daughters who wear tops and shorts (which they did in the 70s). He falls in love with one of the girls, but in the meantime he has yet to find out who is doing all the moonshine and guiding him to all the local bars and restaurants. He must also fight with a fat sheriff and his incompetent deputy who thinks he is the moonshiner because he is new to the city. <br /> <br /> Life in American city, 70s style. YEE HAAAAAAAAAAA.
