Wrestlemania 2 is the only Wrestlemania | thank god | to be held in three different places, and although it was an interesting idea, it didn't really work. There are really only two games that have been really hit, while the rest is decent, or most of them, pretty terrible. There are some fun celebrities on hand, like Susan Saint James, Ray Charles and Cathy Crosby, but the experience has been a waste of time for the most part. The British Bulldgos match The Dream Team is worth the price of admission, but you can honestly see it everywhere. <br /> <br /> Matches. <br /> <br /> Nassau Coliseum. <br /> <br /> Paul Orndorff Vs The Magnificent Muraco / W Mr.Fuji. For the time he had, and despite the bad finish, this was a surprisingly bearable thing, with the crowd really in it. Crowd sings "Bullsh * t" at the end. Having said that, he did nothing for the career of both. The game ends with a double count fighting off the arena <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Intercontinental Championship Match. Randy Savage | C | Vs George "The Animal" Steele. Not that great essay of wrestling, but very funny because of the antics involved, and some great comedy of Steele, besides the savage he can fight with a potato and make it interesting. Savage wins when he puts his feet on the ropes, to pry. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Jake "The Snake" Roberts Vs George Wells. For a knockout match, this was better than it should have been, but it's too short to have an impact on what ever. Roberts wins with the DDT, pulling out the postman of the snake, which sucks at Saint James. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Boxing Match. Mr.T / W The Hati Kid & Joe Frazier Vs Roddy Piper / W Lou Duva and Bob Orton. A huge failure in my opinion. I was bored senseless in all of this, and while it may have been a marketing success, it certainly failed to entertain me. Many of Rowdy's songs are also evident. T wins by DQ, when Piper slams T. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Rosemont Horizon <br /> <br /> Match Title female. Fabulous Moolah | C | Vs Velvet Mcintyre. It ends too quickly, even before you have the chance to start, making a record for the fast fall of the pins, as far as Donna's matches are concerned. Moolah wins when he takes advantage of Velvet's missed shot from the top of the rope. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> Corporal Kirchner Vs Nikolai Volkoff / W Classy Freddie Blassie. Great pop for the corporal. Stupid correspondence, with boring offense from both parties involved, while being too short to matter. The corporal wins when he hits Volkoff with Blassie's stick. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Battle Royal. William Perry and Andre receive the biggest pops. This is quite fun, despite all the NFL talent involved. It is also noteworthy for Bret Hart's first Wrestlemania appearance. Andre wins when he throws out The Hart Foundation. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Tag Team Titles. British Bulldogs / W Lou Albano and Ozzy Osbourne vs. The Dream Team / W Johnny Valiant | C |. Absolutely extraordinary combination, it is one of the best wrestle games of all time. You won't have time to catch your breath, with all the maneuvers within reach and the excellent psychology of the ring. This is pure wrestling at its best, you can't call yourself a Wrestling fan if you don't like this game. The Bulldogs win when Dynamite Kid clashes with Valentine's Day <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> <br /> Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena <br /> <br /> Ricky Steamboat against Hercules Hernandez. Quite decent combine here, with both men performing solid performances. Hercules is an ugly brute, with above-average skills, and contrasts well with Steamboat's flying style. Steamboat wins with a high-flying cross-flying from the top of the rope. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Adrian Adonis against Uncle Elmer. Terrible game, with engaging comedies. Fans love Uncle Elmer, but I don't. Adonis wins with a maneuver on top of the rope. <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> The Funk Brothers vs. Tito Santana and JYD. Fairly solid game here, with lots of memorable shots taken by Terry Funk | that across the table was something else for that time |. I should evaluate this as my second favorite. The Funks win with the help of Jimmy Hart's megaphone. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. Hulk Hogan | C | Vs. King Kong Bundy. Decent pop for Hogan. One of the most overwhelmed matches in the history of Wrestlemania. Hogan can't fight to deserve a lick, and Bundy isn't as good. The violence was brutal for the time, but Hogan's superhero act is rather annoying and there are too many boring moments. Hogan wins when he flees before Bundy. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Wrestlemania 2 is a failure in many respects. Wrestling fans should see it once, but you really don't. There is not enough here to satisfy a true wrestling enthusiast. Vince ruined everything. Don't be fooled by the clamor of the main event, it's really a boring affair, like most paper. Not recommended, and ranks as one of the worst Wrestlemania, outside the brilliant match of the tag title. <br /> <br /> 4/10
