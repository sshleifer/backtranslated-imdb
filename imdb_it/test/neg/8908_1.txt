That sucks that movie is. The script is simply non-existent. The film sometimes looks like a music video. But it can't even be so since the soundtrack doesn't really match. Pathetic way of combining action and rap. You might think it's a recipe for a successful film ... here it fails miserably. The dialogues in this film have just killed me. The scene in which Harlan is interrogated by a policeman is simply painful. In general, recent Seagals films are hardly watchable. What the hell happened to the boy? I know he's old, but can't get "Hollywood" to give him a decent script or something? Is finishing the dough for his escapades in India that takes on whatever he needs?
