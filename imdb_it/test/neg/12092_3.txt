First of all, what is really nice about this movie: <br /> <br /> - Ryan Reynolds, great acting! There are very few actors that I really like and for now it's one of them. He has an extraordinary ability to play the characters. <br /> <br /> - The soundtrack! Great music played at the right time. <br /> <br /> - The idea of ​​a nine lost in his world, unable to leave. <br /> <br /> However, I only give him 3 out of 10 for some flaws: <br /> <br /> - Horrible second part. It seems the director was very eager to do something new, but despite his efforts it was really boring <br /> <br /> - Very annoying character, Melissa. I couldn't stand the scenes with her - that was constantly annoying. She represents everything that is wrong with the American woman. <br /> <br /> - Terrible explanation of the numbers. The director was so busy with the development of the character that he completely lost the point of a good story ... excuse me koala? brr ... terrible! <br /> <br /> This film had great potential. The shooting is well done, the music is really good, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> Look only if you are a fan of Ryan Reynolds or have a lot of free time.
