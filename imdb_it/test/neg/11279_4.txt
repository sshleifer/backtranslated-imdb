For a film made in Senegal, based on Carmen, the book, by Prosper Merimee, this film does not reach a simple resemblance to the story made famous as a work and like other films. > <br /> Ms. Gai as the title Karmen is very nice to see. His fiery dance softens the screen, as in the case of his torrid love scene at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a Karmen that aims to satisfy all genres, but a real Carmen, she is no! <br /> <br /> We would like to see Mrs Gai in other films where her talent is used better than here.
