Yes. It takes a Norwegian to ruin and massacre two great books and a concept that would work well on the film - this film is really the worst Swedish movie of all time. I hated it so much that I even thought about getting out of it, something I never did. But it was so terrible that I was almost irresistible. I just had to sit down until the end. Just like a Stallone action reel from the early 1980s, this REALLY takes up Swedish action back to the Stone Age. So full of logical errors and stupid mistakes is almost funny - but who could ever see something good in the terrible acting, Mark Hamill survives in a minefield or in the donkey, useless and irrational action? <br /> <br /> Let me ask you: are we not going through clocks going down to zero, the hero who flees at the right time and two friends become enemies who eventually rejoin? STUPID !!!! <br /> <br /> And another thing: the product placement in this film is incredible. While other countries have realized that it should not be so OBVIOUS, the Swedish film industry apparently did not understand anything: just look at the credit card that Hamilton uses to open a window? O o o ... this movie really drives me crazy.
