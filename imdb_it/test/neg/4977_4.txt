And now for another point of view: I didn't like it. I didn't actually finish it. I know that "Unforgiven" is considered by some to be one of the greatest westerns ever made. I know he is the protagonist and was directed by Clint Eastwood, one of the icons of American cinema. I know he won a lot of Academy Awards. However, I didn't like it. I don't like Westerners, and it's clearly a matter of taste, but I don't admire Eastwood's acting. He is not and never was a guide man. It is not Burt Lancaster, nor Paul Newman, nor John Wayne. Only in this film is belittled by Richard Harris and Gene Hackman; they are both actors. No, Eastwood is a tall guy with a high-pitched voice who usually plays hard people. Here he plays a retired boy. When I see him on the screen, I see a man working on his acting. Then there is the Western anti-Western plot. Too clearly it is intended to inject contemporary values ​​- a respect for the role of women, blacks, Native Americans and single parents; a lack of respect for violence and drinking; the healthiness that comes from marriage, including interracial marriages and adorable little children, in a century in which those values ​​were not necessarily accepted, at least in these ways. By promoting these values, the film appears polite, if not preacher. Then there are the stereotypes of the film: the prostitutes with golden hearts, the boy who can't shoot, the new city slicker in the Wild West, the sage brush that glitters on a summer afternoon with a musical accompaniment in the major chords. Finally there is the rhythm of Eastwood's direction. I gave up after an hour. Eastwood was still pedaling north, chatting with Morgan Freeman and the boy who couldn't shoot straight, sixty minutes after the plot led by a prostitute's cut had been set in motion. It was too slow. Someone had to find these elements uninteresting. I'm afraid it was me.
