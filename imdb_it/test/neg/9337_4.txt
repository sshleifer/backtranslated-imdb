Right now I'm watching this movie on TV here in Tokyo. Beautiful landscapes, beautiful series of biblical proportions, beautiful costumes, beautiful colors, beautiful Gina. Great culminating scene in which God destroys the Sheban idol and much more with the de Millean lightnings when Yul and Gina are about to consume their love. Yul does a decent job of delivering his lines halfway, even though it sounds a lot like Yul delivering his lines like Ramses or Taras Bulba. George Sanders sounds like George Sanders who plays George Sanders. Given the limited range of acting that she is asked to perform in this role, Gina does a good job, although by the time the film ends, she completely converts into a damned and remorseful girl and looks like she's playing in a biography of Mother Teresa. I imagine the lightning will do it to you, but it's almost unbelievable how quickly you discharge your beliefs for your new religion. Supportive players are mostly horrible, lacking in emotion and credible time. The usual great battle scenes, the ones that passed for lascivious dances in 1959, and an orchestra that exploded a lot of trumpet blasts behind a huge chorus that sang a lot of "Ah", but none of that by far Hollywood quality. The last firefight between Brynner and Sanders is at the extremely low skill level of a middle school opera. The film is a great piece of eye candy but not much more.
