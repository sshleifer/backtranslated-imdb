It could be the worst movie ever made. At least the Outer Space floor 9 was fun. I can't believe they talked to someone to make money to do this. Complete celluloid waste. Before seeing this shit I had a little respect for Kristophersson. I imagine someone needs a tax deduction. Please, in the name of everything that doesn't suck, stop those who did this, before they suck! This film should be avoided by all the people who are not on LSD, or by my crazy cousin who insists we are part of Native Americans. If you're in the woods and an owl starts talking to you, see a psychiatrist. It is not necessary to make a film about it.
