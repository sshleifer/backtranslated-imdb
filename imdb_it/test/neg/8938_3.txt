"Music and lyrics written and performed by Charlie Daniels" ... "nuff said, just don't expect anything like" Devil Went Down To Georgia ", or Charles, in a song at the beginning of Whiskey Mountain (duh) , and that's all for the lyrics. Hey, fans of the rape art scene will kick in the Polaroid montage (my second hand copy is classified as a FAMILY movie) and those who don't like the endless redneck scenes they watch with wonder the pure wimmen? The art of the box has made the film much more bizarre than it was, with the promise that "you can lose your life - or your mind!", but above all they are two couples walking through sticks and "act" in a natural way.
