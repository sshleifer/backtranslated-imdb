This is a classic type B movie that you'd rather not waste time and see. It started well and I thought it would become a good thriller, but I was wrong. Throughout the film, you get the feeling that something interesting will soon occur that will suddenly turn into a tension thriller, but that doesn't happen. It works slowly and peacefully until the end, with nothing interesting. The finish was unexpected and original, but that's all. Rating: 2.5 out of 10. Oh, one more thing. Why is this film classified R anyway?
