Where to start? This movie is a lot of fun if you're new to the wonderful game of rugby, however, if you live outside the United States and follow the game, it's ridiculous. Various rugby traditions such as "Haka", which is preformed by New Zealand "All Blacks" and only by the All Blacks. The leader of the Haka is usually the member of the team with the best Maori pedigree. This is one of the most important conventions of the modern game and has been abused and represented by the writer. The film itself is quite well directed, but it is the poor script and the overall performance that heavily disappointed him. Taking into consideration is based on a true story, it possesses a great deal of clich√©s in the plot. I would strongly recommend that any American interested in rugby watch this film and then watch what rugby is on Youtube because the rugby played in this film has been distorted and distorted so far from what it really is.
