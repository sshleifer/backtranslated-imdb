Intertwined viewpoints can be a good idea in some movies. Here is a total casino. <br /> <br /> But total disorder begins with the story: a mummy of video clips wants to make a light comedy with a pernicious and pernicious female character. She is beautiful and no man could resist diving, crawling and sucking his toes. It is much more materialistic, it seems that the butter will not melt in the mouth. <br /> <br /> The film melts into its own pretentiousness: being smart / funny / good-looking. Phalocretinism at its best. Only white waste, please.
