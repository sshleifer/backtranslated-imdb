I can't remember when was the last time I was so terribly disappointed by any movie. I probably expected it to happen too (in a way you can expect to act in dogma style movies, of course). But there's nothing to do here. Fortunately I was looking at it at home and I could change channels every time silence and insensitive faces began to kill me. And that was very often! It is really not a great pleasure to watch ugly people who do not speak and move slowly, piglets and men kiss French, not to mention ugly bodies that have explicit sex. If only it made sense ... the whole murder situation is ridiculous; it seems to have been created only to show an extra vagina since no character is able to solve the crime. Having only four pseudo-developed characters and a film that isn't going anywhere, it's pretty soon obvious who the director has chosen as a killer. And this also makes no sense. Despite all the boredom and suffering I must admit that in some way it touched me in an inexplicable way. Maybe you should check it for yourself, even if you don't recommend it.
