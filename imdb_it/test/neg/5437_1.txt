Let's see: there is a civil war, a lost city, a talking gorilla, some regular gorillas, a previously unknown species of albino gorilla assassin, the most powerful laser that has ever been known to man, a * lot * of diamonds that lay extracted and sand, hippopotamus attack, an active volcano and a hot air balloon packed in a suitcase on a downed plane. It's not too much, is it? I had more consistent fever dreams ("... and then the Romanian boy picked up a bunch of diamonds, because this was a lost city he was looking for or something, but then the average gorillas we had seen before came out out of nowhere and ate it Now, somehow, the talking gorilla had returned from visiting the regular gorillas and, like some sort of earthquake or volcano, the woman doctor built a gun using a laser and this big diamond that he had just found in the hand of his dead fiance ... "). It is an explosion if you are looking for more ammunition against Michael Crichton's pernicious influence in American entertainment (and therefore world entertainment), and if you keep in mind the extent to which this cynical and melancholy attempt fell on his face at the box office. But, unfortunately, the responsible men - Crichton, sceenwriter John Patrick Shanley, director Frank Marshall - probably never lost a penny. Shame on you, and I mean that. 1/10
