Hi guys, this is my first review and I should have chosen the worst movie to review. As I only saw 5 minutes but believe me, you could see that this movie was not going anywhere. The acting was deplorable, the work of the camera and the lighting seemed to have been shot and managed by a 10-year-old pack. No offense at 10 years. I couldn't take it anymore. I got off my couch, took the DVD of The House of Adam from the DVD player and threw it in the trash. Maybe if you are a Colin Farrell fan this movie might interest you, because the character in the movie, Anthony, is an aspect of Colin Farrell. But this is how far, certainly it will never have the acting skills of col. I gave this film a rating of 1 (horrible) just because there were no shortcomings in the dropdown list.
