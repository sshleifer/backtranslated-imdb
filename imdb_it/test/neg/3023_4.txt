There were two things I hated about WASTED: directing and screenplay. I know I'm opening up to ridicule but the direction of Stephen T Kay is too much like .... like a .... like an MTV pop video. It was shot (I think) on a digital video against an intrusive soundtrack, often blurred and often with a quick transverse cut. If you are not a teenager, you will find many unwatchable WASTED segments due to the stylistic approach. As bad as the direction was the script that tore the chain from me. The story is told through Samantha, a poor rich little girl who spends most of the film talking through her voice (Strange how the finished voice never seems idiosyncratic enough to have come from the same character) who tells us about the pressure of her exams the pressure of domestic life, his social loneliness and all that led her to take drugs. It is for similar reasons, like the separation of the parents, that his two male friends (I thought he should have been alone?) To start taking drugs. Oh poor little Sammi in her beautiful home and her problems as my heart was bleeding for you and your friends - NOT. What WASTED does not say is that regardless of what someone is addicted to alcohol, drugs, nicotine or chocolate, that person must work to become a drug addict, is not a victim of external forces, is committing an act of free will. Both TRAFFIC and TRAINSPOTTING have made this point very well, people become addicts because they want to do it. Painting them as victims in some way is wrong, patronizing and most likely dangerous <br /> <br /> By the way, if MTVs are anti-drugs, will they stop playing videos of stars who freely admit to taking drugs?
