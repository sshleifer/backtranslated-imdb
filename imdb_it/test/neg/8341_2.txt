I saw the trailer for this movie before watching Titanic, and I have to admit that it whetted my appetite. Vulcano seemed to be quite spectacular and full of promise. But that squib damp. Corny is not the word for the script, and the characterizations are often ridiculous. The stupid daughter is simply unbelievable: it should be 13 and not 4. But then scientists, firefighters and peripheral characters no longer offer. This film is placed right in front of Cruise II and Twister, but only because those two films are completely terrifying. This has some reasonable effects, but overall it's a 1 out of 10. Don't waste your time
