I liked most of the dialogues, I liked the cast, I thought it was well acted. I particularly liked the perfect flawless execution of Ellen DeGeneres. <br /> <br /> What didn't work for me was: (1) the relationship with the younger man (too long, too apparently out of character for Helen), (2) the seemingly endless cinematic clichés , mostly visual but including endless voices on re-readings of the same love letter (its contents should have a mystery); (3) a young feminist woman and, ironically, a scene of fireworks (no wonder this reminded me of that horrid film How to make an American quilt); (4) the imbecile "gotcha" cop who smells "drugs" everywhere (no cliché there either!); and (5) a small town environment naively romantic. <br /> <br /> I would have preferred the film to more persuasively explore the source (or even glorify) Helen's bitterness, for having included much more than the character of DeGeneres, having eliminated or reduced the various intergenerational devices, and be a little less uncritical than the life of a small town. <br /> <br /> If it had been developed first as a game, those criticisms could have been addressed before committing the material to this film, which unfortunately is decidedly mediocre.
