I saw three other films worse than this, "Plan 9 from Outerspace", "Side Hackers" and the dreaded "Blair Witch Project" There are so many technical errors in this film that, regardless of a decent storyline, the film is just not it is credible. <br /> <br /> Let's start with an AMTRAK train without skirts or handrails between the cars. The killer walks behind his victim as he moves from one car to another and pushes her from the train. <br /> <br /> In a scene a murderer creeps into a woman's apartment. He wants to sneak up on the woman to kill her, so what does he do? He raises his stereo! If I had heard my stereo suddenly become stronger I would be worried. He kills women by throwing an electric curler in the tub. I was amazed to see that an electric roller with a five-foot cable could be thrown ten feet and stay connected. In addition, the apartment seemed modern enough to have ground outlets in the bathroom and the victim was still electrocuted. <br /> <br /> The Boeing 747 is one of the most famous commercial aircraft on the planet, so this part really surprised me. First the cockpit wasn't even close to a real 747 and secondly it wasn't on the upper deck of the plane. I watched in amazement as the pilot and the copilot (where was the flight engineer?) He walked right past the spiral staircase and headed forward to the nose of the plane. <br /> <br /> I was also amazed that the bullets would not penetrate an aluminum service trolley (which is good for our hero), or the bathroom doors, but would penetrate the ceiling causing a leak of fuel escaping from a small hole in the fuselage. Eh? Watching three guys stretch a 100-meter track in less than a week was quite surprising. <br /> <br /> I didn't check, was it a movie of the week or something? It was terrible.
