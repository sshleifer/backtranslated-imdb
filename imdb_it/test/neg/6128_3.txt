This is the second adaptation by Charlotte Armstrong by Claude Chabrol for the screen: the first was "la rupture" (1970) (from the novel "the balloon man") and it's really a pity no one cares. He is Chabrol's sleeper, and I invite all his fans to see him. <br /> <br /> "The chocolate spider web" was not as strong as a detective story to begin with. I read it 20 years ago and forgot everything. The film promises good things at first, though, then finally disappoints until a flaw. This is a Chabrol film that confuses, mixing elements of the heyday (around 1969), and a lot of tongue in the story that comes since the eighties, the caliber of "poulet" au vinaigre ", not a particularly memorable work. <br /> <br /> Part of the disappointment comes from the cast: this is a distressingly poor encounter: Jacques Dutronc sounds like a zombie, Isabelle Huppert turns out to be a somewhat limited, finally rather vulgar actress, who worked in "une affaire de femme", not here. both in "la rupture") were brilliant and contributed to Chabrol's unique atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The story itself is indistinct: starting as a sort of "serious" "la vie est un long fleuve quiet "(also, a character mentions the film very funny of Etienne Chatilliez), the film drags itself back and forth like a dramatic psychological drama later. We will not congratulate the young female pianist, who after all heard about her wicked hostess, agrees to drive a car along a dangerous road. <br /> <br /> Because he makes too many films, Chabrol often releases turkeys. One wonders why people who want to watch one of his films should choose this among all his things up for grabs. <br /> <br /> It seems that the bourgeois satire of Chabrol has finally given way to clemency. In "the rupture" Armstrong's first adaptation - a media crime story that Chabrol has completely transcended, you should do it he ar Audran says "they have so much money!" Here, Chabrol has lost his bite, his strength.
