The only saving quality of this film is that it shows bands and their music when it was changing in New York in '81. As for the film itself, it has at least three main flaws. First of all, there is a narrative throughout the film, which is not required at all. In the few places where there is a necessary explanation, only the addition of a little dialogue would have come a long way. Secondly, there was no obvious attempt to synchronize the audio, in fact it is quite evident that most of the dialogue was recorded later without any attempt to match the film. The third flaw was in the final. I will not give the final away to those brave souls who would endure the torture of sitting through the film, but commit a capital sin in the script. It's not worth the money or the time it takes to see it, unless you're a fan of one of the represented bands.
