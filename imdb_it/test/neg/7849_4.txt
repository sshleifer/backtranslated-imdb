Perhaps the director was looking for another PIRATO (Good Garland and Kelly musical) - but this lame musical era falls flat. The voices of Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson do not blend well and their chemistry together lacks spark. Sinatra's premise as a sweet boy who tries to impersonate his late "bandit" father is fine, but it looks awkward in the role. What is surprising and wonderful here, is how Sinatra can take a rather insipid song and make it seem special - her phrasing and eloquence as a singer make you want to hear it again. When Grayson sings the same songs it is hard to believe that he is not singing something completely different and not so interesting. She has her big moment with "Love Is Where You Find It" that fits her perfectly and shows her skills. Photography is lucid and both stars look as attractive as costumes and set designs. The co-stars Mildred Natwick and J. Carroll Nash put a lot of energy into making the work impossible. Apart from Sinatra's singing, there is a strange menage-a-tois dance with Ricardo Montalban, Cyd Charisse and Ann Miller. It's fascinating and strange. Montalban and Charisse were a wonderful dance team and this number is a real oddity.
