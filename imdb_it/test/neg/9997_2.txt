Horrible, horrible, terrible, a hundred or so people are not yet beginning to describe how gross "Biggest Loser" is. Imagine this: take two fat couples with nothing interesting to say, humble and make them work to lose weight, all on television in prime time. Am I the only one to think that these are not people with IQ in the 3-digit WANT TO WATCH area? Everything drags on forever, with pieces of bacon complaining about how to lose weight will mean so much to them and their lives. Does anyone care? Do they think we care? Does it matter to them if we care? Probably not. I think I'll resume crunching and selling it to some major TV companies. If this happens on television, then my workouts too!
