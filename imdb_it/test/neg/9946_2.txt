As Jennifer Denuccio said on Square Pegs, "Throw me out the door." I will definitely be voting on this movie on the worst list of IMDB movies. <br /> <br /> Dennis Christopher plays T.T., a boy from Chicago who goes to California to sell his brother's jazz records. He should be a barney in the local surfing community. But he acts more like he's new to civilization (he just tries to get past the sex scene without squirming). There are also the ongoing adventures of the rest of the local population that the spectator has to endure. That of Duke (Seymour Cassell), the volleyball expert who tries to convince TT to behave like a normal human being, the heinous drunken surfers who betray their girlfriends, and the guy who makes a bet with another who can live car for sixth month. <br /> <br /> California Dreaming is just a big old casino. It starts as a typical 1970s game, complete with 70s music (although this film was released a year before the 1980s). And Dennis Christopher turns out to be the most irritable loser, making the movie hard to watch (keep your finger on the fast forward button). Although this film was supposed to be about surfer culture, the surf scenes are almost totally junk. The people at the surf race seem to be unable not to fall asleep. I guess the only interesting thing is to see Tanya Roberts out of her Midge role in the sitcom "That's 70s show." And Cassell wasn't bad, he was just in a bad movie.
