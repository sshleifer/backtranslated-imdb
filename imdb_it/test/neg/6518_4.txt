acting is good. qualify the positive aspects! SOSN is superficial and superficial. Almost all the characters are bourgeois and English. Homosexuals are depicted as volatile sexual predators aiming to use children in their empty lives. This film could only attract people who know about health problems and get less satisfaction. from emphasizing all the points of reference. There is no time to interact with the characters and it has a result that you really don't care about, Catherine Tate at the height of her fame as a woman's comic star that seeks divorce from her husband and on the screen at about the same time that his sketches of Nana failed to convince, but if he had said "what freedom would I have accepted?" I'd rather take a walk in the Park: not intelligent garbage!
