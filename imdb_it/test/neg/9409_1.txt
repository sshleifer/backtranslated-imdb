For all the cast and crew that worked on this excuse for a movie, another payday in L.A. For any public hoping for a fair return on the admission price, a huge waste of time and money. The saddest aspect of this bad exercise (for me) is that we are looking at a very talented actor, Pacino, who apparently plays a parody of himself. This is what has remained with me as a total mystery. I can fully understand the need for people in the film industry to work and earn their living. What I can't understand is a talented artist from Al Pacino who prostitutes himself and embarrasses himself with this level of mindless trash. I hope you choose projects of better value in the future ... and by value, save time and hard-earned money. Skip this !! We send a message to Hollywood and Al.
