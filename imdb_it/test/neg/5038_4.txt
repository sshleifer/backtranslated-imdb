Not only is The Great Rock N Roll Swindle completely inaccurate, but when it comes to it, there isn't much that is interesting or even fun. Apparently, Malcolm McLaren has squandered most of the Sex Pistols' earnings on this waste of film, which makes it much more hateful. The intention, from the beginning, was to create a monument to the "genius" of McLaren, who until now takes full credit for creating punk music, creating the Sex Pistols and, sometimes, even writing all the songs . Viewers follow McLaren in various contexts, where he tells his story to his helper, a female dwarf, and simply takes credit for one thing after another. A particularly irritating scene has McLaren in an abandoned hangar, waiting for a plane, haunted by journalists and giving them their "great story". The most enjoyable elements of the film are the animated short films, however, even this stench of McLaren's preponderance. <br /> <br /> Even as a farce, this movie doesn't work. Little is fun except Steve Jones, who is surprisingly decent as a pseudo-detective type. 20 years later, Julien Temple, who wrote and directed this film, also directed the Sex Pistols documentary "The Filth and the Fury". While that film is much better and more interesting than "Swindle", it is still full of "artistic blooms" from Temple that simply don't work, like interviewing band members in the shade, as if they were some sort of criminal witness trying to hide their identity. An interesting curiosity: the film critic Roger Ebert was one of the original writers of the movie "Who Killed Bambi?", Which eventually became "Swindle".
