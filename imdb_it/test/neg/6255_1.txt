This film was simply ugly. I can forgive low budget movies for being on a low budget, but it wasn't fun, it wasn't smart, it didn't get any ransom, unless you like fake tits. I don't know how this genre is classified, perhaps an erotic horror, but if so ... well, it's neither sexy nor scary. Binding him to the Slumber Party Massacre movies was useless; I had never seen the previous films and, except for a scene that tried to tie together, I had no way of knowing who the psychopathic killer escaped in 'Cheerleader' or why they took the trouble to include him, especially because (and I don't think to reveal anything here) it was really obvious that the cheerleader killer in this movie wasn't him. As for the murderer right? All I can say is, lame. Really lame. When you find out why the killer is throwing the cheerleader team (and the team coach, and two stoners who were on the bus journey they are taking, and the bus driver just for the fun of it, apparently) you sit go and go ... WTF? Worst excuse for a never-killing spree. The "actors" (two guess why I added the quotes) generally looked like cheap pornographic scraps, which probably were. Those poor, trying to get into the "legitimate" film. One of my friends had this to say about the actor who played Buzzy, the bus driver: "He looks like the guy who, you know, really gets into him, and his face gets all red and stuff like that" . We had a good larf in this. Half of the other actors had all the skill and subtlety of the actors in the production of "Annie" of the first media that I just saw. The other half seemed almost bored to death (especially in the deleted scene, this red ...), and even after ten minutes in this movie I was. <br /> <br /> A note: the DVD contains a deleted scene, which would have taken the movie from R-rated to NC-17 if it was left in. It was completely free, and as an adult entertainment it has no quality. The only reason to worry is to laugh, very much, to nastiness.
