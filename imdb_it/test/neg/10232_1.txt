I'm the kind of person who never, ever, sees animated films, but I make an exception for Thumbelina and Swan Princess. Being absolutely in love with the first episode of the series, I bought it and sat looking at it with a very prejudiced mind, determined to love it because I had spent money buying it. I finished the movie and all I can think of is THE HORROR !!! I wanted to like it, really. I tried a lot, VERY difficult to love. But I couldn't enjoy a second of this grueling film. The songs made me feel like tearing my ears off my head. The dialogue was so lame that I felt myself quiver with frustration and irritation every time someone opened his mouth. The villain was ridiculous and I felt Derek and Odette die at the end ... and I was absolutely in love with them from the first movie. <br /> <br /> I'm going to try to repress the memory of this movie, because it almost destroyed the first for me. There is a song in the film where there is a series of flashbacks to the first movie. The difference in animation between the two is made very obvious, and I began to desire the first and wishing I had never seen the third. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time.
