Here in Australia Nights in Rodanthe is promoted to the same class as the Notebook. Frankly, what a lot of rot. <br /> <br /> This film is like a recipe. On paper we have all the right ingredients ... Richard Gere is normally perfect in this genre, Diane Lane is an old favorite with "Under Tuscan Sun" and "Unfaithful", a position on the ocean, solitude yet the film sucks. We went to the session yesterday afternoon, a woman next to my wife fell asleep and halfway through the film she got up and left! The main problem is that there is no accumulation or credibility in the relationship in the first place. And maybe there are too many long and low faces if you like the stories that the characters of Gere and Lane bring to the film. There are hours of balanced ones with maybe 5 minutes of what we can see ... romance! There is no warmth in the character of Gere, Lane looks terrible at the beginning of the film and everything fades. So as a spectator we can't really connect to the characters. <br /> <br /> The others here say that the book is fantastic. Well, either the script, the direction or the production, someone here has made a real mess of this movie. It is as if the scenes and the accumulation were a deck of cards except instead of being in the correct order in which they were thrown together everywhere. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing ... save money for when it hits the video stores and even then expect a good deal when it goes at the weekly rate.
