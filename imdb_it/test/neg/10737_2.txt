Just a few words: it's a good thing George A Romero is still with us because if he died, he would be forced to go up from the grave to vote against the people who made this 'political satire' And the saddest thing of all is that In reality I agree with the feelings of these people. Yes, there are zombies and they have a good reason to come back from behind the grave: vote. Oh, and one of them ends Startrek Voyager's The Doctor. It's scary how much people will get. If you are looking for a horror movie I suggest you keep looking. And if you're looking for a witty political satire, you're also in the wrong place and not just because this series is called Masters of Horror. But don't let yourself be held back: maybe you see something I missed. Although it's likely that you're wasting your time with it just like I did. Let's say I prefer my zombie movies with the zombies standing in front of the camera.
