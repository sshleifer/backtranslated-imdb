I don't agree to call this film stoner just because Weed also makes an appearance. I can't imagine it even approaching the "classic stoner". It would be like calling Singles a "grunge film". The film certainly trudges along with a dark plot. Sometimes I wondered if the script had been dropped and shuffled or if they had lost it completely and had just tried to take it off. Watching this movie reminded me to watch children act and make history as they go along. <br /> <br /> The characters are wooden, the dialogue is taxed and the whole story seems to be completely disconnected. Who was killed? When? What? And this is how you act when your friend overdoses? Complete lack of emotion and total disconnection from reality. <br /> <br /> Concerning the droning guitar soundtrack that accompanies each scene: enough! It was like looking at the opening menu screen where the same track runs infinitely in the background, without moving forward or backward. <br /> <br /> I kept watching and hoping that the plot could somehow fall into order, acting and dialogue would improve or something, somehow it would concentrate this mess in a coherent film. After 112 minutes, it never happened.
