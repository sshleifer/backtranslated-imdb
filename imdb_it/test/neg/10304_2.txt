Fox is rather lame. Cancel the wrong shows. It's bizarre that they would delete a well-written program like "Arrested Development" and still keep this show and "War at Home". I feel that Fox loved the fact that he broke the barriers with the then sharp-edged "Married with children", but now it's getting ridiculous. "The Loop" is a useless and boring watch, and their sharp jokes simply fall flat. To make the edgy comedy work you have to keep making jokes. "Family Guy" and "The Simpons" work because there is a constant stream of jokes. Fox needs to pull his head out of the rectal cavities and stop letting their relatives write this mediocre tripe. I mean, if you're going to invest money to do something fun, make it fun. Also, stop using "unnamed" actors. It's nice to have up-and-comers, but you need to anchor a show with a famous celebrity. Duh, Fox.
