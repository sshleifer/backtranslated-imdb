Mocked by most critics when he first appeared, "Frenzy" recently toured UK TV. I remember seeing it in its original version and thought that if Hitchcock wanted to show off a sort of confession on the screen of his ingrained misogynist, he could not find a worse little vehicle to do so. <br /> <br /> But Time alters the perspective, and therefore what was sickly bad in 1972 could, in all these years, be worthy of a revaluation upwards. <br /> <br /> It could. . . but no. 'Frenesia' is waste. The dross of an elderly director who desperately wanted to exploit the artistic freedom of film production in the 1970s without realizing that freedom imposes his obligations - in particular, the need to bring integrity to his work. <br /> <br /> There's nobody here. And there is not much evidence of the director's previous brilliance, or - the transition from an implicit pinch to an explicit hateful is neither shocking nor, for a supreme, stylish stylist: it's just trivial (the scene of the prolonged murder is precisely that : prolonged, without rhythm, without reason, without a purpose other than the cheapest of directorial wishes to appear contemporary as an artist as, say, that the other acclaimed economic scam practitioner, Michael Winner). <br /> <br /> And it goes from bad to worse, with a dialogue that defies all human origins (not least in the ridiculous diversion in the domestic life of our dear wooden inspector, and his wife's kitchen). <br /> <br /> Perhaps the scene that best sums up 'Frenzy' (and resists as the most explicit charge on the character of Hitchcock) is the clunking exchange between two lawyers in a bar, where they discuss serial murders and then agree on the fact that at least women have fun before being raped. <br /> <br /> I remember my revulsion at that scene dating back to '72, and it's still unpublished, because it wasn't Hitchcock being smart, or sardonic, or trying to make a universal point (big themes, great truths, they weren't Hitchcock's strength, or personal preferences.) It was just Hitchcock, which allows you to reflect on your distorted mirror on life to shine through the plot of the film. <br /> <br /> Calling "Frenzy" Hitchcock's last great masterpiece is to betray little if not the slightest understanding of what Hitchcock actually achieved in terms of film tricks, cinematic thrills and dazzling cinematic mastery. <br /> <br /> 'Frenzy' is therefore now what it has always been: an economic film, bad and an iron fist that did not serve any of those involved, or in the memory of a filmmaker who was really , in his Hollywood days, one of the greatest ever there has been.
