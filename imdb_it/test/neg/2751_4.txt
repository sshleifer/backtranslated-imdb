I've read many reviews on IMDb (well, all five that were written at the time I'm writing this article) and I'm surprised by the number of praises on The Brideless Groom, which is undoubtedly one of the minor comedies performed by the Stooges. I prefer the larger ones where Larry, Curly and Moe were, although Shemp is honored for most of Sing's Song of Six Pants funny scenes, another Stooges short which is only moderately funny but far superior to Brideless Groom. In fact, there is a somewhat funny scene in the film, the "don't-hit-a-lady" scene, which is barely funny and is 15 minutes into the film. Not very promising in a 17-minute play. <br /> <br /> Shemp is a vocal instructor whose uncle has died and left him an inheritance of $ 500,000, provided he gets married within 48 hours, which is quite short, but when Shemp comes aware, he only has 7 hours left. This is a premise that had already been made and redone earlier, but it was not, I think, a massive clich√© at the time this film was made, as it is now. There are a number of gags throughout the film, none of which is even close to the level of the comedy for which the Three Little Mites are so widely known. Does the Stooges seem to have encountered the same problems that have plagued so many Shirley Temple films ?? there is too little reliance on the contents and too much confidence only on the fact that they are there. <br /> <br /> The standard features of the Stooges are here, Moe is the medium one, whose pettiness is certainly not used sparingly in this film, and the slapstick sound effects (although with more exceptions than usual) are rather funny, but they are included in their standard slots in this movie. The "Keep your hands, you pigeons" line is immortal. The rest of the film is not. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of talk among the other people who have reviewed this film for this site about the fact that this is one of the best short films of the Stooges, that you won't find a weak moment, about how this is the maximum from the first thirty years. It's not true. I can certainly understand a level of automatic respect for the milestone classics and for the giants of the first comedy, which certainly are the Three Stooges, but that respect is damaged when the poorest films are praised more than they should be. The Brideless Groom deserves some respect because it's a Stooges movie, but for the exact same reason, it should have been better. The three marmittoni were simply better than this.
