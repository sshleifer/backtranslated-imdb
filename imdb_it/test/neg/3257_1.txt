I have vague memories of the fact that this movie is fun. <br /> <br /> After seeing it again or I changed or was thinking of another movie altogether. <br /> <br /> It seems like we're supposed to be in tune with the character of Jackie Mason, yet nothing in the film really generates that emotion. It is noteworthy that he is really the only one to grant a tender dialogue with loved ones. Nobody's character is allowed to rise to the state of even vaguely human. <br /> <br /> I don't even like golf, but as the movie went on I found myself really cheering for Robart Stack and the guys in the club, really hoping they would reject Mason and Chevy Chase.
