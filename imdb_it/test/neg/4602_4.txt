Clearly this film was made for a new generation that may or may not have had the idea of ​​Charles Bukowski's work. Henry Chinaski's autobiographical character in Bukowski's stories was brilliantly played to perfection by Mickey Rourke in 1987 "Barfly", also played by Faye Dunaway. Anyone who has seen "Factotum" should certainly see "Barfly" to better see how Bukowski wrote his character. 'Factotum' does not have the unctuous filth of Bukowski's script and the fearless desperation of his lone hero. The involuntary humor that breaks into the dark despair of Chinaski's misadventures does not work for Dillon as he has done so admirably for the filthy and filthy Rourke. The character of Rourke makes the pain and pleasure of the misbehavior of the previous night a place for yet another grueling day in the life of a misanthropic and drunk and unknown writer. The character of Dillon lacks these signs in favor of a strutting, beautiful, relatively clean writer of wanna-be who passes almost for no moment in that of Chinaski's story. Dunaway's ill-fated heroine, Wanda, is the perfect complement to Henry, the grandfather-benino. Women in "Factotum" cannot hold a candle to Dunaway's "distressed goddess" and the use of more profane sexual arguments in "Factotum" proves to be more than a raw distraction of a hat tip for the raw and nasty of Bukowski portraits of dysfunctional relationships. I was stunned by the way many of the same identical scenes were used in "Factotum" (Marisa Tomei who buys everything and loads it to the old is an exact fake from "Barfly"). <br /> <br /> If you want to see Bukowski's best stories on the film, see 'Barfly' and 'Love is a Dog From Hell' (also called 'Crazy Love').
