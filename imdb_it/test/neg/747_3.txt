The BBC and the Arts & Entertainment Network should be ashamed of themselves for putting this unfortunate production on the world. The acting is, with the exception of Robert Hardy in the role of General Tilney, at best amateur and at worst painfully painful. The costumes are exaggerated and present some really macabre excesses - was the costume designer obsessed by feathers for women's hats? Surely EVERY woman in Bath had no feathers in her headdress in the early 19th century. Production values ​​are mediocre and the rhythm of the film makes it appear that it was hastily and clumsily modified at the last minute. Altogether a distressing film that I had to force myself to watch until the end. It's a shame, as producers obviously spent a lot of money on costumes and outdoor shooting. Compared to the sublime "Senso e Sensibilità" by Emma Thompson or the extraordinary 1995 production of "Pride and Prejudice" or the subtle intensity of the "Persuasion" of 1995, this production of "Abbey of Northanger" certainly has Jane Austen turning in tomb.
