I mistakenly thought that this neo-noir effort from the Buffalo - Niagara Falls area could be something different. Unfortunately I was not correct. There are many problems with "The Falls", which actually have nothing to do with its low-budget video production. Immediately one has to wonder why all the constant narration? My feeling is that if you have a decent script, the audience will follow, without having to be insulted with the voice on storytelling. The acting is very amateurish, which is not unexpected, but it simply adds to the problems. Finally, the whole thing is bothered by an MTV music video, which I found completely unacceptable. Narration, bad acting and annoying video effects are all good reasons why this should be avoided. - MERK
