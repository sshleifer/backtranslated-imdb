I started to get interested in the film a little. It seemed that it could be a serious drama, facing death, pain and healing, with some realistic human conflict. Alas, he could not hold up. <br /> <br /> I need a movie with something coherent and credible characters. Too many characters in this film have been described as extremely gullible and incoherent. Look, I know this was not to be Shakespeare, but come on, I need some quality in the script and characterization. <br /> <br /> The acting went well, the script is not so important. At one point, the character of James Brolin is reproached for appearing at a picnic under his clothes. He declares that ordering it will not work. His new wife says that if he goes home and changes he will tear off his clothes later. This is a screamer. This film had some unwittingly funny jokes. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to take care of the character of Jolin by Brolin. When he promptly handed over his first wife's things to his new wife, even allowing his daughter to be snubbed, I lost most of my understanding. Who really cares what happens to him. I must confess that I didn't finish the film. If you've made a quality 180 in the last 45 minutes, let me know. It was simply unpleasant to look at and so predictable I felt that there was no need to finish it.
