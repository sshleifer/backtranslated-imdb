Sometimes I like a good horror movie, so I thought this would be a splatter and gore movie. but it was a boring boring movie, maybe because I saw a cut version, because where there are only two things that where a little splatter, once where some cut someone off and where someone shoots him an arm, but where one the only things Wismaster, for example, had more fantastic senes and then he was evil, he is more boring than bad. and some actors who are disgusting
