I saw this movie purely based on the fact that he was on the DPP Video Nasty list, and while I'm glad to have seen him because he is now "another Nasty Down Video" - on his merits, Andy Milligan's movie is not really worth the worth worrying about There are, of course, much worse films on the infamous list; but this does not make the pain of seeing it easier. The film was obviously shot with an extremely low budget, and this was translated into the script; how Blood Rites works on an idea often seen in horror movies, and does nothing new with it. Basically, the plot focuses on three couples who are in a house waiting for the results of a will. It doesn't take long before they start being picked up ... blah blah blah. For most of the movie, nothing happens; and then when we finally get to the scenes that justify the fact that the film is banned, they are so amateurish and stupid that they can't be taken seriously at any level. It is a very good thing that this film does not have a very long execution time because otherwise it could have been used as a particularly unpleasant torture method. It all boils down to a tedious ending, which also manages to be a non-event of epic proportions. Apparently, this film is still banned here in the UK; but somehow I doubt it's because of its shock value. Basically, Blood Rites is not worth seeing and personally I see no reason to recommend it. Unless, of course, you did your job to see everything on the Nasty Video list ...
