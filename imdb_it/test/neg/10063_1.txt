The Golan and Globus producers should have been ashamed to publicly release this piece of garbage. I know this will sound like a clich√©, but compared to this, the first "Hercules" of 1983 looks like a mature and exciting epic! This "sequel" is morally, cheaply, irredeemable, childish, fake, inept and BADLY ACTED. A point of reference in bad cinema, and one of the few, few films that I saw that REALLY deserved the lowest possible vote: no stars!
