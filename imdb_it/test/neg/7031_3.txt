Have we all seen the same movie ??? I can't believe the raves that some of the others are giving this really terrible bio that, believing or not, was authorized by Shirley Temple, based on her book CHILD STAR. It gives me the feeling that some are terribly easy to please. <br /> <br /> First of all, ASHLEY ROSE ORR, whatever its modest talents, in no way, the form or shape resemble Shirley Temple enough to be cast as she is in this sort of simple biography of the most famous child of the world. He gives no indication as to why or how this child was so revered, except for trying his hardest for a Shirley imitation that never clicked on any level. Absolutely not. <br /> <br /> And this is the main handicap of the entire piece. But as if this were not bad enough, any drama inherent in Shirley's story about his rise to near-night celebrity has been completely bleached by an insipid writing punctuated by occasional moments of singing and dancing that don't even come close to what Shirley did (as for example, "The Codfish Ball" with Buddy Ebsen which was probably the highlight of Shirley's dance choreography). <br /> <br /> Simply putting a girl in a polka-dot dress doesn't make her Shirley Temple. None of Shirley's brand of charm, warmth and charm is even remotely suggested. Everything we see on display is a pale imitation of the original demonstration, once and for all, that there was only one Shirley Temple. <br /> <br /> It is not worth writing more about this casino. None of the others is more than normal in lifeless roles. My advice for Shirley fans is to read his book - or better yet - watch his films. <br /> <br /> This is the hole.
