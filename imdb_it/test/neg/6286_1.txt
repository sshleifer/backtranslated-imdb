Wow ... <br /> <br /> Reading these comments, I see an extraordinary socio-cultural clash between the United States and ... the Dutch! The United States P.o.V. it seems that this is a good little film, Parker is a nice hero, the story a carefree rendition of what could be a glorified form of reality. <br /> <br /> All three Dutch reviewers see the world looking like a completely different pair of glasses. I am categorically and in surprisingly similar terms agree that the film is a disaster. <br /> <br /> Far be it from me to take a position in what appears to be a dispute between cultures, about this object as wide as the ocean that separates them geographically. Again, based on a factual observation - I saw the film with my own eyes - I suspect the Dutch are not too far away: <br /> <br /> "Parker Kane" is badly done, absolutely boring, and really not worth the celluloid that was undoubtedly wasted in its creation.
