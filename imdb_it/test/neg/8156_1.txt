Rarely is there such a bad film to reach the often sought-after paradigm of having so little value of salvation that it alone is worth looking at. "Cyclone", I'm happy to report, it's a film like that. <br /> <br /> I knew I had something good as soon as I found the videotape. They are at least his fourth owner: he has a "Sale of used films! $ 9.95" sticker on the front and a sales sticker for the yard for a dollar. I took it from a thrift store for fifty cents. <br /> <br /> The sale of used films! the sticker covers most of the covers on the cover, which means that what I see is a strange mixture still on the front of the super bike Cyclone, a car that ignites and Heather Thomas, who wears Flouncy Eighties Hair with her mouth open in an expression that says: "I am my pain". I saw it and thought, "All RIGHT". The case, honestly, was enough ("without a place to turn and no one to trust, Teri has fallen into a maze of dangers and deceit"), but I really surprised myself by turning around to look at him. I always make time for really bad movies. The "Fight Club" ribbon can wait. <br /> <br /> Meet Teri. Teri is an extraordinarily well done character, as we can say from his introduction, in which she and her friend do exercises that highlight her breasts and, later, her leg warmers. Then Teri gets in touch with her boyfriend for the terribly bad evening. Before she knows it, Teri is guided "straight into a network of deadly double intersections in CYCLONE". The VHS box says how it is. <br /> <br /> Summed from the start, perhaps out of a vague hope that the real copies of this film would be sold - the acting is horrible. It could have been just me, but I kept thinking I could read the characters' thoughts through their eyes. "This is stupid," thinks Heather Thomas. "I know," thinks Bad Guy with Too-Wide Mouth. <br /> <br /> A driving force (no pun intended) for the second part of this epic image are car chases. Those were actually pretty good, although I'm inclined to think that gasoline doesn't need coaching on how to explode. What really impressed me was that, in all the pursuits, the streets were practically empty. It's like there are only twenty people in this huge city. <br /> <br /> I know what you're thinking. You're thinking "Gee Wilikers! I have to see this movie!" The sad thing, though, is that you can't find it. Oh no "Cyclone" is a movie that finds you. Wait up. One day - perhaps during lunch, perhaps late at night, perhaps "when military scientist Jeffery Combs (" Re-Animator ") is assassinated by assassins" - you will hear the rustle of leg warmers and you will know that it is time.
