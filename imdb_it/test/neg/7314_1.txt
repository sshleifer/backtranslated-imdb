The "bad behavior" was one of a series of texts published in Australia during the first half of the 1990s that explored the alleged victimization of the privileged heterosexual male in the era of feminism. This creature only needs to look at something quite young, and is accused of sexual harassment, and its life is ruined. Damn those pounds of women! Grrr ... <br /> <br /> As my tone might suggest, I don't buy any of these BS anti-feminists, and as a result I didn't like this movie. "GM" trivializes the issues of sexual harassment and teacher-student relations. Sexual harassment here is the result of the imagination of a confused young woman and those professional boundaries that teachers are bound to keep ... well, when the teacher is a charming and handsome family man (and played by Jimmy Smits !), Well you don't need it "t worried about those. <br /> <br /> sexist trash, and even reviewing it, I'm giving you more time than you deserve.
