I'm surprised to read all the positive comments on this film. Even my 4 and 6 years were bored. The squirrels are cute ... but the plot is too obvious. Not recommended for young people with less sophisticated tastes. <br /> <br /> We heard some laughter from the audience while we were present; but I was wondering why. <br /> <br /> I don't admit I've ever been a "chipmunks" fan, but I expected to be entertained. It is not even an "escape" film, as far as I can tell. Simply a heavy vision of "too young booty success". We've seen more than enough with Britney Spears, and so on, haven't we? <br /> <br /> Don't disturb yourself.
