This is really terrible, the weakest attempt at an adaptation to comics ever committed in the cinema. Every possible thing about this movie that could be bad is. Music, acting, lights, sets, "special" effects ... about the only positive aspects I can find are that Sue looks pretty in her blue tights and that the Thing make-up is almost passable (face only). That's all. ZIP. Don't worry about tracking down that copy of bootleg; not really worth your time. Even the abortive movie of "Captain America" ​​of the early 90s is much less heartbreaking than the one shaking on the seat while trying to endure this mess.
