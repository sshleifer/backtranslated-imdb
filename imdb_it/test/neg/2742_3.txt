This was quite inevitable. This film borrows from "The Core" and from the film borrowed from "Armageddon" and from the films borrowed from and so on. Except this time there is also Luke Perry. This film version of the famous plot of the world of rescues involves super earthquakes that start in the Pacific Northwest and extend to the entire ring of fire. He soon established that everyone on Earth could be condemned. So the military and some scientists build one of those high-tech drilling machines to enter the Earth and fix things (it wouldn't be fun if they didn't have to go somewhere like in space or inside the planet). There is also a line that tries to make the journey to Earth more impressive than the journey in space (like the one in "Armageddon"). It's a science fiction movie, so the script is painted with numbers of disasters. There are fights between scientists and the military, there are lasers that melt, people who die and sacrifice themselves for the good of all and, above all, there are special effects (weak CGI). Not original and not so funny. This is a movie to watch when you have nothing to do, especially if you have beer.
