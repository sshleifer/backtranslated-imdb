Jeff Fahey has such watchful eyes and an indecent and insidious smile that every character he plays seems wicked; therefore, it doesn't really work to cast him as the good guy of the piece, the audience is just waiting for his character to crack and start to blow up people. Drew Barrymore, fresh from his acclaimed role as "Poison Ivy", must have made this film simply as a favor to director Phedon Papamichael (he was the director of photography on "Ivy"); playing a character named Daisy Drew (!), she was immediately thrown away, which leaves us with no one to watch, but Jeff Fahey and Sean Young (who didn't have a single little "Blade Runner" camera moment) . This witty script, by Michael Angeli, concerns a police artist who draws his wife's face from the testimony of a murder witness, and while it is not a bad idea for a plot, it would be much better suited for a television series than a Now. This cable movie is short on inspiration (starting with casting) and shorter than surprises. * from ****
