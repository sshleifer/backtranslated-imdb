The use of "astral projection" (wandering soul), to exist outside the body, with the result of inflicting horrible deaths (crushing the bowels of the victims that lead to the breaking of the spine and broken organs) on those close to the one with this ability, is the threat of ETERNAL EVIL, which gives Karen Black (as Janus) another "unique" character to imitate as a woman who influences a commercial director, Paul Sharpe (Winston Rekert) tired of his marriage waning and his boring career. In fact, he is dying and needs his body, his potentially harmful spirit for his wife and child (.. his son has a "special friend" who talks about him in things, even poisoning himself at some point). A detective, Kauffman (John Novak) who investigates unusual murders concerning those killed by the benevolent spirit, binds Paul to death and through him discovers Janus. Soon they both realize that Janus must be stopped or will simply move on to another human host. What Paul doesn't know is that his new secretary is Janus's lover, both of whom were actually older intellectuals featured in his astral projection documentary called WANDERING SOUL. <br /> <br /> Director George Mihalka (My Bloody Valentine) certainly creates a strange atmosphere with this film which contains a rather bizarre premise. It seems that Paul's boy can see the spirit moving in the form of a "blue man", manipulating the child in disorderly conduct. Black, despite being treated with the stars, is rarely shot from close up using his face which can produce the kind of evil that his character guarantees. Instead, her voice is struck from afar, and she never manages to establish herself with the right threat which is a lost opportunity, in my opinion. For some reason, despite the intriguing (albeit strange) idea of ​​astral projection that causes a spirit to kill people from within, the film never takes off. The soundtrack is very "Yanni-ish" and the lighting (.. and the sound), while it is sometimes moody and effective, is often quite murky. Rhythm is a problem, too, like the long story mules. The cast is rather limping, especially Rekert in the lead, his performance is irregular, at best. It doesn't help that there are few characters (except Paul's wife) that we can care less about, and what really hurts is that Paul himself is not exactly the most adorable person in the world ... he can be rather difficult and moody , his unsatisfied career is a reason for such behavior. Black should have been a prominent figure in the film, but it remains mainly in the background, spoken in dialogue between Paul and Kauffman, but he rarely has the chance to amuse himself with his histrionics, which is a shame.
