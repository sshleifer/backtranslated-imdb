Jumpin 'Butterballs, this movie stinks! It is a boring and listless resistance that never gives up. It is amazing that someone has taken the trouble to make Groucho his bizarre brand of eyebrows and mustaches because he has nothing witty or outrageous to do or say for all this boredom. Chico must have been so uninterested as to forget to use his Italian accent. <br /> <br /> Only Harpo offers a smile or two, and there is still little of what goes around anyway. The figure in a hotel manager full of bullies and another obnoxious co-comedian in Frank Albertson, and the road becomes even more unfortunate. <br /> <br /> A true misfire.
