The next stop on our journey in the calender scene is ... oh yes, "Graduation Day"! All those old people, simply full of possibilities and ready to venture into the real world and become adults. That is, however, SE can make it to graduate without having to intertwine with the crazy campus that is running around, digging life out of students with his fencing sword ... Yes, it all comes from a high school star who falls dead from a blood clot during a race and a year later, his older sister returns home from the Navy for graduation. The track coach holds the blame and hatches in his downgraded store class position, while the girl's boyfriend still mourns her death a year later ... All these characters are the main candidates for "Serial Slogan of the Year" and you just have to sit through this movie until the end to find out who-made-it. "Graduation day" is fun, even if it is not absolutely original in every way and there are not many memorable deaths, but there is enough to keep you entertained. Like Linnea Quigley who fucks the music teacher and gets caught with a 30-year-old actor who plays teenagers, and of course ... I roll! I must love that shit! You can do a lot worse than "Graduation Day", kids ...
