Get Smart should be titled Get Stupid. There is no funny line or gag in the whole movie. This film is so ugly that it makes the Austin Powers films a Shakespearean look. Some other films like this and Steve Carell can kiss his goodbye career. As for Anne Hathaway, what is she doing in this movie? She's a good actress, but it's just terrible. <br /> <br /> The writing is pathetically lame. There is no fun, intelligent or witty line. There is no good gag view. <br /> <br /> The direction is terrible. The comedy is based on time. Someone should tell the manager. Every line that should be fun (and it isn't) is delivered with the worst sense of comic time I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 0 stars
