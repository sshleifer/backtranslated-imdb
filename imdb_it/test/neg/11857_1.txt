Roger Corman appreciated his cinematic infamy actions in his illustrious low-budget career, covering over 300 films. While few (if any) would call it grandiose, the obscure connections of his films with underground culture (through references, tributes or influences) have given him a legacy of sorts. Throughout his career, he has also developed a bad habit of remaking his films ("Piranha", "Humanoids from the Deep", "The Black Scorpion", etc.), without improving them at all. "Raptor", "written" and "directed" by "Jay Andrews" (Jim Wynorski, the man behind one of my favorite guilty cinematic pleasures, "Chopping Mall") brings that practice to a new eerie bass about the middle of the years '90 by Corman The trilogy of "Carnosaur". <br /> <br /> Wynorski's credits are in quotes because "Raptor" is not a tribute to the "Carnosaur" films or even a remake. "Raptor" It is the movie "Carnosaur", or at least the death scenes induced by the film's dinosaurs, combined at random with the trace elements of the original plot and some scenes just shot (many of which consist of "dino's eye view" in a lame attempt to make the scenes less obvious). The "new" material was written around the movie, instead of vice versa, and is completely insignificant, with huge gaps in logic (for example two separate teams are sent by the army simply to resume from parts 2 and 3, where the soldiers they had different uniforms, it could be included), which is surprising considering the little logic that plays in the "Carnosaur" films. The lack of feeling of the actors in their characters (even if in all honesty, any dimension of the character is presented in the script once, maybe twice) makes us think of the terribly wooden acting of the b-movies of the 50s, and certainly not produces nothing among the torn attack scenes that are worth looking at. Even more embarrassing for the actors of the new scenes is when there is an obvious discrepancy in the physical construction between the new actor and the actor in the original scene. When the only scene that evokes a response in a film is the oldest trick of the book of horror, the "spring animal", something is seriously wrong. <br /> <br /> As it is, this is a despicable practice in two b-grade figures (who don't have to worry about ruining their reputation, because they don't have one) who rip their material, for the cheaper and faster than dirty tricks, simply because they can (because otherwise someone will feel in possession of tearing a series destined to be a rip-off of the series "Jurassic Park"?). There is nothing else I can say except that this film carries my highest recommendations AGAINST the vision; the only good thing (besides observing Melissa Braselle's navel) is that now I don't have to see any of the "Carnosaur" films.
