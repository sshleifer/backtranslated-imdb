I can't believe how this atrocity managed to capture the hearts and minds of a cross section of the "bright young things" of his era, but I'm sure I wish it wasn't so. In my opinion it is an imprecise, poorly interpreted, faintly scripted, pretentiously directed piece of gumpf. The brief exits to an imagined reality strike to death any humor. The situations are imperceptible exaggerations that make the already fragile characters even more incredible and detestable. Romanticism is boring, the end is unsatisfactory and ruins the only sensible drug message in the film and the simple plot ('Withnail and I', 'Fear and Loathing') is put to the test with the uninteresting movement of the film. In short, this film is an obvious visual assault without any sign of skill or initiative. I condemn him to the ash pile in history and pray for him to stay there.
