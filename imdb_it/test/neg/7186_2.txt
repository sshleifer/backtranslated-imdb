Afraid of the Dark left me with the impression that several screenplays had been written, too short for a feature film, then clumsily joined together in Frankenstein's monster. <br /> <br /> At its best, the protagonist, Lucas, is creepy. As difficult as it is to draw a bead on secondary characters, they are much more understanding. <br /> <br /> Afraid of the Dark could have achieved mediocrity if he had only one approach and seen it - and if he had made Lucas simply psychotic and confused instead of demonic and daunting. I wanted to see him locked up in an asylum so that the rest of the characters could have a normal life.
