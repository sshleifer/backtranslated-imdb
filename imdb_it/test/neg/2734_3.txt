The screenplay seems to have been "wholesale" (ahem ahem, cough), "borrowed" from a certain other film that included the use of a self-propelled machine with a manned drilling rig. Scene by scene, the two films were almost identical. Only a sufficient number of serial numbers has been archived in this article to prevent a copyright infringement case. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, I have to say that I found it a bit funny since I like it deep underground - kind of movie. It's a little stupid about science, but if one is willing to squint really hard and pretend not to notice that gaffe scientific here and there and everywhere, this movie is almost bearable. Much better than "Supernova", which was another film in which Luke Perry played a leading role because he was so stupid, stupid, stupid that nothing could save him. A note for film producers: hire someone who knows something about the topic covered by the film. It would be a small part of the film's budget, but on the whole it would have a great effect in helping the public laugh in order to do nonsense. <br /> <br /> Productive values: almost passable. I've seen a lot worse in my time. <br /> <br /> A new thought for catastrophic films: instead of always having a happy ending in which the world is saved once again, how about some where things are a little bit more realistic, where sometimes even the best efforts end up failing. Especially when the problem that needs to be solved is caused primarily by pure stupidity. Catastrophic films caused by stupidity with glowing and moving endings that justify stupidity in an unjustified way by saying: "No matter how horrible a problem caused by brain stupidity, it can be solved". Which is absolutely not the case. A self-caused catastrophic film with an unhappy ending would serve best as a cautionary tale of "Don't be so damn stupid in the first place". Should you watch this movie? If you're bored and you've seen everything else in the scifi section at your local video rental store, of course, why not. But avoid "Supernova", as I can assure you that you are not so bored. This was definitely not one of Luke Perry's best films. This is better. This is not saying much, but it is better. <br /> <br /> A hoof dead to be an underground genre movie. A hoof dead to snatch maliciously from the script of another film of the same genre.
