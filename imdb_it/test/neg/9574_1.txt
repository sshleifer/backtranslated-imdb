The old bat turns into a young OK-looking girl after drinking a potion. This film was terrible. The atrocious acting. The camera work made my head spin. And presents the longest, most terribly boring strip-tease ever shot. Piero Vivarelli should be ashamed to direct it. Eduardo Manzanos Brochero should have been blacklisted just for writing something so terrible. Don't rent this movie, the only exception I can be is maybe If you're dying and you only have 90 minutes to live, watch this movie and it will seem like an eternity and you will beg for Grip Reaper to arrive a little early. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F
