* Criticism mentions spoilers * <br /> <br /> I rarely comment on users, but this is a film that I have no problem defaming. This film stinks, and its mediocre 6 and a half star rating is probably too high for such a pulp. The Bone Collector is by no means the same caliber as Silence of the Lambs or Seven, despite what its advertising claims. This is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller. The pace of this film was extremely slow - I actually left for about 10 minutes and returned to the exact scene with the exact same character without any progression at all (I am talking about the part where Angelina Jolie's character discusses Denzel on cutting the hands of a corpse). The film is not scary at all, but tries to compensate for this with a subtitle of love, even if the sexy character of Angelina Jolie and Denzel Washington. Obviously, what you get is something comparable to that of the mentor-student relationship, as seen in the brilliant epic Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lecter and Starling, however, this also lacks any effectiveness and I was personally routing for the villain to kill Denzel off so as to avoid the angry laughter between the two. With such a lousy movie, I was almost expecting a twist or some sort of spectacular situation at the end to give the film some credit - things that mediocre films like Arlington Road and Scream brought out. Anyone with a 4th grade education can see the ending as it will be solved (a situation that mimics the back window of Alfred Hitchcock). The cliché of having the killer explain his motivations wasn't inspired enough, but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid that it made me throw up milk on the screen. Esoterically speaking, I even think that the intention of the murderer has been completely lost while Denzel happily recovers from his loss for the proverbial "game of chess" and gets with his pet project, Angelina. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of films with original ideas and genuinely dynamic concepts (as I am), you will not appreciate this film. If you've never witnessed a single film in your life and you'd like to take in every single Hollywood cliché you have ever worn (the late night knock on someone else's window, but the killer, the ridiculous serial killer to trigger the investigative report, the horrible 'woman who tries to get by in a totally male workforce dominated as SOTL), watch this movie .... but even then it's too slow and you'll get bored.
