The fault of this terrible film is the director Martin Campbell. After seeing some of his credits in later years, this must have been one of his first directorial concerts. He had a more than decent cast to work with, but unfortunately he had no idea what he was doing. There were scenes that made absolutely no sense. Where was his head ............... Was he drugged? I couldn't wait to see this movie only for Oldman & Bacon. Maybe it was a short filming program and Campbell had to "slam it". I can't imagine the story directed by Campbell approaching the story the writer wrote. Oldman & Bacon, along with the rest of the cast, must have slipped under the chairs if they went to the screening. As one poster pointed out, Karen Young did a rather good fight scene with Bacon. He really "let go". It is unfortunate that I have to fill more space just to stay within the guidelines of what IMDb requires because I really have nothing else to say about this uninteresting movie. One does not have to be forced to be a "windbag" when criticizing a terrible film and wants the IMDb to change the amount of words to fill a critique.
