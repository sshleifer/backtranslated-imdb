After seeing this show a couple of times; I am deeply offended like a female that there are so many stupid women out there who fall for this shit. I'm a little more mature than some of the "players" on this show, but I'm still shocked that the entire dating game has been reduced to a gameshow: where stupid dudes can score points on their lame donkey try to collect chicks. If young people look at it and use it as a learning manual: Do not !!!. Save yourself the effort and hire a prostitute if all you are looking for is a piece of ass. Maybe there are girls out there with the same mentality, but some like me don't think so.
