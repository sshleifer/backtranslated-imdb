Watching ALIEN EXPRESS inspired feelings of awe, shock, pity and, yes, pure terror. To think that actors who have done a good job in the past should come up with something similar. The horror, the horror. <br /> <br /> Tell me if there's anything familiar. <br /> <br /> A specially constructed train for a political campaign is on its way to Las Vegas for a grand rally for the candidate, a Texas senator (Barry Corbin, the only actor with both ALIEN EXPRESS and NO COUNTRY roles FOR OLD MEN in the same decade). At a railroad crossing in Utah a meteor incinerates a car while waiting for the train to pass. <br /> <br /> The train stops. Local law enforcement agencies are convened. Oh, can it be? The senator has a beautiful girl (Amy Locane of CRY-BABY and MELROSE PLACE) who has just married one of the agents who answered the 911 call. Lou Diamond Phillips (STAND AND DELIVER, LA BAMBA) is the ex- husband. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile the eeeeevil aliens managed to get on the train. <br /> <br /> The train leaves. Lou gets his friend to pilot a helicopter so Lou can get on the moving train (about 70 miles per hour) so he can save the day. As a reward for his companion, he crashes into the helicopter in the mountains. <br /> <br /> Which is another example of how badly ALIEN EXPRESS is written. The companion of the police hero must die, we all know. But he should die near the end of the third act, usually while saving several lives. <br /> <br /> Once on the train, Lou manages to lose his shirt so he can channel Bruce Willis into DIE HARD wearing a shirt to beat his wife. Yes, Lou is 46 but he goes to the gym. The part that is playing is not worth worrying about, but it is in good shape. <br /> <br /> The senator will have an afternoon delight with Miss Utah, but the interceding aliens and both he and the pretty young woman from his granddaughter pay the maximum price. <br /> <br /> Soon we have bomb threats, multiplying the aliens, and of course the train gets out of control and speeds up to its rendezvous with destiny while Lou and Todd Bridges (DIFF'RENT COLPI) tries to save as many more lives possible. <br /> <br /> There is exactly one surprise in the whole film. At the beginning of the story a couple wears wine glasses on its thirty-fifth anniversary, with hopes for another thirty-five years together. The guy gets hit, but he and the lady both live. Perhaps the writers have just lost track of them. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you'd like to be a fly on the wall. These actors who have done a better job (and, indeed, deserve much better than this) are probably just happy for the job. Did they really think they were working on something useful, or were they crying (and drinking) themselves to sleep at night? At the end of the story the survivors (quite numerous, all in all) gather in the last car of the train, which is dropped. The other cars pass a cliff but the one containing the protagonists stops a few centimeters from the cliff. <br /> <br /> Lou and his ex got together. Happiness reigns I would have thought that the first thing they would do was get off the train in order to have solid ground under their feet, but I digress. <br /> <br /> Someone looks out the window and sees a star shot. Look, make a wish. Then another Then more and more. The Earth is bombarded by meteors that crack and creep puppets with big teeth will be everywhere. <br /> <br /> It has come to a point that seeing the words "Presenters of the Sci-Fi channel" on an "original" movie tells us that we will be happy to have Ti-Vo so that we can move forward quickly in the next two hours. Or better yet, just go ahead and delete it two minutes in the story and spend that time more wisely.
