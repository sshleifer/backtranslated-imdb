I gave this film a chance just because it had great reviews. After seeing the trailer I thought: what a little funny movie full of clichés. But I decided to give it a chance because the trailers often don't describe the film very well. What a waste of time ... The film is worse than the trailer and after spending 2 hours watching it, I couldn't remember a single line that made me laugh. The funniest parts of the film were the CSI parodies, but this is also rather passé. I could not relate to any of the characters, nor hope they are together, because I found them absolutely stupid. The plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive. Not intelligent comedy for people who are still in high school or who are feeling mentally.
