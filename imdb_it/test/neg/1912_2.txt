You can always tell if I'm enjoying a movie for the number of times I cross my legs, change position, make a slight noise, etc. Etc. Less is better. I moved so many times in this movie that I managed to overthrow my friends' giant tub of popcorn and get a huge thigh-strengthening workout. <br /> <br /> Sobieski, a young actress who at some points in "A Soldier's Daughter never cries" gave some promise for her theatrical talents, played poorly in a badly written part. Depressed of fact number one. Number two: Chris Klein was there. Depression of fact number three: Chris Klein had lines. Number four: Chris Klein played the role of comedian. Woah. The dummies of rich families unite! Even worse, he actually tries to act, but manages to look like a mentally disabled overactor in an increasingly maudlin independent version of a Cecille B. DeMille film. Go back to humming your American cakes. <br /> <br /> This film was terrible in almost every sense, apart from the delicate interpretation of Josh Hartnett as LeeLee's stiffened boyfriend, Jasper. Fortunately, he refrains from trying to have too many "moments", unlike all the other characters. Of course, this is why he is much better than others and indeed shows some courage. If you like Josh or are thinking of having a child who knows a few things, he is your man. <br /> <br /> Hartnett is a keen actor, but otherwise there is no need for further punishment. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (for poor Hartnett in this terrible film) <br /> <br />
