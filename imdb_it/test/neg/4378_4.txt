Well, the Hero and the Terror are slightly below average, in my opinion. Yes, Chuck is a true martial artist and he kicks off in this movie, but it's pretty slow and acting in my opinion is for most subpar even though I think Steve James has a decent job. Like my friend Ryan, I was confused as to why the psychopath chose to go to the theater at the end of the film rather than go after Norris's girlfriend. Until, the murderer had killed only women. Oh, well, I guess it wasn't as predictable as I thought. Definitely a film that you can broadcast.
