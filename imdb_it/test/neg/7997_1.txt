This is one of those movies that is so ugly that it's awesome !!! It has everything it needs for the early eighties: flared trousers, large mustaches, chicks with Farrah's hair and, above all, NINJAS !!!! I have some moments of choice to retract for you. Cole's army companion has a strange monkey face and always seems to talk without moving his jaw. He gets his ass on every other scene from the thugs who want his land, so he gets drunk all over the movie. At some point his farm workers finally return after being escaped from the gangster's goons and Frank, I think his name is Frank, he is so moved that he shouts to the whole group "Lets Have A Cock Fight !!" and they all move happily in the fighting area of ​​the farm's rooster to begin the festivities. This is fun at every level possible. That you take it dirty or that it literally warms my heart again. Another funny thing is Sho Kosugi's little grunts and ninja-style animated movements. I remember this boy from when I was a child and he said he was the only real ninja in the world (he had advertisements in martial arts magazines) if I remember correctly. My friends and I were a crazy little ninja during the time this movie was released and I can remember seeing it many times in the local theater. I was wondering how I was watching Starz last night, because every dingy American gangster always has a stronghold in the Philippines and wears a white Steve Martin suit. Actually this guy goes far beyond the fact that all his hooligans have to wear white clothes by Steve Martin. There is a scene where it seems that 20 Steve Martin impersonators are attacking a 70s Sears underwear model (Cole). While we end up in the final battle, Cole clumsily breaks into the villain's headquarters and is immediately spotted by a secretary who in turn warns a guard that he shoots from a bullet from his shotgun no more than 30 feet from the bad guys and no one seems notice it or worry about it. Cole, wearing a completely white ninja suit, stealthily proceeds to ascend a ladder, then jumps into the area where all the villains are. The second in charge tells him that he does not need to kill everyone as they were waiting for him, then gives him a ride into the huge Cock Fighting arena. Don't ask me why Cock Fighting is a huge part of this movie, but it is. When they arrive, Cole still wears his ninja mask, although everyone who knows it knows what it looks like without it. The final battle is approaching when Cole has killed everyone and now Sho, as I like to call him, is revealed to have kidnapped Cole's wife, Frank's wife, and they meet in the slimmest cockpit you have ever seen. Sho then, very politely I could add, release the lady and the battle is about to begin. They bow and begin to surround each other, both masked by the way. When they join in battle it seems that Cole becomes someone else intermittently at the "Finishing The Game" a funny parody on the completion of "Game of Death" by Bruce Lee. In the end Cole, Kills Sho, comes out and dies with a beheaded honor and everything is fine. Then we see Cole, after ruining everyone's life, is about to smash the city again but not before foreshadowing the brutal death of a fat man with a hooked hand and then inexplicably winking at the camera, freeze, credits, done .
