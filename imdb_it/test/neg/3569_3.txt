Why spend a moment browsing this awkward and awkward movie? Every now and then, after an hour of boring amateur drama and drama, we begin to get fragments of the big band's swing that made Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, separately and together, the great musicians they were. Occasionally - in a jam session with Art Tatum, with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra doing "Marie" and, an extraordinary star, Jimmy Dorsey and his orchestra in front of Bob Eberle and Helen O'Connell singing "Green Eyes" - we get a complete song. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film is in the public domain and the DVD transfer is just as bad as the acting. My copy has only four chapter breaks. This means that you can get arthritis in your fast-forward finger by trying to accelerate to where the good things are. The swamp you are going through is the Hollywood version of life and the battles of the two Dorse. Tommy, proud on the trombone, and Jimmy, superb on the saxophone, usually couldn't stand each other. In 1935 they finally separated, with Tommy starting his orchestra. Each has had greater success alone than the one achieved together. They reconciled when their father died in the 1940s, which is where the film ends. Later they managed to tolerate each other in the orchestra led by Tommy while the era of the great band was extinguished in the fifties. Tommy died in 1956 at the age of 51, vomiting in his sleep after alcohol, pills and a large meal. Jimmy died of cancer at age 53 in 1957. Jimmy was enormously talented and, by all accounts, a fairly sociable boy. Tommy was enormously talented and, from all points of view, often an overbearing asshole. But good music compensates for many defects, and the Big Band seems to have helped define the era of oscillation. <br /> <br /> In the film they behave alone, and we see them develop from shitty boys (with child actors) to adult men who fight and bite each other. The film is crowded not only by their two parents, played by those Irish Hollywood clich√©s, by Sara Allgood and Arthur Shields, who just want their kids to get along, but also by an important subsection involving a story of love between Janet Blair, as a Dorsey childhood friend who becomes their vocalist and acts as an almost full-time mediator and facilitator, and William Lundigan, as a pianist. Blair is not bad at all. However, if you want to see why she never became the star that she probably should have become, watch movies, like this one, that her studio has let her in. No wonder he left Hollywood. Lundigan simply takes up space. <br /> <br /> How bad is this film, if not when we can actually hear the Dorseys? Well, here's a song written specifically for the film and delivered to Blair. It's called "To Me". <br /> <br /> For me ... you are the rose of a rosary ... the rise of a rising sea ... the glow of a star ... <br /> <br /> rose of a rosary? The film is no better than this and cannot get worse. Anyway, if you like Dorsey and if the price is right ... well, in hindsight I wouldn't buy it again. The highlight for me is Eberle and O'Connell singing "Green Eyes". You can watch them on You Tube for free. You'll also find a good deal of each of the Dorse. I wish I had known.
