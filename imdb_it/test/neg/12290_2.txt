I saw this at the video store and thought I'd give it a try. It seemed like a good story and the cover looked good. It was like this. The characters looked good, and the actor who played "Noel" was the most convincing, even though he hadn't had much time in the film. I find it really hard to give a movie a bad grade, but this is one, in a tiny number, that gets my book. As the film went on, I kept wanting it to improve, but without success. In principle, it was nice. Sound and lighting were good, but the acting in this film killed him for me. It was like watching a low-level soap opera. I kept saying simply "I can't believe they made this move this way". I stopped several times for sheer disbelief that the acting was so bad. There is so much I want to say but I will only say this, everything else, for the most part, was good, it was acting, like a final cut, that really made this film.
