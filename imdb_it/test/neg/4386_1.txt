This film was like a gathering of people who had been in other films and decided to make a really bad film. He had a guy from "Detroit Rock City", a girl from "The Cosby Show", that jerk who kissed the girl and bought that sausage in "Sorority Boys" and there was more. OK, this is not a bad movie in itself, it was just something I noticed. All with the prostitute and the French girl of the same name is stupid and the thing with 37 people who write these notes and if you think they will get confused ..... quite shocking ....... you called it And the bag thing, it was just stupid. It was so bad that I saw the film in two parts and I reached the score of 50 minutes. If you're looking at this and waiting for "Van Wilder" or a movie like that ...... Don't do it.
