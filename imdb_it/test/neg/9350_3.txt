I can't beat this movie too terribly, because it's obvious in mid-sight that they're trying to make it bad, or "campy" if you prefer. In any case, many of the parts they tried to make fun of are, but often simply because of the cheese factor. Watch the game of "Space Invaders", actually played like in real life! Scratch the clumsy robots' head ... oh, weirdness! And look at the whole thing going to the top of the end towards the end with the "temporal distortion"! And the sexual allusions keep flying ... I'm really surprised that this went away with a PC. Oh good. A fun way to waste a couple of hours, but Star Wars / Trek is not like that, folks. 3 out of 10.
