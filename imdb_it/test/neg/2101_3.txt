When renting this, I didn't expect to be swept away. In fact, I knew it would be horrible. He was just seeing how horrible it was. This is what comes with a low budget horror. <br /> <br /> "Snakes On A Train", not to be confused with the snake summer blockbuster "Snakes On A Plane" with Samuel L. Jackson, is about a woman who is put under a Mayan curse that opens snakes inside her and devour her from the inside. His only hope of survival is lies in a shaman who lives across the border, so she and her clandestine companion on a train to Los Angeles. It throws in few passengers and it follows the hilarity. <br /> <br /> Come to think of it, though, the story is not badly bad. It's not even half good. <br /> <br /> The acting in this film is in contrast to that of a science fiction original, if not worse. Trust me, it's horrible. Snakes were another problem. They had to be rattlesnakes, I guess, but most of what you get are mostly harmless garden snakes that don't attack anything and there's this sound effect that gets really annoying. <br /> <br /> The effects of gore on the other hand, although not on the level of Tom Savini, were actually quite good. <br /> <br /> And another thing, the ending alone makes up for the rest of the film. I'm not going to talk about it here, so you'll have to rent it and see for yourself.
