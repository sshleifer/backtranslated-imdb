I spent some time reviewing all the reviews of this movie. I totally agree with almost all reviewers in saying that Noah's Ark is a shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! Do NBC executives have no classes? I feel sick to my stomach from actually seeing both parts of this mini series. The script is so stupid, so useless, and yes, TOTALLY UNSUCCESSFUL! I can understand making some changes for dramatic purposes, but this film has changed almost everything in the story. God Himself is about to face the problem of killing the entire Earth population, but somehow it is missing from someone who is navigating trying to sell stuff to Noah. Give me a break! And what happened to the children of Noah who behaved like Indiana Jones, saving the girls in need? If all this is not bad enough, there is the part where God apologizes to Noah and says "I'm sorry Noah, I was wrong". Newsflash NBC, GOD CANNOT BE WRONG! This film is the most insipid and shameful biblical film ever made.
