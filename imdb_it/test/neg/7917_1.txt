I loved All Dogs to the Heaven so much that I went to see the sequel in the theater, and I can't remember being more disappointed by a movie. The story smelled worse than a sack of aged manure. I mean, come on! How could Carface perhaps imagine he could get revenge on an animal much bigger than him, no matter how angry he was. More depicting Satan as a CAT?!?! How can you get a clich√©? So much for the story. Is it any wonder that Don Bluth, Burt Reynolds, Melba Moore and Vic Tayback do not touch him with a 10-foot pole? The entertainment was absolutely unhappy. The colors were all faded and I can't count how many times I was able to see through objects that needed to be solid. It had to be the worst animation I've ever seen! I usually like animated movies, but not this BOMB!
