Some of the secondary actors try, really hard. And the camera shots in the desert are quite beautiful. Otherwise, this film is horrible. <br /> <br /> The character of William Shatner, Harvey, is an amateur screenwriter. He is also a psychopath, a man who literally escapes from a mental institution. The point of this film is that amateur screenwriters are psychopaths? Harvey will do anything to get his script read and turn it into a movie, even if it means taking a film crew hostage. Amateur screenwriters ... crawl? Maybe they do it. <br /> <br /> The installation of the film is too long. We don't get to the point of the story until the second half. The first half of darts and flit between assorted characters. <br /> <br /> "Shoot Or Be Shot" is advertised as a comedy, but I found it totally unpleasant. The dialogue does not contain subtext. None of the characters is credible as real people. They are all stylized figures that perform "actions" in a way that is reminiscent of cartoon characters. In fact, the film is basically a cartoon for adults: foolish, foolish, deceitful. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some actors are in this movie. They need money or exposure. But what are Shatner and Harry Hamlin doing here? Maybe Shatner wants more roles in comedy. Is this the best you can do? Is Hamlin desperate for money? He was a respected actor. What happened? <br /> <br /> Although the story should be a satire, it comes across as a put-down of amateur screenwriters. Maybe that wasn't the intent. But this is certainly the way the film can be interpreted. As such, the script was written very badly.
