This is one of those "family" movies that I can't imagine having much appeal to anyone over 9. A group of brothers discovers a "sand fairy" (yes, really) situated at the end of a not-so-passage secret in the country house of their eccentric uncle, to which they were evacuated by the London blitz. ... And you have it, all in one sentence. The story is about the role of magic in childhood and the danger that wishes are fulfilled, but none of these problems are examined in a way that would be interesting for adults or instructive for children (or vice-versa!). The only reason I can think of seeing this is to see how the exceptional talent of Freddie Highmore stands out from the rest of the mediocre performances.
