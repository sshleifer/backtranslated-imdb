For reasons that I cannot understand, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) begins to inject wolf blood into his tender handyman, Petro (Glenn Strange). The result ?? Petro turns into a horrible (as horrible as someone with a bad wig and pointed teeth can be) killer beast. Dr. Cameron uses Petro to take revenge on those in the scientific community who mocked and ridiculed his ideas (and because they didn't, Dr. Cameron is crazier than a fruit cake). <br /> <br /> Overall, The Mad Monster is a boring and poorly made Poverty Row thriller. There is really only one positive that I can invent to write about The Mad Monster. George Zucco can be fun to watch while the mad scientist plays more or less like anyone else. His Dr. Cameron is a regular madman. He has no qualms about killing; has whole conversations with people who are not there; and, as with most mad scientists, mess up "the dominion of God" (actually, I'm not sure anyone accuses him of this, but it's right). But beyond the Zucco, there is nothing to recommend here. Everything else, from the effects of the monsters to the supporting music cast, is simply bad. There are much better examples of horror than Poverty Row from the 1940s compared to The Mad Monster.
