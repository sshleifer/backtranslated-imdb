I suppose Hollywood was not exactly at the point of openly celebrating homosexuality in 1997, so you might want to give some credit to those who put this film together for showing some courage. You simply wish you could give them credit for putting together a really cool movie, and in my opinion "In & Out" doesn't qualify for it. It is the story of Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) - an English teacher from a small school in the city who came out from a former student who happens to win an Oscar and then has to go through what can be described only as a period of self-discovery when it comes to terms with being homosexual. For me, this was the first problem with this film. Howard didn't have to be gay. The film would have been more fun (and perhaps even more stimulating) if Brackett had remained defiantly despite the stereotypical aspects of his life and the city's belief after the Oscar speech of being gay. (In fact, I thought that identifying him as gay, given the presence of those stereotypes, would actually have been rather offensive to the gay community, as well as to heterosexual men who love poetry and believe in neatly dressing!) <br /> < br /> Kline was quite decent in the role, and largely brought the film. Apart from him, most of the other cast members (though good actors) were people who weren't really famous for their big screen success. People like Tom Selleck and Wilford Brimley and Bob Newhart are good actors but not great movie stars. Actually I thought that the most amusing (though very small) role in the film was that of the super model Sonya, played by an actress named Shalom Harlow (Speaking of stereotypes, I loved her stereotypical model line "I promised to this afternoon, I have to take a shower and throw up! ") In the end, what really upset me about this film was the ridiculous ending, starting with the graduation ceremony (and, to tell the truth, even if someone decided that the degree was really necessary, the film should have ended there, rather than continuing with the wedding absolutely useless in the end.) <br /> <br /> Basically, I had a couple of laughs from this, but nothing more. 3/10
