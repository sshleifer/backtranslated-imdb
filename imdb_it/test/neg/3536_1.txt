SPOILER !!!! Mind Ripper hmmmm .... I had just seen the nightmare on elm street film and I had just discovered Giovanni Ribisi. I thought Giovanni Ribisi hadn't done any horror, so I checked in. I saw "the outpost" (mind ripper) I checked my Tivo for this. There was a flight appointment on Sci Fi. So I was ready. I prepared my popcorn ready and on the couch and what the hell is it? A bizarre guy in blue plush pants who screams around! Nothing scares this movie! If anything, it's fun! Funny how low your budget is, how funny it is to be expected, how funny how bad acting is and how much money DIDNT makes. Ok giovanni ribisi is a good actor but this film is stupid. He's so stupid. They killed him in the end and then got on this plane and the "monster" is on it. They shoot him in the head with a rifle and fall off at a great distance. And <br /> <br /> -GASP- The killer ending is still alive! WOOHHH! Frightening! woooohhhh! 2 hour fat rubbish stone. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: you have a place to go and you have to kill some time. The mental ripper is not the suggestion. I'd rather be sitting naked in the snow than watching this movie a second time. <br /> <br /> CLASSIFICATION: F- - - - - - - - - - (ENTERNAL)
