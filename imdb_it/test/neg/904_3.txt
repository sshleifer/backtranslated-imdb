A 10-year-old boy fed up with his arguing parents decides to warm up a car and take a surreal journey across America to find the Motorama cards, which is a card game at the gas station, which he can find to spell "Motorama" he has a chance to win $ 500 million. Meet many bizarre characters along the way. No one is able to create an "instant cult classic", the previous "After Hours" by Joe Minion got this result for pure merit and an extraordinary director, but it was not instantaneous. This film, on the other hand, is simply bizarre just to be bizarre. No rhyme or reason for any of them. The plot is at most random and seems to exist only to show various cameos. It's not just a funny or thoughtful movie. He's too slapped. I've heard many comparisons between this and David Lynch's films. It's damn close to heresy, because even the worst Lynch movie (the worst in quotes, since it doesn't really have a bad movie) is still far from this madness. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Cynthia King is very short topless <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: "Joe Dirt" trailer
