I've seen some terrible book-to-film adaptations in my time, but this one surpasses them all! The bizarre and unattractive cast takes away the plot, which in itself is not true to the book. Mr. Tilney is nothing nice; as for Catherine Morland, a mouse-like appearance makes this heroine difficult to sell to a sympathetic audience. Isabella does not resemble the Aphrodite mentioned in the original text, and James Morland appears in the film too little to leave the viewer with an understanding of his important role in history. Furthermore, as others have pointed out earlier, this novel was intended to satirize the Gothic mania prevalent in Austen's time, but it seems that this "soft horror" film was designed and thought to be taken seriously. I'm sure Jane Austen turns to her grave whenever one of her fans is disappointed by this terrible interpretation of what should be a joke.
