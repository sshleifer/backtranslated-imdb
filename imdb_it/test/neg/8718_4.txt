While David Lynch's version of Dune is unstable, uncomfortable and unfaithful to the novel, it is visually well designed and well acted. The best that can be said about the Sci Fi channel's attempt to make Dune a miniseries is that it is ambitious. In reality, this is practically the only positive praise that can be offered. The actors (with few exceptions) seem happy to recite their lines with the least possible emotion and the least appropriate accents. The costumes seem to have been designed by someone with a large surplus of Mylar fabric at their fingertips and an unhealthy love for an unflattering headgear. <br /> <br /> In part, this miniseries suffers from living in the shadow of the already known Lynch effort. However, he takes elements from Lynch's film that were not present in the novel and copies them almost wholesale (ie Guild Steersman's navigation sequence), and this only encourages encouraging negative confrontation with Lynch's film. A for effort. D for practically everything else.
