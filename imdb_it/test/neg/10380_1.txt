While this film had some moments of fear (great use of music and the corners of the film to create suspense), it is obvious that director Ethan Wiley and screenwriter Ellary Eddy wasted no time searching for their subjects; which also makes me doubt that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a true Catholic bishop. <br /> <br /> Among the many inconsistencies: <br /> <br /> * Jacob the Catholic priest, when we are the first to meet him outside the church, wears an academic robe on his clerics rather than on the typical alb, chasuble or cooked. The academic garments are commonly worn by Protestant ministers in liturgical denominations, not Catholic priests. <br /> <br /> * The priest of Jacob cites some dark and disturbing writings concerning the angels who collect weapons. It is attributed to St. Paul. This verse is not taken from the writings of St. Paul, nor is it in the Bible. I can't even find it in the Gnostic Scriptures. <br /> <br /> * Jacob tells his bishop that he does not believe in demonic possession and refuses the request to study exorcism, but makes a total of 180 (later that same day?) within minutes of talking to Isabelle. Of course, it is possible; but a little unrealistic. See Father Damien as a priest / psychologist in the original THE EXORCIST for a slightly more realistic portrait of a skeptic who has become faithful. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, the former priest turned farmer, is the first to experience an exorcism on Isabelle. Quote the scriptures and she quotes back. He says "I see that you know Psalm 65" - he corrects it "that is Psalm 67" - they are both wrong. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, the former priest who has just finished performing an exorcism - making the sign of the cross, invoking the name of Christ, applying holy water, etc. - he tells Jacob that he does not believe in church and does not believe in God. (Perhaps he is only in conflict?) Jacob recruits him to wear homemade vestments and make another in any case. <br /> <br /> * Miguel, the former CATHOLIC ROMAN priest, crosses backwards (or in Eastern Orthodox style). As a Latin American Catholic who used to be a priest, he would have to cross his forehead on his breastbone, from the left side to the right side of his chest. <br /> <br /> I had to read the small side stories to get the notion that Satan was combining with the whole family, not just Isabelle; but even in the end it was difficult to say with certainty if someone was really guilty of the images in their heads or if it was all a demonic trick (except for the sheriff - it is clear that he was guilty). <br /> <br /> On the positive side: Isabelle was CREEPY - in my opinion it was the best part of the whole movie and I liked the twist with Claire. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the movie was meant to be serious or a parody. <br /> <br /> Listening to the ongoing comment with Cameron Daddo and Ethan Wiley, I am inclined to believe it was a joke.
