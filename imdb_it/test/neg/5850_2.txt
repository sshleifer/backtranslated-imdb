If you are a slap-stick fan who has terrible writing, horrible acting and clich√© after click this is for you. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to list for the reasons this movie sucks. In a brief synopsis, people with a combined IQ of 100 trips to New Mexico in a race for 200 million dollars. And yes, they're all seemingly superheroes, as they can do many things, like jumping on trains that travel 80+ mph, surviving numerous car accidents, and countless examples of cartoon roulette and coyotes. <br /> <br /> If you are a teenager, or you don't want to think about a movie, this is for you .. It's not an actor at all outside Lovitz. Lovitz saves the 1 movie with Hitler's bit. <Br /> <br /> 2/10 (save 2 hours of pain and $ 4)
