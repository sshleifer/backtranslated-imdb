There I sit at home in the morning, suddenly my brother turns on what appears to be the stupidest film I've ever seen. Considering that it was the 70s and the special effects were not those of "sharpe", this film almost equaled the definition of shit. The stupid monsters, the stupid plot and the stupid setting made this the worst movie I've ever seen. So bad, in fact, I didn't even finish it, I did it up to a certain point, then I kept seeing how long I could continue without putting a rope around my neck and hanging myself. (I'm kidding haha) THE FANTASTIC FILM
