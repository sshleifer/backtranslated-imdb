Accoliti presents an interesting mix of original concepts in the horror cliche of "screaming teen" with a rhythm more like a thriller. In some ways, the Acolytes are very successful, but in many other ways the film fails miserably. <br /> <br /> The General Acolytes have avoided the typical archetypes of the naivety and innocence of the youth of infinite horror films like Cabin Fever, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and countless other films in which unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teenagers , they have sex, they go around screaming and one by one they are torn from a sort of monster. Instead this innocence is replaced by pride, retaliation and arrogance. The characters had several opportunities to save themselves from immanent death and despair, but they failed to do so because of their personal demons. In the end you were left with the feeling that there were not (and perhaps are not) innocent victims. <br /> <br /> As the name suggests, the film also touches heavily on a leader or authority. This was used in a direct sense of whether the main character would become like the serial killer and was also used less directly during the film. Following a central figure is a recurring theme throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Through all this, the directors have also incorporated many clich√©s, which I suspect was intentional and gave the film a unique mix of depth and superficiality that I found intriguing. This, perhaps inadvertently, plays well with the characters that are, at first sight very superficial, but as the plot develops it becomes obvious that they are, at least the two main male characters, rather complex. <br /> <br /> Technically the film still has a lot of problems. Cinematography, which is generally considered highly, I find rather somewhat sophisticated and over-stylized, using too rigid 2/3 formal approaches. Many transitions that I heard were also too stylized. The use of symbolism was not only vague, but also widely used. <br /> <br /> The plot was poorly planned and was based solely on misinformation to get a twisted ending, which was poorly resolved and leaves viewers confused. The methods used to resolve the climax are inexpensive and poorly prepared, the motivations are unclear routines and eventually the main points of the plot remain loose. <br /> <br /> Overall, the originality, the themes and the thesis related to the film are lost in a maze of poor technical execution, too stylized images, unclear motifs, obtuse and unnecessary symbolism and twists economic maintained only by a lack of information or completely incorrect. <br /> <br /> If the film were performed better, it would have been excellent. However, the Acolytes receive only two stars in my opinion.
