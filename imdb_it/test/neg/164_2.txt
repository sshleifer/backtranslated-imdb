This film is so boring that I spent half of it on IMDb while it was open on another tab on Netflix, trying to find out if anyone thought it was one of the most boring, ponderous, and deceptive movies they had ever seen. A word of warning: I really couldn't finish it, so these are my impressions until the minute 54. <br /> <br /> Keira Knightly gets a lot of time on the screen. As others have already mentioned, his mother wrote the script (perhaps during a sort of astonishment-induced stupor in which absurdity and statements without emotions about emotions seemed interesting dialogues) and it seems that the film is a showcase for Knightly. Oops! Although I agree that he is adorable (with his unexposed teeth ... his bared teeth cause me anxiety and fear) I found his forced and ill-programmed reactions. As in, William or Dylan do something nice ... pause ... HAHAHA from K with dimples and a playful arm shot. Like a minute too late. What? And she can't match the intensity of Cillian Murphy. Somehow he can really look at her and it seems like he's fascinated by her and in love with her while she seems totally disconnected, almost as if she were interacting with a mirror. It must be torture, acting in front of someone who is not offering the same level of energy as you. Do you know what else torture is? This film. <br /> <br /> Knightly looks great during his cyclical "I have 1940s curls and a sexy outfit, blows, but what's the point? Are you an altar or an actress? When talk is bizarre, "Ooow, Mehster Deelan. Where are you going? "This makes me confused because the accent is so confusing and inauthentic, yet so often sometimes I have no idea what you're saying (or maybe you fall asleep.) If no one knows who Vera is or cares, or few do it, was it so important to give her this alleged Welsh accent? It distracts the rest of the action (I'm kidding there). <br /> <br /> This movie looks like someone has dreamed a movie, maybe after reading a little "Dylan Thomas before going to bed. But instead of adapting to the waking world it was like" Man, that dream was so interesting "and he tried to replicate it. Then someone else warned:" Your script needs work , nothing of what happens promotes a story or creates necessity "and the writer is all" But that's how I dreamed it! "It's like the rambling fantasy of a child, one of those wild and sinuous yarns that rotate to attract the Your attention And then William went to war and then Vera had a child and then a little blonde drank too much and there were so many airplanes and pin curls and all had ruby ​​red lips and ... <br /> <br /> the character of Dylan Thomas (so insignificant is all this what can I call it), why doesn't it have any jokes in this biopic goofy? All he does is drink beer and smoke cigarettes and roll with Sienna Miller, who is so wild and artistic that he will make a wheel in public! Get out of here, crazy poets! (I realize that she is not a poet, but she and Thomas are like this sickening unit of crazy boys who have crazy times, like a lukewarm Sailor and Lula of Wild at Heart.) Someone asks on the message board if they should buy this movie. I say foul. Leave it on your shelf and use it only as a weapon to narcotize children, the elderly or the guests of the house. <br /> <br /> P.S. to the character of Murphy ... when someone asks you if you were "in the sh **" you can say yes, because your war scenes seem to have been shot in a landfill.
