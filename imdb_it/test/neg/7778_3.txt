As usual, another masterpiece from the Vice Academy series (HaHaHa). I don't know why they took the trouble to make this garbage. Just another series of policemen who act like sluts. A decisive part was when the character of Ginger Lynn Allen (Holly Wells) and the character of Elizabeth Kaitan (Candy) tried to seduce the scientist by wearing only the bra and underwear under their shirts. Just a wonderful scene (Ha). A character that I didn't like was the commissioner. He was very annoying and ignorant. They should have arrested him. Mrs. Devonshire was also rather annoying. They should have stopped this series after this movie.
