Steve Martin has always had my respect for being a very nice comedian and a pretty good actor, and I loved "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" and "Bowfinger" --- but "Bringing the House" is definitely not one of Martin's works more fun, and it doesn't even seem like it's trying to be, which is simply sad ... <br /> <br /> I don't know; maybe I didn't like this movie because I rented it together with "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" and "Phone Booth", both excellent films, or maybe because I got much better used to Martin, or maybe it's just because I'm in a bad mood today ... Anyway, this movie wasn't very funny or fun, and I never handled more than a smile or a faint giggle at the movie gag, which is really a shame, since the previews of this comedy were so promising! I expected "Bringing the House" to be a real bash comedy, and I certainly expected a slapstick comedy and inter-racist laughter from Martin. Instead, we're "treated" to see Queen Latifah moving across the screen, trying to do her best with her totally uninspired character. The funniest thing about this clunker is Eugene Levy, but he also doesn't get the screen-time he deserves. <br /> <br /> I would have really enjoyed "Bringing the House", but I didn't and I would find it very difficult to recommend it to anyone, except for the toughest Steve Martin fans. Skip this and rent "Planes, trains and cars" instead ... <br /> <br /> You'll have a much better time.
