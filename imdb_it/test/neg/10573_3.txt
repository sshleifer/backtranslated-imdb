I thought it would be fun. I did it. I do not know what happened. But I think that much of the problem unfortunately falls with the casting. I don't know who this guy is, he could be a very nice person, but he wasn't right for this movie. And the supporting cast was great, which just makes it more obvious. For example, there would be a scene with him and his love interest and your mind starts to wander, but then Keith David starts talking, or Leslie Nielsen, or Marion Ross, and it's like someone turns on a light and suddenly you can pay attention again and you think it might not be so bad. But when they return to the main characters the lights go out again. <br /> <br /> The spoofing material available in the superhero genre is plentiful, so the fact that most jokes were basically a fart, makes you wonder who wrote this thing. I mean he had a couple of funny bits, as I remember laughing a few times, but right now I don't remember why and it was only a few days ago. <br /> <br /> I'm really giving it a take or leaving it to vote but I think most people should just leave it.
