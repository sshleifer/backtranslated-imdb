I do not know where to begin. Perhaps the whole idea of ​​this film was just a disaster that was about to happen. There is nothing humorous about a kidnapping. I don't know what was more offensive - the topic or "performance" of David Arquette. It was like watching a bull get his penis cut, even though I think the bull felt better later. The directors should find something about Sinatra in addition to kidnapping his son to show (as, I don't know, his TALENT AS A SINGER !!!!). His family should not relive that horror. Thank God it was just shown on HBO and it hasn't been released in theaters. Please don't look at this if you respect yourself.
