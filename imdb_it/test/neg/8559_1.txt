I spent the last 5 years in the entertainment industry and recently I find myself working for the company that made this film, which is a real shame, because I like these people, I can't believe that nobody could do something like that ugly like this? !!!! This was crap from every possible angle. From working with the camera to dialogue, acting, costumes and production design, it was one of the worst films I've ever seen! The actors in this film seemed to have been taken directly from porn that was shot in the San Fernando Valley and put on a set with an even less talented crew. <br /> <br /> I can't really overcome the fact that I'm sitting on some of the best materials I've ever read and contacts within the industry that could help me turn my dream into reality and hit all the posts in possible block? Yet the people behind this movie show have no problem putting it together and, in fact, sleeping well after it has been released. <br /> <br /> Life, what a journey!
