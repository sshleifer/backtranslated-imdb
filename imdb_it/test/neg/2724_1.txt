I am the only one to note that the "realism" of the 19th century ship is wrong. It is actually a fifteenth century, around 1620 if I need the memory, because the "realistic" ship in the film is the Mayflower, now as far as I know the Mayflower has NEVER gone to Australia or has not even tried a trip to Australia . I don't know who managed the research and development for this film, but using the Mayflower and hoping no one notices it is a really poor job. They also printed it on the cover and on the DVD. I wonder how can other people notice this little mistake? Not to mention the fact that the film itself was simply horrible, I would have expected better from Sam Neill.
