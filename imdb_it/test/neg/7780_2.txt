The problem with this film is that it's not funny, it's not scary, it's not dramatic, it's not intriguing, it's not stimulating, it's not, it's not exciting, it's not even the least interesting. I recently saw this film on tape and I'm glad I didn't spend money to rent it. It is basically a poor attempt to make films. I won't even bother to tell you the story. History? What a story?
