OK, so this movie is well acted. It has a good direction, but the fact is that it undermines what all gay and lesbian people have fought for all these years. The straight man "decides to be gay" and the homosexual "Deciding to be straight" I liked until the last 20 minutes, after which I was really offended. As is usually the case in these films, heterosexual actors play the main parts and gay actors play secondary roles outside. The protagonists are played by handsome men, but don't let yourself be distracted by the fact that this is a film that leaves you unsatisfied. All the romance and relationships that you hope it happens do not. Unless you are a priest, in which case God bless the heterosexual woman who cares for our homosexuality.
