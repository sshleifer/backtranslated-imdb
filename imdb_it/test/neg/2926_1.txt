I just went to the cinema in the center of Prague to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Not because of the poster I found the old-fashioned heroic style of Holywood <br /> <br />. Not because of the high level cast that reminds me that most <br /> <br /> of those high films starring French are usually pathetic. But just <br /> <br /> because there are not so many films in my native French language in a city like Prague. And because I adore Adjani, Depardieu and Rappenau from <br /> <br /> Cyrano. Then I decided to write this little comment because I think I don't really agree with the comment on the main stream of this movie on imdb. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed. The film resembles the poster. The characters of <br /> <br /> are just as stupid as they seem. For a while I thought that Adjani would be like a caricature - only a funny character <br /> <br /> you can laugh at. No she is not! For example, when he decides to tell Depardieu that she killed the fat he killed at the beginning of the film, then the violins became a great pathetic fat <br /> <br /> music that should make you cry and make yourself I realize that the character of Adajani is a deeper person as it seems. Perhaps this was humor at the tenth level <br /> <br /> but I am sorry that my sense of humor is not so high! If I want to <br /> <br /> see some fun French films about World War II, I look again at La Grande <br /> <br /> Vadrouille! It's definitely more fun! I also read on imdb <br /> <br /> that Lemoine is doing a great performance in this movie. I must say that I've never seen him act so badly! (Well, I've never seen any movie from Ed <br /> <br /> Wood). Nevertheless, the film is beautifully filmed with many scenes <br /> (very expensive) like the one with the Pantheon in the morning <br /> <br /> when the German army arrives in Paris or when the refugees arrange <br /> <br /> on a bridge in Bordeaux. I think Rappeneau is a good filmmaker but <br /> <br /> who does better with a good script. It was easy with Cyrano. He <br /> <br /> didn't have to write the dialogues! <br /> <br /> I give 1/10.
