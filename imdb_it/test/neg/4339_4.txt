An intelligent story / general position for a story. The action is respectable. Children are annoying and their motivation is not clear. The main villain was a nice change but could have been better. "I Love You" was more exaggerated than "You completed me" but at least Van Damme had the chance to show some tenderness. One of Van Damme's best films.
