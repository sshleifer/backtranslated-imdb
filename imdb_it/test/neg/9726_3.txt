If I had to present this cinematic idea to some Hollywood big boys, I'm sure it would sound like this: <br /> <br /> ME: "Four boys in a private school are good friends, AND they're witches." <br /> < br /> Hollywood: "It seems" The Craft ". <br /> <br /> ME:" No, no, I said four guys, not four girls. "<br /> <br /> Hollywood:" Play again like "The Craft", only with boys instead of girls. "<br /> <br /> ME:" OK, but there is this fifth unknown boy who enters the picture and he wants more power. "<br /> <br /> Hollywood:" Still little difference, because even one of the girls from "The Craft" wanted more power. <br /> <br /> ME: "OK, OK ... I'll make these guys part of the" crowd ", they'll be rich, And the school is on the east coast. <br /> <br /> Hollywood:" Now looks original. This is nothing like "The Craft", here is a billion dollars. "<br /> <br /> This film was so trivial and uninteresting. Even the drama produced by Chase and the Ipswich brothers was very blas√©. The children, with their biggest problem, are the color that Bentley wants for their eighteenth birthday (and the 18th machine), they don't interest me at all, even though they have powers. Every single guy in this film seemed to come out of a magazine and of course there had to be free male nudity and 80% female nudity just to go home as you are out of shape I wanted to rename this movie "The Witches of OC". Oooh, the rich kids and their problems ... let me pretend nothing happened. <br /> <br /> This movie was completely Unimaginative and predictable. The final clash was lame and dragged out and the ending was very anti-climatic. This was a film best left on the floor cutting room.
