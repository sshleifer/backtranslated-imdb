The moral of this show is that bad eating habits give people bad hair, bad taste in clothes, bad posture, bad jobs, and so on. They are obviously unhappy and hate themselves. However, if they learn to eat broccoli, they will be rich, successful and attractive. <br /> <br /> TLC should be ashamed of itself for this blatant exploitation of parents' fears and guilt. If nutrition is really that important, they should be able to develop a show using honest and truthful methods. If they really believed in their computer simulations, I'd like to see them take a double-blind test finding 40-year-olds, finding out about their eating and exercise habits as children, and the advancing age of children "photographs. So compare the real things. Hey, it looks like a project for Mythbusters! Discovery Channel - are you listening? <br /> <br /> TLC has to support Tabloid Lies and Cons.
