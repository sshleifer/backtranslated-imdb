I see this film as a poor tribute to old slasher movies. Because in reality it does not stand comparison with the 70s and 80s of horror, this is obviously the personal taste. <br /> <br /> This film falls into the "New generation of woodcutters" category in my book, the cast is typical of 18-24 year olds and potential models. Personally I'm pretty tired of that image in horror movies, old movies had at least some variation in people. One or more fat people and in general the butts. Only simple-looking people, obviously having a couple of good spectators is fine, they have always been there. But when the whole cast is just a bunch of nice racks and butts it's getting silly. I mean, OK, yes, I like to watch HOT chicks. But not in a horror that should reflect some ordinary people being hunted by a maniac handling knife ... You expect people to be hunted to look like a random person you see on the street. I think. Obviously there are some films with good viewers that are perfectly fine, but they are not many. "Wrong turn" is an example of the best ones. <br /> <br /> The next point is the killing scenes that the coupons should be made of. In this poor film, all you see are 2-3 frames of sudden sharp sound / scream and crescendo music. And this is all. The little you can see is not at all graphic, not for people who have seen some horrors over the years. Compared to this, the old school cutters had much more and better death, blood and blood. Not to mention the killers of those films, which have surpassed what you'll see here. <br /> <br /> As for the real horror fans it's more fun and exciting to watch the horrors with new approaches because of the originality that opens up, the killer in this doesn't add anything new and fresh to the genre at my opinion. I have to say that I agree with what someone said earlier, CGI is something I hate to look at. Personally I prefer the tricks in this sense I am conservative, (unless the CGI is really well done). But the most important thing is to set a good atmosphere that allows you to "get into the movie", a good background story is a very good thing. Even revealing and explaining too much of everything in a movie to viewers takes away any sense of mysticism that adds much of the mood and doesn't give you much to think about. Just to give an example: keeping the killers' background a complete mystery to the viewer is a good move in many cases. I mean if everything about the story or the people in it has to be explained or shown in detail, so it's not much content left to the viewer to think about ... It's like watching a porn movie and hoping for a big story in the meantime . <br /> <br /> Because old school coupons still work, at least for some people. It is because they are established cult films of the era in which they were a novelty, making new ones today is certainly difficult. The exception could be for people who are more recent to that kind of horrors, of course. I've noticed that many people like this kind of horror movie, so obviously there is no "Good taste" for horror movies. <br /> <br /> But for the people out there who could share my opinion; here you have a frame of reference on what to expect from this film.
