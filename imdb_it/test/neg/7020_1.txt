This film was so horrible, so boring, so evil - it took a lot of work to make that thing that should have been a sure thing in such a parody. I love Lucille Ball, but it's absolutely stinky in this movie. Too old, he couldn't sing, he looked like a truck unloading gravel even when he wasn't singing - and the biggest pity of all - IT WAS NOT FUN. ALSO A PO. The studio shot itself in the foot with this, and for ruining what should have been a fabulous film version of a fabulous stage musical, some other parts of the body deserve to be hurt - or maybe they were already without those parts. This could explain it. But Lucy thought she was right for a part that required CANTARE - well, that's the saddest thing of all. It's good to know your limits. Even a legend cannot get out of a skunk like this and still smells like a rose.
