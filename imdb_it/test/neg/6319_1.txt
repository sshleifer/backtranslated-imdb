A renowned New York lawyer (George Segal) is slowly going crazy. He promised his father on his deathbed that he would NEVER send their senile mother (Ruth Gordon) to a nursing home. Years later he takes care of a senile and dangerous psychopath. Meet a beautiful nurse (Trish Van Devere) and fall in love. But her mother continues to frighten her. Segal is ready to kill her .... <br /> <br /> Ummmm ... IS this a comedy? I have nothing against sick humor, but come on ... there are limits! This film goes out of its way to launch every sick and insipid joke it can think of and rub its face. Too bad none of the jokes is fun. The jokes concern rape, nudity, public humiliation, senile elders, blasphemies and racism. Basically this is a film that thinks it's smart trying to shock people and thinking that it will come from it. I was disgusted and didn't laugh once. The film is morbid, disturbing and (surprisingly) boring. The cast is the only thing that has been keeping an eye on me. Segal and Gordon were both wonderful in their roles, especially Gordon. And Van Devere is pretty good too. But the script is against them. The only interesting thing (not funny) was an unnecessary court scene with Rob Reiner Jr. (and trying to locate his then wife Penny Marshall as a spectator). <br /> <br /> Actually this film could have been worse - the original end had Segal going to bed with his mother and pretending to be stern! This was (thankfully) changed. <br /> <br /> A really bad, sick movie. The bottom of the cane I give him a 1.
