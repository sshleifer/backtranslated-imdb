There is only one reason why this movie is watchable. Till Schweiger. He is such a good actor that the film is not entirely terrible. Uwe Boll, please resume another career. Special effects and action are acceptable. All other aspects were very disappointing. All I can say is that Kevin Smith (An evening with ...) talked about Tim Burton who never read the Batman comics and showed. Uwe Boll must never have played video games on which he continues to make films. If you two want to know how it's done, go see Andrzej Bartkowiak. Doom was one of the best video games to film the adaptations of all time. Some people might disagree, but if you watch the movie you can see that the ID guys had a lot to do with Doom. It does not seem that someone from UBIsoft has been close to this production.
