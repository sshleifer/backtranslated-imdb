It is difficult to evaluate the first effort of a writer / director. After all, it's a film more than what I've written or directed. James Hunter wrote a story that was interesting but suffered from an irregular flow. <br /> <br /> After all, the idea that a man (Ja Rule) should choose between the life of the delinquent and going straight is common, and also the falling in love of the daughter (Tatyana Ali) of the man you have he was killed. Doing something new requires something original and this film lacks originality. <br /> <br /> I was attracted by the inclusion of so many favorites: Tia Carrere (Trues Lies, Wayne's World), Pam Grier (Jackie Brown), Frank Langella (Dracula, Good Night and Good Luck) and Ving Rhames ( Rosewood, Dawn of the Dead). They did not disappoint their performances, but they had little to work with. <br /> <br /> Direct to video is becoming more and more common, but that doesn't mean it should be a waste of time. Perhaps Hunter's second year's effort will be more enjoyable.
