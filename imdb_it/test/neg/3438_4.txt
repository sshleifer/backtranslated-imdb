!!!! MILD SPOILER !!!! <br /> <br /> With the exception of THE TERMINATOR and TOTAL RECALL, I don't think Arnie's action / adventure films are up to much. They are certainly better than his comedies, but this doesn't say much. The problem I have with his all-action blockbusters is that they are exaggerated and lacking in any sort of morality <br /> <br /> morality? I mentioned in my review of TERMINATOR 2 the scene where the good Terminator blows the SWAT team's knees. We must think that since the hero causes people to do their work instead of killing them, we will admire it somehow? This is the problem with ERASER, when the character of James Cann is revealed as a traitor in the department of the American marshal. The character of Arnie John Kruger goes on the run with a witness who is protecting but in several successive sequences Kruger kills a large enough character of marshals working with the villain. We take it, were they all traitors too? Surely many of them were honest men who were trying to stop Kruger because the villain had told them that Kruger was the traitor? It is a bit uncomfortable to think that Kruger killed several people who were really trying to defend the law <br /> <br /> Although they cost a hundred million dollars, the special effects are not that impressive. Watch the scene where Kruger lets go of the jet wing and climbs up to wear a parachute. It is obvious how the intercultural action that is a stuntman doing the free-fall sequence while Arnie is in a studio in front of a blue screen. ERASER is also a film that has unnecessary CGI with murderous alligators, not only unnecessary CGI but also unconvincing CGI. There are also some holes in the plot as in the opening scene involving a couple of people with witness protection that the crowd has captured. Kruger opens the trunk of the car, takes out a couple of bodies and fires, thus launching the crowd of perfume. Kruger is then seen reorganizing the dental records by computer of the couple he saved. Would it be logical to do so, but should all the couples' dental documents be stored on the computer? The most important thing is that we believe that the US Marshal Department has a freezer full of bodies for these events? <br /> <br /> So let's go, a typical Arnie thriller for a long time on unlikely pieces and short on intelligence and it is interesting to note that ERASER did not produce much profit at the box office as production costs almost exceeded the potential of audience. After ERASER Arnie did not make much more business at the box office except for TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES which was an event film and it will be interesting to see if he will be remembered as a politician rather than a movie star
