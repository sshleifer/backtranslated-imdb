This is by far the worst ever "horror" movie, no, it makes any film I've ever seen. Shame on Block Buster for even bringing this kind of shit. I never ask for a refund for any film, but I think it will be the first. <br /> <br /> The film is so bad that I had to stop after only 15 minutes of viewing. <br /> <br /> I had a lot of fun watching one of the blurred YouTube movies compared to watching this piece fall. <br /> <br /> The marketing guy for this film must have some kind of Argentine language to move this thing to a factory like Blockbuster.
