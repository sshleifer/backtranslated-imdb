Like many, this manure caught my eye as I was surfing the canal. It's a horror film, set in the woods, it has a stupid title, but hey "Michael Rooker" is in it, and it's been part of some great horror movies, I know it wouldn't have gone wrong ... Ugh! The most offensive part of this is that I really looked at it. I see that director Johnny Martin is a stuntman, but this stunt simply sucks, and as he did take some of the actors to make this bowel movement of water is the greatest mystery of all ... I understand Casper Van Dien, but shame for you, Mr. Rooker. Your good name in the horror community has been tarnished forever and your agent should be fired immediately. I'm sure this fecal matter nugget is available on DVD, but if you like the 100 cent menu at McDonalds, you'll get more for your money there.
