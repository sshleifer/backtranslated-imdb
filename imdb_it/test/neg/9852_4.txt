The television program was slow and the "unusual" characters were sometimes irritating. Only through the miracle of fasting I managed to overcome the first 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The write-up indicates that it is a sort of comedy / mystery, but I haven't seen much of either. <br /> <br /> If it really starts after the first 2 hours, please let me know, because I doubt I will watch the rest without a recommendation. <br /> <br /> This review should be without spoilers so I will continue in a vague way, not spoilers, fashion. I found the two main characters uninteresting and unpleasant. I found myself asking "Could a normal adult do it?" The man with the hedge trimmer looking out the window was irritating and when the male protagonist interacted with him, he seemed pathetic. Would a normal adult bear someone as irritating as he is?
