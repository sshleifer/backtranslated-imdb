WEBS is a rather strange film, even if slightly watchable. Richard Grieco plays an electrician who is sucked into a parallel Earth invaded by mutant spiders, or something like that. The film itself was made on a modest budget, which explains the limited premises, and the somewhat tedious script that manages to do little with enough interesting premises. In practice a 90-minute episode of the TV program "Sliders" and nothing more. <br /> <br /> 4 on 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review and reviews of other such films)
