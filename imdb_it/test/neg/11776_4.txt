Given the subject of drug addiction, Down to the Bone can hardly be a rather depressing film. But depressing it doesn't necessarily mean bad. Unfortunately in this case it is actually quite ugly. The film has some positive things, in particular the quality performance of Vera Farmiga in the central role of Irene, a mother who is dealing with a cocaine addiction. But here there is not enough to overcome evil. The flaws of the film are found mainly in the story, which fails to fascinate and never seems to really go on. Irene goes to rehab and returns home to a clueless husband who has no idea how to support his attempt to kick his habit. Irene grows up next to another recovering addict, a nurse from her rehabilitation center. Complications complicate. But history is never really sparked to life. It doesn't look like the movie is really going anywhere. You can say that it is a hard and realistic look at the daily struggles of an addict. Maybe so but in this case it is not an interesting film. The whole thing has a very "blah" feeling. Minimalist cinematography does not help things, adding another layer of gray to the incredibly sad procedure. And none of the other performances is as good as that of Farmiga. Hugh Dillon is OK as a nurse friend of Irene, but no one else in the cast adds anything of value to the proceedings. All in all this film is a sad, depressing and rather boring ride.
