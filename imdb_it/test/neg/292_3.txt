In summary: Simon leads a small team of special agents who specialize in finding and returning missing people, against all possible odds. Their last mission concerns the niece of their friend. It seems to have been taken into the network of a particularly brutal criminal and all those who sought it disappeared. But now the Librarians are on the case. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is pure B action, through and through. The key phrase for this is the unlimited offer. There is an unlimited supply of ammunition, it is not necessary to top up once. There is an unlimited supply of bad guys, so the heroes have something to shoot. There is an unlimited amount of breasts, many of which are bare, in a vain attempt (and as always failed) to distract from the holes of the plot. And there's an unlimited amount of bad acting (it's almost like the performance of Erika Eleniak shines in this, what to say?), And the actors who don't seem to care about salary anymore (and why should they do it when nobody else seems to?) . <br /> <br /> And like in most action B movies, there is an unlimited amount of wrong shootings. But these seem almost ridiculously bad. I think I saw more realistic shootings when I was playing as a child cowboy. <br /> <br /> But then again I didn't even expect much, how could I from an action movie called The Librarians? And it actually provides what might be expected. 90 minutes of more or less bad action with some scenes to connect the dots between. But I'm not sure if I can call it funny, it hasn't kept my interest for very long. <br /> <br /> 3/10
