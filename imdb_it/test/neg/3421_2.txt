This film illustrates the state of the Australian film industry and all that holds it back like no other. <br /> <br /> Exceptional talent, exceptional performance (especially Victoria Hill), but a disappointment in almost every other way. <br /> <br /> An "adaptation" of sorts did not bring anything new to Macbeth (no, setting it in current Australia is not enough), and essentially, it failed to justify its existence, apart from (let's face it, completely uselessly) by paying tribute to the original work. If there is a body of work that has been done (and done and done and done), it is Shakespeare's. So any adaptation, if it does not want to be a self-indulgent and useless exercise, must at least bring a new interpretation to work. <br /> <br /> And that's what Macbeth can't do. As has been done, this film has no contemporary relevance. It is the same piece that we have seen countless (too many!) Times in the past. Except with guns and different clothes. <br /> <br /> Apart from the fundamental error (no other way of saying it) of maintaining the original Shakespearean dialogue, one of the film's most cruel moments is the prolonged and incredibly slow boring movement that goes out towards the end during which I completely exited, even though I looked at the screen. I never thought I had poor attention, but you go there. <br /> <br /> I suppose the film succeeds on its own, very limited terms. But as Australia continues to produce world-class artistic talent, its filmmakers need to stop being proud of being successful on limited terms, and indeed set high enough standards to show respect for the kind of acting talent they work with. /> <br /> A pity. Such a pity.
