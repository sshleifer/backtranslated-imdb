Caddyshack II is NOTHING compared to the original Caddyshack. But there are legitimate reasons for this. (1) Rodney Dangerfield was supposed to be the ace of this movie, BUT he didn't like the script, he wanted to change it, his request was denied, so he didn't make the movie. (2) It was a low budget, Bill Murray had become a superstar status. Ted Knight disappeared in 1986, and Chevy Chase the "so-called ace" of the first film (even if it was Rodney to the end) could not have been more than 5 minutes, because it would have cost too much to pay for it. But you had Dan Aykroyd, Robert Stack, Randy Quaid and Jackie Mason, all useful substitutes, that nobody had their best performances.
