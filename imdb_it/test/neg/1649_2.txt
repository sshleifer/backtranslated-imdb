The perfect double bill for the horribly juicy "Beverly Hillbillies" is this equally atrocious, limping comedy, "Son in Law". Country girl Rebecca goes to California to attend college, only to be assaulted by lifestyle. 'Resident Adviser' "Crawl" helps her to settle in, and soon the two are good friends. Bec decides to take home the "Crawl" crowd for Thanksgiving, with obvious results of "fish out of water". <br /> <br /> The only other comic corner that Steve Rash (rightly called) reaches here is the sexual one. This hits us with, but without success. Both comedic aspects fail well, and you know that the film is groping when "Crawl" hijacks the combine and writes his name in the wheat field. <br /> <br /> Dramatically even the film is not up to par, with several attempts in the family and personal advice from "Swap" malfunctions. Among them Pauly Shore and Carla Gugino manage to raise a couple of smiles, but little else, while the rest of the cast are just forage. The problem is that it is almost impossible to really like "Crawl", and you'll find yourself spending the whole movie wondering why Rebecca wanted to spend a moment with him. However, if you are a fan of a non-intelligent comedy, "Son in Law" is right about the brand. <br /> <br /> Sunday, 10 November 1996 - T.V.
