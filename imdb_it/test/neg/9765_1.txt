What a total disappointment. Forget this abysmal movie and take the TV series instead. What the hell were they doing to make the American president relatively sane? ALL politicians should have been fools (Peter Cook is as good as the British prime minister). The pungent satire of the original is lacking, going instead to "slapstick least common denominator". 1 in 10 if I am generous! This is unfortunately yet another example of a remake that totally misses the point of the original, the difference with this being that they were both written by the same people.
