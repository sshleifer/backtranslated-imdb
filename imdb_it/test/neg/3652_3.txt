MGM tried to mate and to reach young men with the Divine to give them visibility and try them as protagonists. Gable and Garbo had the chemistry in SUSAN LENOX but it was a bad film. Here in INSPIRATION there is no chemistry between Garbo and Robert Montgomery and the script is also poor. What were they thinking? The modern Montgomery, fast talking, popping, and the long-lived Garbo? It's a story like CAMILLE. The young student falls for the woman of the world and is rejected learning from her past, rejects her, takes her back, refuses her ... you get the image. Garbo is absolutely credible as the model of a Parisian artist and completely at ease, even if bored, with his life at the top of society among his artist friends and their silly morality. Suddenly she is fascinated by this innocent. In the end he renounces his life for him and sinks into poverty, only to be saved by him and established in a house of his own. Ironically, he intends to marry and keep it on the side - so much for his moral ethics as before. <br /> <br /> The scenes are incredibly boring and boring and not much happens. Only Marjorie Rambeau in the role of Lulu is able to inject life into the acts with phrases like "Unfortunately weak women have strong appetites" and "Odette, where is your sting?" <br /> <br /> Only for Garbo fans.
