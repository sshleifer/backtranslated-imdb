This film has sucked so many levels! Have you ever seen the dentist? This film made The Dentist look like a masterpiece. I don't recommend this movie to anyone, unless, of course, you are really really bored, then maybe. It was so trivial. The killer reminds you of the grandfather of monsters, except he has protective glasses. When Jessica said "I want you to meet someone, my inner bitch, I thought you would kick your butt, but all you did was throw a garbage can against him." I was very disappointed. the crying scene about his wife, I KNOW the pain behind his tears ......... NOT !!!!! So, before watching this movie, grab a blanket and a pillow, make yourself comfortable because it's very relaxing.
