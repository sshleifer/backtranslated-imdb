Many actors have a multitude of good movie roles in their soul. Some, a handful. Others, maybe a couple. <br /> <br /> Then there's Linda Blair. "The Exorcist". Here it is. <br /> <br /> When you see "Chained Heat" and look at Linda Blair inside, you have to ask yourself what, if anything, was going through her head. <br /> <br /> Certainly not, "Oh boy: Oscar for the best actress, here I am!" <br /> <br /> Just another woman in prison film as if they were used to doing cheap in the 70s, this one actually has names you could recognize. John Vernon plays the principal ... I mean, the guardian (with a hot tub in his office, I wonder what he said to the contractor?), Stella Stevens appears, even Henry Silva and Louisa Moritz show how badly they needed work . <br /> <br /> And special mention, of course, for our heroine Sybil Danning as a bisexual prisoner who sets her sights on poor Blair. To paraphrase, Sybil is like Sybil and everything that Sybil does is perfect. It makes you forget what a terrible movie you are watching. <br /> <br /> Almost. <br /> <br /> Two stars. One for Sybil and another to try to get Linda Blair to pass as a sex symbol. Whatever could have possessed them (understood?)?
