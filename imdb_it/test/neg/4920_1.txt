Well, at least this was the last sequel I could find at Blockbuster, because this movie was just awful. I mean, I can understand how difficult it would be to get rid of an evil house. We are talking about a horrible fire, a bulldozer, a flood, etc. But a mirror? How difficult can it be to get rid of a mirror ?! This was the most horrible movie that could have put the Amityville title in the picture! <br /> <br /> Well, a group of friends who are practically from the beginning, are a group of monsters. One of them is a photographer of some kind and buys a mirror haunted by a gruesome homeless boy, teaching me a valuable lesson, not buying things from a terrifying and homeless boy. Of course, the horrible death and chaos follow this group, although I can't imagine anyone missing them. <br /> <br /> Please skip Amityville: a new generation, I have already received some complaints about my generation so I think this was a premonition. Don't look so crazy. : P But believe me, this is horribly played, not well thought out, nor scary! I feel so bad about the original authors of The Amityville Horror, they have to cry every time the person attends this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
