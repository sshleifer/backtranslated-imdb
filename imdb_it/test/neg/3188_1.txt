The horrendous "comedy" in which a beautiful crazy woman (Liv Tyler) "comically" destroys the lives of three men (Matt Dillon, Paul Reiser and John Goodman). Dillon hires a hit man (Michael Douglas) to kill her. What's happening to the play? The year 2001 produced some of the worst comedies (Saving Silverman, Sugar and Spice, Freddy Got Fingered, Tomcats, etc etc). This is one of the worst. There is not one, I repeat, not a funny moment in it. The jokes are either stupid, not funny, stained or sick. There is also a strong hatred of women in this junk - the only main female character (Tyler) is constantly used as a sexual object. In the end even extreme and bloody violence is thrown. The only bearable moments come from Reba McEntire as a psychiatrist and Andrew Dice Clay in two roles - both psychological. Dillon, Goodman and Reiser have hit an all-time career with this - the only way to go is expired. And poor Tyler! Have you stopped making smart and spirited independent films for THIS? AND DOUGLAS ???? What was he doing when he agreed to this? A piece of shit - to avoid at ALL COSTS !!!!!!!!!!
