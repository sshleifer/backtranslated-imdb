I can only imagine how this film was born: <br /> <br /> "So how else can we ruin our careers?" <br /> <br /> "I know! Let's take a movie that has been a great success and make a follow up! <br /> <br />" Perfect! We will get B-level actors who have half the charisma and want only 10% of Carrey's original salary. We'll save millions and make a huge profit, no matter if nobody wants to see a second-level sequel with any of the original actors that made it popular in the first place! We, as executives, still honestly believe that a film is popular based on the name and the story, not the actors who did it in the first place! "<br /> <br /> Fantastic! We have a huge budget and we get the cheapest players we can find! "<br /> <br /> And that's just how you can describe Son Of The Mask. Just a simple class B movie that tries to suck the life out of its original classic. <br /> <br /> However , if the film did not contain the words the mask, or whatever it had to do with the mask, would be a nice film for children.For all its enormous flaws and horrible acting, this will really appeal to children: it is a natural film really wants to scream "like me!" but only the 8 and the younger ones will really appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Jamie Kennedy is the only one worth mentioning in this film, which is clearly trying to make the material work , playing the desperate father but the script is so poor, the only thing that spits worth it was my drink after seeing this.The character of Loki also deserves a quote, since he was the funniest character and really one of the only reasons why older adults see no this movie. is wasted in this film, I would have really liked to see the character take on the real mask. Instead, we are reduced to jokes and toilet humor towards the end. <br /> <br /> The plot is so much from the books, I won't bother to mention it here. It is all so clearly obvious that even a Disney executive would be green with envy. <br /> <br /> Save your money, this is DVD-directed in three months from appearance. Too bad for the studios for having spotted a decent movie again with a horrible sequel. Isn't it stupid and stupid to teach them something?
