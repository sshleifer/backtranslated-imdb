I'm not at all foolish when I say that this film was worse than any other film ever made. Worse than "Batman & Robin". Worse than "Manos, Hands of Fate". Seriously, it's so bad. When people tell me that a movie is terrible, I use the "Two Girls" scale to understand it. If the film is comparable to "Two Girls", then I will not watch it. If it's twice as good, maybe I'll watch it, but only to laugh at the retarded who paid someone to do it, because a movie twice as good as that would still be a piece of junk.
