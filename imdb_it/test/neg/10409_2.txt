This is a nice movie that deserves your time to find and see. <br /> <br /> He really talks about all the trivial choices we make every day and (like a HG Welles story I can't remember) can live to want back. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that this is a SHORT (very short). It starts slowly, but just when you start thinking that it has become boring = bang = it's over. And believe me, the "punch line" is the one you will remember. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that the producers will make it available for purchase - or available on the web, but in both cases you will be happy to have found the time to get a copy - I'm sure.
