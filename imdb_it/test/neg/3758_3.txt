I'm seeing a pattern here. If you see a movie on Mystery Science Theater 3000, it is likely that if you go to IMDb.com there will be hordes of movie lovers, yet it was chosen to be on that TV show because it was really bad. I'm sorry, but I read a lot about Rocketship X-M as a science fiction movie that emphasized realism. Well, if that were the case, I could write for several paragraphs about how even with the knowledge of the 1950s this film is absolutely wrong. Gravity could be the first obvious observation, or as the MST3K did as a "selective gravity" skit, even as regards the moment when they are falling towards death and standing right there looking out the window, and the ship does not Should that scene be raised down? I'd like to think that they started with good intentions and that it worked beyond the budget or something, but I think this film was just a cheese like in the sub-type. Just compare this with "When Worlds Collide" which was published in 1951 to see the real place where this film is placed, there is no comparison. The film gets a 2 or maybe 3 alone, it's not even fun to watch alone. It gets about 5 or 6 as an MST3K episode as there's no action or a lot to tease, just ugly, bad, bad, oh I already said, it's ugly.
