Get a clich√© story and enter Steve Guttenberg. So I'll tell you more? This is really bad as you would expect. Sheriff Tom Palmer (Guttenberg) and Anna Montgormery try to turn a bunch of useless and inept children into a winning soccer team. Leaving the originality and the direction from the offset it is rather difficult to maintain any form of interest in this film. Despite my reservations about Guttenbergs' acting ability, I can safely say that the acting coach of rival teams is actually worse than Guttenberg. Previously unimaginable I thought. This kind of story of losing fighters until the last was done before and better every time this so-called "movie"
