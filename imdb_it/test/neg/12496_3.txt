Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a secret service agent who prevents the murder of a senator however along the way he finds a conspiracy and has a pursuer on his tail. By the way, the tracker is willing to close Phillips. The most obvious inspiration for this low-budget cheeseball action movie, it's definitely Robocop, and while that movie had a bit of imagination and real energy, this only has a real kickboxing champion running away from a robot. The film is not so terrible as it is just empty and repetitive. The story is written in clich√©s and the characters are set to be shot down by the various shots. Don Wilson, as usual, is terrible in the lead role. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on 4 (Poor)
