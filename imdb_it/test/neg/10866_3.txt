Larry Bishop is 60 years old, dirty and not beautiful in this film, it's like a drug for women in their twenties. <br /> <br /> Many films have been declared sexist but if someone deserves that title, this is it. <br /> <br /> I can't even count how many tits we were shown in this movie, probably more hours than Larry Bishop spent writing the script. <br /> <br /> The script is ridiculous, Bishop and his band quarrel, ride bicycles, party, have sex, kill people and the next day they discuss, ride bicycles, party, have sex, kill the people and the third day, well, the idea. <Br /> <br /> I like ERIC BALFOUR and considering what he worked with, he was as good as Comanche. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this film is about the one-dimensional character of Larry Bishop Pistolero which is not even funny. <br /> <br /> He is also a horrible actor, and apparently he never intended to be the protagonist alone, but everyone he asked said no, so what should he do? Once he realized that he would be the protagonist himself, he probably did a rewrite of the script so that he could touch up other women. <br /> <br /> Although visually it's kind of good looking, at least the biker scenes and Eric Balfour are not a pity, this movie is just a big mess. I hope to never see Larry Bishop again in front of the camera.
