This is probably the most irritating show I've ever seen in my life. It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen. Everything is simply ugly. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: Each week a different situation arises for parents to manage their children. <br /> <br /> I don't understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess, first not to mention several seasons. The script is ugly, bad ?? contains both jokes and unethical jokes that are normally seen in films with classification R or NC-17. Especially for the character of the boy in whom all he does is please himself is what is called family humor? The casting is also horrible, because all you see is a really BAD Actors, period. <br /> <br /> Final Word: This Show is a real torture !! This show provides an image of how the irresponsible parent can be (using power incorrectly rather than understanding). It is sometimes zillion away from reality. Listen Kenny G would be a god sends the comparison to this. Watching the washing machine turn around would not hurt your eyes as much as this show. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0/10 (Rating: Z) <br /> <br /> Note: The Show Is So Bad That even the cast mother takes her daughter out of the show.
