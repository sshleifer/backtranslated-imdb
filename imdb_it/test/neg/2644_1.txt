This film was horrible. If it had never been created, the world would be a better place. Come on, a flying cart? What were they thinking? This was a sub-par movie with a horrible hook, and I would like excuses written by the studio that produced this, along with some cookies to help me pay me back for the time I wasted in this shitty party that I will never get back. If you paid to watch this movie, I'm really sorry because I watched it on TV on a Sunday afternoon, when I had nothing better to do and that pretty much ruined my entire week. A VAGUE that drives you crazy?!?! And should this make up for having a horrible mother who cares more about her own wrong needs than her children? No wonder they don't have enough sense to tell someone who is beating them, their mother doesn't teach them anything but what they want comes before anything else. Absolutely horrible.
