Now before telling you the synopsis this is a non-spoiler review. Bone Eater hits the mark for being the worst movie of the year. I don't know how these films also come on DVD. If you saw him in the cinema, you would be very angry. Bone Eater talks about these people digging an ancient cemetery and finding bones. It is the "bone eater" and the more bones it eats, the more powerful it becomes. <br /> <br /> First of all I thought that the DVD artwork looks scary and sounds creepy. When I rented it and looked at the DVD label, it looked scary. But then, when I played it, I agree on one thing: the title "Bone Eater" is better than the film itself. Tell me what's more stupid? A bone eater who attacks by simply throwing a bone ate you and you disappear? Don't worry, it's not a spoiler you see happening in the first 5 minutes. Or is it more stupid that "Bone Eater" has a horse? Do you know what I think is the most stupid? The whole movie. <br /> <br /> The CGI is horrible. Yes, I thought the idea of ​​'Bone eater' was creepy but once you see the real thing you think it's a kind of action movie or just a cruel and mean joke. The film seemed longer than Titanic and this was half an hour. Once the film actually has its moments of suspense, it stops. I admit that acting was not the best, but actually decent and that violence was not exaggerated, but everything else is a stinker. <br /> <br /> The bone eater in general is a movie you can skip. If you like interesting movies with great creatures, the excellent CGI and the suspense "Bone Eater" is a movie to be skipped. If you like bad movies, no matter how picky, then "Bone Eater" will satisfy.
