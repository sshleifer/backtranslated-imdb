Directed by Diane Keaton and adapted from a book by Franz Lidz. A young mother Selma Lidz (Andie MacDowell) is fighting a very serious illness and her self-proclaimed husband of inventor Sid (John Tururro) is a little lacking in the emotion department. Unhappy with the new family situation, their sensitive son Steven (Nathan Watt) decides to stay with his two eccentric uncles Danny (Michael Richards) and Melvin (Lou Cutell) until his mother is fine. Steven seems to be happier and is also interested in the life habits of the strange uncle; he even decides to change his name to Franz. Set in the early 1960s, this drama is a bit comical ... change it strangely. Not being a MacDowell fan, UNSTRUNG HEROES assures my attitude; although I liked the film and it is not a total waste.
