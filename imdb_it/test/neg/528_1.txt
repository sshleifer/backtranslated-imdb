I wasted 35 minutes of my life in this turkey before giving up. The main character is completely in the dark and incredibly obnoxious, but there is no humor in his mistake. As soon as he arrives in Germany, the writer takes out the old woman "there is only one room in the hotel, you will have to share a room with a beautiful girl". Come on, at least you could let them develop their relationship a little earlier. Watch "It Happened One Night" to see how to do it right - or any of a thousand movies since then. <br /> <br /> Acting is always third class, and impromptu dialogue should have been left on the cutting room floor. It unwinds without any plan, despite the fact that the film telegraphs the destination of the report from the moment Greta is introduced. <br /> <br /> The first song, in the boardroom, is slightly funny but badly sung. The rest of the songs (well, to be honest, I've only heard those in the first half hour) are simply useless and horrible. Most singers are painfully off-key, but not deliberately witty.
