Before starting, I can say that I hope you have already eaten while you are reading this. Why? Because, after seeing this movie for the first time, the look and sound of the bird made me want to eat the chicken after the words "The End" appeared on the screen. So don't say you haven't been warned. <br /> <br /> Fred Sears could have directed "Earth against flying saucers" (an ok film and one of the greatest examples of Tim Burton's "Mars Attacks"), but "The Giant Claw" isn't a movie gigantic. Yes, it is a prehistoric monster that flies in the air, attacks planes and cities and from time to time it is a man on a parachute. The beast is gigantic except in scenes where it is considerably smaller, but who needs consistent proportions in a film? Frightening? It may have been, but not if the plot is hopelessly stupid and the monster looks like a puppet that escaped from Sesame Street.
