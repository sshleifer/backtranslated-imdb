I'm shocked to see that this film has received more than two stars from some people. They must or are joking or being totally blind to the art of acting, directing and other flaws in the film. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I couldn't force myself to sit for the whole movie, it was too bad. <br /> <br /> The first three characters, with the exception of the "seeker", were just horrible actors, and I mean! Maybe the director didn't care, or maybe he's a worse director. It was like watching a bad school performance. The film was obviously shot with a video camera (lowbudget - not real film) and even the light settings were not very good. Also, the sound man (if he had one) had to be a beginner or a drunk as the sound was amateur. Even in one of the first scenes of the kitchen (AWFUL acting btw) the sound of the dialogue was rather ugly. For example, when the woman moved her head as she spoke, her voice could be heard disappearing and turning back. They seemed to have tried to correct him in post-production by raising the volume a little when he felt dizzy. In addition, the continuous and irritating hum coming from the camera or other kitchen sources could be heard. <br /> <br /> All these snowshoes in the first 5 minutes or so. Should I add anything else? <br /> <br /> A good school project or a fun project to watch for friends, but it should never have been published for a real audience, especially for a paying audience. THIS WAS A RIP OFF unless you have a very low standard for movies, or just bad taste. You are WARNING! SB.
