This piece of gawd-awful tripe is everywhere. The script is ugly, the plot is ugly, the acting is ugly. There are a couple of decent actors (Charles Durning, for example), but the director didn't get anything out of it. The plot has Santa Claus, feeling disconsolate and thinking that no one needs him anymore, taking a child across the country to try to bring his father back with his mother. Includes a scammer in Santa costume with a stuffed parrot on his shoulder (played by "Isaac" of The Love Boat), the world's biggest elf (played by Bruce Vilnach - a very funny man, but without an actor), hardened factory owner who works his employees overtime on Christmas Eve, and a sled race in which someone cuts one of Santa's skis trying to win. If the plot sounds bad, it's worse on the small screen. If you see this movie coming, run, don't walk, to your TV and disconnect it. You may want to boil the TV to remove any remaining infections. If you accidentally watch more than 10 minutes of this, you may need to burn the TV and have the cable company install completely new lines.
