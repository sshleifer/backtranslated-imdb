I just saw it on TCM tonight and I was shocked by the excessive acting of Jean Arthur. The fact that she had stunned his eyes in surprise and that, generally, he just did everything was not in the same style as Dietrich and Art Lund. Dietrich was wonderful in his control and his comic times. She's the best thing about this movie. Wilder's gags were flat and frankly more like something a college freshman would write trying to "run away", being evil, witty and dirty, but it sounded boring and not funny at all. It seemed that humor had been pushed too hard to be funny. The ending was totally invented. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD: Never for a moment did I believe that Art Lund had suddenly fallen out of love with Dietrich and then suddenly fell madly in love with Arthur. Oh, Billy. Come back down to earth! 3 out of 10.
