Please don't waste your money with this sorry excuse for a movie. The only way I could see someone watching this is if I'm a diehard fan of Erika Elaniak, but you'd be better off surfing the internet than watching this piece of shit. I'd rather watch the paint dry than watch this. They attract you with Casper and Erika and make you believe that this is a Dracula science fiction movie, but it quickly turns into a farce on Van Helsing's big-grand (get the point) nephew, here ironically for a last show-down between he and Dracula. <br /> <br /> The film also tries to make a political statement, I believe, when it seems that none of the characters in the future know who God is, that they have not been taught anything about him and do not understand when they see a cross . He could have done much more with this idea. It is a pity that it turned out this way.
