This film begins with a pedestrian configuration before entering the standard genre of suspense action in which an employee continues to beat trained secret service men, etc. <br /> <br /> I couldn't say that the acting was bad - there were some good "surprised" faces from Hamilton and Sheen - but I really shouldn't. <br /> <br /> The final awakening gave me at least a good laugh for my pains. And yet, if my life was flashing before my eyes, I think I will have 90 minutes ahead. <br /> <br /> I have to write two more lines of text just to get this thing published. Yes, very resistant dress that wears shine. I made a special promise to never look at such a bad movie again.
