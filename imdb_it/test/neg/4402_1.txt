This is like a school video project and a propaganda film that puts the whole class and the teacher to sleep. <br /> <br /> Absolutely boring long (silent) strings of unrelated video clips. <Br /> <br /> Instead of watching this movie watching the dried paint or growing grass, it will be more interesting unless you like to see the mischievous Arabs towards everyone around them. <br /> <br /> Sulieman (the director) should be embarrassed by this gross waste of movies. <br /> <br /> It deserves one for the quality of the film, a zero for the ridiculous propaganda message and a negative number for the script (or its lack).
