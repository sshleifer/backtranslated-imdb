I saw this movie in the theater and it was a terrible film. The way that Michael Oliver, who now runs even worse in the sequel, is the biggest intolerance I can't find. Junior angered his father because he didn't want to go to school and had his father Ben crazy. Even the Crazy Dance race operator is not fair to Junior for not letting him go around. And Lawanda Dumore is horrible as a serial killer at Junior because he has threatened Junior with insults, which is why I can't tolerate this film. Although the film is republished in theaters in the extended version, I would not see this film because this film is not even tolerable. In fact, it stinks!
