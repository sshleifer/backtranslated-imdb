This film was produced by the largest producer in Costa Rica. Although their authors boast of being the biggest film ever made in Costa Rica and their actors even dare to claim not having received an Oscar nomination because of its political relevance with oil (-he he, right) ... Well this is all a lie This film was apparently based on a book written by Carlos Salazar Herrera on a love triangle (super cliché soap opera as subject) and the secondary story is about an oil problem on the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica with an American oil company that wanted to explore the oil fields in the region, but in the end it was never approved by the government. Now, he can have some good beach films, but that's all; nothing bigger than that ... it's all in the camera. Most of the actors are bad, except for two or three. The rest is meaningless of what acting means: they are almost always agitated. The story is completely common and cliché, worthy of a cheap Mexican soap opera as I said .. because the crew advertised it as an oil protest film, but 80% of the film is based on a stupid love triangle . The script does not impress, it is very simple and the dialog boxes are not very thought out. He also has some editing problems on a couple of scene changes ... but beyond that he's pretty decent. The director did a good job, I mean, he's not like Oliver Stone, but he did his job with the resources he had on hand. I would like to ask him why, instead of using the Costarican actor, he spent most of his money on foreigners. In short, after all they boasted that they are a 100% Costa Rican production ... that's what you expect. Finally the end is not well done, there are defects and details that do not correspond or are useless. Besides being the most elaborate film in the whole history of Costa Ricans, I think it's mediocre. You can take more interesting and better photos with less money. Ever heard of "Pi"? However, if you are curious about films from Costa Rica or Central America, this will do it, but you don't miss anything at all.
