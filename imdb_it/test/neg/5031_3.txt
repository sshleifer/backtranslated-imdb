I wasn't hypothesizing that this was certainly a very, very free adaptation of Eça de Queiroz's work, and I must say that this free adaptation forms the book as a lot of good ideas and possible characters. The problem is the way it is done, without any care, without any taste, just a grumble of clichés of bad taste everywhere. The screenplay is so fake and the characters so unreal make petty sympathetic actors like Unas, Bryner, Morgado, Lagarto and others look like they've been lost in a web of anything, except for cinema or storytelling. To my surprise the newcomers Jorge Corrula and Soraia Chaves bravely engaged in their performances, but you can see them lost like a drifting boat without any direction. And speaking of directing, does this seem to be something totally missing in this movie ?? where is the director? Everything is bad taste; the frames are anything, and every time, the use of the camera by hand without any justified reason, the design of the light that should create environments does not exist (and there is no excuse that the point is a true and obscure story). The problem overall in this film "trying to be" is that it has no taste, or very, very bad taste. It is sad to see Jorge and Soraia disappear into false and free sex scenes, painted here and there through the film as closing narrative holes or used as false transitional reasons. Perhaps Carlos Coelho da Silva should see the 2002 Carlos Carrera adaptation of the same book by Eça and get the overthrow of how to build a real movie.
