I just saw Congo on DVD. In most cases I love this type of film, but this is different. He made me write my first comment for a movie on IMDb. I was amazed how a team of experienced filmmakers could make this film as a result. You can see that there was a lot of money for this production but you can't make a good movie if you don't have a good script. And as a producer, Frank Marshall gave us a lot of fantastic movies to watch; he should never have tried to become another Spielberg. This shows how difficult it is to make a good movie, maybe you have all the ingredients but if you can't cook, stay out of the kitchen. If you can make a suggestion, don't spend your money on it. If you want to see it, watch it first on television and you decide.
