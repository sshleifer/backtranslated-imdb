Yes, we all know the strange charm of Dan Schneider in making shows with young children and iCarly is no exception. See the girls who move their toes and stick their tongue to the camera and wear skimpy clothes and bikinis. Yes, you wonder if these shows were made for teenagers or for some old degenerate crowd. In both cases the show is not so nice compared to Dan Schneiders in other shows like the Amanda Show & Drake and Josh by far superior. <br /> <br /> The show is about a brother and sister (Carly and Spencer) who live alone and have to go it alone while the father is out of the army and the mother is strangely absent from their lives. Carly has a petty friend named Sam and they do a very well made and rewarded web show called iCarly with their little school friend Freddie. The episodes deal with their lives in and around the web show and their bad luck at school. <br /> <br /> Carly Shay is a young, all-knowing personality of the web / business woman / producer played by Miranda Cosgrove, a young actress who counts speaks very loud and fast to get her point of view and make strange faces. His brother Spencer is a rather petty, puzzling and eccentric artist played by Jerry Trainor, who tries a little hard to be like Jim Carrey and whose comic style seems to be aimed at the young male audience who would like this kind of humor of Joey Gladstone. Then there is Sam Puckett, an unbearable, petty and liar of a brat who needs an adjustment of the attitude played by Jeanette McCurdy who clearly wears hair extensions, how can you see them disappear and then reappear from one scene to another . And finally there's Freddie Benson, the web shows nerdy cameraman and technical consultant, who has a crush on Carly but obviously can't go anywhere with her being played by Nathan Kress. <br /> <br /> Other secondary characters come and go like Freddies' mother, Carly's grandfather, annoying teachers and many of their annoying classmates to complete the cast. Most of the play is petty, like blowing up the goalkeeper Lewbert like a gag, throwing a water balloon at a teacher and toppling the table of young explorers selling cookies. All adults come out as complete idiots while all children know it, and some main characters have absolutely no morals. Lying, cheating, stealing and raping are all acceptable in this children's show created and written by Dan Schneider, Yes ... it's a children's show! What more young viewers could ask for? Well, with Dan Schneider we can expect to have the girls dressed in tight dresses and bikinis and do strange things like sticking their tongues to the camera and eating bananas. <br /> <br /> Shows like this are just what the young crowd loves and I don't think they get worse than the other Nick brushes of his young crowd. There's always a fan to be found for anything seen on TV, at least that's a little better than what's seen on Nick as the horrible Naked Brothers show.
