This is probably one of the worst movies I've had the pleasure of watching in my entire life. The plot is ridiculous and the characters are horrible people. I watched this movie with 3 friends and we agreed to turn it off 30 minutes before the end. Ben Kingsley's character is simply stupid but it's not funny at all. It is a wonder why an actor of his talent is involved in this tripe. Tea Leoni makes a beautiful impression of Hillary Clinton to portray the very cold and uninteresting female protagonist who has all the captivating qualities of a broomstick. Throw a useless and inexplicable subplot and a deservedly horrible editing and you end up with a waste of 93 minutes (60 in my case). Avoid this movie at all costs!
