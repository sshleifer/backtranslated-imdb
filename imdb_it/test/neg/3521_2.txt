usually a movie that starts badly remains bad in a monotonically descending pattern. This bad movie started to improve before facing a steep dive. The acting, except for the male antagonist, was horrible. The plot was essentially a set up for the final main scene, which is probably as good as performance art, but was wasted on this film. I'm not sure why this film was made.
