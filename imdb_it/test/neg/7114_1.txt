When you first sit down to watch this movie, keep in mind that you're about to see something you've probably never seen before. Keep in mind that this is a film in which they obviously spent a lot of cash on explosions and not enough to act or anything for that matter. The crazy thing I noticed is that every character is completely superimposed, and it seems (most of the time anyway) that the film was "accelerated" to make the characters move faster! (I wonder if the Hong Kong version was dubbed too?) I understand that the cartoon had this, but it doesn't work for live-action. It seems strange ... as if the crew decided to act because they couldn't afford real actors. <br /> <br /> The English version is horribly nicknamed, and the character's words do not correspond to the mouth at all. I would have preset the subtitles, but since this is a children's movie, and since some children can't read well, I'll let it go. But there is something extremely strange about this film. It is supposedly a film for children, but there is a lot of material on SEX, RAPE and STRIPPING which is not exactly for young westerners. (In the East, they have different laws and sexuality in children's films is much more accepted). But parents are warned! There is a scene where two characters talk about rape, multiple scenes in which people say "sex maniac" and a scene in which this crazy young Japanese makes a sexy dance for one of the "sexual maniacs" and shows him her breast ! For whom was this film made? <br /> <br /> Oh, and the special effects are ridiculous. You can say that things like spaceships that bombard the village are cardboard cutouts (or animation, I wasn't sure) that seem unconvincing, even for a child. The creators of this film have left out many interesting things from the comic, simply because they could not predict the kind of money they would need. I don't like how the names of all the characters were changed ... I wondered if this movie was made by the same people as Dragon Ball Z. <br /> <br /> I don't really recommend it to anyone. Fan for children, adults or Dragon Ball Z. It's just a poor representation of the cartoon and, of course, you will be able to say that this film was rushed and that no attention was paid. I won't even enter the camcorder ... just wait for the end credits to the still image that stays there for 2 minutes ... most of the shots are not framed correctly TO EVERYONE and the movie seems to be made only by amateurs. The quality of the film is also grainy. <br /> <br /> Simply everything horrible !!!! <br /> <br />
