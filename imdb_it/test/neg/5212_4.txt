I saw him recently in 2007 at the Palm Springs Film Festival and I can't believe this is Sweden's official presentation at the 79th Academy Awards to be considered as the best foreign film. Producer Anna Anthony also received Sweden's official presentation for best foreign film with Zozo last year. I wasn't personally a fan of Zozo, but at least it had a certain production value. This may have been shot as a high school film project. As a short film it may have worked, but as a feature film it is lost like its characters. This is a story of about five twenty friends who live in a small Swedish town and have no goals, hopes or ambitions for the future and love to live in the past of their distant childhood. Actually, Falkenberg is not like a remote village in northern Sweden. It is a famous summer resort with a population of cities and municipalities of nearly 40,000 inhabitants and is located between two important Swedish coastal cities of southern GÃ¶tborg and Malmo. The characters are pretty nice, but if they were school-age children with a dark or confused attitude about what they think they do with their lives, I would no doubt be more interested in them. However, they are far from the point where they should make plans to face adulthood. If they want to stay in Falkenberg forever, they must certainly find work in the tourism or fishing sector instead of cycling, drinking, smoking weed and painting a house from time to time. Maybe if they are out and about with a girl or two in their circle of friends, of which the girls are absent from this film that makes no sense at all. Jesper Ganslandt makes his directorial debut and wrote the film together with the director of photography, of which I freely use the term Fredrik Wenzel. acting is not so bad. I would give this 4.5 out of 10, but despite the presentation for the Academy Awards, I wouldn't recommend it.
