Heh ... I'm surprised this movie still exists in any form, not to mention it's available for rent! <br /> <br /> This film is one of the many bad flashes that exist only for T & A and economic laughter. The plot goes through the "Texas Chainsaw massacre" with a background story centered on the mother who remembers "Psycho", and some of the good old women in chains, astonished as a true ex-lover to a good extent - in others words, complete originality wrapped in half-naked women seasoned with a hint of absolute idiocy! Watching as the director tries to pass the wetland of Quebec as the southern United States, the bayou land is sad, I tell you! <br /> <br /> For me it's a funny thing, actually I was at the premiere of this movie, because, at the time, I was friends with Ratchford, the "star" of the film. It was painful to see Jeremy sink into his seat as the film opened its mutilated wings. <br /> <br /> I am happy to see that Ratchford, after this fiction of a first film, has become a hell of an actor. He can be seen regularly in the Canadian crime drama "Blue Murder", appeared in "CSI", not to mention his role in Clint Eastwood's classic film "Unforgiven" - we forgive you, Jeremy! It was a rocky start, but you did well, man! <br /> <br /> ~ T.Paul
