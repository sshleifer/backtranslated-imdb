As a semi-film lover, I had heard about this infamous movie a long time ago. I had heard that it was basically a $ 15 million movie about the tyrannical regime of the Roman emperor Caligula, complete with hard-core pornography. What struck me was that it was a porn movie and yet there were great actors like Peter O'Toole, John Geilgud, Malcolm McDowell and Hellen Mirren in it !! ?? A week ago I saw a documentary on Caligula on the History channel and this film came back to my mind and in the end my curiosity took the best of me, I madly rented the DVD and even more stupidly looked at it. <br /> <br /> Within the first 30 minutes I saw acts of sex and above all violence that would have gained an NC-17 even according to today's standards. It was really necessary to have a scene of a man who closed his urinary tract and then poured in liters of wine and then cut his stomach with a sword (all in very graphic detail). And a scene in which a boy cuts himself off the d *** and feeds the dogs (always with very graphic details) ... and this scratches the surface. The subject of this film by those who like it seems to be the only film that honestly portrays pagan Rome and excesses. When in reality what this film really is, it's pure exploitation. From the beginning to the end we see nothing but endless torture, beheadings and every kind of violence and imaginable crude behavior (sadomasochism, rape, necrophilia, never stopped). There are no insights about Caligula himself, what might have prompted him to go mad, the horrible childhood that turned him into an adult sadist. This is not a historical film, it is weak. Even the porn in this movie stinks, and for most of this when I wasn't gagging I was just incredibly bored. When he finished I was depressed, I didn't like eating and this movie does the impossible, in reality it can get you out of sex. <br /> <br /> What these great actors were thinking when they arrived at this. I read that the porn segments were shot after the main footage was completed (which explains why none of the main actors are in any of these scenes and why the quality of these scenes is so poor). But still and all these actors must have known what they were going to meet. It is in the opening credits that "Penthouse Magazine and Bob Gucionne Presents" are read. And the scenes in which the famous actors participate are completely repugnant in themselves. Apparently director Tinto Brass wanted his name removed completely from the complete film, as was the screenwriter (Gore Vidal of all people). Even John Geilgud and Peter O'toole asked people not to see it when it was opened at the Cannes film festival. <br /> <br /> For the amount of money spent by the producers, the quality of the film is terrible. Everything is subdued and dark as if the film had been dropped into a swamp before it was developed, and that's when you're lucky enough to see a scene that is actually in focus. The sound is little nicknamed, much of the music is embarrassing and the editing is terrible. <br /> <br /> However, I brought this film on myself. My advice ... don't look at this, don't look at this, don't look at this ...... like myself tomorrow night I'm going to watch something lighter ... like DAWN OF THE DEAD!
