Before going any further, I have to admit that I only saw the first episode of this show. If I had the time, I could have thought of watching it every week, if only to see how the season was going on. However, it was very clear to me from the beginning that Martha Stewart's version of "The Apprentice" is not "suitable". Martha Stewart has made a career as a happy housewife, a domestic diva like Oprah Winfrey and Julia Child. It was only from his scandalous legal problems and subsequent incarceration that his public image began to reflect the true roughness of his character. Sure, she's been compelling for a while, and this whole series raises the interesting question of what it means to be a woman in the business world. Does she have to come out cold and hard? Should not? <br /> <br /> But the truth was that, when Stewart was released from prison, his attempts at a public return, although certainly justified, could never capture the interest of the spectators for a long time. Perhaps a real comeback would have worked if she returned home peacefully and waited about a year after her thick ankle strap was removed. Instead, she frantically became passionate about 2 series at once, the other being her daytime marathon series Martha, very similar to her old but more mainstream show, with famous guests like Bette Midler. Of course, even at its peak Stewart has never been mainstream, so it's too much to ask the American public to immediately accept its incursion into the TV reality. Perhaps America wants Stewart to return on its own rather than being the basis for it. <br /> <br /> The show was basically a tired reconstructed "Apprentice" by Trump, which still maintains my interest, depending on the tasks, the cast and Trump's dismissal decisions (often controversial - probably for this reason). The letter was certainly not a clich√©, but rather unpleasant. The fact that Stewart never says "You're fired!" - mentioned on the bulletin board of this site - is particularly painful. Producer Mark Burnett should be admired for honestly addressing Stewart's prison while trying to make her a hero, but the truth is that anyone who looks at him can tell he is practically trying to show his beautiful businesswoman. Never again mainstream, Stewart lacks the pleasantness and identifiability of Oprah Winfrey and the admirable and charismatic "tenacity" of Donald Trump. Yes, this may be a gender assessment of your character, but I want to say that it is more about the nature of your business. <br /> <br /> It's not surprising that Stewart was fired, but I wonder if they always thought it lasted for just one season?
