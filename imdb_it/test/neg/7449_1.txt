The first Robocop had a sense of cynical spirit and a sense of sick violence. It was a thin line for walking, but Paul Verhoeven took it out and the film went so well, they made a sequel. What a terrible thing. (Possible spoilers in advance - even if all that could ruin all this is beyond me). Irvin Kershner is not the director of this type of film. Clearly he didn't understand the wit of the original and consequently the massive and senseless senseless violence seems really bad - and worse it is very unpleasant. Even worse is the musical score. Leonard Rosenman was an old man of another age and the heroic light music does not correspond at all to the images on the screen! What was he marking? The great American hero?! Worse, it completely eliminated the Robocop theme from the first film, which was so memorable and perfect. Can you imagine a Superman movie without the fanfare of John Williams, or Indiana Jones, etc.? How could he do that? !! <br /> <br /> The plot is just a collection of ideas that don't freeze. At first we see Robo "hounding" his old wife. Well, good idea. But they completely abandon him afterwards. Then, there's a stupid idea of ​​the company that reprograms Robo to be nice. It is launched for 10 minutes and then immediately eliminated. Or, the silly idea that the repulsive 10-year-old drug lord reminds Robo of his son - Once again, a weak reason that is briefly shown twice and dropped. This could work in a comic book, but not on the film and Frank Miller was unfortunately too inexperienced at the time and threw every idea together with the kitchen sink. It doesn't work as a whole. <br /> <br /> Some people seem to commend the assault on business in this film and the privatization of the police. This is the best part of the film that is consistent with the first. However, in the original, the old man was a tough businessman with a profit, but ultimately fair in the end. In this film, he is purely evil in his lust for money and power. You can't just change characters like that for no reason. And the character of Nancy Allen is useless in this film, while in the first it was essential for Robo's search for himself. It's free like violence in this movie. <br /> <br /> And violence, yes violence. I like many violent and bloody movies when they serve purposes and are meant to tell a story. Irvin Kershner seems to start from human beings who are blown up, torn apart, children who want death and torture and people's craving for drugs. He doesn't know when to stop. Do we really need to see the last innocent spectators (even people trying to help others) to blow themselves up ???? We can deduce when we see the bad Robocop repeatedly firing! Instead Mr. Kershner proves to have very little taste for this kind of work and creates an abominable disaster which is a terrible piece of pop art and, worse, a disgusting message of violence for every young person who watches this film. <br /> <br /> No, this movie is not meant to be message and I certainly don't watch Robocop or Alien or Predator movies for this reason. However, when you go too far and cut the line, much of what you do needs to be questioned. And as for this film, in the words of the last words of the drug-addict thug while he dies, "It still sucks."
