Even if I don't recommend this movie, I don't even recommend reading this review without first seeing the movie. Although it has not given away the ending, or most of the twists and turns, this film could best be seen without any preliminary information. It is difficult to identify the main problem of the film Donnie Darko, as there are many to be addressed. Richard Kelly, in his first feature film, seems to have collected enough scenes of adolescent rage, nocturnal stoner diatribes, hypocritical justifications and inoffensive and banal philosophy to inspire twenty adolescent dramas; then I mixed them in a single two-hour package with a sci-fi touch. The result is deeply distressing, for all the wrong reasons. The film attempts to lead the public on winding paths without any sense of symbolism or meaning, to make them sympathetic with one-dimensional characters, and above all hopes that they ignore the underdeveloped plot, full of inconsistencies, hiding it under a patina of CGI effects and neo-surrealism. The main character, Donnie Darko, is a young man, engaged in therapy, misunderstood by his friends and made hostile and dissatisfied with his suburban life. We are destined to feel that he is smarter than his classmates, although sometimes this is a difficult assumption to make. For example, when one of his friends arrives with an absurd theory about the Smurfs, and Donnie contrasts with his theory, his friend complains that Donnie recites "everything smart". Donnie's speech, however, is not smarter than his friend's - just more angry. The only clear proof of his intelligence is the description of his principal of his standardized test scores as "intimidating"; but given the director's point of view with respect to the simple categorization of human elements (as shown in the FEAR-LOVE sequence), this is a bad substitute for character development. Donnie takes prescribed drugs to fight mental problems, which are not addressed directly in this film. In fact, the whole issue of drugs is underestimated, and one of the first possibilities that the director must redeem is the loss of the film. The ambiguity of Donnie's strange destiny, the possibility that all this may be a product of his imagination, is pushed into the background, making the film 100% science fiction. This would not be bad in itself, except that the "science" behind the "fiction" is very shaky. Time travel explanations are weak, at best they seem wandering detached and uninformed. We have the impression that the film's writer has read a book about time travel or some chapters and can't remember how it worked, but he was sure it was really interesting and wanted to work on it in the film. The scientific part, therefore, depends to a greater extent on the expensive computer animations than the actual development of the theories involved (at a certain point a teacher who discusses time travel states that if he continues to talk about the subject, he would be fired. no further explanation is necessary). Donnie's relationship with a visitor to the future leads him to commit various vicious actions. The justification for these actions is a complicated one. It hurts his school, but that's okay, because his school doesn't treat him like a person. His punishment of a gruesome advocate of self-esteem (somewhat similar to the character of Tom Cruise in Magnolia) translates into the public humiliation of man. But should the public believe that Donnie is a sort of avenging angel, which strikes against ignorance and debauchery? He himself seems ignorant of the effects of these actions until after the fact. Apart from these defects, the film is full of flat and uninteresting generalizations of humanity. The story is set in 1988, just before the Bush / Dukakis election, and the director touches this point during the film. The attention, however, extends exactly to this point: the grumpy Donnie, the blue collar, is voting for Bush, while his rebellious and free-spirited daughter plans to vote for Dukakis. Here there is nothing remotely like a political declaration; simply a statement of the obvious. The first is not necessary to make a good movie, but the latter should be left out. Likewise, Donnie's heartfelt discourse on not being able to group all human emotions into insignificant categories of "fear and" love "does not require the public to make great progress in understanding. Everyone knows there are more than two human emotions, and the particular emphasis on this fact is useless.Mr. Kelly pays tribute to several symbols of pop culture of the 1980s in his film: ET, Stephen King, the Smurfs, Back to the Future. , this film seems to be that of the director who pays tribute to himself, a collection of his own experiences, interests, personal heroes and adversaries, statements and disenchantment, roughly mended by inexperienced hands: entire songs are reproduced in music video format for the actions of the characters, apparently because the director likes songs. The characters that have little or nothing to do with the plot (including the archetypal bully, the fat girl and the right-handed idiot teacher) receive a useless intrusion, because the director really wanted to compress them in some way. Donnie Darko's embarrassing mess lets us ask if Mr. Kelly has enough ideas in mind to make another film, or if he wasted all his creativity in a useless, cumbersome and tortuous effort. <br /> <br /> My vote: 1/10.
