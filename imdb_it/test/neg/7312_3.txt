Well, I should say I own this movie and I only like the ending. The film is boring and slow, but the final fight is so much fun. Let's just say that if the fake bird didn't attack the main villain this movie would be a 0 out of 10. But the bird makes it a 3. If you are really bored or you want something terrible to watch rent it and go fast to the final battle.
