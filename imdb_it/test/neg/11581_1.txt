I can immediately admit that this is one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. And that's not saying a little, because I consider myself a bit of a fanatic when it comes to bad movies. But this is beyond evil. This film is so horrible that nothing funny is left, it's just ugly. <br /> <br /> Reviewing this is almost impossible. There are no strengths and nothing positive to say. I'll just talk about some of the points that sucked. First of all, CGI must be one of the worst I've ever seen. I can't believe this movie was made in 2005, the CGI reminds me of something I could see at Babylon 5 when CGI was new and fresh. He is poor beyond imagination. Secondly, all the actors seem to belong to the worst kind of daytime soaps. And looking at their resumes, I see that I'm right ... Thirdly, being able to breed huge reptiles doesn't live up to the technology they invented in this movie: the unscrupulous gun with infinite ammunition! Seriously, Michael Par√© shoots 100-200 times without reloading in any other scene ... What's more, there are also planes that change shape! In the beginning they are normal F-16 fighters, in the next scene they are something else completely, and in the third scene they are F-16 again! If you are buying archive material, please do not mix it this way! <br /> <br /> Honestly, there's a lot more to say, but I think I'll stop. You all understand what I'm saying. I honestly didn't think that this kind of film was more realized. It's like something Ed Wood would do. Completely ignorant of quality, not worrying about how it all looks ... It's almost unbelievable in everything that is terrible. If I could give it to 0/10 I would do it, but 1/10 is the lowest rating. So that's it.
