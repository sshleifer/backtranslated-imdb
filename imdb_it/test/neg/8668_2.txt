I read a lot of Jane Austen in my day and I approve several film / television adaptations, but we really don't need this. <br /> <br /> The score is 2, because I wouldn't say it's horrible just so boring you'll feel like you've lost 90 minutes of your life. A boring script accompanied by an even more boring acting. I heard that Billie Piper is fine in Dr Who (he's not a fan, so I can't confirm) but this just sucks. There is absolutely no contact chemistry. This is Austen, it should be a love story! <br /> <br /> Please do not be put off by Austen or historical dramas. There are many better programs to see.
