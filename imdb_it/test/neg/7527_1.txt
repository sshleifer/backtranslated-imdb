The 2002 version of "The Time Machine" is just the latest in a series of terribly disappointing Hollywood remakes that fall on their faces despite the extravagant special effects. <br /> <br /> What a terrible story, banal and without inspiration, without imagination. Why rewrite such a fantastic science fiction movie so completely? Today's movie audiences are too fashionable for H.G. Wells largely how is it? George Pal's 1960 version told a much more captivating story, even with awkward low-budget effects, Eloi at the beach party and Morlocks that looked like Smurfs with steroids. <br /> <br /> The 2002 version must have HG Wells turning in the grave: <br /> <br /> 1. The idea that the time traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and trapped in a paradox temporal is an old science fiction cliché. This totally distracts from the love affair with Mara (what happened to Weena?!) That made the 1960 version so appealing. This soon sets an unfortunate and distracting tone that makes the whole movie gloomy. If Guy Pearce's character were so brilliant, would he or his friend Einstein have realized the paradox of time dilemma ?? doesn't it have it at dawn on him 800,000 years in the future ?? from a Morlock not less, Doh !! What is wrong with time travel just for fun, adventure and curiosity - as embodied in the 1960 version? <br /> <br /> 2. Only if you have seen the first film will you realize what Pearce was doing with the time machine when you see it for the first time. George Pal's film carefully explains the whole strange idea of ​​"journey" through a fourth dimension. <br /> <br /> 3. The director does everything to make the character of Pearce a bit of a geek, an old tired stereotype of scientists. In the 1960 version Rod Taylor was a little too nerd (at least around Weena) but he managed to be bold, playful and charming. <br /> <br /> 4. Among the key themes of the 1960s version - abandoned in the remake - there is the idea that the endless war leads to the bifurcation of humanity. Making the Moon explode to destroy humanity is useless and doesn't do much for scientific literacy. For over 4 billion years the Moon has suffered much more powerful asteroid impacts, which would make any nuclear device look like a firecracker. Yes, science fiction needs an artistic license, but it is simply stupid and meaningless. <br /> <br /> 5. Destroying the time machine is also stupid. Apparently our time traveler invented the neutron bomb to power this thing. Blasting the machine to kill Morlocks is a kind of disappointing "machina ex machina". Pearce never comes back in the 1800s to tell his story to his incredulous friends, a fundamental part of Wells' story with the irony that in a week when time travels goes to the distant future and comes back. <br /> <br /> 6. Having Morlocks running during the day totally ruins the portrait of H.G. Wells, wonderfully spooky and macabre, like dark creatures of the night. A real film opportunity lost. Furthermore, Wells depicted the Eloi as fragile and childish. These guys in the movie seemed able to face Morlocks, if they hadn't been so great. <br /> <br /> 7. The only smart Morlock ?? a kind of bleached Star Wars Evil Emperor - it had potential, but it's so lame and aloof that it tells Pearce to take his car and go home ?! Boy, what a dramatic point! In the book the Morlocks stole the car because they are so fascinated and fight to keep it. <br /> <br /> 8. The goof ball hologram of the public library of N. Y. is too much. Makes light the idea of ​​human cannibalism. the 1960 version simply had the "talking rings" that offered a dark and dark praise for humanity. Derelite evolution is serious. <br /> <br /> It is sad that the wonderful effects of this film can never compensate for a tired and invented clunker of a script. Save the cost of a ticket and popcorn and go rent the DVD when it comes out (soon there's no doubt), at least you can anticipate the thought of boring parts, just like our time traveler.
