I'm afraid I was left alone to watch the first hour of this film, since it really felt like a mindless trash and a waste of talent. Liv Tyler interprets a sumptuous beauty, but her acting skills are not yet sufficiently developed to give the part a real kick. While slowly seducing a bartender into a life of crime it is difficult to feel a real concern for any of the characters. Even John Goodman expresses his faintly comic lines with an absence of panache, as if carefree humor should be recited slowly in case someone misses the joke. The finish should be good, but the starter and main course left me with no appetite to find out.
