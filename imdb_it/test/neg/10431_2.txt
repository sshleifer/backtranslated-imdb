Idly, perhaps that should have been the title. Bad dialogue delivered at a snail's pace. All characters are of a single size except one. Unfortunately, that character has some of the worst lines and doesn't seem to fit into this clich√© driven by two hours of resistance. Having grown up in the seventies, this film is seriously lacking in detail, atmosphere and authenticity. Surprisingly, this was produced by Kelsey Grammar, someone who should recognize a sharp dialogue and a coherent narrative in a script. Cameron Richardson is the only element that illuminates this film. Robin Trower's music is also a welcome addition.
