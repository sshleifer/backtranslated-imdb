I think this movie was done backwards, first they shot a lot of scenes and actions, and explosions, and then the writers started working trying to find a story to tie all the scenes together. this film is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen, your average porn movie has a much better and much more coherent written script. The film makes no sense. Seriously, even if you are a Segal fan there is no reason why you should NEVER want to watch this movie, except if you are one of those who likes to fix accidents, because this is a horrible accident, and should never have been released on this world. <br /> <br /> Boran.
