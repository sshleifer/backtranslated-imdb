The first two films of this series have distinguished themselves for shooting the natural world and the common people stuck in the midst of society. This film has none of those natural shots, which I understand is part of the point, but it really makes the whole video component of the film like random images stuck together - those and the zeros that fly around, the computer models of human skeletons and so Street. Occasionally the archive material is highlighted (the nationalism / finance segment around 35:00), but it usually seems that the video does not contain any significant content and requires the acceptance of the context of the photographic photographers rather than the context of the director. It's not better than the video shown on a karaoke. Three stars added for the Philip Glass soundtrack.
