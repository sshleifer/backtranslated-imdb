I saw this film based on the comments of some who said it was ugly but funny. But you must be warned that this film has the worst special effects ever produced. They make the science fiction films of the fifties look like works of art. This is fun at times, but for the most part annoying. And aggravating the problem with seriously pathetic special effects is the total lack of logic that has characterized most of the events represented. One of my favorites is where three characters fall for hundreds of feet in a tunnel created by the arachnia and come to find it completely illuminated. Apparently even the arachnia has managed to hook up to the electricity grid. Very impressive. But this is just an example. And for what it's worth, the music sucks, the acting sucks, the two pretty girls are annoying, the nasty guy is annoying, the so-called handsome lead man is a misfit, and the black girl who falls in love with him is a crazy. His father is the worst actor I've ever seen. I'm not sure that brief moments of humor can compensate for the experience.
