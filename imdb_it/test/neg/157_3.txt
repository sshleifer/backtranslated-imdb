The film (DVD) "The Tempest", directed by Jack Bender, was released in 2001. It did not make its way into German cinemas and neither the director nor the actor received a major award for this film. The film refers to the Shakespearean comedy "The Tempest" which was published at the end of the 16th century. The director tried to create a modern version of this game, but he couldn't. At the beginning of the film the owner of the Prosper plantation enters into conflict with his brother Antonio for the treatment of their slaves. Antonio travels his brother and tries to kill him, but with the help of a witch, Prosper manages to escape and escapes with his daughter and a slave named Ariel on a small island near the Mississippi river. For over twelve years he lived isolated on this island, until a lucky chance allowed him to take revenge on his brother ... If Prosper is lucky, you have to find out for yourself. <br /> <br /> My opinion is that this film is really a bad attempt to create a modern version of the original by William Shakespeare. The story of the film is confusing as are the characters. Prosper does not have the same powers as the storm ..... END OF PART I
