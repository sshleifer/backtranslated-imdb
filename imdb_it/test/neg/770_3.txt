This was not a great film, the acting was pretty sweet and the effects were bad most of the time. But there were some fun moments, but most of those weren't meant to be fun. The funniest part of the movie for me was the part where a kid in a wheelchair falls out (not the fun part what kind of person you think I am) the guy falls out and starts screaming for his big brother , well the brother comes running and the way the child runs is so funny that it's all stumbled and really over the acting that I had to rewind several times so I could laugh a little more. so if you're looking for something to rent but can't find anything check this and look at the running part.
