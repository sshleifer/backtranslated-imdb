... Or better yet, look at Fandango if you want to see a truly street-smart, entertaining college men's movie. Rolling Kansas looked promising (in fact the program's guide gave it 2.5 stars out of 4, which usually means that it is quite watchable) but I did a quick advance. Street movies usually have great music, but I can't even remember if there was music. The only important point was a small role with Rip Torn as a wise old hitchhiker / guru. Otherwise the jokes and the missed times along the whole route. The four main characters are unknown actors and I don't remember seeing anyone in another film. (Oh, yes, I see that Thos. Hayden Church was inside, but he is in everything, good, bad or indifferent). This movie is as much fun as watching someone else stoned when you are not.
