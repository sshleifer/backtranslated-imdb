The box is the reason I originally took this film and the back is why I rented it. But I soon learned that I had been deceived. I thought this film would be like a road trip / Eurotrip / American Pie. But I was wrong. This film is one of the stupidest I've seen in a long time. The unrated version pushes you to look but it will disappoint you completely. The acting was terrible and the sound effects were simply gaudy. It seemed like a very low budget with the whole setting taking place in the same building. Exit and take Eurotrip or Road Trip instead. I can't believe National Lampoon has put his name on this. DO NOT PURCHASE IT, DO NOT RENT. Don't waste 2 hours of your life in this.
