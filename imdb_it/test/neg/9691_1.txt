This is the most inaccurate and shameful biblical film I've ever had the misfortune to watch. I'd like to know why anyone on earth could enjoy seeing this. I'm so surprised that a big name like Jon Voight would agree to act in this shameful piece of junk. Many people who may not have read the Bible will now be misled believing that this film was accurate and the thought of it really annoys me. I think the producers have a lot to answer. The worst thing is that, I believe that no one can make such obvious mistakes with a biblical film, since they can search the Bible for the truth, so I believe the producers have deliberately distorted what the Bible says, and this is something that nobody has the right to do and I find it very offensive. There are no words strong enough to describe exactly how I feel about this.
