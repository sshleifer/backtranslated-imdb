I miss the words for this appalling waste of two hours of anyone's life. The story is invented to complete unbelief. <br /> <br /> The acting is leaden and much of this is terribly ridiculous. Vinnie Jones - so wonderful in Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, is unbearably horrible and unbelievable as Mike Sullivan, a journalist. <br /> <br /> I can honestly never remember having seen a worse movie. It is only worth looking for the terrible interruption of continuity. After Jones is delivered a huge beating emerges without scratching him. His girlfriend spills a drink on him and he pursues her, coming out of the pub bone to dry. It's pretty awful, made worse by the talented actors who appear to us.
