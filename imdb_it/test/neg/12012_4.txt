Junior and his father start a new life in a new city. It's the same life because Junior hasn't changed a bit. He is always the same brat as before, only he has grown older. This time he has a friend named Trixie and she is only slightly worse. Junior doesn't like his father to meet and ruin all the opportunities he has. Then the grandfather moves in and the dog arrives. I thought the two of them would make a good movie but they didn't become friends until the end. This is a film for the most immature people. He has diapers, farts, pecorino cheese and humor in the bathrooms. Only someone under the age of twelve would find it super fun. I hope when I have a child, it's exactly like Junior.
