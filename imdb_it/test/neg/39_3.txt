This is a difficult film to evaluate. While he really deserves his 3 (or maybe even a two), for an Al Adamson film, he's exceptional - and pretty much the best of Adamson. This is because, unlike many Adamson films, there are moments when NURSE SHERRI seems almost competent. But, being an Adamson movie, you know that sooner or later that crap MUST make its ugly head! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a bizarre leader of a gigantic congregation (six) who tries to resurrect a dead man who seems to be made of blue cheese. However, in the process, the cult guy has a heart attack and is taken to the hospital. Apparently he dies, but it also seems that many of these hospital scenes are missing and some of them appear much later in the film. In other words, when you see the movie, it looks like it has probably recovered - just to hear after it's dead. Because the boy is the b.f.f. of Satan, however, his diabolical soul cannot die and returns to persecute one of his henchmen and to possess the nurse Sherri. <br /> <br /> Now, Sherri is obviously a very disturbed lady - demonic possession or not. Sometimes he acts like a zombie and in others he is violently a murderer. So I ask ... "why didn't her boyfriend (a doctor) think that this was, perhaps, problematic ?!" In other words, after trying to kill a patient, he gets neither an exorcist nor obliges him to the explosion hatch !!! Oh, and talking about tits ... this movie is NOT the full sex of pectorals that break its title and the posters would indicate. While there are a few bare breasts here and there, they are irrelevant to the plot and seen only very briefly (1/2 second or so) in all the scenes except one. So, if you are a pervert, this film is not for you, even if in some parts of the film (like the nurse who strips for a patient) it seems that the film MIGHT was, at the same time, designed as a porn movie . <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of bad cinema, however, there is enough to whet your appetite. Some examples of incompetence are the inability of many actors to provide lines that are not like those of a zombie - and I don't even talk about Sherri. One of the final scenes is particularly evident - I have never seen and heard some recitations and dialogues written in my life - and this includes Ed Wood's films! There are also some cheap touches, like the bad animation of the "green stuff", the doctor who finds a murdered nurse who continues to investigate in a house where the walls are covered in blood (I'd like to have a policeman ... even better , an army of policemen). <br /> <br /> So despite these problems, why do I think it's good for an Adamson movie? Well, the story is not bad at all and he was able to build the tension very well. Many false alarms have precipitated the heart a little. Furthermore, the car crash, although irrelevant, came out pretty well and was pretty big for Adamson. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not a good movie and most people would be bored watching. However, fans of Adamson or inept movies will appreciate the fact that it will offer some entertainment in a poor way that will provide some laughter.
