Considering they wanted to make a vampire movie in space, I thought, "Well, it's probably pretty bad, but at least interesting enough to see a different way of playing the whole genre." Ops. I don't care what kind of movies you like; even if you're the greatest vampire, horror, thriller or suspense fan in the world, or negatively, if you've never seen a horror movie before and you'd expect your first one to be awesome in any way ... you're wrong. I don't think I've ever seen a movie "made for TV" or such an ugly after-school. I've never seen a television pilot show that bad. I've never seen movies of sleeping animals or shit that is as bad as this. This is, by far, the biggest waste of hours that you might otherwise spend contemplating the importance of kitchen towels and their effect on your life. I much prefer to be trapped in a bathroom for weeks without anything to consume but my urine and excrement than just looking at a single clip of this movie. Watching this made me want the fate that the characters have fallen into, instead of taking care of knowing that I paid to see it. It was, however, like a shipwreck: so bad you couldn't help looking, hoping that something good could happen. It was not so. Please, for God's sake, if you or your friends - even if you use illicit substances while doing it - also consider watching this movie, choose instead to organize a contest to see who can shoot a farther rocket. It will bring you much more fun and entertainment.
