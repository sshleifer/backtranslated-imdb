I took my fourteen year old to watch this movie. We left after 15 or 20 minutes. It was absolutely horrible! This film should be rated R as a minimum. I'm not so strict with movies, but this was just too much. It was a waste of money. I thought it contained some comedy and I knew the play would probably be rough but, this was WAY beyond the rough. I was sitting there watching and reading (a certain subtitle at the beginning of the film was what really took me) and I couldn't believe how sexually rude he was. I could not believe it would be OK for a 13 year old boy to read and see this content. I don't understand how the evaluation system works. ??
