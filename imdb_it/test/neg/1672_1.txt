I received this film in a package called "50 all-star movies" for $ 18 (45 cents each). Many are good This was terrible. It was an afterthought reconstructed 1000 times before and every time better. A former crippled athlete has the courage to coach a team of young delinquents. They learn from him that they can make it if they play by the rules. I'm sure the kids and locals were excited to be included in a "real TV movie", but I can't imagine what the guys who launched and produced this project thought to bring to this already beaten topic . I kept waiting to see that "new touch" or "new corner" but, honestly, it doesn't come. Avoid this movie. Forget the 45 cents, I want the 96 minutes of my life back.
