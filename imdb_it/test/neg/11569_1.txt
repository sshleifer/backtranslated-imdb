I was so "impressed" with Tim Kincaid's MUTANT HUNT that I tried to do this. It's the near future, obviously post apocalypse. A wandering fighter named Neo (no, not that Neo!) Joins a group of similar-looking fighters to challenge the Dark and its undertone Valaria. Along the way, they encounter mutants, crazy females, sewer worms, a large spider's leg and some sturdy robots. Oh my! <br /> <br /> Sadly, HOLOCAUST ROBOT is hardly up to (or down) the HUNT level. At about 79 minutes of pain (the box says 90), this is a stroke of luck. The sets have all the elaborate design of a house infested with carnivals and the costumes show that in the near future everyone will dress like John Travolta in the final dance number of STARE VIVI. The atomic desert is a combination of old buildings full of rubble and Central Park. The headquarters of The Dark One is called The Power Station and looks, well, to a power plant. The acting is universally bad except for Angelika Jager like the evil Valaria. Jager is a whole other level of bad. More seriously Cherman accuses, gives such an incredibly negative performance that it becomes the only reason to recommend this movie. It also delivers the only nudity of the film in the "enjoyment room" section of the film. Ed French again provides the effects of the robot but they are not as slimy as his work in MUTANT HUNT.
