This very spontaneous story by Carmen begins in an acute way with a smoking and sexually sincere dance between the prisoner "Karmen" of Senaglese and his female prison guard, but the alive initial minutes never light up in any coherent film. One minute Karmen is a sexual predator, the next day he dances in protest against his unfair government, and suddenly he is a smuggler on the high seas ... Although the film deserves compliments for postulating the first carnivorous "Karmen" bisexual, in large strokes it depicts in such a vineyard and not supported by any narrative coherence that the film emanates as a schizophrenic and unruly melange of "Basic-Instinct" meets "Bound" meets an African version of a Bollywood musical.
