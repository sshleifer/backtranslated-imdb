Dear Mr. Ram Gopal Varma, I do not know in what capacity I am writing you this letter. I'm a fan of Amitabh Bachchan, who never said he finished, after sitting in Jaadugar in his cock-hunting act. I also request some important designation in the fan club The Godfather, having observed the Coppola classic more times than you delivered the flop from your factory. And, of course, I've been your great admirer, ever since you had Nagarjuna by wrapping the chain of the loop around his knuckles in Shiva. <br /> <br /> When you announced Sarkar and defined your opinion of Godfather, all you wanted to know was the date on which the first look would be released, on Sunday the promos were aired on Friday the film would be published. It was pure satisfaction of the desire to work knowing that you, and not someone who wandered between the mustard fields of Amritsar and the tulip gardens of Amsterdam, had taken on the task of recreating the pages of Puzo on the big Bollywood screen. <br /> <br /> Could your cast be you anymore? working for the first time with the legend, making Abhishek his son-screen, giving Kay Kay a role he deserved for years, bringing back forgotten faces like Supriya Pathak and Rukhsar, and choosing complete non-actors like Katrina and Tanishaa to join the list?? Before July 1, you had made Sarkar the most anticipated film of all time for any Godfather fanatic who adored Bachchan. <br /> <br /> The opening titles aroused the hope that your incredible sepia promo on television would come on. But now you've labeled Sarkar as a tribute to Godfather instead of the "inspired" word you've always used. You probably don't want the two creations to be compared, but when the medium is the same, then a Kaante would be compared to Reservoir Dogs and a Reservoir Dogs to a City On Fire. <br /> <br /> Also, when is your first and last sequence ?? the heart of every script treatment ?? Concerning the creation and transfer of power, you cannot keep Nagares and Corleones apart, even if you replace the American mafia moves with the Maharashtrian political game. <br /> <br /> But are you wrong, Mr. Varma ?? You wanted to show Amitabh in his 1970s avatar, jagged by the Salim-Javed feathers. You wanted it to hide bigger than life. You wanted it to be his brand (o). So how could you steal his voice in the name of using silence? How could you keep him rooted to his chair in the hunt for interesting camera angles? How could you leave him without his voice and his stature, the two things that made his B so big? Coppola's godfather cameraman, Gordon Willis, masked Brando's eyes throughout the film because he didn't have the power to match that trailing voice or sudden finger snap. But you tried to repeat the Malik act from your own company. But Bachchan is not Ajay Devgan ?? his forte is not in the stagnant gaze and in the suffocating silence. You made the man appear as a patient in a coma, from which he remembers from time to time to look at the papers of the cues and to mail those predictable jokes. For that, Agneepath is there, every Saturday. <br /> <br /> Which Bachchan fan would go to see Kay Kay Menon steal the thunder from under his nose in the scene where Sarkar asks Vishnu to leave his home? Which Amitabh aficionado would watch him focus on achaar and carambola, in a film that talks about power with a capital P in promotions? We can't handle so much in the name of moderation and understatement! Don't even let the camera lean on him for five seconds when he finds out his son wanted to kill him. Give me the old-room-only-on-Bachchan style, every Saturday. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to you, of course, for making an actor with Abhishek, first at Naach and now at Sarkar. Also allow him to show Mallika Sherawat that he can run like his father. Even in the short sequence of captivity, you really make the Bachchans come out of the text, an opportunity that Shaad missed on Bunty Aur Babli. I wish the film could have been more of a parent-child story rather than a chaotic conflict between caricatures in the name of characters, which look like Internet ad windows. <br /> <br /> You also allowed women more in the script than they did from Puzo and Coppola and again, you deserve all the Brownie points to tighten them up so effectively. Pathak is a welcome return as the mother in the middle, lovable Tanishaa as the girl in love, Katrina a revelation as Abhishek's confused lover and Rukhsar's silence says volume. <br /> <br /> But the plots don't make a classic remake. When your free-flowing camera tries to make each frame a hatke and your strong background music incessantly irritates, we keep reminding ourselves that we are in a factory. Well, maybe it's not a score by Nino Rota, but Sarkar certainly deserved better than those Govinda, the songs of Govinda and the interludes for flute without interruption. <br /> <br /> Mr Varma, some of your Factory directors tell me that you are involved in every project, from checking the shooting times to supervising the editing sessions. Perhaps, in the midst of all the various storyboards, Bhiku Matre's scream is muffled by the silence of Subhash Nagare. Perhaps, you need to bring the blinds at the factory and work on a single homemade product. Otherwise, your products would remain products, to use and to throw away, not treasure. And movie fans like me, for whom there are no hits and flops, just good cinema, would prefer to choose a movie without Factory finish, every Saturday.
