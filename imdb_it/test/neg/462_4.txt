The filmmakers apparently had enough money to be able to offer decent makeup effects, but not enough for a creature that moved and attacked convincingly. We never have the chance to see the "monster" move from one place to another - whenever this happens (presumably), the camera focuses on the "terrified" reactions of nearby humans. And when a man is attacked by it, he simply seems to hold an inanimate object against himself so that it does not fall to the ground. This is still not the worst "Alien" scam (the two "Xtro" films are even worse, for example); actually it's fun enough if you have 68 (!!) minutes in advance. (* 1/2)
