I'm a fan of slasher movies, especially Scream 1-3, but this is just one who kills after another. To my great astonishment: the second part is far better and the whole story of the first part is summed up! So don't waste your time on this and go straight to Part II, you won't regret it because Part 2 actually has a PLOT and it's pretty self-deprecating. First part: 1 of 10 Second part: 4 of 10
