If you really want to experience the magic (?) Of Don Dohler, check "Alien Factor" or maybe "Fiend", but not this one. Alien Factor is actually quite imaginative considering the low budget and it's quite disturbing, but "Nightbeast", which I imagine is a sort of Alien Factor update, is simply stupid. Actors crossing the sleep scene through their roles, in particular the sheriff of Monotone, and the monster is a kind of stupid Halloween mask instead of the wildly imaginative (but rather stupid) looking creatures of Alien Factor. A spaceship crashes into the Earth and there is a creature inside, of course, that runs around to vaporize people. And tear off your arms, etc. And he has a ray gun he uses to vaporize people, too, until he is shot from the hand. And this is really about it. "Alien Factor" claps his hands on this mess, if you really want to see a good Don Dohler movie, check instead. And RIP Don Dohler, 12/2/06.
