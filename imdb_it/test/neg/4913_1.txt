Aksar is a terrible film. The script, the story, the acting are all simply ridiculous. Dino Morea plays a man who pays Emraan Hashmi to seduce his wife. Yes, it's as ridiculous as it sounds. Both Morea and Hashmi offer bad acting incredibly and without surprises. Udita Goswami plays the aggressive, capricious and angry wife. He is handsome but has zero acting talent. The film has a hit song called "Jhalak Diklaja" which is composed and sung by Himesh Reshammiya. I have never been able to understand the exaggeration of this song as I have never found it particularly valid even if it is appealing. The film should be a thriller, but it just looks like a comic book thanks to the terrible direction and writing. Avoid this cheapo at any cost.
