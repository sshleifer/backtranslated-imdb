The remake of the 1942 film "The Major and the Minor" reversal of roles sees Jerry Lewis enter the part originally played by Ginger Rogers, but unfortunately this anemic release lacks much more than Ginger. Lewis tries to pass for a child when he gets on a train; is successful, but the deception leads to a series of comic and romantic confusions. Sidney Sheldon adapted the script, launching musical moments for Dean Martin (playing another in his second banana stable) and a jewelry robbery subplot (which is terrible). Diana Lynn, who played the crafty teenager in the original film, plays Lewis's love interest here. She is cute; Jerry no. * 1/2 from ****
