Daniel Auteuil's Bruno in Petites Couperes is a middle-aged model of his Pierre in The separation of Christian Vincent from 10 years ago. In both films, youthful trust in leftist ideology and love (reciprocal metaphors) crumbles into paranoia - manifesting itself as an aggression trapped in Pierre and a hopelessly comic femininity in the more recent Bruno. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for the fans of Auteuil, the actor has become addicted to a weariness of the uniform world (not unlike his compatriot Johnny Hallyday in the recent L'Homme du Train in Leconte). Acting is not, and it becomes quite frustrating as the movie progresses. Pascal Bonitzer does not help as a writer / director of the project. His sequencing of episodes superimposed on connection symbolism fails to mask the lack of rhythm of the film. I was particularly furious that the imposing and romantic backdrops of Grenoble were rendered virtually unnecessary by a cameraman who was clearly trembling in the cold. <br /> <br /> Krisitn Scott Thomas almost saves the show with his female counterpart of Bruno, Beatrice. She dramatizes the dizzying contradictions intended as Bruno in a character of increasing complexity to the point of becoming surreal. Bonitzer cannot support this, and the flagrant plot asks Beatrice to tie another bourgeois mannequin. Thus, Bonitzer's performances then deny Scott Thomas the Oscar cabinet. <br /> <br /> The immersion of all the characters in the bourgeoisie could be a feasible and truly tragic result, but in this case it is a cop-out of a cadence (unlike the brutal, painful epilogue of La Separation) . A real disappointment, 4/10.
