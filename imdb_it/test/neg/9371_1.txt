Tru Calling was good but could have been fantastic. The concept was intriguing and allowed for seriously weird and scary stories that could be explored in the future. Unfortunately the writing and an actor leave the show down. <br /> <br /> The writing was not bad but there were holes. In episode 13, "Drop Dead Gorgeous", an incredibly toxic poison would have been used to kill the victim. This was so toxic and killed so quickly that the victim didn't have time to run or scream for help. Yet there was no plausible explanation as to how the killer got such powerful poison. <br /> <br /> In episode 15, "The Getaway", the off-duty cop responded unrealistically. In the second scene of the diner he (meekly) tells the thief to drop the gun and when he doesn't follow the order, and actually turns the gun in his direction, allows him to turn into a stall and then degenerate into a hostage situation ?? the situation in which he was warned. His answer would have been (would) have been to shoot the thief when she had failed to follow his order and turned the gun on him. There are other flaws in the stories, but I'll leave it with these two examples. Despite the writing defects, I liked the show. The other problem I had was that I could not accept Eliza Dushku in this role. In my opinion it is too inexperienced and light to carry this part. He never walked anywhere, he marched; and too often he stopped abruptly. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, there was no real emotional expression or facial expression. Either he has a pensive look or a cute smile; rarely are other apparent emotions. When he tries to appear dramatic, he begins his line by looking away and "then" turns his eyes to his fellow actor. Or alternatively, he begins his line by looking at his opposite and then looks away. Both are annoying if done as a substitute for real emotions. An example of his lack of intonation is in episode 20, "Two marriages and a funeral", during his second wedding speech he is emotionless (eg hearts in our hearts). <br /> <br /> I liked all the other actors in their respective parts and they were all believable. With improved writing and a change of driving, Tru Calling could have done it.
