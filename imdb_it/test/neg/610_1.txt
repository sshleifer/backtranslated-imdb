This show uses a rather tired sitcom formula of the fat blue collar slob idiot with the beautiful (and sometimes with shrewish appearance) wife and crazy mother-in-law. With this show, it's the smoky comedian Kevin James as Doug Hefferman who works as a delivery person for a parcel service. He has a beautiful wife, Carrie (Leah Remini), who works as a legal assistant, and senile father-in-law, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in his daughter's and son-in-law's cellar. Kevin Doug's Kevin Doug is a typical sports drinker who watches television from a sitcom husband who prefers to watch the tube rather than take care of his marital problems. He also has a couple of idiotic friends who lend further stupidity to the problems faced by the couple in this show. Beyond the few laughs provided by the crazy character of Jerry Stiller, this show was generally not funny. Kevin James' idiotic behavior usually caused the show's problems, which were usually solved by his wife. This show continued a series of sitcoms with the stupid fat father / husband and their beautiful wives who seemed to work on ABC for some reason.
