this is the worst movie in the world. the only reason I gave a 2 was because the first 10 minutes were hysterically funny in a "is this for real?" somehow. it was so poor and inexpensive ... they shouldn't have even bothered. there was nakedness and violence for the pure taste of having nudity and violence, and the effects were so bad that they could not believe it (think of ketchup as blood and cabbage for severed heads). don't rent this !!
