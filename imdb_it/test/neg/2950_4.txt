1st seen 2/18/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Leon Leonard): Fair adventure movie based on a novel by the author of the famous Moby Dick, Herman Melville. This film is about the captain of a ship that had stolen his eyes (which were extremely rare black pearls) from God's sculpture of a native tribe and hid them somewhere that only he knew before leaving the island of Tivi. He became very ill and was traveling in secret to return to the island to retrieve the pearls for himself while the others (like his daughter) thought he would return to being treated by the local doctor. Others did not know the reason for the trip. A clandestine really knew the real reason for the trip: to return their eyes to their God. The foolish part is that the pearls were hidden very close to the statue and all this time the natives directed their tribe without their God having eyes (causing them all kinds of problems). Along the way, we are treated (for some reason) in a short submarine show with an electric eel fighting a local octopus (I only imagine that Herman Melville knows what it was). Once arrived on the island, the captain dies, but passes the fate of the pearls to his daughter, but also receives the curse of illness. One of the villains finds out where the god is housed and convinces his daughter to go there and steal the pearls, but at this point the good guys find out what's going on and a fight ensues. I won't tell you the results of the fight or the finale, I'll let you find out if you want. As I said before, the film was OK, but some very silly things I have already mentioned have diminished its impact. I wonder if that new "Pirates of the Caribbean" took part of the plot from this --- hmm ?? black pearls, a curse (I wonder ??) Well, it does not matter, those elements were not a good movie in this case or the other. They seem to learn that they are a lesson, but with the money coming in on that new movie I'm sure they won't. Oh good.
