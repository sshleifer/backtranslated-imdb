It is sad that they are letting themselves enter film festivals these days. I had to sit for over twenty minutes of this sad short which was not at all funny to have a good place for a feature film I wanted to see at a local film festival. The festival planners have combined this horrible short with great functionality. I'm glad the function went well, otherwise I wouldn't have been a very happy camper! <br /> <br /> For a short comedy short, he didn't laugh. The title says it all.
