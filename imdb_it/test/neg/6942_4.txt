Marlene Dietrich is as magnificent as Concha Perez, the temptress who drives all men to despair in "The Devil is a Woman" by Josef Von Sternberg. His interpretation has nothing to do with "acting" in the conventional sense but is incandescent, a true star in full respect of his material. But she's the only good thing about the movie, (she's so good at keeping you in this slag, I doubt any other actress could have done the same). <br /> <br /> The story is a terribly lugubrious melodrama, (surely the novel by Pierre Louys was better), in which Dietrich's amoral Concha ruins the lives of two friends played by Lionel Atwill and Cesar Romero with a rigidity to limit of petrification. And for Von Sternberg it is a bad film, (perhaps in line with his rather ugly arguments). Bunuel, on the other hand, has thought enough of it to do it again as "that obscure object of desire" with a greater emphasis on the surrealist aspects of it all, to the point of founding two different actresses in the same role. Neither film is the director's best time and while Bunuel's version could be the best film, it is Dietrich's "performance" that you remember.
