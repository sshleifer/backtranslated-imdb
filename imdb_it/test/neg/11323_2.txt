Trite and tiring, the head shots almost made me cry. My 4 year old left the room and ended up doing a puzzle. I don't know for which age group this was written, but the writer himself didn't even want to believe it. As for the song, it's slightly funny. At least it was a decade ago. There are many Christmas movies to watch. Even though I've seen them many times, they're still fun. Every time it happens, I try to encourage my child to look at something else. A positive note, which allowed a vote of 2 instead of 1, is that it encourages good moral values. It would have been encouraging if someone were watching him.
