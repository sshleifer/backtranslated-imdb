I should start by saying that I have something of a love-hate relationship with musicals. Some of them are fantastic, some are disgusting. So I expected the hair to fall into one of those categories. However, it did not happen, falling instead in the middle. <br /> <br /> The songs are not brilliant, although the song "Sodomy" made me smile a lot, and everything is rather dated. But the film didn't attract me like others, like Rocky Horror. Although this is a bad example, since I hated Rocky Horror for years, I suddenly understood it and loved it since then. Maybe Hair will be the same. Although I doubt he will get more visibility than Rocky Horror because of the language and the nudity content, so I doubt I will have the chance to make it grow on me. Gettit? Hair ... grow ... oh, adapt. <br /> <br /> However, I couldn't see the last fifteen minutes or so due to a technical problem, which was a shame, as I enjoyed seeing how it ended, especially after reading some reviews here. <br /> <br /> It is not a film for those who love cinema, but certainly for music lovers. I really hope they can't do it again, since I think such a reproduction would end up with a shallow PC version of the original. <br /> <br /> It is worth taking a look at lovers of the genre.
