Before talking about my piece, I would like to clarify some things: 1) I am a girl who does not like detective films ("Kate & Leopold" and "Someone Like You" are EXTREME exceptions - Hugh Jackman's ass). 2) I chose this just because I'm a Fichtner fan who couldn't wait to see him in a bathtub. 3) I'm not a fan of Demi, although I think his performances in "Immortal" and "A Few Good Men" have been sublime and have earned places in my video library - I also think it's a bit crazy (it is not possible that he is NOT yet w / Brucie). <br /> <br /> If this is a character study of an unfinished woman who lives a double life of independence and happiness, then I would say that we have a narcoleptic melodrama. Marty: literary agent. He makes a 6-digit salary. He lives in a Manhattan luxury penthouse. It is easy for her to read several hundred manuscripts and fall asleep at her desk for a highly recommended nightly escape. Or maybe crossing an interdiemsional portal? He has a career, a look, a beautiful car, a big pad, now where are the man and the children? Walk our boy Aaron - a real escape. What are architects? They are artists who know how to do mathematics, dreamers who make real money. Aaron gives Marty the dream of security and fills a void where she obviously does not trust herself. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the coin, there is Marie, who still lives her student fantasies while she gets confused with motherhood. His children are his career and his life. But what about Marie, does she exist only through her children? In waltz William, a Parisian stranger who helps her focus on the only thing she has lost contact with: herself. <br /> <br /> An alleged journey of self-discovery and into old age, thrown in part with anguish and some resentment towards Marty's mother. This gets a 3/10. All I could say is thank God for the BPL multimedia division, I would not waste my $ 2.99 at Blockbuster on this, put it towards a Harlequin Blaze title.
