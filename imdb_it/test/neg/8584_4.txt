Predictable, clich√©, incredible, boring ... what else can I say? It's just the caliber of the cast that saves any salvific qualities of this bloated mess. Oh yes, and the amusing antics of the final area. <br /> <br /> But wait for the eleven o'clock, because the result is as predictable as who will win the Globetrotters / Washington Generals match. <Br /> <br /> I had a great time in the second act before realizing that these had to be the PRO teams we were looking at (all dressed in vintage brown padres). And the imitation of the character of Cameron Diaz in Georgia Frontiers was ill-conceived on the page. (Isn't it your fault, Cameron, would you like to go to dinner?) <br /> <br /> Enough of this - I'm just in fashion because I couldn't wait to see this movie. Rent the YONG LONGEST instead. <br /> <br />
