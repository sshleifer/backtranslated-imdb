I live and work in Lexington, Kentucky, the city where Zombie Planet was filmed. I had heard about the film forever, from various people who claimed to be a critical part of the production. Then, for several years, I heard absolutely nothing. Imagine my surprise when I found him sitting alone at the local video store, just for a rent. So, being the cinephile I am, I decided to give local filmmakers a chance. <br /> <br /> Bad idea. <br /> <br /> Zombie Planet is a film too long, boring, poorly performed, miserably - and this is just the good stuff. I did my best to enjoy it, which included removing my brain and setting it on the table so as not to interfere with the horrible plot. Alas, nothing worked. Zombie Planet is so ugly that it's pathetic. And the idea that they are planning a sequel leads me to believe that the director and his henchmen have not listened to any of the criticisms that I am sure they have heard. Let's go guys. Please. In fact, refrain from making films together. Or take part in a few lessons on rhythm, storytelling and, well, basic direction. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, for the love of God, hang it.
