This is a rip-off of already lousy Hollywood movies like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. The story is classic, some high school students are looking for a joke on the class's misfit of the class, but something goes wrong. Terribly wrong. When you watch the movie, you know what will happen before it happens all the time, it's not good if a movie tries to scare you. The actors are ok and the girls are nice (they're Asian after all) so I'll give them two out of five at the mojave'o'meter.
