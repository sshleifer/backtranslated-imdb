this 2.5 hour diluted snore-fest seems to be one of the poorest excuses for adaptation, ever. clearly in possession of a budget that allows breathtaking shooting in Greece, the money could have been better spent elaborating a cohesive script with character development and clearly delineated motivations; especially since the account has gone through the problem of doing so already. the portraits lacked passion and direction, leaving the viewer to discuss whether they should take the trouble to worry about the disappearance of the protagonists. which brings out another point: the main character of the original, prosperous work is not so called in this representation, despite the fact that the names of many other characters are used. even the spell and magic are markedly absent from this particular piece. in fact, all the aspects that have made the theatrical version of the "storm" full of wonder and intrigue have been completely sucked in by this twisted version of an imposing and pompous donkey who cannot understand how to worry about something beyond the blur of his wealth and power. on everything, a lackluster effort and a brutally poor imitation of the expected inspiration.
