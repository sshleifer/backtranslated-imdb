There are so many things wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges strange accent. <br /> <br /> Rita's ability to decipher the password code <br /> <br /> The entire script <br /> <br /> The ending - esp the last scene where two coffees they are brought to the table for Jeff and Rita and the publisher. J & R laugh and say "We don't drink coffee anymore". Well, why did they order it then ??? Obviously they did. If they didn't and the waiter brought a coffee to everyone by default there would be three coffees. <br /> <br /> Total Tosh.
