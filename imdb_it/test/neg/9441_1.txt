This film has absolutely no redemptions. It's not even worthy of being in the "so bad it's good" category - it's simply bad. Movie poorly interpreted, badly shot, badly written, badly directed, and the whole thing is just incredibly amateur. Rather, this exit is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Oh, and some might PLEASE tell the lead actress that if you're playing "crazy" that doesn't mean you have to fiddle with your hair all the time - in a film that was generally annoying, this it was probably one of the most irritating things of all. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, I think this is the only film ever to present a Nazi carjacker ...
