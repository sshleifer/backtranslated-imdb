I'm not sure this is a comedy or not, but I found it quite comical. Isobel is possessed by the devil. Somehow a perverted priest and the gardener are about to fix it. In part exorcism and in part soap operas, you will have at least some laughter. There is the paranoid jealous dad, the satanic sister, the mother of Valley of the Dolls and then the cowboy boyfriend; all there to help the skirt that chases the priest to fight the demons of dear Isobel. Sometimes it seemed like a Jerry Springer episode, but I actually paid to see this. Instead of the cold twisting of the head, the cursed sailor and the crucifix that Regan did in The Exorcist; you have a sack of Isobel bouncing on her bed as if it were a trampoline, hidden in her closet, and jumping off a barn. Yes, it's Chuck E. Cheese gone mad. So if you want to see a quote from an unmistakable horror movie that is worth a laugh while you wait for the predictable ending ... this is your movie.
