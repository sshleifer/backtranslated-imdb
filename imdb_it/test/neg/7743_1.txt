And the title says it all: a poor sounding title that is a cheesy-sounding joke of a movie known as "Alien from L.A." Why not simply call it "Alien of South Africa", since this is where this film was shot? My tips for watching movies that have been published in "Mystery Science Theater 3000:" don't look at the original version of the movie at all! Period! Always watch the film with the shadow of the theater at the bottom of the screen, with a man trapped in space with his two witty and wise robotic friends, sitting in the lower right corner of the screen. It looks better this way. <br /> <br /> The film was originally seen: terrible! Movies as seen on MST3K: Genius!
