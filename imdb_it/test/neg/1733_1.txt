Honestly, the only reason I took this blockbuster movie was because there was Aaron Carter. Ok, the first thing is the first one. Did you notice how bad Aaron Carter has become? I mean, he was so cute but now ... with that lanky body and stained skin - EW. I think he should continue to sing and the film's directors may have found a much nicer guy who could synchronize with his lips. No offense though. I thought this teen movie was badly lame - and this one comes from me, being a teenager myself. The "bad girls" are so predictable, the acting is so amateurish that it makes you shiver sometimes (especially from Aaron) and overall I didn't like it. Although, I gave points for the plot - it was fine, but not entirely realistic. However, stay away from this movie by all possible means unless you happen to have a wad of cash and you have absolutely nothing better to do with 94 minutes of your time. Not worth $ 6.50 !! <br /> <br /> (P.S: this review may not apply to children under the age of 13!)
