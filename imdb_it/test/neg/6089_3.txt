"Three" is a seriously stupid shipwreck film. Masked as a psychological thriller, the closest relative is the monumentally superior "Dead Calm" (also with Billy Zane). "Dead Calm" provided well-designed characters to root in the form of Sam Neil and mourning parents of Nicole Kidman who try to redefine their relationship on an ocean cruise. They end up being terrified by the drifting psychotherapist from Zane. It provided an acute, ever more acute suspense, a frightening sense of claustrophobia in the open sea as the game of cat and mouse of life and death unfolded. <br /> <br /> "Three" suffers from a poorly designed characterization (the public does not care about what happens to any of them), a stupid and useless plot of voodoo plot, a total lack of suspense or excitement and some hammer and hammer performances of the main actors. In particular, Zane goes beyond the lines in an irritating manner. In "Dead Calm" he was threatening, wired and boiling with barely controlled sexual violence. Here it is bombastic, petulant slimy and unmade. And where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of cigarettes and dry cigars? And how come your lighter stays full of juice for over a year? Mrs. Brook is very picturesque, incredibly pretty, but both the chest and the rear seem to have been excessively inflated by a sort of raft pump. However, they manage to behave with more skill and conviction than the rest of her. Dramatic actress, in the purest sense of the term, is not. The guy who played Manuel, the third member of this sad triangle, had been replaced by a lump of wood - no one would have noticed. In fact, judging by its total lack of ability to communicate dialogue in any significant or dynamic way, driftwood represents a potential improvement in casting episodes (excuses). <br /> <br /> Positives: the scenery is beautiful and the cinematography (above and below the water) is credible. <br /> <br /> I imagine that he had a very limited theatrical release (if any) or he went directly to the rental and retail DVD. The reason for this is that it is not very good. If you want something decent following these lines, take "Dead Calm". It was created by people who knew something about cinema.
