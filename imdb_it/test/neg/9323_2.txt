I have nothing against Paul Schrader. In fact, HARDCORE (1979) is one of my favorite films. But some horror fans suffered a premature uproar when their original version of the EXORCIST prequel (DOMINION, this one you're reading right now, apparently) was demolished by Warners, and when Renny Harlin was replaced by things of spruce and make a new version that was "scarier". In my opinion, some viewers were prejudiced and automatically ridiculed for hating Renny Harlin's interpretation on the subject (EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING) before the first frame of the film had ever been unresolved to be judged. And I should know; because I myself went to the theater premiere of START with stubborn arms bent, and prepared for the absolute worst, which I surely had to come. Imagine my surprise when I found the START of Harlin to be much more serious than I could ever conceive, with a good interpretation of Stellan Skarsgard as a young version of Father Merrin, who was struggling with his faith in God. It was not a great film, but it wasn't even close to the garbage I had prepared myself, well in advance, for an invisible sight. <br /> <br /> Well, now I've finally seen the real garbage version - and it's Paul Schrader's DOMAIN: PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST. He was inexorably talky, uninteresting and tasteless. Stellan Skarsgard's tormented priest was nowhere near as interesting as it had been for me in the Harlin movie, and the actor himself wasn't that good at it. For all those who have indicated the obvious CGI effects in START, guess what? I'm also here in DOMINION. Do you remember the dull end in Harlin's surrender (which I will also agree on the rest of that film)? Well, you'll find that this Schrader ending isn't much less lame. <br /> <br /> Let me also say that it offends me the nonsense that was presented by those who appreciate this film better than Harlin's, saying that we are "retarded" or "we cannot appreciate the subtle film production". As a person who despises Stephen Sommers' 'MTV' MUMMY of '99, and being a true fan of very suggestive and discreet horror films of the 30s and 40s, I can assure you that this is not my case. At least there was "a little" of exorcist terror and executions in the beginning of Harlin; this is just a real exercise of boredom and a great challenge even for the most certified sleepless. It will be very interesting to hear that horror fans try to convince themselves that DOMINION: PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST is as good as if they had already decided to do it in advance; just as they were already willing to lambasting the BEGINNING of Harlin, the second in which they learned that the name of Paul Schrader was getting impregnated with White-Out.
