Ok, the only reason I watched this movie is because Krista Allen is in it. Since I admit I have looked at the days of our life ... I know her as Billie. Oh sure, maybe there will be a reason to watch this movie .. that would be the soft porn area. They seem to exalt in this. And little else. I hope that anyone who rents / buys this film has only rented it for the sex scene. Because if they bought / rent it for something else, we say quality TV, they could die of a heart attack. This film involves little imagination. While I have a good laugh at his stupidity, and maybe I'll buy it myself, I'm just a fool. Rent before buying on this. 2 out of 10. (note that I still have to give a 1-star movie, the sensual scene alone has given itself and up to 1. if they didn't have a scale 1 in the pot and I want a refund if it didn't have t.
