Abderrahmane Sissako may have known what he was doing when he did "Bamako", but the rest of us can simply sit in mystification and confusion trying to figure out what the purpose might have been. <br /> <br /> The "plot" face value involves a young African singer who is planning to leave his unemployed husband to find work in the city. But much more than the screen is dedicated to what the film's advertisers describe as "a fake trial against the main financial institutions" that deals with "Africa's enormous economic difficulties". All in all it's okay, I suppose, but when the arguments and ideas are presented in such a dramatic and pedantic way as they are here, they lose strength and impact. In other words, if the director had found the means to actually incorporate issues such as the damaging effect of colonialism on the African people and the problem of African debt into something that even remotely resembled a compelling storyline, the film could have reached the intellectual level and emotional resonance is now so clearly missing. <br /> <br /> The topics covered by the film can be relevant and important, but trying to pass off what amounts to two hours worth the word of a true, honest God to the film is not able to gather much of the public for their message.
