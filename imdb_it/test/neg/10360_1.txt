Yes, I admire the independent spirit of all this, but it's like a Road Trip with a bad cast and no budget. <br /> <br /> I enjoy it when I watch American comedies, they don't laugh. This film made me laugh, but only because of the patently obvious attempts to simulate high-budget high school American pot-flicks. <br /> <br /> If you want a good independent American comedy with pot-reference, go see Kevin Smith or Richard Linklater film or something. Don't waste your time with this piece of film. <br /> <br /> I mean, how can you take these comments seriously when most people complain about characters who don't smoke the pot! <br /> <br /> And by the way: in Norway it's called "Dude, Where's My Pot"!
