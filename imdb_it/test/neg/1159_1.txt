Ed Gein, one of the most famous serial killers of all time, was the inspiration for famous movie killers like Norman Bates, Leatherface and Buffalo Bill. He is also one of the most sick and disturbing killers of all time, I saw a documentary about him, so I know his story quite well. When I saw it, I was curious because I thought it was like a documentary re-enactment, but I must say that this was just a pathetic waste of time. First of all, the facts are completely wrong, with a few small exceptions, and secondly, this was just a stupid Hollywood story when these horrible murders really happened and they just turned into a cheap dollar. Not to mention that if they were going to turn it into a horror movie, this was misinterpreted! <br /> <br /> Ed Gein, lives in a small Wisconsin town called Plainfield, but has a little secret about the fact that the whole city was hit, dug dead bodies and brutally killed people. Bobby, a deputy, is on the case to get Ed Gein, alone, no one knows who the murderer is at first, only finding the crime scene after the crime scene. But things become "personal" when Ed starts messing with the family and friends of the cops. <br /> <br /> Obviously this film was just ridiculous and completely offensive to the real story. I always thought that bad acting is a necessary tool for a horror film, but for this story it should have been a better film, not to mention, it should have been more of a documentary than a stupid horror film about clich√©s. Please stay away from this movie, it's completely pathetic and false compared to Ed Gein's story. <br /> <br /> 1/10
