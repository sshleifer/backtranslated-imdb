If you watch the extra documentary, you will notice that the director is totally inexperienced and was actually a workmate of Quentin Tarantinos in a video store. Put two and two together and you realize that Quentin is doing a favor for his old bud, although the bud is rather lacking in talent. Was it so hard? Well, watch this movie and you will realize that it is not. Too slow at first, too foolish in the middle and too slow to finish. This sums up. Eric Stolz and Delpy were the only two to show a certain charisma. And Kemp actually did a good performance. But the rest was very bad. An example of stupidity of the plot was when "the lead thief" accidentally left his mask during the raid. So what happens? Well, the other thieves decide that they too can remove them too! What a beautiful thought. The violence was relentless and insane. But not in a "cool" way. Rather in a farcical way. I wondered if it would be a comedy. More crazy Tarantino to have his good name connected to this garbage. The more I frown on having looked at him.
