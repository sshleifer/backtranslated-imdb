I bought this film for a couple of dollars in a "Clearance Warehouse Salt" one day when I looked around. The cover was very beautiful (in color), but the film is B & W, (I wish they wouldn't try to trap us with colored covers on black and white films, but it's a common thing to keep an eye on!). <Br /> <br /> When I saw it I was pleasantly surprised. It turned out to be better than I expected. I was disappointed that it was a B & W, but the effects are pretty good, certainly better than, say, "Invaders from Mars" which has crappy effects, and it's nice to see John Banner in something else besides Hogan's Heroes. <Br /> <br /> Overall, this film is not bad for a class B rating, and certainly worth the two dollars from a nostalgic point of view. It's not my favorite science fiction, but neither is my worst. All right.
