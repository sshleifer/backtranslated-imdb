Brainy, cross-dressing little boy finds success in the Spelling Bee circuit despite an unconventional and dysfunctional education. Shirley MacLaine has directed and played the child's grandmother, and it's always fascinating to see longtime actors having the chance to direct a film, the material they are attracted to and the actors they choose to work with. Here, the only person well written in "Bruno" is MacLaine. The child actors seem to have been chosen for their glitter and their cuteness, and MacLaine, with a soft heart, holds their first plans for long atrociously long periods; nothing of these cherubs seems natural, not the lines that fall without consciousness out of their mouth or the interaction they have with adults or even each other. Like the boy's dissatisfied father, poor Gary Sinise hovers around the edges, in feigned shame, always with a pained expression. Towards the end of the film, MacLaine transforms everything into a series of enveloping scenes, and ends even with the boy who embraces the Pope in Rome! Another wicked treatise by a talented actress and director who, like Sally Field and her film "Beautiful", seems to be stopping to wink at the public. Shirley uses ethnicity for shtick and childhood innocence as a punch line. The children in this cast are rolling their eyes, making essays with mature comments, using grandiose words - but when a boy with a jealous mouth calls our small "gay" hero, MacLaine's grandmother orders him to go punch to the kid (in front of the media!). What is the progression like? * from ****
