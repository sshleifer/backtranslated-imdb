We chose it as part of a Brentwood set, under the title "The Broken Skull". Shot directly on the video, with a very different sound and quality of light, this film shows an overactive quality that can inspire the viewer with feelings of nervousness, confusion and irritability - and not in a good type of "Evil Dead". <br /> <br /> Without getting into the spoilers, what at the beginning seems a simple revenge, the ghost story becomes more and more complicated and bizarre. While there are some interesting ideas here, the general effect is likely to leave you scratching your head and saying "hunh?" <br /> <br /> This is a very, very gory film. The effects of gore range from blood-filled appliances to a silly Video Toaster effect that must be frozen to be (dis) believed. The "Fangoria" level of the gross effects of this film is truly amazing and probably should appeal to blood followers while making anyone with a weak constitution feel a little disgraced. <br /> <br /> The Broken Skull is also an extremely noisy film. It presents not only environmental noises (captured by microphones and not replaced in post), but there is a lot of screams. No, no, I mean a lot. Very very! The characters scream, howl, howl, howl and laugh maniacally. Turn down the volume if you consider your eardrums and your nerves! But you can't criticize the cast for their enthusiasm, they really eat the view and sometimes the effect is pretty funny. In particular, the actress who plays a certain Vietnamese immigrant offers all this with considerable enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> In fact, very few actors were made of wood. Some of them may have exaggerated a little (oh, just a little smidgen!), But most of them are certainly fun to watch. The cast is ethnically diverse and congratulations to filmmakers for this. The two middle-aged white women, however, are two of the most mischievous and exasperated characters since the shopkeeper of the classic MST3k "The Brute Man". Watch them watch all the other characters, it's fun! <br /> <br /> In closing, the Headcrusher may not become a horror icon on a par with Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers or Freddy Kruger (or even the Leprechaun), but we can certainly say this ... this was a movie .
