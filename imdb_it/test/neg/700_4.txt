Not the best of the Lone Star series, but it moves quickly with good performance. <br /> <br /> Introduced as "Singin 'Sandy" in the main title, John Wayne in the role of a "singer cowboy" is unsuccessful - you don't even see a close-up in the foreground while singing. 'The real singer is the son of the director, Bill Bradley, who warbles away playing like many famous singers of the day like Hutch or Joseph Wagstaff. <br /> <br /> The features of the film: Cecilia Parker (also in the serial "The Lost Jungle", "Tombstone Canyon", and as older sister Marian in the films of Andy Hardy) doing her best Katherine Hepburn-- " They really don't have to, they really aren't "; Al St. John, before he literally became "Fuzzy" by filling all the available time on the screen with his characteristic activity of scratching the hat, head and chin, grimacing and gesturing and graceless physical movements; George (pre-Gabby) Hayes as a pipe smoking father; and Forrest Taylor, a junior veterinarian of 395 films and TV series, who plays the oily villain with the bow tie and the cigar. <br /> <br /> Funny or strange moments: the great trick of Yakima Canutt "under the stagecoach"; the "gay" scene when Singin 'Sandy binds Bert and Elmer face to face, drags them to his horse and dumps them in Kincaid's office, where Kincaid says, "You're a nice pair of lovebirds!"; The ecstatic comment by Denton after an atrocious song and the guitar playing from "Sandy" - "Ummm. I could listen to him all night!"; Kincaid's answer, we will not go into this ", after a breeder said" You have the soul of a snake! "And of course the immortal pronounces," I made an offer to Denton he cannot refuse. "<br /> <br /> The movie's plot is saved by Sandy's intriguing Kincaid, and later by saying the three magic words in many of these films:" I'm from Washington. "FDR saved us from the Depression! ( Is this the reason why the bad guys are always either bankers or in real estate?) <br /> <br /> The shooting sequence is taken from Bradbury's previous film "Man from Hell's Edges" (1932). Lone Stars are special for their unique mix of interesting characters, the troupe of actors and stuntmen, and the rotation of clich√©s and repetitive stories and situations on the back. This is a bit low, spoiled by inappropriate and wrong -Used gimmick " Singing Cowboy ". I will give him a 4.
