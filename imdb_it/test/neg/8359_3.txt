There must have been a lot of basic information that was left out of the movie. In fact, in the film, the girl, Lizzy, didn't even seem depressed. She looked just like a girl who lost control when she finally arrived at college, mainly for drugs and alcohol. It seemed his problem, not mental illness. Sure, he had emotional problems because his father left and she barely saw him as a child, and his mother seemed a little off. But the way he treated Noah and Ruby was simply mean and I don't think it was caused by depression. It was very necessary, that he ran Rafe, but he was so thanks to his father. <br /> <br /> But I think the main reason this film has never made a film is that it doesn't quite happen with the plot and the story is not well written. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Honestly, I would recommend it only if you are interested in seeing Ricci's first nude scene. Otherwise, it's not very interesting.
