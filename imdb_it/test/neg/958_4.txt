This review contains a partial spoiler. <br /> <br /> Shallow, "D.O.A." at least it starts as if it were a chat, a funny part of absurdity like Fincher's "Game". The central character (Dennis Quaid) suffers from a nightmare sequence of events that seem to create a twisted and cunning thriller. But the plot proceeds at too great a pace, leading to a dramatic turning point not in the middle, when the character discovers that he has been poisoned and has only 1-2 days to live. And this is simply too big a turn to add to a story. Once this has happened, the only chance of success of the film is if it treats the psychology of someone in this situation as its principal, indeed, it is the only argument: but 'D.O.A.' it continues as if it were just a normal revelation like any other you could usually encounter in a thriller. The problem is twofold: firstly, Quaid's actions do not convince what someone's situation might be; and secondly, even if they have convinced, it is difficult to worry about what will happen when the most significant point of the plot has already been solved prematurely. The rest of the film is a fairly standard rate for a film of this type, but made more boring than usual by the slightly treated situation of the character, which logically dominates the events in which the film is interested. Dennis Quaid, in the lead role, does not convince him either as a burned professor or as a man who is destined to die: Meg Ryan is, as often, ditzy and annoying. Another negative feature is the ugly soundtrack of the 80s. Watch 'The Game' instead, which from similar roots remains tight and guided by the characters, while 'D.O.A.' goes adrift in developments that only undermine its own premise. Given that the premise is in itself rather intriguing, it is a pity to see it drowning in a surplus of over-cooked plot.
