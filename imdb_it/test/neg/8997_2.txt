After reading the mostly heated comments of this film, I decided to rent it despite some suspicions of TV movies. I should have followed my instincts. <br /> <br /> I tried so hard to warm up at the cinema and find the credit, but I couldn't. History never involves you or sounds real and acting is at its best and at its worst reserve. Everything in this production is amateur. <br /> <br /> Always a joy to watch, Mary McDonnell may be the only performer to escape this disaster without harming her career or reputation. I won't even bother checking the protagonist's name - hopefully he'll go back to advertising. <br /> <br /> Even poor Vanessa Redgrave, whom I adore and respect, seemed to channel Katherine Hepburn for as long as she appeared to be really drugged at home. Maybe he needed money. <br /> <br /> If I can save a person from losing 100 minutes in this tripe, I will feel confirmed.
