Now, I loved "Lethal Weapon" and "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", but I can't believe that Shane Black wrote this pile ... or that there are David Morse and John C. McGinley. I projected it for a film festival. Terrible. Everyone was laughing. It's a sermon and a heavy hand ... not to say stupid. Furthermore, it is as surprising as the small L.A. look like Cambodia. The whole idea of ​​time going through post-traumatic stress disorder is pretty stupid. Imagine "Born on the Fourth of July" mixed with "The Butterfly Effect 2" (I used to sequel as an example to really show how ugly this film is) but directed by Michael Bay's second unit director. So bad. The 2 stars are purely based on production value.
