once again this type of digital-video trash zero-budget cam. and again I fell into this trap because the title contained "zombi" (German title: ATTACK ZOMBIE!) the story: on Halloween some people visit the "museum of the dead", it's a trap, a crazy doctor wants to kill people, all connected to some Aztec cult. then they fight against some zombies in there. <br /> <br /> ultra-economical scenario: some corridors with black tape on it. some amateur drawings and some skulls as you can find them in every entertainment store. no actors, only low-level models who wake up with absolutely no idea what to do. no effect. make-up ridiculous, your local zombie make-up fan will do it better, sometimes it seems they don't have enough money to get enough color, otherwise they couldn't do it this way, man, they have to make their appearance " "zombies. some martial-arts fights fight with zombies in slow motion. simply, when the director wants to scare him, he uses a standard digital video-cam effect in which everything is floating. Incredible! 0 out of 10!
