The original WASC is absolutely not to be seen in the genre. In fact, if it weren't for his first 25 chilling minutes, there would be no logical reason to watch it. The remake takes those 25 minutes and turns them into a mediocre 85-minute horror movie. <br /> <br /> Now, I have nothing against the PG-13 Horror movies, but the trend around them is getting lame. When you see the PG-13 vote you expect a movie full of fake scares, teen t.v. or music stars, and a plot that has been used several times. Don't even ask for blood or violence. <br /> <br /> I know it is not correct to compare both the original WASC and the remake, but I think it is necessary to do this because the whole idea of ​​the new one is based on the beginning of the original. The tension that is felt through the first film is not present in any way in the remake. Not even with the surprising settings or the great use of lightning. No tension, suspense, chills ... nothing. The film becomes too slow before it becomes a bit "interesting", and that's when the stranger appears. The tracking sequence is probably the best part of the film because at least there is a feeling of "what will happen next?" But it is so. Situations preparing for the climax are predictable, boring and lacking in suspense. The original has the merit of having suspense in the most important scenes, and also, for a chilling climax for the most important scene in the film. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that this is a PG-13 horror movie but, if you pay compared to the original. Why change the most important situation? Children should not survive! After the finale I felt like this movie was useless. So the baby sitter played cat and mouse with a wacko ... is that it? So the sequence at the hospital was simply stupid. And worst of all, it means a sequel may be coming. <br /> <br /> Camila Belle is the best thing about the movie. It offers a nice and believable performance. He needs to choose better projects, even though this role will gain for his thousands of teenage fans. <br /> <br /> Please, don't watch this movie. Some say that to support the Horror genre we should support any movie that comes out. It is not necessary to agree. If we ignore films like WASC, the producers of horror films will understand that we will not accept CRAP. We want good horror movies, not flashy movies full of fake scares. <br /> <br /> Look at the original "When A Stranger Calls", instead, because the first 25 minutes are WAY BETTER compared to the complete (useless) remake.
