The plot of "Open Graves" is very simple: it is a board game called Mamba, in which players die in real life in the same way they die in the game. Death scenes include computer-generated killing with crabs and snakes. The characters are cardboard and deliberately annoying and there's not even a little suspense. I liked Eliza Dushku in "Wrong Turn", but she is completely wasted and not memorable here. The climax with the CGI witch from the sea is absolutely ridiculous and stupid. The only reason to see "Open Graves" are some interesting camera angles plus the sexy Eliza Dushku. If these films are the future of horror, then I give up seriously. Give me a low-budget horror movie from the 70s or 80s on this modern piece of crap. A generous 3 out of 10.
