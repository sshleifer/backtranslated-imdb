It is difficult to decide what to say about this. It is not totally, one hundred percent bad. Although the film-in-a-film is unspeakably bad, thought to be campy, but missing for a mile. I'm pretty sure this is intentional, though. Danny Aiello is perfectly adequate here, and more or less nails his pathetic character. Dyan Cannon was good at a small role. Clotilde Courau was as impressive as the last twenty-year-old girlfriend. And Linda Carlson had a brave topless scene that she did very well. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it is not totally negative, but I do not believe that this will accomplish its objectives. All in all, probably worth passing.
