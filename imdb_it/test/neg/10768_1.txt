The writers of this mini series should have been sentenced to the guillotine. They slaughtered a very funny story and squandered the talents of Richard E. Grant. The only thing the writers kept from the original books was the name. All the characters were totally altered and the story was not the same. I highly recommend looking at another version of Scarlet Pimpernel. Any other version is better than this.
