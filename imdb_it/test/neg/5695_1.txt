I did it halfway through, but I wasn't masochistic enough to see everything. The first half of the film had no dialogue! Almost everything was the voice on the comment to bring the story. The writer has forgotten that sometimes he is less and has tried to explain several millennia of detailed history in the voiceover. At the same time he forgot to make any character development. Most science fiction fans don't require huge amounts of character development, but it would be nice to know why the two main characters who survived the destruction of the space fleet ended up fighting each other. <br /> <br /> There are some positive things in the film. The soundtrack was well done. Some of the computer generated graphics are very good, but others were just mediocre.
