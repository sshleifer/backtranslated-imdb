I normally love Jackie Chan's movies, but this was terrible. There are only 2 or 3 combat scenes that are all normally normal more or less. The bad thing about this movie is that it focuses a lot on the chasing / running machine. Car chase is not so bad (though not as exciting as fighting), but car racing at the end is exceptionally boring. Basically it takes everything that makes a Jackie Chan movie a Jackie Chan movie and leaves out everything except Jackie Chan. Even the traditional outtakes eventually lack the usual humor. I suppose it was aggravated to some extent by the fact that I saw one of those horrible dubbed versions. I usually try to see the subtitled version ... I wish I could understand Chinese. <br /> <br /> I only saw a Jackie movie worse than this and that was one of his first forays into Hollywood movies that didn't go so well. <br /> <br /> Avoid unless you are curious or fond of motor sports.
