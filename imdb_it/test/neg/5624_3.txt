I've seen this movie 3 times. Mainly because I kept thinking as I watched, "Did I miss something here?" Is there any reason why this film was made? Was he trying to say something and I missed him? Well, after 3 views, I couldn't find an answer. I think the worst thing I can say about a movie is that it bores me and I didn't finish it. I have to admit that there is a lot of eye fun and fast paced and hip music to keep my attention all the way, but is that all it should be a movie? <br /> <br /> I am not against extreme violence, it is almost continuous, but there seems to be some sort of inspiration. Something that is highlighted by it. The word free comes to mind, but it's worse than somehow. In the first part of the film we are given ideas on the motivations of the characters. And yes, the 3 principles are very good in their roles. But the roles are absolutely incredible. So in the first part we learn about the characters, and in the second part most of them die and use the sadistic joy of killing others. This seems to be the whole movie. And the first part has nothing to do with the second. <br /> <br /> For example. How could a good intelligent guy like Zed agree to join a group of drug addicts and amateurs to do a job like this? It does not make sense. He is portrayed as intelligent, yet he goes on with this suicide mission. The fact that it survives is totally inconsistent with the rest of the hyper-real violence and chaos. So what are we looking at here a Hollywood love story with a happy ending or a super-real and super-violent bloodbath? I remember having the same reaction with two other films with which this director was involved: True Romance and Reservior Dogs. <br /> <br /> Useless Dreck!
