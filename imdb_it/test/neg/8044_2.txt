Poor political operator. Badly photographed, recited and directed. Every single scene is lit up, including those that were shot during the day. No matter what the location. In a major conference at the White House, there are no lights on and the only lighting available is a dark blue filtered through some windows. The firstborn of China leads a shocking telephone conversation in such intense chiaroscuro conditions that he should contemplate a bust of Homer in a painting by Rembrandt. Honest. It is as if he had a small reflector on his face and was otherwise in total darkness. Slow motion deaths are now mandatory in any ill-conceived film. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider and Maria Conchita Alonzo do their roles well, but Scheider is rarely on the screen. The other performances can be eliminated. There is a beautiful oriental woman with a short skirt who pulls a gun and she has just come out of a James Bond movie that suggests a childhood spent in Basset, Nebraska, and that she should have remained the model that probably started as . Anyone who plays the Secret Service agent who survived aboard the cruise ship was probably chosen for the part because he looked more like Johnny Depp, not because of any show of talent. The wicked Chinese, who represent both Taiwan and mainland China, hiss and smile as they threaten the heroes. <br /> <br /> The script is rather horrible, recycled from other top films. There are many shootings aboard the ship and virtually everyone ends up grinding. Two thirds of the way, the ship explodes in the series of fireballs provided. So the film is divided into two related parties. First part, another shooting, this time in a warehouse on the waterfront. The second part, an exchange between the vice president, now president in office, and the fat Chinese premiere, raised by both "Dr. Strangelove" and "Fail Safe". We launch our missiles involuntarily. They launch theirs in retaliation. We cannot convince them that our launch was accidental, even if we offer to help them destroy our missiles. There is even General George C. Scott / Walter Matthau who claims that their "neck" armory cannot match ours, so we should hit them with everything we have. More fireballs. <br /> <br /> The end comes not too soon.
