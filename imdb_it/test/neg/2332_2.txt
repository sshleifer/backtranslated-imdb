There is an inherent problem in commenting or reviewing a film like this. I remember feeling the same way after hating Dogma. If you don't like a movie that is weird and controversial like Mulholland Dr., you are seen as "I don't understand". Obviously for those who have already seen this film we know that the whole point is not. <br /> <br /> I have heard from various sources that the unique and pleasing aspect of this film is a dream - like the quality it has. In other words, the plot is not structured like other films. With the case of Mulholland Dr., it looks more like a blurred collage made by a third grade boy who procrastinated until the last second to realize his artistic project. It doesn't make sense, it's not expected, but I know it was originally a TV series. It looks like Lynch had a pile of unused movies and decided to crush it with some new stuff. You will notice that towards the end nudity, sex and vulgar language increase. All things that he would not have filmed for television. <br /> <br /> For a better film not told in a traditional and linear way, rent The Thin Red Line since 1998. This was a great film, it is not. br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of ten
