On paper this film has some ribs: a street boy who overcomes past trauma, reconstructs his life and succeeds when the world would have written it. Great things, everyone loves a happy ending. <br /> <br /> But in the theater there were some omissions that left the film dead inside. The dialogue was empty and uninteresting, the characters were almost comics in their lack of size and complexity, and why did everyone have to be gay? I have nothing against homosexual themes or characters in a film, but when it is used in this way it is not only offensive to homosexuals, it trivializes the lifestyle and weakens the film. If the story works without this cheap trick, it should have been cut. <br /> <br /> Each character seemed to come out of the same cookie cutter shape: Each had a major flaw and a minor flaw, each character is kind-hearted if they succeeded or not, and each had or had violent relationship with someone. <br /> <br /> The most annoying fact about the film is that they never let you get past the name "pip" comes from high expectations. They give it to you once and that should be enough. The story shares enough with the Dickens classic to make this clear. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the film is the story of the grandfather and the box he leaves for Pip and Pip, the main character, learns to grow from the lessons learned from the tape. In the end, with the lessons he learned, Pip confronts his dark past and films with his life.
