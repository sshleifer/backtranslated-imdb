And I could be generous. The vast majority of the film is made up of looped footage ... the shattering monster, two women exercising, the trembling monster again, a group of people in the pool, the trembling monster again, it's no worse for wear despite being injured ... get the picture I refrained from shouting "TURN WITH RIGHT" on several occasions. <br /> <br /> And it doesn't help that the footage they used was badly produced. The sound is disconcertingly out of sync with the image. And in the only scene in which they tried to get "art" with lighting and filming techniques, the lighting boy, who holds the torch that provides the only illumination of the scene, is clearly visible in the shot. <br /> <br /> My hope is that the production was the victim of a horrible disaster in which the original audio track and most of the footage were destroyed, but decided to release it anyway, cobbled together from the piano of the editing room, in memory of the heroic crew members who gave their lives trying to save the film * real * - the one with the interesting plot and dialogue. Unfortunately, there is no proof of this, and I am forced to conclude that, in the immortal words of Joel and the Bot, they did not care. <br /> <br />
