If I guess your "palabra", will you let me pass? - asks William Geld, a Tim Robbins who continues to behave as if they had told him a fantastic joke and was trying not to laugh. <br /> <br /> He is trying to reach a forbidden area. The woman who blocks him continues to blather: -Your "palabra" is Carrefour. <br /> <br /> - How did you know? - asks the woman, surprised. He answers, in the name of Wisdom: - I had heard when you were not talking. : / <br /> <br /> Yes, this defines the film. This precisely. It doesn't matter if Carrefour is a "road junction" in French, or if the future is coldly bureaucratic and mixes languages. Or if Samantha Morton has nothing, nothing Spanish (Maria Gonzalez is her name in the film) with her Irish, Scottish, whatever. <br /> <br /> It's boring and boring. If you believe there are more symbolisms, you will buy the most bizarre and disgusting love relationship ever, set in a future that could be in seven seconds. I can imagine the palabra of this film: it will be "painful".
