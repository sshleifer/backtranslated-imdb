This film baffled me. I couldn't make it. I thought you might miss something. I'm glad to see that many of you agree with me. This is not always the case (see my recent review by RE: Extinction). <br /> <br /> To further expose the flaws of this film would be a glorious waste of time ... so I'll do it. .. <br /> <br /> They're dressed like cowboys, but it's modern times, right? No? I do not understand ??? When I got the box, I thought, WESTERN ZOMBIE! COLD! Here's how it was presented. I haven't seen it yet. I hope they did a good job. <br /> <br /> YOU DON'T HAVE IT! They tried to create an iconic character that would generate a series. They didn't. <br /> <br /> They tried to create an undisputed Australian zombie film on the caliber (and perhaps on the coat tails) of the well-made "UNDEAD". They don't. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe they just wanted to create confusion, bumpy, movie salad mess that could eventually be changed to something watchable. YOU DON'T HAVE IT! This is the new number 2 on my Worst Zombie Movies Ever list. There are really only two so far, "DAY OF THE DEAD: CONTAGIUM" is the first (not to be confused with "DAY OF THE DEAD", which is one of my favorite zombie movies of all time). If you make a zombie movie (and I'm not a zombie filmmaker, I'm just a connoisseur) I'd make a good one. Flight of the Living Dead is a good example of the recent creation of decent zombies. FYI. <br /> <br /> If you are really lenient, you might think, well, they haven't at least thrown something in to make us feel like we didn't want our money back? Guess what ... they HAVE NOT DONE!
