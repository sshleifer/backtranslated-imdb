There are films that are so bad, they are good. Then there are films like Rest Stop that should never be made because they are simply terrible. <br /> <br /> Malicious actors, improbable characters, predictable plot and a seemingly supernatural touch that adds nothing to the story are all key failures. Some halved special effects are about the only thing worthy of note. <br /> <br /> I can't even write a storyline because all I really want to do here is not to waste time and money on this movie. Do yourself a favor and don't even worry about this movie. It is 1.5 hours of your life that you will never return. <br /> <br /> 1/10
