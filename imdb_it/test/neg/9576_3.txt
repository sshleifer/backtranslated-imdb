A deformed and aged female scientist kills a fellow scientist to steal formulas to rejuvenate cells and reverse the aging process. He takes it and turns into the beautiful and evil Satanik (Magda Konopka) who goes around, seducing and killing rich businessmen. <br /> <br /> She dresses very elegantly in the mod dresses of the late 60s and manipulates those around her, looking very similar to the late Marisa Mell of the film DIABOLIK. Coincidence ?? <br /> <br /> However, despite all this, he is amateur and sloppy without the James Bond pop-art gadgets that DIABOLIK had had. Even the film locations of Madrid and Lake Geneva do not compensate for this. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is by Manuel Parada and Roberto Pregadio and is not bad at all, consisting of a lush orchestration with some fuzz guitar used as an embellishment. Perfect for one of those Loungecore European CDs released in the 90s. <br /> <br /> Even the Retromedia DVD uses a poor grainy color print that is in poor condition, with an explanation at the beginning saying that this was due to the film era. Taurus! They didn't even bother to look for a better source or couldn't find one. There are only a few photos of Magda and that's it. <br /> <br /> Slick and poor around, this takes a 3 out of 10.
