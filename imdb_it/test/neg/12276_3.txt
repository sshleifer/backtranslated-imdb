Slight spoilers below. <br /> <br /> The prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when TFW was filmed. From the initial scene of European refugees to the final prediction that Nazism will be the death of millions of Germans, this film is as much a propaganda film as the films made after Pearl Harbor. There is not much value for entertainment here, although the video of the powder bowl is interesting for those of us who are not old enough to remember it. The rest of the plot is rather forgettable with the Herr Docktor Coburn - with a rather bad accent - and the daughter who is assimilating to America with Wayne's help. In addition to the powder bowl scenes, the only memorable aspect of the film is one of the best seen in hindsight. Coburn's speech comparing Nazism to a neoplasm worse than cancer and describing (current) successes as a momentary burst of energy from a patient just before death was strangely accurate and Dr. Scherer from Varno played accurately for footage of newsreels of Nazi unrepentants who justified their actions. <br /> <br /> When viewed from a historical perspective, some aspects of TFW are interesting. If you look at it for entertainment outside of the WWII perspective, you should say that this is one of Wayne's less successful efforts.
