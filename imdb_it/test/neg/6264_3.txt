The sequel to Slasher (fourth feature in SLUMBER PART MASSACRE) concerns a group of maiden cheerleaders stuck in a mountain hut in the snow, which were thrown by a derelict killer. Typical slasher elements for hardcore slasher fans, gore, wonderfully free female nudity, no plot. Even if in the end it is exhausted, even if of short duration. <br /> <br /> The original star Brinke Stevens makes a cameo, which seems to be there just to include it in the film.
