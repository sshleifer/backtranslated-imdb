But certainly a serious contender for one of the worst 10 of all time. <br /> <br /> I got this cheap DVD, with Sandra Bullock as headliner on the case. This is a false advertisement - it's on the screen for almost 10 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there was no other point of sale for this film - the dialogue was horrible, the editing was apparently done by someone hanging from Quaaludes, the director was ... well , let's just say that my 14 year old daughter could do better, but I hope she never sees such light praise from me. It is possible that the family cat could have done better. <br /> <br /> Sandra does a worthy job for a first film, in the short period she is on screen - and this is the only saving quality of this film. Stupid story, poorly written and transferred to the cinema as a middle class should be. <br /> <br /> In short, this is dreck.
