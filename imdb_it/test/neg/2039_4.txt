A little boring, a bit disgusting, a little creepy, it wasn't horrible, but not too good. There is a beautiful creepy thing when the statue comes to life, however, props in this scene. Not much, and the film looks just like a scummy. I was happy when it ended, and I don't think any of this is a true story ... very surprised is an average of about 6.
