If I like a movie, I have to worry about the main characters and what happens to them. In this rubbish bin for a film, I found myself hoping that in the end everyone would die. None of the characters are people you would ever want to meet, they made me sick. If it weren't for some nude scenes, I would have given this unfortunate film a 1.
