Now of all the shark movies I've seen, this takes the cake! The plot of the film was good, but later the excitement factor sank. Antonio Sobato, Jr. plays an excellent role as a son looking for the shark that killed his father. A megaldon is one of the greatest sharks of all and also the most dangerous. The sight of the shark was really scary in some corners, but the effects were confused and the scenes were a bit weak in some places. With the weapons of the mini-sub there, this would bring out an entire school of sharks there. It was great that the son would get the exact revenge on that monstrosity, even if it would cost him his life. How do they say revenge has its price, but was it worth it? This answer could go on and on, and this film was a great disappointment. The beginning was fine, and in the end, it went like the Titanic. 1 out of 5 stars!
