Not me ... If it had come to this, I could have kicked a dog's ass, and that's why this movie doesn't work for me. If I were against the alien, or Jason .. Or .. hell, I don't know .. ANY ANTAGONIST OF A HORROR FILM, then there would have been no race and I would have delivered my ass except for divine intervention. A horror film works because it puts people in a situation with a creature, a person, a being, an entity, anything, that is more powerful or resourceful or intelligent than what they are, and then people think "well what would happen if it happened to me ", and they are afraid - and this is why this is a horrible idea for a story. I can't imagine being terrified of a dog, so I'm not afraid.
