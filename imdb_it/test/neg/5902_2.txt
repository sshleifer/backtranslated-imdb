It is not usually my habit to review films that I don't like very much. However, once or twice a year, I temporarily put aside my rule to comment only on the things I like to give a word of warning. I find it more fun to comment on something I like and make it better than what I do in bad movies. But some "movies" scream for the razor. <br /> <br /> Bilitis is one of them. Cinematography is not the only blurred and blurred aspect here. An almost indiscernible plot (certainly inconsistent, even if there is only one) of bad acting, mischievous script and horrible rhythm. These are his biggest problems. <br /> <br /> I understand, I firmly believe that not all films are created equal and that films should be judged according to their category. It is not reasonable to judge, for example, Beach Blanket Bingo against Gone With the Wind. I judge Bilitis against other films in his weight class. Measured against films like Emmanuelle or Secrets of a Chambermaid, it really comes off very badly. Even the eye candy must be fun and Bilitis is not fun at all.
