Made with film material left over from Nana's production, Sur un Air de Charleston from 1927 is described as a holiday film for all concerned, and this is the best way to see it. Jean Renoir seems to have never thought about it enough to even be able to edit the footage together. The plot is a simple reversal of racial stereotypes ?? in 2028 a black explorer goes to a post-holocaust Paris where a white and native girl teaches him Charleston (of course, imagine that she is a savage whose dance is a prelude to her eating before giving in to the seductive rhythm of music "white aboriginal"). There are a lot of surreal touches, whether it's the domestic gorilla that eats the flowers in Catherine Hessling's hair, the angels that the girl calls (Renoir and the producer Pierre Braunberger among them) or the fact that Johnny Huggins plays the part in minstrel blackface while Hessling's ability to dance is almost non-existent, and there are some interesting occasional experiments with slow motion, but there isn't enough to support it for two rollers. An additional air of surrealism is provided by the fact that this silent musical has absolutely no score on the new Lions Gate DVD ??
