I'm a fan of Get Shorty. This is the sequel to the film that needed no sequel. <br /> <br /> Chili is back, but Rene Russo has disappeared without a peek. Unfortunately Chili's game was played in the first movie and instead of finding a personal arc that was interesting for him, they simply made him stand up and repeat the lines of the first movie. It's quite warm. Travolta looks old here. It's like they move people around him because his bones are creaking. Its pink lip gloss and blue contacts are very strange. The second bad role is Edie (played by Uma Thurman). She is a music producer, a role that requires her to be the female Reuben Kincaid. ("Hey these guys have a fantastic new sound.") In every scene, she hits the wrong tone motivated or emotionally or both. It's painful to watch. Despite the numerous problems, Be Cool improves after a very promising start. <br /> <br /> I certainly had my laughs (Vince Vaughan on fire, Cedric the Entertainer, Ludicrous, the Rock, a t-shirt that says "widow" on it), but doesn't offer great memories after it's over. It is a celebration of love in the light of helium from the first frame. There is no one as priceless idiot as Gene Hackman in the first movie. It's all about doing good in the world, for a couple of children who deserve a chance (Beyonce & the Rock). Ho-hum. The first was not a sermon. <br /> <br /> Working inside (repeatedly) gags and lines from the first film is annoying as is the stupid concession to Rock wrestling fans (raises an eyebrow twice) as they are joking at jokes: Steven Tyler says " I'm not the kind of singer who makes appearances in the movies "ar ar. <br /> <br /> The spectacular all-star line-up is part of the problem. The first film was not weighed down by "stars". <br /> <br /> For a dollar rent let's call it too.
