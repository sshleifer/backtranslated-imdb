Living in Edinburgh and feeling a great thirst for history, I was very discouraged by the "freedoms" taken. Wrong dog breed to start !! The owner of Bobbys Old Jock was an old single, who came to Edinburgh and died poor in housing, not like in the movie. For those coming to Edinburgh and hoping to see things from the movie, you won't find the cemetery in Princes St Gardens !! There were some moments when the fabrics would have been great. The actors were fantastic in filling up a rather inconsistent script. I don't think poor Bobby has had enough time on the screen, probably due to a "loss" at some point. That being said, the film was fine and every 8 years it will please.
