First the thing stinks ... the kid likes to dress the girls' clothes. It reminded me of Norman Bates in PSYCHO or Ed Wood in ED WOOD. The jokes are lame and old, you've seen them in a dozen films from the 50s and 60s. The whole cast is wasted. I bet people only signed up to be in a Shirley MacLaine vehicle. Please, someone would tell Shirley that she did her best comedy in DUE MULES PER SORELLA SARA. Look at it ... if there are no replicas of Andy Griffith.
