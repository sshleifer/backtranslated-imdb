For several reasons, this film is simply horrible. Other posters have listed some of the historical errors of this film. Well, I have the knowledge of a layman of Roman history and I also found flagrant inaccuracies. They usually lose mistakes in historical films because I understand that the purpose is to entertain and not educate. And reducing a long saga to a two-hour function requires a historical license, say. But this film goes far beyond mere rounding. <br /> <br /> It gets worse. To tell a story from a distant period, the film uses flashbacks that make the story even more confusing. Unless viewers have a prior knowledge of the period, they will soon be lost. Furthermore, the film was obviously filmed simultaneously in Italian and English with several actors who were nicknamed later. Sometimes, the actors seem like they are in completely different films that were then assembled together. In reality, this is not very wrong. The actors were obviously stuck on a poor computer that generated ancient Rome. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give this boring mess is that I find Peter O'Toole funny. But it's not a reason to rent it. If you are curious about Roman history, there are much better films available.
