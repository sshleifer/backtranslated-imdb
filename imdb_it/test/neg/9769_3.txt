I'm going to be generous here and give it a 3 just because I live in Huntsville and it was good to see how the city was filmed. That said, this film was pretty ugly. It's like they started with very few screenplays and the director just told the actors to fix each other significantly with lots of music on it. And Billy D. Williams seemed to prefer to be everywhere, but in this film. It's just a mess. I think I could write a script better than the removal for this film, and I'm not a writer. <br /> <br /> There is one thing I have seen mentioned in the reviews and bulletin boards - everyone is under the impression that the film begins around the Second World War and actually seemed more like it should have started at the end of the 50s / early 60s. While the military was not segregated since then, I'm pretty sure any troops waiting to get on a train remain segregated in a place like Huntsville, Al. If the beginning of the movie was to be from the 1940s, then Billy D, Lesley Ann and Rae Dawn should have been in the 70s and 80s instead of the mid-50s or early 60s. <br /> <br /> Don 'Wasting your time unless you really like it so much, because the story is not very interesting.
