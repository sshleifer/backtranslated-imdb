Some friends of the folk have recommended this, but as a film it really lacks originality. I found the characters of the unflattering stereotypes and the plot is predictable from the beginning. However, if you like traditional English / Appalachian ballads, you will keep your interest long enough to hear others. I also read that the soundtrack does not resemble the music of the film, with professional musicians who take care of the actors.
