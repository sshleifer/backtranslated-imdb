As a flagship show, Attack of the Show (AOTS) is endemic to the biggest fall of G4 TV; it's a show (and a station) that has fallen so far as to challenge sex to try to cover up its dazzling flaws. His predecessor, The Screen Savers, was a space for solving technological problems and finding the latest and greatest technologies. It was a good show with a nice staff and it was fun to see some of the modding and other experiments that the crew could have put together. <br /> <br /> G4's acquisition of TechTV annoyed some of the station's longtime fans but the first returns were actually promising. The emphasis on the game was a nice addition and I really liked the coverage of E3 and other great entertainment events. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, AOTS is now only a shell of itself. Those who supervise the channel have shifted the focus of the channel away from technology and games and from everything that could be caused by young adult men. The result is that AOTS spends a lot of time parading Olivia Munn or advertising the adult film industry for games. It's so ugly that it's practically unwatchable. <br /> <br /> While some may get childish joy from this kind of thing, those who really love the game may wonder where good coverage went. Equally problematic are the young players who could tune in to G4 thinking that their game - that active group between 10 and 15 years - are instead fed with things aimed at a more mature audience. On a channel like HBO or Cinemax, things like that are expected. On G4, it's tragic. <br /> <br /> At least SpikeTV, another male channel, has good programming like CSI. AOTS and G4 have very little to offer. <br /> <br /> Too bad, really.
