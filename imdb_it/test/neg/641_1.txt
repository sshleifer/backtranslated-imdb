"Eh-heh eh-heh hey, man, look at these aliens, they are like ... biting humans and stuff! Eh-heh eh-heh eh-heh" <br /> <br /> This must be among the worst movies of all time. It's absolutely unpleasant for anyone with a shred of brain. Of course, you have payroll auditors who give brilliant reviews and vote a lot for this abomination, but it's easy to tell who these sell-outs are. Their reviews are TOO good. To give a film like this even a mediocre review claiming that it would have had some corrective recourse to film B would have been a good review! Defining this as a great film highlights the hands of corporate shills. <br /> <br /> But enough of that. <br /> <br /> This movie had all the bad features that a movie can have without being SO bad that it's fun to just laugh. The old Japanese monster movies of the 1960s had a quality that was missing from this film. At least in those films of the 60s you could laugh at how unpleasant the rubber monster costume was. Or you laugh at seeing the ropes that hold the spaceships, how the models dangled on the ropes and how the flames curved upward from the back. Those movies made fun of the way they were BAD. Alien Express (aka Dead Rail) really does seem to be a GOOD movie, which makes it incredibly absurd. <br /> <br /> The effects were terrible by today's standards. Over horrible. However it's not as bad as the monster movies of the 60s, so they didn't have the comic appeal. The plot and the dialogue were the most sophisticated I've ever seen, made even worse by being predictably predictable. I will not even indicate the plot and the logical holes of this; it simply wouldn't be right for this pitiful plot (plus it would take too long to start). Most of the acting was horrible; Lou Diamond Phillips must have been very desperate to agree to touch this. <br /> <br /> SciFi Channel is fast becoming the "economic channel of emotions", producing films after films without a shred of concept or intelligence. I can only ask myself: why worry? <br /> <br /> Don't worry about this tripe. It doesn't get any worse.
