This is an extremely technically competent film. The work and the direction of the camera are excellent and also the acting is good, especially the recitation of Daniel Auteuil in the role of the marquis. I really thought that there were no problems with these aspects of the film. Instead, I was a little annoyed by the way the Marquis was portrayed, since he didn't seem honest and seems like a very revisionist view of history. In fact, in recent years, the Marquis has undergone some transformation into a defender of freedom with great intuition, not the fat sado-masochistic rapist that he was in reality. In a sense, this is very reminiscent of the lime given in THE PEOPLE VERSUS LARRY FLINT - where these men are elevated to the status of heroes. Even if you don't think the Marquis's perversions were so bad (they included rape and extreme violence), his performance in this film as "sexual social worker" in this prison seems silly enough. Instead of the violent and selfish Sade, she spends a lot of time carefully governing a young virgin and slowly helps her to explore her sensuality. What a kind and kind man. In fact, now that I think about it, this performance reminds me of the man that Maurice Chavalier played in GIGI (but without singing) - a nice older man who loves women. I strongly doubt that the real Marquis de Sade has recognized this character! <br /> <br /> The film, surprisingly, does not have a lot of nudity, even if what it shows is extremely explicit. Only a maniac would let his children see this because it is a very adult drama. It's very well done and fun, but it's not all so true. The director admits that the film is largely fictitious in the interview of the special features of the DVD I saw. So, if you want, go ahead and watch the movie: understanding it is not very good historically. During the eighteenth century, sexual libertines were quite accepted in France because they were open-minded, so despite what the film implies, SEX was not the problem, it was violence and rape that was (and still is) the problem .
