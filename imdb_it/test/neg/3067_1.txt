OUCH, no need to say more. Actually this film made me think of suicide. Being a big fan of the wonderful zombie movie genre, I discovered that this is probably the worst attempt I've ever had. The film never seemed to go anywhere ANYWHERE! What was the point of all this, I feel hopeless and lost. Hell was so bad I can't even justify it anymore. I just want to hang myself in the closet. OK now I tried to send my comment but the server only accepts comments of ten lines or more. So here it is ... Bad, horrible, not close enough to blood. NO TITS !!!!!! How can you get a Zombie movie without boobs. In fact, the female protagonist had a hellish rack and the only reason I saw the film was completed, perhaps by chance, taking a look. NO! Of course there was a line that deserves to be mentioned, a line I can't wait to use myself one day (when I feel the need to make my face slam) "This pig won't smoke alone" This movie is bad , so bad.
