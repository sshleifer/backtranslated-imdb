It was stupid. Kind of like an Adam Sandler movie. <br /> <br /> There were some fun parts but not so fun. <br /> <br /> I liked some of the actors. <br /> <br /> There were some Sat. Night Live people in the film. But I wouldn't recommend it unless there's nothing better. And it was even better than any Jennifer Lopez movie.
