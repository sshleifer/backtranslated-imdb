The gate of hell opened under Moscow. A priest, played by Vincent Gallo, goes to the city to find a friend who disappeared in the tunnels under the city in an attempt to find the door. Wandering through the dungeons he and his colleagues have to deal with the inhabitants of both human and demonic galleries. A good idea with a good cast of second-level actors is nowhere like the tunnels that are its setting. I've seen it twice and I still have no idea why it's supposed to be scary when a large number of other people don't happen, then people talk about evil and see shadow shapes. Nothing is clear and I honestly didn't see the point of all this besides providing a pay check for the people involved (the second Val Kilmer is in a couple of fleeting scenes that are not very different to allow him to be billed as in the movie. ) The idea is really good, the performance is good, the script is not going anywhere. Get the advice of many characters from the movie and don't cross the river to see it.
