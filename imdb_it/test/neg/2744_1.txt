I admit to having a secret admiration of Love Thy Neighbor's original TV shows - mostly because they exhibit the kind of exuberant exuberance and bad taste synonymous with so many programs of their era - but I was lying between my teeth (very uncomfortable position) if I pretend that this big screen spin-off is something other than an abomination. The initial scenes of unbridled vandalism are not only useless, but also disconcerting - it has never been explained why the film opens with a succession of people ruining the houses of others - and from there it does not improve anything. When the film discovers the oldest part of the book - the horrible dragon of a mother-in-law finds herself unexpectedly to stay - it is followed by the unexpectedly obvious revelation that she is developing a weakness for the father of the black neighbor, moving her bigoted son to ever greater depth of hypocritical, ignorant anger, the most discerning spectators turn off. Take it as a warning, unless you're interested in cheapskate spin-offs with terrible acting, static direction and the overall comedy atmosphere of a burning orphanage.
