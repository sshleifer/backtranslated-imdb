Solo is an action movie about an Terminator-like android built and trained for the army. When a defect is discovered, it is emitted to be deprogrammed. Rather than face death, he chooses to flee to the jungles of Central America, where he takes refuge in a village. The military chases him in there, leading into a big action party. <br /> <br /> Mario Van Peebles makes a decent performance on the android. His movements and gestures seem mechanical enough to finish the job. True scientific realism is abandoned to become a good action hero. And it works out; the action scenes are not so spectacular, but they are not that bad either. The acting of the other characters is pretty ugly, but I didn't expect anything too good. Even the special effects were decent. <br /> <br /> Solo is decent as an action movie, but very forgettable. The substance that most films possess is missing. But if you want to spend only a couple of hours without thinking about it too much, this will get the job done.
