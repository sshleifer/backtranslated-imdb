What a terrible follow-up. The reason I give this film two stars instead of zero because it is a film that has violence, cold blood and critters, yet is poorly planned. And this terrible sequel was made by none other than BUM-BUM-BUM-BUM !!!!!!!!! Mick Garris! The head of bones that brought you the remake of The Shining that almost made Kubrick almost roll into the grave when he discovered it had been made. Garris is also the man who brought you the sad sequel to THE FLY, THE FLY, which was a wonderful film, but Garris' film almost ruined John Getz's career. However, if you really want to see the trilogy of nasty critters in order, don't do it. This is the mistake I made, I rent the first or third or better yet, DO NOT STOP AT THAT LEVEL AT ALL! This movie was sucked so bad I can't believe it, please avoid this crap. Shame on you, Mick!
