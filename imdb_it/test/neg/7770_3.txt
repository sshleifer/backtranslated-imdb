To feel good, I liked this show and watched it regularly, but now (thank God!) I don't understand why I saw it. Sex and the city is one of the most useless and offensive TV programs I've ever seen. I really don't understand the point of this show, despite the attempt. People say that Sex and the city is fun. In which way? Cursing all the time, talking about vibrators and penis size? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> I don't understand the plot: we have four girls trying to find a perfect man sleeping with every cretin, who comes around. And this show is all about four spoiled chicks, who are sleeping with every man in the city, but in the end they admit that the best pleasure comes out of penis vibrators. And yes ... the show is trying to tell us, that sex is the most important thing in any relationship. If you can have a good sex, you are a good husband (or a wife). It doesn't matter if you want to be faithful and have a good heart .. size matters. <br /> <br /> Bad acting is also the biggest problem. The four main actresses (Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattral, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis) are so bad and unconvincing, that it makes me sick just watching this show. Parker is just screaming and moaning all the time, Cattral shows his old tits and says "the f - word" all the time, Davis offers his smile (and nothing else) and Nixon acts as if he's bored all the time . And yes ... men are sex hungry pigs in this show. But judging by this show, women are not much better. This show is offensive to men and women. Women are shown to be so primitive and emotionless, as if they had no heart, just hunger for sex. It is offensive for everyone. <br /> <br /> Sex and the city is one of the worst TV shows and I'm glad the show is over, because it offers bad acting and useless stories. The whole world is not just about sex and vibrators.
