This is an admirable attempt by the first-hour director, Ham Tran, who offers a close-up perspective to the victims of the Vietnam war fighting for liberation, but presents itself as a special glorified story. With a clandestine and self-conscious dialogue and a comparable acting, even a relatively impressive budget with attention to detail will not give birth to this melodrama falling, although historically worthy of note. Not minding the often distracting disconnection with the actors to the reality of the situations on the screen, and you should leave an informative, if somewhat impersonal, educational lesson in post-war Vietnamese history.
