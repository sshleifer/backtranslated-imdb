Ed Gein: The Butcher of Plainfield is set in the small American town of Plainfield, Wisconsin, in 1957, when the lone Ed Gein (Kane Hodder) lives alone on a farm after death, if his mother and brother. The local police have had a series of serious robberies to deal with and when the suspicions of local maid Sue Layton (Ceia Coley) grow up that something bad is happening. And it is a violent sexually deviant man who kidnaps girls and kills them, the police will discover the truth in time to save Erica (Adrienne Frantz) the Sheriff's daughter (Timothy Oman) ... <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Michael Feifer, this was an attempt to base a horror movie on the real events surrounding the infamous serial killer Ed Gein and turns out to be rather crap. Real life Ed Gein was always only convicted of two murders and died in 1984, but several films were inspired by him including The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Deranged (1974) and Ed Gein (2000) with this addition enough recent, perhaps being the worst Gein movie ever. Although Ed Gein was practically nothing in this film based on the fact, Gein never had an accomplice, none of his victims was related to any of the investigators, there was no victim of a car accident, although Gein continued to calling each other people have had name changes, the kidnapping and murder of the two women depicted here actually happened four years in reality, but in this film it happens over the course of a couple of days and while here Gein is shown as a big muscular man was actually thin, thin, old and rather short. As a drama in fact Ed Gein: The Butcher of Plainfield is useless and as pure entertainment is no better with a deadly boring pace, the character is all boring and when he's not killing someone Gein is shown to work or just walk around and it's very boring. There is no suspense because we know who the killer is and it's just a boring wait until he is captured at the end. There is no real attempt to get into Gein's mind with producers who no longer give him motivation to sometimes have hallucinations of his overbearing mother. <br /> <br /> There is not much blood here, there is a scene with a woman hanging from a meat hook, there is a scene of Gein really badly cut that cuts a leg, there are the usual swollen with organs and skulls around as well as a little blood, but there's really not much here to get excited. The film was obviously designed to whiten much of the color out of the image as it is not far from black and white, sometimes I personally think that the lack of color makes it even more opaque. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of around $ 1,500,000 I can't really see where the money went in a very forgettable production. Although set in Wisconsin, it was shot in California. Kane Hodder is all wrong for the role of Ed Gein, only from a physical point of view Hodder does not seem even remotely like Gein and he gives a rather poor performance when he looks at the camera a lot by making silly faces. <br /> <br /> Ed Gein: The BUtcher of Plainfield is crap and it's as simple and straightforward as that. As a drama or a pure entertainment show, this is a total tripe from beginning to end, with nothing to recommend.
