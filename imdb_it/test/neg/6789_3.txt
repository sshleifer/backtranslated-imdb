I never thought I'd be surprised to say it, but I think "Dog the Bounty Hunter" is more fun than this 1990s police drama. Walker is very melodramatic and has actually set a standard of the genre of "High Octane" cops like CSI, CSI: Miami, and so on. I'm not saying that all these shows are bad, but they're not good either. I like the karate cutting action that Walker dispenses with the enemies of justice and the variegated cast of characters as much as the scientific technology of the CSI series. But there are some elements that I hate in a show like this. Stereotypes / Countertypes! Exact, Stereotypes / Controtypes! Unfortunately, this is a show for the Red State America moderates who refuse to part with the old prejudices of the past, especially when it comes to crime. For example, there was an episode in which a boy with psychic powers ventures to Dallas where he meets a group of kids in Goth / Punk clothes and starts to harass him. Now! This is exactly what Central America perceives the Goto / Punk culture. I mean, come on, how many times people who dress this way steal and steal from people who only care about their own affairs. Whenever there are blacks and Latins in the plot we always talk about gangs in a poor neighborhood. All right! Not everyone who is a minority is a desperate gang recruit surrounded by crime, drugs and poverty. Again, this is what Middle Red America sees of these people. Finally, because the Trivette is the bumbling sidekick, can't you make the sidekick a kicker of the same level?
