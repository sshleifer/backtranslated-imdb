I went to see this by myself first to make sure it was suitable for my child. <br /> <br /> Thank goodness I did it because I certainly wouldn't have allowed any child to see it. Why? Violence, death, funerals. If you are not ready to explain these concepts to your children, then keep them away. <br /> <br /> Because these topics are never covered in a children's movie, especially one that reads the tag "The original party animals". It could also be a gangland performance in a Hello Kitty cartoon. As for the laughter, there were very few of them. There were none for me talking. The cows looked very similar to the cows in the Far Side comics. I imagine that there is nothing original in this film apart from the addition of ridiculous violence and antisocial activities for all children.
