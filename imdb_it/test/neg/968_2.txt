I don't understand the lines. I think this is my problem with modern cinema, or those movies that are made with millions of dollars in the hope that it will become the next big sensation. It is not strange ?? people just don't laugh so much anymore, and I think one of the diseases of this problem is the movie "Showtime". There was absolutely nothing from the beginning to the end of the credits, with all the squabbles between Murphy and De Niro, with Russo open-eyed, with even standard cliches that make the general population faint with pre-programmed laughter, c It was nothing in this film that made me laugh. There were no overbearing physical jokes or mental voice jokes calculated during this debacle of a movie. From the beginning, I didn't buy the De Niro and Murphy match-up as something more than the excitement of Hollywood, in all the commentary does the director speak vividly of the hijinks and the laughter that happen during filming ?? where was he in the movie? Does this fall into both problems? the director does not really have a sense of comedy or the publisher did not understand the value of the film. In both cases, both have condemned the entire hour and a half spent in the Hollywood nightmare "Showtime". <br /> <br /> Outside of finding no reason to laugh, there was no reason to follow these characters at any time in the film. There was a taste of humor with De Niro's desire to collect ceramics as a hobby (but did the director have to write KILN about the machine so that the public could understand WHO DOES IT?), But it was abandoned and never developed. There was the idea that Murphy was an actor, but outside of that one opening monologue, no one would understand. Rent a room in a manufacturer's house where you can afford the salary of a police officer? This was not even calculated by Hollywood standards. There was a bad guy who wanted a big gun, but the gun was never developed, nor was there any real test of weapon capacity ?? even at the end. It has become a bigger joke to laugh at an accent than to remember guns. Where was the TV show in this? Russo had to get permission from this casual boy at the beginning, but there were no consequences. There was nothing in the middle of this film outside of further questions and meaningless dribbling. Random characters have been introduced, forgotten, reintroduced and forgotten again. The director and the producer have laughed at this, while we, the meager spectator, have to put up with jokes and cliché stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Was there a love interest in this film? Was there a really sinister villain who separated from the comic duo to bring the real evil to the screen? Are there references to pop culture that have not returned to Robert De Niro? Was there any random chaos during this movie? If you need answers to these, of course, you won't find them in "Showtime". The fact that I'm tearing this review off with question-on-demand just means that this sub-par (actually, well below the sub-sub-par-par) didn't fill in any quotas or looked like anything of value to the film world. Of course, he had big names and a really clean explosion, but there was nothing substantial about it. Was it almost as if the director had said before the shoot that he wanted clichés, but not regular clichés? go with the bad guys. The plot did not have a linear structure. The jokes were boring. The characters were squalid and underdeveloped. This is also below the best buddy-cop films. I like giving films the benefit of the doubt, but nothing worked in this film. Not even Shatner could save this film, and he even tried. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can't, nor will I, suggest this movie to anyone with a pulse. The comment only confirms the pathetic nature of the film with obvious defects, horrid jokes and creators who question the validity of their work. If the creators can't stand "Showtime", why should we? I didn't want a "lethal weapon" when I saw it, but I wanted something like that. I understand that there has been some form of criticism of "television reality" and the corrupt nature of the media, but that message has not left the page. In fact, I think I saw "the media" leave the theater first when I saw this. Shame brings his heavy hand with this movie and I can't blame him. Murphy was a big star, the comedy was his middle name (see "Coming to America"), but lately he seems to have lost his advantage. De Niro obviously wants to get away from an image that haunts him, but doing this kind of film will only make it farther away. One of these films is the same as an image of Scorsese. <br /> <br /> Skip this. I promise you, will evaluate your last film days. Oh, what if you laugh at any joke in this movie ?? I'm really sorry! <br /> <br /> Vote: * on *****
