This espionage melodrama has a pleasant, almost promising cast, and should have been very atmospheric; is there a will, or an intention of atmosphere ?? and also a desire, or a lack of it. <br /> <br /> Sheen plays a dissident who is now active as an agent, is a loner, loved by women but haughty; Mrs Fossey is her lover. Neill plays the gallant, generous, chivalrous Soviet agent. <br /> <br /> Sheen and Neill are both essentially boring; Finlay makes a cameo and so do other well-known actors. Mrs Fossey is hot; but then again, it always is. <br /> <br /> Will I be your true friend and I'll smash it? the film is low on suspense and excitement, it's banal and quite boring; the good thing is that you can see Mrs. Fossey naked. Apart from this, exploitation of lukewarm derived espionage.
