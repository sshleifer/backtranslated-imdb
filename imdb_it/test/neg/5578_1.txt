Predator Island starts as six friends, Eric (Tom Dahl), Chris (Dan Gordon) along with Heather (Iris McQuillan-Grace), Kim (Iana Baker) and Denise (Melissa Roby) are invited to spend some time on Kevin's (Michael Wrann ) his father's boat celebrates in the open sea. What could go wrong with such an exceptional idea? Well, for beginners a large green meteorite could crash into the sea near your boat and an alien life force could emerge from it and try to kill you all, then again it's just a ridiculously stupid idea, isn't it? <Br /> <br /> Co-edited, written and directed by Steven Castle, I thought Predator Island was crap and actually it's simple and straightforward. The script is the worst kind, you know the kind of abomination that is full of highly annoying teenage characters who do and say the most stupid things, is full of clich√©s and is absolutely predictable, makes it almost-no-sense, things just suddenly it happens without any build up or explanation, it's boring even at only 70 minutes odd and has virtually no entertainment value whatsoever, not even the value of involuntary laughter. The film does not really have much of what I would call a plot, there is no explanation as to why or how this alien creature can take over people's minds or why it can be selective in the sense that the person will "normal" the next, when the story requires it and without an apparent cause, suddenly they get green eyes and a sudden impulse to become cannibals.There's not enough horror in it, the so-called action scenes are pitiful and I don't want to waste another second to think of Predator Island and even less to waste my precious energy by typing these words ... <br /> <br /> The director Castle does nothing to make this thing watchable and the 'special effects' are absolutely terrible, this dude alien creature could not even get into a science fiction movie of the 50s. Filmmakers also play a few credits credits, but this has to be the least fun collection of the errors, I mean that they can't even make mistakes, if you understand what I mean! Forget any decent gore, because there is none, there is a bit of cannibalism and some intestines placed on the stomach of the unfortunate actors so another unfortunate actor can take them and pretend to eat them. <br /> <br /> With an alleged budget of around $ 150,000 I have to admit that the directors were working on a very low budget, which is not yet an excuse to make such a poor film. Everything seems very cheap and the acting is very bad. <br /> <br /> Predator Island is crap, I'm sorry but it's like that and I can't see what anyone would get from it. In my humble opinion this is probably to be avoided.
