I thought it was an incredible boring movie! I heard that the director does not speak French and therefore left his actors to say what they wanted ... Well, Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi is fantastic, as usual, but I can't say the same about the other actors. They have nothing to say, especially Bruno Todeschini. <br /> <br /> They all looked very tired, this is one of the film's plots: tired of being together, of living abroad, of their life in general; so they spend half of the movie sleeping in a hotel room. After a while I felt sleepy ... <br /> <br /> I gave 4, due to some very nice scenes, including the last one.
