This is one of the rare films that I didn't immediately discuss with my friends after watching it. This was not because he had particularly charmed me or impressed me. On the contrary, he had given me nothing. <br /> <br /> Why? Because somehow, everything was so exaggerated that we couldn't take this movie seriously. There was so much sex and violence that I had the strong impression that the film was trying very, very hard to be offensive, as if it aimed at superlatives in ugliness, rather than telling a convincing story about two women caught in a crime spiral . <br /> <br /> Baise-moi was described as "Thelma & Louise with real sex" for me. Well, it's true that the main idea is similar. There are two women traveling through the country because they have committed crimes and they know that their lives are over now, that the police will take them and decide that now that everything is finished anyway, there is no way to hold back. <br /> <br /> Baise-moi had been described as a feminist film in which women, who had suffered from male dominance in the past, exacted revenge on the men they met. <br /> <br /> something I had never played in this film, simply because none of these women had ever been innocent, and because they kill not only irresponsible and violent men, but also men who seduce themselves, men who show the sense of wanting to have protected sex. And they kill women. No, they are in no way better than the characters they meet and kill in horrible and brutal ways. <br /> <br /> How easily the "heroines" decide to kill, and how much pleasure they put into it, fact it is absolutely impossible for me to relate to them in any way, or even take them seriously. It was all too much. Too much sex, too much violence. I had the feeling that sex and violence were there just to create a superlative in ugliness, rather than transmitting a story, or giving a point. <br /> <br /> Baise-moi left me with no impression, he didn't make me think, because he was so far from any real world. So constructed, unrealistic and exaggerated. <br /> <br /> There was nothing I could do with this film, there was simply nothing to think about, besides "Why did they make this terrible movie?" If the intense unpleasantness of this film had a purpose, I would have accepted it easily. But since I didn't find anything, since the movie's story seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to squeeze the worst possible sex in a movie ... I filed it under "unnecessary torture", determined not to have never, NEVER, look at this movie again, and now I consider this the worst movie I've ever seen. Worse, not just because in reality it is not my cup of tea to watch people raped, rape, have sex in other forms and kill each other ... but because whatever it was that the creators wanted to tell the world with their movie ... if they wanted to say something ... it didn't work. And there is nothing else that could save this film, because it is also shot in such a bad style.
