Although it pains me to some extent that I am worried about baptizing the comment board for this new series - mainly because I would hate to give the false impression that there is actually some semblance of public interest in this - I feel compelled to throw my chips on this one. <br /> <br /> To put it simply, never before have I felt so persuaded to root for the rapid and merciless cancellation of a television program based solely on the merit of its promotional advertisements. And, in case you're wondering, I'm a boy. <br /> <br /> Listen, Comedy Network: even if your existing original programming is already, we should say kindly, of a "questionable" quality (I 'If you look at yourself, "Girls will become girls") you really are passed on this. Anyone who has turned on this green thing could not be further from contact with what is beautiful right now. <br /> <br /> Good luck.
