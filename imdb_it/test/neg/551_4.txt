In 1984, The Karate Kid had a certain charm, even though it was little more than Rocky than a poor man. Unfortunately, producer Jerry Weintraub failed to understand that it was better to leave the story at the point where it was over and convinced Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita to make an extra effort to turn the film into a trilogy. The third part was the definitive minimum of the series, yet someone must have thought that the series still had potential. What other explanation could there be for the existence of The Next Karate Kid? <br /> <br /> Wait a minute. The next? Yes, Macchio is gone (at least he was smart enough to stop at the end), and his replacement is Hilary Swank (!), Who plays a troublesome teenager (what else?) Named Julie Pierce. Now, the girl has family problems. She also gets into trouble at school. Said school has a sadistic gym teacher (Michael Ironside). Apparently, one of his students is actually a good boy and Julie falls in love with him. This puts her in bigger trouble than before, of course. Fortunately for her, she currently lives with Mr. Miyagi (Morita), an old friend of his grandfather who happens to know how to get back to the bad guys. <br /> <br /> All those factors up to seven clich√©s, and this is just a general summary of the plot: imagine how detailed scenes must be! From beginning to end, The Next Karate Kid is a tired, flat and boring marathon of idiotic lines and settings. Swank, thankfully, has people like Boys Do not Cry and Million Dollar Baby to rescue this disaster, but why did Morita agree to come back? He may have received an Oscar nomination for the first film, and it was quite enjoyable in the sequels, but he has nothing to say here - even the revival of the gag "wax on, wax off" is dead. As for Ironside, it's slightly better than Martin Kove and Thomas Ian Griffith in Part III, but it's not a stretch at all. <br /> <br /> So, is this image really that horrible? Not exactly. There is a sequence that manages to achieve a strange beauty, but when the best part of the entire film involves a group of Asian monks who dance while listening to pop music for the first time in their lives, it does not qualify as a recommendation for look at the rest
