I'm finding that I'm getting less and less enthusiastic about Disney's sequels in movies. Yes, I understand that the budget for video directed at videos is not the same, but these films don't even try. Some examples are Hunchback II and Tarzan and Jane. If anyone has seen Stitch-The Movie previews, you will see my point. But I digress, this film reaffirms my point. The animation is sloppy, the lines of the story recall the cartoons of Saturday morning and not all the original voices are present. I was very disappointed not to hear the voice of Michael J. Fox. It was so obviously obvious that the person who was doing Milo's voice was trying to look like Fox, but he didn't come close to success. <br /> <br /> If he says anything, my 10 and 6 year olds haven't even seen the whole movie.
