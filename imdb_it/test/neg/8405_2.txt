I think "Rosemary's Baby" is the most overrated horror movie out there. It's not scary, interesting or much of anything. He is reasonably well headed and Ruth Gordon was wonderful, but that's all. But this sequel makes it look like "Gone With the Wind"! <br /> <br /> I took it on TV when I was 14 years old. Unfortunately, I still remember it. From what I remember, little Andrew from Rosemary has now grown up and the coven wants him to start getting the upper hand (the world he is). But there are forces trying to stop it ... and Andrew is having doubts on his own ... <br /> <br /> I'm giving this a 2 for some reasons: Gordon is in this (and still very good); Stephen McHattie was actually quite as good as Andrew and there is a spooky moment at the beginning with Rosemary (Patty Duke) being "kidnapped" by a bus ... without a driver. <br /> <br /> Besides this it is boring, silly and useless. The original does not NEED a sequel! The continuation of Ira Levin's book in 1999 was not much better. <br /> <br /> Tune in to start with Duke ... so stay tuned. It's not worth it.
