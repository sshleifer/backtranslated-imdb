This is what I felt like screaming and trampling the theater, but I restrained myself. Yes, the acting was great, no, this wasn't the typical Hollywood movie, but the dialogue wouldn't have ended (or it would have become interesting)! And despite all the comments, you never get to know or really care about any of the characters. Definitely the most boring movie I've seen from Sphere, but I expected it to be boring. I had to sit down, but please save yourself
