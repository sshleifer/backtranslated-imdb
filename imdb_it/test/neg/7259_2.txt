Other commentators have described this film as "1950's SciFi classic" with the clever use of archive material and documentary footage and intelligent interaction between the characters. <br /> <br /> Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is the SciFi classic of the 50s ... but the SciFi of the 50s is the worst incredibly stupid. <br /> <br /> Consider that the first prey of the Mantis is a radar station shown first by the air, then on the ground. .. but the station is (from the air) in the picture like on the top of a mountain, with snow on one side and the semi-finished dark earth on the other side, but when (on the ground) the investigators visit the site, it is suddenly on one floor, uniformly white plain, miles from the nearest mountain. <br /> <br /> Also consider the ridiculous pseudo-scientific ridicule of the highly recommended expert who is brought to examine a huge claw. He says "Well, we know one thing ... it can't come from an animal, because every known animal species has a bony skeleton, even reptiles and birds have bones." Then he goes on to say that some creatures ... snails, molluscs, insects ... have no bone skeletons. Excuse me? We define "animal" here. Not even in the 1950s can someone over six years old take this man as an expert in biology, since he clearly does not know what an "animal" is, nor does he have the capacity to name different categories of animals that lack bone skeletons ( sharks, rays, jellyfish, insects, molluscs, arthropods, gastropods, sponges, arachnids, echinoderms ... we get the idea.) The characters are made of cardboard, types of stock 2D ... scientist, girlfriend of a companion, great bad monster. Nothing here shows any sense of creativity. No pulse, no vital signs. <br /> <br /> There are no witty dialogues, the special effects are foolish also for their time, and the archive material is used with a reckless indifference to continuity. This is the B-movie that does the worst, with a production team that clearly can't take the trouble to try it even lightly. <br /> <br /> Use sparingly as medicine or punishment for small children who are easily offended by bad science.
