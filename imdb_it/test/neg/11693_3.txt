I'm a fan of the horror movie, regardless of which hemisphere it comes from. I know what to expect from the West, from the East and from most of the horrors in the middle. So I received the "Acacia" DVD in the post and I was looking forward to slowly growing tensions and frightening children with strange bumpy movements hidden under the quilts. <br /> <br /> The main strength of this film was that it has a much more linear plot than many of this genre: you get who the characters are, where they come from and what they do. Get the basic information (nice couple, you can't have children) and realize that the premise is just too normal because something crazy does NOT happen. <br /> <br /> And then the evil comes. The number one complaint is that the story is OBVIOUS. I understood the moment when the child embraced the tree. I knew where the movie was going and I was even able to predict the order of death and why. <br /> <br /> Assembly is shocking and unfortunately not to the benefit of the film. Even though I was still thinking about the events, the tension is not allowed because the director seems to have gotten a new editing suite for his birthday and wanted to use it as much as possible. <br /> <br /> And my final complaint is this ... the tree was not necessary. This would have been a perfect story of subtle horror with the simple breakup of the couple due to the death of the child - the titular tree did not buy anything new or exciting for the film. So I'll end up where I started - my overall impression was 'Oh'.
