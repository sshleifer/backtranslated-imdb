OK, we have 4 city electricians who find a mini nuke reactor, turn it on and fall into a parallel universe inhabited by a giant spider queen even from a parallel universe, which managed to slip in with some of its relatives to conquer the earth but alas is she the only one left? If so, because the rest of humanity has not joined and driven it out. Furthermore, what happened to the military, in no way a few billion or more ammunition could have been exhausted and why hide in a basement when much more defensible places were available. Moreover, it is not an excavation for city workers, but how is it possible to know what a mini nuke reactor looked like and as if they did not have one in the parallel universe, could they reopen the rift? Sorry but there was nothing nice about the movie
