If you want to see a horror movie that is horrible and in bad taste, this is definitely the movie to see. This film starts with two young teenagers who get excited about getting into a chat room and going out in the dark, and most likely end up like a lamb at the slaughter. A lot of blood, blood, nudity, handcuffs and all kinds of draining hooks and things you will never dream of a person is capable of performing on men and women. If you like piercing, well, this type of piercing is done with heavy hooks and many tattoos; in addition, lots of needles and thread to seal things on the human body. I really hope this film does not give someone sick in this world the idea of ​​playing these horrors in real life.
