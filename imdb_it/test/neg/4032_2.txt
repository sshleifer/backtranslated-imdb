I can tell from the other comments that NO ONE could ever really appreciate this little piece of shit, it's the same one I tried. <br /> <br /> For as long as I was watching, I was horrified that someone could make this stupid movie! What is the world coming to? I guess it's my fault that I saw the whole movie (ugh!) But it was like a bad car accident, I couldn't look away. <br /> <br /> If you are a child under 8 years of age, you might like this movie. Otherwise, stay away at all costs. It's the stupidest movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Everything is stupid: the story, the script and above all the acting, everything! While watching the movie, turn off the TV and think "how can a movie be so sadly stupid", or keep on looking out of curiosity, to see if things can become more stupid than this (they can't). <br /> <br /> These filmmakers (if you can call them that) have to seriously return to their day jobs, none of them has an ounce of talent, and I strongly doubt that you can make a life churning out useless horrible junk that nobody in their right mind would like to see! <br /> <br /> Just checked out BS Don't waste time.
