The main part of this light musical history is found in the imaginary Midwick College, in which Peter Kendricks (Peter Lind Hayes) participates because of the generosity of the theater actress Grace Hayes, the mother of her real life who plays the same role here, and that he manages to provide his love interest through his secretary Mary (Healy), who is his real wife. Drably directed by a weak screenplay, and also hindered by an excessive cut and poor editing, this film provides some treasures among its eight songs, including the title number, and has some good work done by the soprano Healy, Benny Rubin as owner of a snack shop, and the dynamic tap dancing Roland Dupree.
