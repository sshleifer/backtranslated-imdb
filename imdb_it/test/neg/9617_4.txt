I will not waste your time describing the plot for this, the other reviewer has already done quite well. Anyway, I'll give you my opinion on this movie. This film is basically anti-Japanese propoganda. The Japanese are portrayed as incredibly evil barrels that they respect for nothing, as well as having very poor martial arts skills (groups of Japanese men get to kick ass from single women on more than one occasion). The fact that the Japanese fighters lose almost every (if not every) fight in the film genre takes away the suspense. The plot is actually pretty solid and perfect for a kung fu movie. The problem is that there are not many fights. When there are fights some fights are quite good, but other scenes are poorly choreographed. A scene, angela mao, takes six Japanese in a church and kicks all their donkeys. The problem is that they show that he fights them one by one when they should all attack at the same time. I imagine this film is incredibly cheap considering how cheap some sets are. They use the same village for when they are in Korea and when they are in China without changing it at all. Some scenes are shot in real places, and look good. Overall, the only real problem with the film is the slow and uninteresting plot. Since there are few fighting scenes, we have to rely on the plot for entertainment and, well, I wasn't entertained. <br /> <br /> a star and a half out of four
