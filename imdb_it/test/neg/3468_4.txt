'Leatherheads' tries so hard. Try to be light. Try to be a comedy. Try to be a love story. Let's see, try to be 'His Girl Friday' by means of 'The Sting' by way of 'It Happened One Night' through a dozen sports movies. Alas, the attempt is not making and the film is as wet as the last field of the game. <br /> <br /> A movie fan would watch the big fighteasy fight scene between the Duluth Bulldogs and some soldiers and realize the struggles that John Ford staged with style, verve and humor in movies like "The Quiet Man "or" Donovan's Reef ", or" The Searchers "might seem easy to do but obviously they are not. I would bet that George Clooney thought that channeling John Ford would be just as easy. How difficult it can be: masculinity run wild, punches, broken bottles overhead, an unperturbed pianist ... just put it there on the screen with some music. Sorry. It takes a master to make the fight scenes flow. <br /> <br /> Movies are not desired. Humor is difficult. Romance is difficult. Slapstick a lost art. <br /> <br /> I once read that you never wanted to sit too close to a ballet. Something about not wanting to sting the fantastic performance bubble by feeling the thuds of dancers' feet or the grunts of elevators. This film is so ... all the tensions and good intentions, the beautiful actors, the beautiful sets, but moves at a pace rather than galloping like the original Galoping Ghost, Red Grange, on which the film is freely inspired.
