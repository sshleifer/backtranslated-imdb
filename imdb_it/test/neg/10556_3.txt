As a fan of C.J.'s previous film, Latter Days, I really wanted to love this movie. <br /> <br /> The best thing I can say, however, is that it is NOT a horrible film. There are some good performances and some funny scenes. In particular, Tori Spelling has a couple of fantastic scenes where he talks to her boyfriend's ex-boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Overall, though, it's a nice week. The script too often falls on strange coincidences and movie clich√©s. (Has the main character gone to Stanford with a golf bag, and doesn't his high school friend even know how to play?) <br /> <br /> Most of the time, this film had no idea where it was going or what he was trying to say. There are many scenes that are slightly nice, but eventually they are a waste of time. And you could easily cut half the characters in the movie without losing anything. <br /> <br /> Yet for all its flaws, I should say that this is one of the best gay films of the last few years. Which says a lot about how bad gay movies are. <br /> <br /> I hope the next film by C.J. it will be better.
