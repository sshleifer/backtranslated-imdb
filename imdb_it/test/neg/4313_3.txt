I read other users' comments and I'm glad someone compared it to Kamal's original called Perumarzhakalam published in 2004. <br /> <br /> The original had a tight history and no loophole as described above regarding the Indian government does not have adequate registrations, or even bad shots and bloopers. <br /> <br /> The story is big and touching and well described by others. But sadly Nagesh took the credit as his story is a sad thing and is nothing but plagiarism. <br /> <br /> I think he was struck by the so-called "inspired" Bollywood syndrome. <br /> <br /> You must at least give credit where it is due. <br /> <br /> I liked some of his older films, but now I suspect that some of them were original, after all. <br /> <br /> Here is a link in IMDb for the original masterpiece. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425350/#comment I recommend everyone to see the original, even with subtitles, if necessary, to know which class direction and class acting is everything.
