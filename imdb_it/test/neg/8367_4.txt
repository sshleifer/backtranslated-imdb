At least if you're a Disney fanatic (well, of the variety that loves his live-action movies as well as animated things), if you're a child, if you're a kid in the heart almost to the extent that you barely realize you're an adult, if you absolutely love any movie that shows animals, especially when they do tricks or if you're not too demanding, Air Bud: World Pup is a little fun to watch. I'm a Disney fanatic. I really liked this movie and will be happy to watch it. <br /> <br /> But the boy has many problems. The main flaw comes from a combination of too many characters, too many threads of the plot and not enough time to take care of everyone. In the space of 82 minutes, we have adults who get married, teenagers who fall in love and try not to be embarrassing, competition for teenagers for love and jealousy, preteens playing spy games, dogs falling in love, dogs playing football, dogs having puppies, manipulative parents who will do anything to convince their children to win a lesson from their children, dilemmas of the housekeeper and cheaters who cook and make elaborate plots. I'm probably forgetting something, but it's about 10 major plot issues to deal with, with less than 10 minutes per thread to deal with them, and presumably we weave them into a coherent whole that's not too complicated - this is child's play "film "After all, it's also humorous and moving. Unsurprisingly, director Bill Bannerman, on his first turn of being completely in charge (he has many previous experiences with the second unit), wasn't up to the task. I'm sure he didn't helped that there were at least three writers involved, and probably also dictated the producers. <br /> <br /> The end result is that Air Bud: World Pup is extremely unstable, events occur with little justification and, worse, often with few explanations: people understand and do things mainly because they need - and fast - so that everything can reach where it should arrive in less than 90 minutes. ro, the time could skip ahead by about six months. We both have adults who seem to be mentally disabled and children who intuitively understand what a dog is thinking and rush into unexpected actions. Some of the threads should have simply been removed, because it is difficult to get too involved in the film when, as soon as an idea is introduced, it has already moved on. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, it does not help that one of the threads is basically a rip-off of Cento and a Dalmatian (1961), minus a character from Crudelia De Vil. And another problem is that, given the way the film was modified, I have to assume that the dog, Air Bud, probably couldn't do much with the soccer ball. Unlike the first two films, a dog that plays a sport is almost an afterthought here, and when we see it, it is in very quick glimpses; occasionally, these fragments even seem to be aided by computer animation. <br /> <br /> Yet, for someone like me, there is a poor charm for Air Bud: World Pup. The script and the performances often intertwine between a ridiculous, somewhat mocking and a bit blatant clich√©. I tend to like this combination. It makes the film both a bit predictable and subtly bizarre. And sometimes, like the finale, when the film completely abandons consistency and basically becomes a commercial for the US women's soccer team, Air Bud: World Pup is so brazen that you can't help but love it.
