After watching the first film in BCI's new Aztec Mummies Collection, it's hard to believe how excited I was about the set and how upset I was when the release date was rejected. I've seen a lot of Mexican horror in recent months. Some big ones ?? The curse of the crying woman. Some fun despite obvious flaws ?? The night of the bloody monkeys. And some Cheesy ?? Choose a Holy movie. One thing that all these films have in common is that nobody can be called "boring". Well, this is not the case with The Aztec Mummy. It's been a while since I last saw something that caused me to sleep. I wasn't hoping or expecting a great movie, but at least I'm entertaining! The Aztec mummy takes every situation that could be interesting and sucks its life through repeated scenes of people who do nothing and then extend those scenes for what seems like an eternity. I imagine that's what happens when you make an 80-minute movie with only 30 minutes of material. Extraordinaire padding! For example, for anyone who has seen the film, what purpose does The Bat have if not to bring a masked wrestler type on the screen and extend the execution time by about 15 unnecessary minutes? <br /> <br /> I can only hope that the other two films in The Collection are more fun than this.
