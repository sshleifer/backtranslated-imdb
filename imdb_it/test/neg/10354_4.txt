Being from Australia and loving the series, I didn't expect much from the American version of Kath and Kim, but I thought I'd watch the first episode to see if it was really that bad. <br /> <br /> Well, what is there to say. It's nothing special. Selma Blair is OK like Kim and she actually had some good jokes, Molly Shannon is not a good Kath. The good thing about Jane Turner's Kath is that when she talks to all her funny accents (like when she says Yumor or Noice) it sounds like it's the natural way she talks, but when Shannon has the accent, it's clear she's acting and he is trying to be the same as Turner. And the show really misses Sharon or others to give us something to laugh about, because the characters of Kal and Craig in this version are not really funny. <br /> <br /> So far only the first episode has been broadcast, clearly not up to the standards of the Australian version, even if if it were an independent TV show with a different name, not being compared to the Australian version, maybe it would be considered a little better. But if there's nothing else to do on Sunday night (or Thursday night in America), then you can't hurt to look at it, or better put up some Australian version, if you have it.
