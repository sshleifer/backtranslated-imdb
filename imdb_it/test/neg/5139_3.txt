I have just finished watching Disappearances at the AFI FEST 2006 with about 30 other people in a 1000 seat auditorium mostly free. The festival programmer, after seeing the lack of audiences, started his opening comments with "Well, at least some of those participating in the festival have good taste in the film". Well, Mr. Programmer, after seeing this movie I have to answer "No, we don't, and neither do you!" This vintage "back-woods" piece follows the Wild Bill (not so) as he and his mystical family dangerously handle Canadian whiskey illegal across the border during American prohibition. The long-time outlaws (Kris Kristofferson and company) not only need money to save their dilapidated farm in Vermont, but want to introduce the little Wild Bill to the virtues of manhood. <br /> <br /> Although beautifully photographed, this adventure story lacks what makes good movies, "tension" and credibility. Kristofferson's lackluster performance and dry monologue remind me of a dream I once had when Al Gore played the role of Willy Wonka. Except that I didn't care and when Wild Bills, the mystic grandmother, appears out of nowhere to give him advice, but it's not good for him. Yes, I almost fell asleep more than once. <br /> <br /> Gary Farmer does a good job as Cameron Frye in the character of Ferris Bueller; Big Bill's brother-in-law while the teenager Chris McDermott uses those piercing blue eyes for his acting benefit. <br /> <br /> But overall it is expected that Jay Cravens Disappearances will play in a Block Buster $ 2 near you.
