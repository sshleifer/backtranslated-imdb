Most of Lorne Michaels' films seem to fail because they are essentially just extended versions of skits that barely make people laugh in five-minute segments. "Tommy Boy" is a character from "SNL" - a big big lovable (in their opinion) who knows nothing. <br /> <br /> David Spade gets the role of Everyman, which has been overwhelmed. It is coupled with the annoying Overweight Slob and endure Miserable misfortunes as they travel to the countryside to save Daddy's Business. <br /> <br /> The plot, for beginners, is really flawed. The whole premise - the father dies and the rich stupid son must save the family biz - can be traced back to almost any film you want. Like any SNL-style film, it is reduced to a simple motivation: empty, superficial; just a reason to see a fat boy and a skinny guy being "funny" together. <br /> <br /> The biggest "influence" of the film is the 1987 classic comedy "Planes, Trains & Automobiles". That film is fantastic because the plot is not old and recycled. It is elementary, yes - a boy who is returning home for Thanksgiving remains blocked by a fool. But it's true, damn it. It makes all the difference. The characters are real, the situations are much more real. "Tommy Boy" is pure slap and his ridiculous situations undermine the characters - we feel nothing for them, and we don't care about what's happening on the screen. "PTA" walked on the careful line between the shameful and utterly believable and related - "Tommy Boy" is simply absurd, with jokes like a simple deer-in-the-headlights that turns into a crash that turns into a fight a dead deer that really isn't dead, then wakes up and destroys their car. <br /> <br /> The whole destroyed car is completely stolen from "PTA" and it's disturbing how much stuff in this movie actually looks like the Steve Martin / John Candy movie. <br /> <br /> Farley is simply too hateful to find sympathies - I never liked watching it in any movie and that didn't change my mind. Spade has given very little to do, being the most thankless character in the film. Dan Aykroyd is wasted as the bad villain who plans to destroy dad's business. The ending is a joke, and not in a "har-har funny" way. More like an "oh god are they serious ?!" way. <br /> <br /> Someone digs it, it's beautiful. But I can't make it, nor do I appreciate all the things he "borrows" from - not just counting "PT & A" - without any merit.
