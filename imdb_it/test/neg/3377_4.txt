Having already seen the original "Jack Frost", I never thought that "Jack Frost 2" would be so absurd. Boy was I wrong! Furthermore, A-PIX films have a way of showing incredibly bad material, even worse than one might expect. I think this is the first A-PIX sequel, and it could be an indication of what to expect in the future: more sequel to A-PIX. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to see him without laughing, especially during the later parts of the film in which the sons of Jack Frost (who are essentially snowballs with eyes, arms, a mouth and sharp teeth) begin to kill people with typical comic dialogue and stupid voices to go with it. They are shown both as puppets (with a stick at the bottom to move them) and as computer animation, which I have to say very flashy. Computer animation surprised me, as the first "Jack Frost" had no such effects. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend seeing the original "Jack Frost" before seeing this (both of which would be preferable to watch with a group of friends) for maximum enjoyment and why it would make more sense (the " meaning "is a relative term). <br /> <br /> Now only if there was "Uncle Sam 2" ...
