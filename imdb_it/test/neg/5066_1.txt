I admire the effort to try to reach the rest of the world with this tragic story. However, the film is made SO BAD, that most of the people I know cannot sit. The film has been relevant to me since I lived in Estonia when these events occurred, but it is horribly written and fails to catch the attention of someone who knows nothing about it. The musical choices do not flow well with the film, it seems that someone has just turned on a CD player in the background to put the actors "in the right mood". Acting ... well, what acting? The only people acting are Jürgen Prochnow and Donald Sutherland, although Prochnow seems uncomfortable with this role. As for the development of the relationship between Erik Westermark (Jürgen Prochnow) and Julia Reuter (Greta Scacchi), it is like looking at a railway disaster. There is absolutely no chemistry and it is painful to witness their "sincere moments". This is not a good movie. There is a difference between trying to get a message out (it could have been a documentary!) And trying to make a good movie. This is a failure and anyone here says otherwise asks me if they are trying to promote it. In fact, being a native of Estonia, I am offended by this miserable effort. This tragedy deserves more than an excuse for a cheap home-made ghost hunt for a movie. This could have been much more!
