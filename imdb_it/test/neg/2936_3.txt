The basic premise of this film is that everyone in the world can know that a person is gay except for that person. And that a man who likes melodies, has good taste, and is clean in appearance MUST be a homosexual. Yes, the film is fun in some parts, but the basic premise is that of homophobia and an insult that the whole film crumbles into something that is rather painful to sit on. The performances, particularly Joan Cusak and Kevin Kline, are very good.
