I thought it couldn't get any worse than "Army of the Dead" but this shit load makes the movie "The Godfather" look like it! The special effects are HORRIBLE (Makes the original Nintendo graphics look like HDTV). When the acting comes, let's put it this way, I went to a comedy with my 6-year-old granddaughter and gave a performance worthy of the Oscars, compared to these D-lists (and that's kind of her) actors and actresses. So basically, if you had a gun in your head and your head to choose between watching this movie again or cutting your arm with a boring knife, this is a difficult choice !! You know what, who needs two arms anyway?
