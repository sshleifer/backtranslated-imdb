This film is a mixture of various idiotic clich√©s. For example, boy-meets-rich-girl-rich and falls in love with him by harassing her in college (a background too used in recent Indian commercial films). A male chauvinist glorification of sexual conquest. The climax is predictable (having been used to the point of nausea in many other films). Like many other recent commercial Hindi films, the film abounds with the incongruous inclusion of songs, which probably contributed more to the film's success than anything else.
