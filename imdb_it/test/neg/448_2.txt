We describe Larry as an interviewer: a complete suckhole, in every possible way. He laughs at all his guest jokes, asks the most boring questions, and would never dare to contradict them. It strikes me as the kind of person who wants to be loved by ... everyone. Harry friendly, boring, or unpredictable. He probably owes his success to being a celebrity dream interviewer because he is not bombarded with what we, the people, want to know and we have the right to know. Let's put it this way: interview as if it were in a red country. 02/10, 2 for the guests who come to the show yet everything seems useless when Larry starts asking his mind questions like "How's being a mother?" followed by the usual answer along the lines of "Being a mother is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me: it is wonderful, but tiring".
