This film could have had a lot of potential. Certainly with today's technology, one would expect real special effects. But the films are not made with special effects alone, obviously it is necessary to act. Both were missing in this film! <br /> <br /> First of all, let me tell those who are angry with this not to follow the Bible: why can't a film take an artistic license? If you want to know the story of Moses, read the Bible. I have seen very few films that follow a true story of fact. Watch the film from its artistic quaility. <br /> <br /> In seeing this film, you will inevitably compare it with the 1956 version. It fails miserably in this. Heston and Brenner have had PRESENCE. They have become their roles. You don't see this here. <br /> <br /> Even if you don't compare, standing alone, this movie is too hasty. Parts where a scene should be developed is not so. It gets boring. <br /> <br /> My advice: skip this and look at the other. Like campy like the other, it's by far the best movie.
