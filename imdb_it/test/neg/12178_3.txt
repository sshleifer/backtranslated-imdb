Boring. Boring. Boring. Ultralame. I must go on? There's one, I repeat * a * funny scene in this whole, amateur, anti-funny Amateur Hour Special of a movie: Fares Fares fat father who hits someone with his beer belly. That's all. The rest of this surprisingly mediocre pile of nothing consists of the usual bored-looking Swedish "actors" who offer dialogues that go from one side to the other, a trivial story, a neglected direction and, well, little else to mention. Farot Fares Fares, with his neotist version, is charismatic as an accountant writing to the institution and his nose also rivals that of Adrien Brody in terms of sheer ridiculous enormity. Torkel Petersson should work only with Lasse Spang Olsen. The rest of the cast is, fortunately, easily forgettable, while Fares' gigantic and titanic nose will haunt me forever in my dreams. <br /> <br /> Josef Fares helps ruin Swedish cinema. Don't support him and his nonsense. Jalla Jalla is for the comedies what Arnold Schwarzenegger is for acting the character, Kopps would have been much more respectable if he had been a YouTube video without budget, and Zozo was simply the most pretentious, pseudo-touching junk ever unleashed by Swedish director. Wake up and smell the roses: Swedish films can be much better than that, so stop pretending that Fares films deserve to be watched simply because they are "good at being Swedish". Please.
