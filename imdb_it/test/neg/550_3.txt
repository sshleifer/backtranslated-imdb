The latest installment in the Karate Kid series is predictable, poorly acted, and so bad that it borders on fun. But not really, it's just bad. In this episode, Karate Kid by Ralph Macchio is absent, already in one of the episodes. The new Kid, played by Hillary Swank, is the teenage niece of one of Mr. Miyogi's World War II companions. His parents have recently died and his grandmother is trying in vain to relieve this infernal young woman. In the steps Mr. Miyogi to fix things. True to the formula, there is a group of neo-fascist bullies, called Alpha Troopers who must be put in their place and a new karate move, called Mantis Religiosa. As I said before, this film is a disaster and should be avoided.
