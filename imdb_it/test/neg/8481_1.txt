(Contains really bad spoilers) So, what can I say about this ... It's a really HORRIBLE and VERY HORROR !! Too many CGI effects and special effects .... one could say how fake the ridiculous child !!. PLEASE at least go see "Dungeons and Dragons" which is another terrible TRASH stack. Son of the Mask makes Dungeons and Dragons so much better !!! Uggg !!!!!!!!!!!! Pure Crap !!!!!!!!!!!! I hate this Trash !! I would also like to say that "Superbabies: BabyGeniuses 2" was also a really stupid movie. Probably just as stupid as "Son of the Mask". "BabyGeniuses 2 was as false as" Son of the Mask "and also contains too much CGI !! <br /> <br /> However Yeah ... this was a BAD BAD REALMENT BAD movie ... please avoid it .... I do NOT recommend it to anyone ... just simply too ridiculous ... it doesn't make sense and the plot is really bad.
