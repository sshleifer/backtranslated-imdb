For me it is a case that you will never understand if you have not lived it .. so read this to know why I would have had such unlimited anger .. <br /> <br /> I heard a lot about (Bruce Lee) .. my father loved him .. my mother who hates every little bit of violence loved him! and how he talks so far of his "The Big Boss" aka "Fists of Fury", and the experience of watching it in Egyptian movies of 1973 with all the gigantic success .. besides I saw a really nice film about him (Dragon : The Bruce Lee Story - 1993) .. so I found myself crying: where are your Bruce movies? !! <br /> <br /> I went to the video store .. and it was dumb to move .. (you'll know why!) .. and waw .. I found a lot of Bruce Lee movies .. I selected one called ( Bruce Lee in New Guinea) <br /> <br /> I did it to myself and watched that .. OH GOD please forgive your servant .. I hurt myself but without a decision taken .. I don't I would do if I knew that his illness is harmful !! its mythical level of horror !! <br /> <br /> Then I didn't understand at all what is the great clamor of Bruce Lee as a great immortal star ??? .. why would anyone be interested to know if he is here or there .. this hero (whom I saw!) is not that talent and not that genius and of course he is not so sexy ??? <br /> <br /> Until my father saw THIS star and asked me to stop at one of his close-ups and after examining his face a little .. he told me in a very definitive way " this is not Bruce Lee "! so I became too confused to ask myself: who is this stupid anyway ?? !! <br /> <br /> It was 2001 .. 2 years after my first inclusion in the IMDb database ... so I immediately worried about who the hell is that man .. and I discovered the truth .. he it's not 't Bruce Lee .. No my dear friends .. he is Bruce Li !!! <br /> <br /> And what a huge ... so huge difference !! I just want to know who can love that bad clone ?? Oh God forbid .. He loves his filthy movies .. I saw 2 of them and couldn't bear to finish the third! <br /> <br /> After that I ignored all our video stores because its economic cunning (writing on the posters that this is Bruce Lee! ??) .. and I have the original .. The one and only only Bruce Lee, who really is a great star, and Oh BOY, he certainly had the right to immortality ... and no less.
