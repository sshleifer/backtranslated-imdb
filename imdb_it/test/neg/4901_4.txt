Inspired by a true story, it is full of feelings from the 70s but is detached from the story. This is the story of a black university swimmer who ends up in Phillie in a closing rec center in a bad neighborhood and somehow puts together a swimming team. The film stumbles around blindly for the first half hour until Terrence Howard, as our hero, gets the kids into the pool. At that point he gets up and becomes a little addictive, even if he continues to falter. There is a good story in this and it is clear why Howard and Bernie Mac took part in it, but the script is poor and most of the director seems intent on making it look like something different instead of making us try something for history. /> <br /> It is not the disaster that some reviews have done, but it also suffers from all the recent real sports stories - Coach Carter, Invincible, Glory Road, etc., which at least I knew you should at least work with the story for make a movie instead of letting the audience suffer because "it's true".
