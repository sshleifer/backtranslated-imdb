This movie is a bad movie. But after seeing an endless series of bad horror movies, I can say that it's a little different from many I've seen. Not in the plot, which is a fairly regular slasher story, but more the way the scenes are cut. Murder Weapon gives us many dialogue scenes, but they last much longer than in most films of this type. For this reason some victims seem a little less similar to cardboard cutouts. Only slightly. I had trouble understanding exactly what was happening at the beginning and kept wondering if certain events were dream sequences. My favorite scene is when two guys are on the run from the killer and take refuge in a car. In the glove compartment they find a gun. "Thanks God!" one of them happily exclaims. The man's head suddenly looks like a mannequin's head, and for me it took long enough to ask me, "What is this? Where is that mannequin in relation to the two boys in the car?" Then BOOM! The head explodes and I realized that he had to be one of the guys in the car to get his head shot off with a rifle. I love that scene, but the film is a very bad film. 3/10.
