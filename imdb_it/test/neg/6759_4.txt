First of all, Katherine Hepburn is misplaced like Clara. He cannot be convincing as the devoted, selfless and very smiling wife that the authors have created. <br /> <br /> But the real weakness of the film is its superficiality in the face of a potentially large drama. Schumann's bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder is equivalent to "Oh, oh, I have a headache" and the occasional word of anger. Suicide? The word is used, but there is no sign in the domestic scenes and when we see it in the asylum it is calm and submissive, smiling and optimistic. A superficial treatment E Brahms is so upright and bourgeois - no sign of his gruff humor, his love for the precision of the establishment's nose, no sign of his tortured attitude towards sex and women resulting from spending youth to play the piano in brothels. And was Clara's long concert career promoting Robert's music entirely, or was she, in effect, an extraordinary pianist who wanted a career for herself, a female pianist who carved out a place for herself in a male world? Any kind of treatment of the lives of great artists is better than nothing, but this is a mid-level Hollywood approach, particularly disappointing because the real story is much more dramatic, much more interesting, so much more human.
