I rented it thinking it would only be nice from the cover of the movie. Judge and jury started an excellent assassin chasing the man who killed his wife on a bicycle with a cold pistol, but this movie became progressively more stupid as he went on. David Keith is an exceptional actor, especially when he plays a role like this, too bad the film was a piece of shit, he actually wasted his talent. Judge and jury were really stupid, I gave a 3, I should have given him a 2, I gave him an extra star just because David Keith's gun was cold.
