There are bad movies, horrible movies, and then there is a tiny and rare film body that is so horribly bad that even after seeing them only once, the absolute terrible makes it impossible to forget them even a few decades later. This is exactly such a film, and it's hard to believe that the original film of this series was actually quite good. Let's see, George Kennedy, the cigar that bites the "hard" mechanic of the original was somehow promoted to the captain of the airline, and, after the Concorde ended up under a missile attack (don't ask), he uses acrobatics like shoot a rocket gun out of the cockpit window, despite (presumably) flying over Mach 2, all the while doing the sort of wild evasive maneuvers that would have wrested the wings of a real airliner, not to mention the passenger effect! But the absolute worst part of the film, at least for dedicated airplane enthusiasts like me, is that this atrocity "played" one of the most beautiful, sexy and most technologically surprising aircraft I've ever flown. The Concorde (or simply "Concorde" as its pilots refer to it) deserved much better, this abomination is the equivalent of taking a high-class beauty like Audrey Hepburn and putting it in a sequel to "Porky". Fortunately, the release of the always fun "Airplane!" the following year he took the entire "Airport" franchise to a well-deserved break, as anyone contemplating a fifth episode would be mocked to death by the studios and movie fans. <br /> <br /> 1/10
