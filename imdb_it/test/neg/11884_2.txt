My wife and I couldn't even finish the film. Really, it was pretty painful. <br /> <br /> First of all, historical accuracy is compromised not so much by the events themselves as by the ridiculous one-dimensional nature of the characters. For example, Augustus takes the "weight" of power only with great reluctance. Indeed, he is portrayed as a sort of great humanist and believer in democracy. <br /> <br /> Second, the field! My lord, dialogue is horribly bad. I remember the soap opera my mother watched when I was a child with a better dialogue than this. The constant exposure and pontificating grids on the ears like nails on the blackboard. Ugh. (Okay, I exaggerate a little, but the dialog box is really bad.) The HBO Roma series is superior for no other reason than its characters were at least credible, regardless of their historicity. <br /> <br /> Rome was also wise enough to know that they could not stage epic battle scenes. The creators of this film no. When Caesar attacks Munda, the battle scene is practically farcical. <br /> <br /> I will grant that the costumes are perfectly good. The sets are perfect, even though their CGI backgrounds can be a little off-key at times. The sound is ugly, both in terms of music, fake work, and the dubbing of many secondary characters. <br /> <br /> However, it is definitely not worth hiring. As a history expert, I was hoping for an alternative approach to Augustus compared to the Rome of HBO, who, I believe, failed to grasp his overall "feeling" as much as Cesare or Antonio. Instead, I should have limited myself to my reading.
