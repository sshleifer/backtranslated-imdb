THE EXPERT, played by Jeff Speakman, is the definition of DULL !!! <br /> <br /> Dull, characters, boring situations, boring direction, boring actors, boring cinema, boring music. <br /> <br /> I don't really understand this movie. Should it be an action movie? It's almost as if Speakman wanted to act in a serious film, but the level of acting and writing found in THE EXPERT is lower than the normal television drama. And there are some typical scenes of "Speakman Pummeling Bad Boys" here and there, but the main aspect of the film is based on a kind of credible drama, which is totally wrong for Speakman or is so badly directed that it simply doesn't work with the action star. In the end, this confusing film appears and feels very anonymous and tasteless. The worst aspect of THE EXPERT is music. The composer is an aspiring Jerry Goldsmith, with his pompous and melodramatic music, which simply does not belong to this type of (boring) film. It is as if the producers knew they had a very boring product and asked the composer to make the film more compelling and dramatic with its soundtrack, which makes the whole film even more confusing, confusing and boring. > <br /> Don't waste your time looking at this, even if you're a fan of Jeff Speakman.
