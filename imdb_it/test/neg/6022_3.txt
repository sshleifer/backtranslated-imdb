This film was a real waste of time. It is nothing more than a gangster movie to be desired. Contains a very predictable plot. My feelings are not nice for the characters, and the dialogue is mediocre at best. Half the time you're looking for something else to do, because the film is boring, since you already know what will happen. The other half of the time you desperately hope the protagonist will grow a couple of balls or end his life by jumping off a bridge or something. Furthermore, the secondary characters are mostly one-dimensional. There is no depth for any of the characters in this movie! No depth!
