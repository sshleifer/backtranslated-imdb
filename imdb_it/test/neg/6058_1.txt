I don't know how expensive the creation of this film was, but the effects were terrible. Half of the film was shot on stage in front of a canvas of the film (it is certain that the blue box would not have been so artificial). When they traveled on a boat, the background canvas was moved imitating the movement of the waves but the characters did not move. The CGI effects: terrible (I'm not sure, but I suppose the effect was created with Paint and made a GIF sequence - the next time the creators should hire a team of creative CGI professionals). It seems that the creator of the CGI would have drawn on the strip with shaking hands. Terrible, that's for sure. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I thought it was created in 1983. One of my friends told me the correct date: 2005. My mouth open, I was so shocked, I thought he was joking. People, I suggest you skip this movie, the story is also distorted, you won't like it.
