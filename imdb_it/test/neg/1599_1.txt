This should be the story of the life of a man named Wirey Spindell from the age of 8 to 36 years told in narrative by the character in every age of his life. For example, when he is eight years old, it is the eight-year voice that is narrating; when she is in middle school, it is what narration is doing, etc. This is the only interesting aspect of this film. It seems that every actor who plays Wirey is a separate character. Not only do they not resemble each other, their life experiences do not seem to fit together. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like a bad cold.
