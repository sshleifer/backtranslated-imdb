Actually, Son of the Mask made me laugh a few times ... mostly because of the cartoon jokes that made Bugs Bunny and Roadrunner so funny. CGI is very impressive and is widely used in this film. Garfield, for example, is not a par for CGI, but I would give the same vote. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows the story ... which is not so bad for a KIDS movie. Yes, it's a KIDS movie ... and therefore it should be treated as such. Jamie Kennedy is not very good at his role. His attempts to act "crazy" are not very good and general acting is poor. <br /> <br /> All the others are not bad. <br /> <br /> In practice, my 2 and 5 year olds watched it all without complaining. At least I was able to sit down. <br /> <br /> There is no way this movie is the worst of ** shudder ** Class of 1999 <br /> <br /> 4/10 for CGI and some laughs.
