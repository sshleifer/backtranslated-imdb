In the last years of his career, Charles Bronson has established long-standing collaborations with several directors, most notably J. Lee Thompson and Michael Winner. He also directed two films for Bond's director, Peter Hunt, the first of which was the decent 1981 actor Death Hunt, the second was this indifferent political thriller pursuer. The murder is rather boring if the truth is known, and in the end you find yourself wishing for something with a little more passion and rhythm, like The Wilby Conspiracy for example (which, by plot, resembles this film). <br /> Bronson sleepwalking through his role as bodyguard Jay Killian, whose job is to protect the wife of the American president, Lara Royce Craig (Jill Ireland, wife of Bronson in real life). Killian believes that Ms. Craig was targeted by assassins; she thinks she is a paranoid and too protective pessimist. It turns out - surprise, surprise - that Killian has always been right and someone is really out to uproot her. The two go on the run, pursued by the assassins. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows that the wife of an American president is known as the First Lady. For some reason, in this movie they have renamed it "One Mama"! Enough what the point of this is someone's hypothesis, but it is indicative of the senselessness of the film as a whole. Most of the film's performances are lazy and the script takes a long time to get to where it's going. If I were to label Assassination within a specific genre, I'd say it should be a "thriller". I would say that with some reservations, however, like saying that it is a thriller has few precious chills.
