It's a male who drinks a lot of money. I saw it on Sci-Fi some time ago, and the idea seemed interesting to me. It may have been a good movie, and the plot itself doesn't see it as a male hit, but certain specific references to men get really annoying. I could still look at the film again, even if at least trying to redeem itself by implying that perhaps the women in the film are not as violent as they claim, but they still don't compensate for the very tired male -bashing. I mean, I can understand a little, it's part of the film's plot, but come on, it gets really tiring after a while. Not only that, but to assume that the majority of women in the world would accept to become homosexual so easily and that the few remaining heterosexuals would be such a minority to "stay out". It's just too incredible. There are too many women out there with cultural or religious restrictions that could hinder them, it's totally unlikely. I mean, I know his science fiction and I love science fiction, but the best science fiction has at least a hint that it's possible, and this is too implausible. The phrase "Truth is stranger than fiction" was born because fiction must at least seem plausible to be accepted, but the truth is not always. This film is not that. In addition to this, the film has some good acting and the eventual moral of the story, that something similar to what happened is wrong, redeem it a little, but not enough.
