A little while ago, I stumbled upon this DVD while surfing Netflix, and with such an impressive cast, I decided to try it. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a movie try to be a new version of a great existing movie (Scarface) and fail so spectacularly. <br /> <br /> The main problem seems to be a complete misunderstanding of what the story should be. In Scarface, Tony Montana was the self-proclaimed "bad guy". His spectacular ascent and eventual ruin were not sad, it was a great one (and the only logical conclusion) for someone who lived a similar life. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa, as a director, writer and lead actor, sees Kilo as a kind of hero, or at least a complicated boy. However, he does not want to do the job to create a realistic and understanding character. He was raised by a white mother, except for the six months of his childhood when his father, a gangster himself, showed him his life. For reasons never fully explained or even mentioned, he decides he wants to become a drug dealer, and actually drives to the ugly part of the city, approaches two traffickers and says, "Hey, I'd like to buy some drugs." He drops his father's name and, apparently, they are not only rich, but the two boys who supply him act subordinately to him for reasons, yet, never explained. <br /> <br /> Chapa wants you to feel ill when his character is sentenced to jail when a police informant lies over him. However, since he has already distributed large amounts of drugs before now, why should you feel sorry for him that he will go to jail this time? The most obvious case of Chapa who wants to be the good boy is in his execution in prison of a White Supremacist / rapist played by Gary Busey. In Scarface, Tony Montana kills someone in prison because he basically needs to rise, it's done, he goes on. But in this case they must make sure that Busey is not only a rapist / pedophile, but also a white supremacist. A little excessive, don't you think? I will not go into details in this sense too much, but their desperate message of "PLEASE LIKE ME! I AM A COMPLICATED GANGSTER!" fails at every level. Try how they could, I didn't feel bad, in conflict or understanding when his companions were killed (after a shootout), his wife was also killed (shortly after she called him to be a lousy father, and during an escape attempt when he decided it would be OK to drive right next to a car full of armed men while his wife was in the car), and her eventual disappearance. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that his acting can be summarized equally badly, his only result that brings the term "wood" to new starry heights. Busey should be credited with having actually committed his ridiculous role. Tiny Lister did well. Stacy Keach plays her role in the role of Prison Break. Robert Wagner is going around for a salary. Faye Dunaway, while a dramatic touch, still turns into a better performance than this deserved movie. Brad Dourif has been in the film for about two minutes and does what he can. And to give credit to the film, it uniquely makes One-up Scarface - Jennifer Tilly now holds the title "The most ridiculous attempt at a Hispanic accent". (Excuse us Robert Loggia.) In short, this film has had an interesting premise, but a poor story, unpopular characters and hit-or-miss shows. I would advise Mr. Chapa to relax forced sympathy next time - really, we don't have to love your character, we just have to be interested. Next time you'll be luckier.
