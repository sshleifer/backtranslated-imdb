I love the other work by Brian Yuzna, even more raw stuff like "Necronomicon", but "Progeny" was too much for me. My main complaint is that she is uselessly exploiting the nakedness of Jillian McWhirter, I'm not an idiot but these nude scenes are dragging on and on and on ... just to culminate (almost every time) in a dark * winking * of sexual violence. The scene in which he attempts abortion with a coat hanger after several minutes of naked shouting is a good example. Arnold Vosloo's "performance" is absolutely turgid, but even Jeffrey Coombs could not save this pile of films. Aliens are boring, uniformly opaque lighting arouses your interest, and the plot is absolutely predictable. The only highlights for me were a look too short on the true shape of the aliens (very beautiful model) and the scene in which Vosloo finds his wife in the closet was OK. But you have been warned.
