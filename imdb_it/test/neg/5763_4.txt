"Curse of the Forty-Niner" doesn't really deserve a long and detailed review, so I'll just make a few random comments about it: <br /> <br /> - Cool opening credits. <br /> <br /> - No plot. <br /> <br /> - Is there anyone who has ever seen a horror film and cannot guess, within the first 20 minutes, who will survive and who will not be part of this group of street stereotypes? <br /> <br /> - Hey, that newcomer (Alexandra Ford) is pretty hot! <br /> <br /> - Richard Lynch (rigged to be about 100 years old) and John Phillip Law have fun, ironic cameos. <br /> <br /> - Karen Black has a bigger role, but it's not funny - it's rather embarrassing. <br /> <br /> - Martin Kove is on the screen for about 40 seconds, but he still got his name on the cover of the video. Did they pay for it or was it the opposite? <br /> <br /> - I hate the economic effects generated by computers in horror movies. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of 4.
