Surprisingly, this film by Kieslowski disappointed me because of the script, sometimes strange and sometimes cliché, which sometimes seems like a work of poor observation. There is an isolated boy. He lives with one of his relatives, but he is alone and every night he watches a woman living through their building. It Looks! that he wants her is one of the young people who are not good at communicating with the opposite sex. However, he likes that woman, when the woman comes to his house with a man, Tomek gets hurt. Therefore, we understand that Kieslowski tells us a story about an isolated boy who needs a female to flirt or who falls in love with a mature woman. He does not do anything else, because it may be that he knows that it is his salvation. One day, he stops that woman, suddenly, he looks like a shy boy, but he proves that he isn't, so he explains almost everything. You give lectures and reject it. Everything is as realistic as the other Kieslowski films, no problem. The problems begin when Tomek visits her, the story of a lonely boy who falls in love with a mature woman (but unrequited love) turns into the story of a young boy in love with a mature woman, in the beginning the woman refuses, but after a short time, she starts to change her mind. This U-Turn makes the film cliché in the first place. Is Tomek's personality strange? or the result of poor observation? I am disappointed with this character, this is my opinion and I will try to explain why. When he goes to his house, Magda treats him very friendly. You ask me what you want from me? To kiss me? make love to me? go out with me At this point, I remember people who say they are a femme fatale. To see? Returning to the scene, Tomek rejects all the proposals. Why? Why is he shy? I don't think so, but his communication is abrupt, OK. After the leg scene at home, some events cause the target to lose its purpose. I think the purpose of the film is (should have been according to the story) show us that there are some people who suffer from a lack of tenderness and that saving from this situation is not easy due to lack of communication and detachment especially for men. I mean that at this point, what does the film say? It's fuzzy and disappointing. We see that he is not hungry for love or a woman or a sex. So what? And the scene of the suicide attempt supports this weakness. So that he touches his legs, he wants to kill himself! By the way, as I said before, some say that Magda is a femme fatale. Totally no. He strives to make Tomek happy. Do you avoid having contact with him? No. Do you insult him? No. Do you enjoy it? No. And deceives him? No. He has some problems with his (ex) lover, so he is not O.K. However, he does not retaliate for this from Tomek. Not an angel, but not even a femme fatale.
