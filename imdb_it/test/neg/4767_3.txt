Although this is not one of Miss Davies' worst films, it's pretty ugly. And it is sad that in a revisionist way, the recent raters of IMDb have deliberately over-inflated the soundtracks of some of his films to make up for the fact that she is scolded in the past - or so it seems. For years, conventional wisdom has been that Davies was a terrible actress and only got the roles he got because her boyfriend, William Randolph Hearst, made his way to Hollywood. This is certainly the image created in CITIZEN KANE by Orson Welles. It is true that Hearst used his considerable wealth and influence to build Davies' career. With all this money, it is not surprising that he has made excellent films and it is not surprising that people have become disconnected because of all the extra attention he has received. Sleeping with the man who finances your films is bound to get noticed. However, despite this margin, he also made a fair number of bad films and I think we really need balance when it comes to the soundtracks of his films. After all, no rational person could believe that from today (1/5/08), PEG O 'MY HEART and two other Davies films recently shown on Turner Classic Movies (THE FLORODORA GIRL and MARIANNE) deserved exceptionally high scores - higher rankings at the top of films like HIGH NOON, BEN HUR, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT !! In fact, MARIANNE would now be the fifth best film ever according to IMDb with a score of 8.8 !!! Considering that most people out there don't even know who Marion Davies was. And most of his films were financial disasters, that's a serious problem !! However, she was a much better actress than CITIZEN KANE and initially broke into the movies before she started sleeping with Hearst. <br /> <br /> What sets PEG O 'MY HEART apart from the other two films is MARIANNE and THE FLORODORA GIRL were good films - while PEG O' MY HEART is somehow simply terrible. Much of the reason was Marion's terrible suffering. While his French accent on MARIANNE was nice, in PEG his Irish accent sounded bizarre, not particularly Irish. Also, and maybe I'm wrong, but her continuous use of the word "you" makes it seem like Shakespeare should do it, not a movie set in 1933 in Ireland! Also, there was a bizarre insistence that Marion should be the consummate star with many talents - so they had not only acted, but also dancing and singing. In some of his films the singing suited the screenplays perfectly, but here it seemed out of place and seriously compromised by the film. It almost felt like I heard Hearst shouting "see - she's a great actress --- watching her sing and dance". Unfortunately, Marion seemed simply uncomfortable and out of place in many of these scenes. But for me, the biggest problem was the idea of ​​having a 36-year-old Marion who played such a young role. It was obvious that the character played at the beginning of the film should have been like those played by Mary Pickford in her teens and twenties - complete with pig tails and brave attitude. Miss Pickford COULD carry out these roles even though she was no longer a girl. But here, Marion had put on some weight and had seen at least 30. Without offense - she looked beautiful for her age - but she didn't look like a girl! <br /> <br /> Strangely, with the millions that Hearts spent on Marion's career, he never realized that the most important thing he needed to spend his money was a good script and one that fit to the talents of Marion. Believe me, I evaluated many of his very high films (in particular I love SHOW PEOPLE), but here he couldn't do without flops - this film was a turkey.
