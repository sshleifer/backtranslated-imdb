Contrary to most of the comments in this section, I must say that this film barely escapes the definition "junk!". The only readers who seem to be aware of what a catalog of clich√©s is are those who, like me, live in the northeast and know firsthand how the area is. I'm totally fed up with films that should be "realistic", yet they portray the working class (of any place) as stupid, criminal human beings, but then excuse them because of their social background. It is funny? I smiled briefly twice and laughed once, but that was the inconsistency of two actors with Sunderland accents who were supposed to try to hide their Newcastle accents from Sunderland fans! There was only one nice character in the whole film, and that was the senile grandfather played quietly but very competently by Roy Hudd - the only non-Geordie in the cast. <br /> <br /> As for writing - well, I wonder which department of university sociology the author has studied. He certainly had no ear for the local accent. And I, too, have never heard the expression 'Purely Belter' - and not only am I a native, I am a linguist who has written articles in the local dialect. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time and view on this garbage. It's not funny, it's not realistic, it's not funny and it's basically dishonest.
