I thought this film was a little effort on the part of the British film council - it fell flat like hey, come on, Tim Robbins is an old boy and here is this beautiful young woman who falls straight for him too. As lost in the translation, it is really difficult to suspend disbelief in this context. It is a beautiful film but lacks strokes. When Tim Robbins pretends to be a psychic, he seems to have a small headache. He looks uncomfortable and lives less. The part where he is examining suspicious employees of the sphinx is ridiculous. If an investigator comes to my factory, the last thing I would do is talk to him about my freckled fetish. He is obviously too intellectual. Clumsy. The city is as it is, a convenient context. Evidently they have chosen the most futuristic city they could (shanghai) as a backdrop, but the city never really comes out and influences the characters as in the case of blade runners, where city characters often intersect history. slow as a wet week. No chemistry, real dramatic highlights, so plot like this.
