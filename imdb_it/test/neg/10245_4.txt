I've seen worse movies. This is bad, but at least it doesn't try to be good, so it deserves a brief applause. Stay firmly in the realms of the B-low-budget science fiction genre. <br /> <br /> It's a junk movie but in a nice way and it's definitely worth buying if it's in the business basket at your local supermarket. Terribly fascinating instead of just awful. <br /> <br /> The highlight for me is when Galaxina's lover goes to save her. At his appearance he exclaims "Bunnyfluff!" which attracts icicles from its co-pilot. <br /> <br /> Sit down, get drunk, have fun!
