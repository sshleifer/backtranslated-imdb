I like homosexual-themed movies where the characters are not stereotypically gay and this is what attracted me to this movie, that is the main actor, which is the only reason I'm giving this movie a star in more than you deserve (though not because of his acting in the film, let me tell you). A lot of people complain about cinematography, but the feel of the film's camcorder added a certain "underground" quality to it for me and there are a couple of scenes, usually around sunset or dawn and between trains that they would make any movie screen blush. <br /> <br /> But the acting is cardboard, the music is repetitive (I went through the second half of the film listening to a soundtrack from another film), you have to wait almost twenty minutes for each dialogue and then it's embarrassing and amateur . The subject of the graffiti could have made this film great if it had been elegantly exploited and the art itself had been more intriguing, but it is not. <br /> <br /> Worse still, there is no climax; there really wasn't a plot to begin with. The film returns to the surface in its shell of silence and dies. A forgettable film.
