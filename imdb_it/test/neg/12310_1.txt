I couldn't wait to see it when it was in production. But it was the biggest disappointment. A distant cry from the extravagant world of Dr. Seuss. It was vulgar and disgusting, I don't think Dr. Seuss would have approved. How the Grinch stole Christmas was much better. I understand that he had some subtle jokes for adults, but my children still haven't figured it out. Considering that The Cat in the Hat shouted vulgarity, they captured much more than I would have liked. Growing up with Dr. Seuss It really annoyed me to see how this timeless classic was blown away on the big screen. Let's see what they do with Horton who. I hope this will do Dr. Seuss some justice.
