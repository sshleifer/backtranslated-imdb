Someone said that WEBS is very similar to an episode of SLIDERS, and I have to agree. Spoilers: I've never liked Sliders' actors and I've rarely seen them except when there was nothing better. WEBS is the kind of movie to see if you have no other choices. Read a book. WEBS has that kind of TV that has actors that seem to be there as part of their PROBATION or Work Release program. Some low-budget TV movies have actors who seem at least enthusiastic. Actors in WEBS seem to have been paid minimum wages and were working on a watch. They have that desperate look, "The-Paycheck-Better-Not-Bounce". The Queen Spider looks great, except that it is rarely seen, and there are no other spiders (and no cobwebs). The Queen Spider bites people, and they become Spider Zombies, which means they try to keep their eyes open when they attack humans. Humans are all fighting each other for a number of different reasons, and they are not nice. After meeting all the "humans" I would have recommended the school of charm for the characters. All that WEBS made me feel was APATHY. I was insensitive to the characters, and was hoping for some interesting gore and special effects. The blood was minimal and the special effects were reserved for the ugly spider queen, who was fine. If WEBS had a group of spider creatures that ate humans, it would have been more fun. Apparently they could only spend "spider-zombies". WEBS is a sad entry into the field of SPIDER-oriented films. It could qualify as the worst Spider movie ever, because the Eight-Seam Freaks had great special effects.
