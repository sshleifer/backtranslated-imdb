Once again Woody Allen seems to be completely uninspired as well as recycle himself. Here we have a fake documentary (like Zelig), the film's structure is a series of anecdotes (Radio Days, Broadway Danny Rose) set in the 1930s (Zelig, Purple Rose, Bullets over Broadway) on a low life (Deconstructing Harry) who believes he is a genius absolves him from being a jerk (idem). Given this film and Decostructing Harry, one wonders if this is Allen's justification for his actions with Mia Farrow's adopted daughter; yes, I was an idiot, but I'm a genius so you have to love me. <br /> <br /> Allen has only produced two good films in the last ten years; the refined Bullets over Broadway and the excellent but largely ignored Manhattan Murder Mystery. His other efforts range from nonsense (New York Stories, Mighty Aphrodite) to angular but experimental (Mariti and Mogli), to pure drek (Alice, Scenes from a Mall, Shadows and Fog, Celebrities, Harry's Deconstruction). His films no longer even try to have a narrative arc, and his humor seems to aim ironically, not amusingly. After deconstructing Harry, I stopped seeing his movies in theaters; after Sweet and Lowdown I could stop renting them too.
