The story: Alain, a French policeman, is shocked to discover that he had a twin brother when his body is found in Nice. Investigating the murder, he discovers he has a list detailing the actions of the Russian mafia. Helped by his brother's girlfriend, Alain dodges Russian gangsters and corrupt FBI agents as he tries to find the list. <br /> <br /> "Maximum Risk" is another long list of action films with Jean-Claude Van Damme. As for things, it is strictly formulated. The script is based on clichés and acting is mediocre. There are some well-made action sequences, with an inventive car chase, a fight in a burning building, an escape through the roofs, a brutal fight in an elevator, and JCVD ​​escaping his enemies over an elevated railway line . Director Ringo Lam keeps everything at a reasonable pace.
