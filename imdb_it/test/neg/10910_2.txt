Some directors cannot be wrong in the eyes of national criticism, which is why you should never pay attention to them. This film is a perfect example. Critics like director Eric Rohmer. <br /> <br /> This film is a boring soap opera about a woman and a teenager ("Pauline") she is taking care of for the summer, and the relationships they have with some men. Speak, speak, speak and talk more. <br /> <br /> For those who watch the cover and hope to be titillated, there are some quick nudes and a couple of swear words, but otherwise this is a harmless work of French morality. A friend of mine loaned me this tape. He thought he would take a sexy French movie, and he was disappointed. I was equally disappointed because it was also boring. <br /> <br /> How this gets such great reviews is almost incomprehensible.
