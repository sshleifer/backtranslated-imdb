"Eaten Alive" is much simpler than "Cannibal Holocaust" by Ruggero Deodato, but it is also a much more foolish film. I mean, sometimes it can be unintentionally exhilarating, but the plot is so incredibly idiotic that it was impossible for me not to lose patience at the end. The tough Robert Kerman (Cannibal Holocaust) joins Janet Agren (The Gates of Hell, here with an intolerable accent) to look for Agren's sister in the jungle of New Guinea, who was brainwashed by a cult leader religious (Ivan Rassimov). Along the way, they are witnesses of animal torture (sometimes real) and of a provocative cannibalism. As directed by Umberto Lenzi, the film is so exaggerated that it's hard to take it seriously, but if you like trash cinema with more involuntary laughter, it's not bad. <br /> <br /> 4/10
