I gave Soul Plane the benefit of the doubt and thought that there would actually be something of comic value. I'm not black, but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate black comedy. I know because I enjoy seeing Wayans Bros, Good Times and other series. <br /> <br /> I have seen shit movies and I do not find myself easily rejected. As for Soul Plane, I didn't even bother to finish it. I don't know if they managed to land the plane and I couldn't care less. It would be unfair to say that I didn't find any fun parts as I did laugh, but they also laugh at the YouTube skateboard videos that fall on their peanuts so they don't say much. The men in the film were like a group of horny and screaming hyenas in the mating season trying to "take some" whenever and wherever possible. And we wonder why all those stereotypes don't seem to disappear. To summarize: Soul Plane makes the Harold and Kumar series similar to The Godfather.
