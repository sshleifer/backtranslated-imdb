This film must be one of the most boring and stupid films that Perrugorria has made. <br /> <br /> It looks like an advertisement from beginning to end. The "director" has spent all his time on a tripod, has no rhythm, no rhythm. It is illogical. what a mess. You can tell what will happen from the first 15 minutes and the ending ... Wow <br /> <br /> ------ spoiler ------- <br /> <br /> Jesus Christ, how the hell was Perrugorria fired? Are you serious? Worst scene of someone getting shot ever! <br /> <br /> ------ end of the spoiler ----- <br /> <br /> Bad direction, bad script, bad acting ... Really bad overall. I would definitely not recommend this movie. It's a waste of money and time.
