This film tries to be the most damned to capture that ugly classic Canadian movie: <br /> <br /> "weird" and hateful characters (a few); "bizarre" city with "bizarre" people; a coffee shop or "extravagant" restaurant (coffee shop here); many shots of Canadian stuff for postcards (ocean stuff here); lots of mentions about "I have to leave this city"; completely canopy. <br /> <br /> And it succeeds on all fronts. <br /> <br /> Something to note, though. I couldn't tell if this movie was just trying to be a "eccentric" post-Northern Exposure comedy or something surreal like a psychotic or psychotic hallucination. The modification of this film has jumped meaningless from one thing unrelated to another with zero stimulation or motivation. Not to mention the fact that half the time we didn't even know where we were jumping. Take, for example, the very initial shots of screaming teenagers in the car. Who are they and what do they have to do with something? And this sub-uh plot (use the text's plot in an approximate way) by giving children who seem to have passed by generations. I don't think they really do, but the editing makes it seem like they suddenly materialize from the flashback to the current moment. Eh? What did I miss? <br /> <br /> Avoid. Laughter aside. Or do you want to try to stumble in inept assembly.
