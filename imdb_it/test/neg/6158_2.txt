This film fails on many levels. The script is the first to fail and, as I understand it, if the script sucks, there is nothing that can solve it. The plot is boring, after the first 45 minutes, I watch the DVD counter saying "how much longer?" Cinematography is rather horrible. I'm not sure how bad the DVD transfer was, but it looked like a VHS copy. Moreover, the sound was bad. I realize that this won't be remixed for 5.1, but it seems to me that it hasn't even sounded like in the Dolby Stereo that had been around for almost a decade when they cut this movie. <br /> <br /> Slipstream was too similar to Mad Max and Blade Runner for comfort. Due to the lack of decent special effects and high quality dialogue, it is extremely disappointing. If I remember, the pointer scene took place over the last 20 minutes, usually it should be in the first 20. Most people will be totally confused about what the hell will happen until the last 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The film's music was excellent in some parts and therefore completely inappropriate in others. Elmer Bernstien made the score, but it sounds like someone else had a hand in "other" things elsewhere because it didn't match the overall orchestral score (with some synthesizer music). <br /> <br /> were great actors, Bob Peck, Mark Hamill, Ben Kingsley, Bill Paxton. And they did a great job breathing in the little life available in their characters. (Well, Paxton's character was pretty stupid, and the whole movie was centered on him. I'm not sure that a heroic underling is a good choice for the main character who brings the film.) Again, a big flaw with the screenplay. br /> <br /> Thank goodness I watched this from a DVD mail order service, and not from the theater. Overall a big disappointment for science fiction fans, or Paxton fans, or Hamill. 90 minutes of your life, you'll never come back.
