Carlos Mencia just isn't fun! His show is painful to watch for this. His sketches / parodies are all very horrible, and this really seems like a filler for the Chapelle Show, which although I'm not a big fan of this, is much more fun than this junk. Carlos Mencia gives the stupid speeches and too often depends on finishing his monologues with a delayed voice and going "der der der". It's not funny. Often, talking to others, he plays on words. They are horrible and painful. When people don't laugh, blame them ... because someone should laugh, it's not funny. He has an immature sense of humor in everything he does on this show, it's amazing that anyone except the 3 years is watching this. One of my favorite things he does, is water down every topic and make it look like a joke! I hope this racist idiot gets back to flying as soon as possible because he stuns a station that no longer needs to be silenced.
