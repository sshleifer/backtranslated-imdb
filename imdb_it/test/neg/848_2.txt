1st guarded 03/17/2002 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Mario Pinzauti): Silly, master full of sex and slave with too many intimate relationship films. This film seemed to worry more about sex than about the history and type of sex work around history. The ridiculous dubbing of the original Italian language in the version I saw with a ridiculous ending in which you try to give an anti-slave statement (or should I say a line). What a waste of time for all those who watch this garbage.
