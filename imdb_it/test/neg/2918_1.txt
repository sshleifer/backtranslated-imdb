If one were to return to the dawn of the speaking scene, a bright future would be prophesied for Harold Lloyd. Unlike his competitors, he was a comedian trained on the legitimate stage, not a representation raised in the purgatory of the music hall or vaudeville circuit. He had a beautiful voice that matched his image. Moreover, from 1924 onwards, his "silent" films had incorporated gag-based sequences of sounds lost on the audience (for example, the sequence of bells at the FRESHMAN Fall Frolic and the sequence of monkeys in THE KID BROTHER). However, the sound characteristics of Lloyd have constantly failed at the box office once the novelty of WELCOME DANGER had lapsed. Lloyd blamed his fall on many external sources, but he never realized that the enemy of Glass's character was not healthy, but the Great Depression. The pre-Depression public, full of optimism, could have taken root in this ambitious go-getter where they saw their surrogate; The public of the depression despised him as the person who could foreclose the mortgage and throw them into the sewer. Composing this problem of character choice is Lloyd's perception as an incurable lover. Sincerity, of course, is a subjective assessment, but it is undeniable that Lloyd, despite his own tragic education, has never been able to interpret a convincing and introverted. Maybe it's because he was afraid of going back to that state permanently. CAT'S-PAW fails for these reasons, but only suffers from the revelation of Lloyd's pro-fascist agenda. Many film scholars believe that Lloyd was driven to make this film because he saw the FDR presidency as a dictatorship determined to immerse the rich and the weak in crime. We should remember that he was not alone in this feeling. DeMille had directed THIS DAY AND AGE, a state police drama the previous year. We should also remember that America was founded by those who start showing taxes and continue to be motivated by those who want something without paying it. TCP suffered because he treated fascism lightly in a "comedy" and because his release was particularly inappropriate given the events in Germany that year. The 1934 Production Code would eventually limit the glorification of the vigilante's justice and would reaffirm the rule of constitutional law, however cumbersome it might be. The ideal of the benevolent despot, the omnipotent and well-intentioned leader who produces a utopia freed from the checks and balances of this omnipotence, goes back to classical antiquity. For this reason, totalitarian regimes fear laughter even if it acts as a safety valve. Ironically, the simple existence of TCP, a film that demonizes the democratic experience of the country of origin, shows that FDR's America was safe enough to accept criticism. There are no parallel criticisms of Hitler's Germany, of Stalin's USSR or of Mussolini's Italy. But can one laugh at the mood of the waiting fascism gallows? Lloyd's unfunded film is distorted to the right and may have been written by Dr Goebbels himself if he had a sense of humor, of course. Puts an alternative story in which a chosen person restores the order and has lost the honor WITH ALL THE NECESSARY MEANS, and does it with good nature and fun. Imitating fascism approached from the left is, of course, THE GREAT DICTATOR of Chaplin. This last film has the advantage of being set in another country and based on real characters and subtly veiled events. Today, the Great Dictator produces few laughs because he underestimates the extent of human evil, but succeeds despite his unjustified and inappropriate definition, since it has the clear advantage of being claimed by history. Lloyd, however, should be credited for two things: first, he did not make other pro-fascist films nor did he subsequently produce films that were hyper-critically pro-allied during the war: secondly, he never sold TCP to television. The post-1945 world had seen the face of fascism and was not funny.
