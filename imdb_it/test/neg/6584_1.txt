The Polar Express. Director Robert Zemeckis, I love Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Contact and Who Framed Roger Rabbit (NO QUESTION REQUEST AFTER THAT FILM TITLE !!). And Tom Hanks, one of my favorite actors. The reviews of this film have been almost unanimous in saying that this is an instant holiday classic. Ebert & Roeper give him two ENTUSIASTIC thumbs up! Even the written review of Ebert gave a full four stars! Wow ... OK ... this I have to see! But wait ... the motion capture used seems really weird. Hmm ... maybe I'm not so interested in seeing it anymore. <br /> <br /> "Well, are you coming?" says the boy's ticket collector in The Polar Express. The boy is reluctant at first and the train starts without him. The boy soon changes his mind and jumps on board just in time. <br /> <br /> Now, most of you have probably decided not to board this train and wait for the TV train or express hire (hee hee, I'm so witty and smart). I, on the other hand, was like the guy who was skeptical at first, but jumped forward to see what it was. <br /> <br /> I just wasted $ 10 and two hours of my life. <br /> <br /> I can't even begin to explain stomach pain. The Polar Express was so painful that it wasn't even funny. There is no history. There are no profits. You sit there through this series of events and you ask yourself "is there a point in all this?" It would be one thing if the scenes were fun ... but they are not. <br /> <br /> This film is devoid of any emotion, any soul, any ounce of plausibility, and above all: any fun. This film is NOT FUN. <br /> <br /> And let's talk about how these characters look for a second. Saying that it is the same technology (motion, sorry, acquisition "PERFORMANCE") used to make Gollum is a real shame because Gollum was believable !!! Photorealism does not translate well in this medium. Are you using animation, why not design the characters to be more expressive? Or why not film everything with real actors? They certainly could have. We as people know all too well how we walk, talk, interact with things. Seeing it on the screen unconvincingly is not impressive. The convincingly caricatures are all the more credible, as The Incredibles demonstrated. The result of The Polar Express is now like taking dead bodies of dead children and turning them into puppets. They move and talk, but where is the heart? Where is the soul? This is what we are seeing on the screen. UGH UGH UGH UGH UGH! This movie is so horrible! <br /> <br /> There is a scene at the beginning of the film in which the boy takes a girl's train ticket from his seat because he got up and left it. He wants to give it to her but you sit there going "why ??!" Forget it ... she's coming back! Obviously he loses his ticket and follows "the adventure". And then there's a guy who's stuck in the back of the train all the time, and they bring him some hot chocolate, but can't he come and join the rest of the kids? And then there's this annoying "I know everything" guy with the voice of a 35-year-old. It's all so very disturbing. <br /> <br /> Oh and there are songs! A girl goes to the back of the train where the lonely boy is. He's singing a song to himself. And then he interrupts and joins! They finish the song while holding hands, looking into each other's eyes as if they were lovers. Very embarrassing. I won't even go into the details of the hot chocolate service song while the waiters dance around the train. "Stay warm, keep it warm!" The only scene where Tom Hanks slips to his knees with his arms stretched in the air must be one of the most memorable scenes in the history of bad scenes. <br /> <br /> I have to stop now or I'll kill myself. I need to look at something crappy to clean the palette. Yes ... crappy is better than The Polar Express. <br /> <br /> "The only thing about trains, no matter where you are going, what matters is deciding to move on." <br /> <br /> Don't get on this. For the love of God, I have decided for you! This is just another movie based on an incredibly thin stretched children's book in the form of a movie. It happened with the Grinch and The cat in the hat and even those were horrible. But who can blame them? I bet if I took the book, The Tous Much Junk Food from The Berenstein Bears, and turned it into a feature film, it would probably be boring too. But at least ... there would be a story and a point, which is what the Polar Express misses.
