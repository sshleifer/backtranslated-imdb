Well, I probably would agree with all the negative comments on this film so honestly I thought it was a piece of shit I mean the actors had done a terrible job of acting and the script was terrible. Although the special effects weren't a little ugly, but I think it should have been a lot more difficult. I mean, as Clara Bryant did in putting this film into success, I mean that she would do a lot better if she looked a little further and that goes for Kristen, I mean her character dies and doesn't bother trying to defend I mean it must be a complete joke. He should at least do much better than what makes a soldier or more heroin or something. But the point is that the actors did a completely soulless job and so did the director and screenwriter who made this film. they should have gone to film school to think of some better ideas and I hope everyone agrees with my methods because they are probably thinking the same thing.
