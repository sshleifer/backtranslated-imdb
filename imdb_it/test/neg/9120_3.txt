I suggest if you've already seen the original American Graffiti, don't see this movie. If you haven't seen the original, I still don't recommend it, but it will be much less painful to watch. The characters in the first film are fantastic and you eventually fell in touch with them. This film aims to show how bad their lives have become. It's a task to keep an eye on! <br /> <br /> Set over the New Year of 1964, '65, '66 and '67, we have four stories about the characters in the first movie. In '64, we have John Milner (Paul Le Mat) who is now a professional runner. He meets Eva, a foreign girl, and although his plot is not going anywhere, it is the best of the four. In 1965, we have Toad (Charles Martin Smith) who is stuck in Vietnam and, more than anything else, wants to go out. Try to find ways to hurt yourself or do stupid things to get out. In '66 we have Debbie (Candy Clark), the girl that Toad picked up in the first movie. Now she's a steaming hippie, and I'm actually not sure what her plot was. He was going to a concert ... not much happened. Finally, in 1967, Steve Bolander (Ron Howard) and Laurie Bolander (Cindy Williams) are having marital problems that end in a demonstration against the war and in a police action. <br /> <br /> None of these stories is very good. The script in some parts shows very bad dialogues. These poor characters that I enjoyed so much in the first film, ended up where I am ... why? Why was this sequel realized? I imagine that if a sequel were made, it would have to represent the Vietnam War, and the hippies and the police action, but the real thing is that this film should not have been made. <br /> <br /> The management was elegant, but it amounts to a huge headache. Each story has a different style. Milner's is just a normal screen (depending on how you look at it), and it's shot the way the rest of the movie should be. The plot of Toad was shot in 16 mm, and what amounts to is a poor quality photo, which is the size of a small box in the center of the screen. Debbie's plot is shot in multiscreen. At some point there may have been a screen, but for the most part, it's anywhere from two to twenty screens at once. Don't worry about trying to follow the screens, since nothing happens. The plot of Steve and Laurie has the strangest film style. Style really means nothing and is stupid and meaningless. Instead of just a full screen, it's a condensed widescreen that looks like a full-screen version of the widescreen. Even if I don't like others, at least I understand what they were looking for, this makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Music is the saving grace of this film, not that it could save this! Bob Dylan, Simon and Grafunkel, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and dozens of others have beautiful songs featured here. They don't save functionality, they only make it a little better than it is. It's still bad! <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a useless sequel. Any fan of the original should avoid this lackluster sequel! <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 on ****. 110 PG minutes for language, drug use and violence
