This was painful! Recently donated as a free DVD with a British newspaper, this 1977 British-Belgian co-production (it may have tricked me, at least looks like ten years older than that) is quite deservedly obscure and if you do it over half - your brand, you consider yourself a trouper. The combination of animation and live action is at the limit and in the worst case it is even terrible, which suggests the reason why it was even decided to attempt to make the film this way when the technology clearly was not really there. Harris is nothing but a human object and the animation is among the flattest and lifeless I have seen, with the obligatory "trippy" moments (especially where the animation of the brain-type Subtracto character is involved) that made countless characteristic cartoons from the late sixties onwards immediately dated. Don Black's script provides a convincing argument for the usually resilient lyricist to stick to what he does best, and the pace is so slow that even the very young will be bored. As for adults, follow Jonathan Swift's original novel.
