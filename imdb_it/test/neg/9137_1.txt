Director Godfrey Reggio must be a very charming and persuasive man for this frighteningly messy project of having seen the light of day. Reggio's message, so powerful and resonant in his previous two Qatsi films, is hopelessly confused here. Athletes, equations, oceans, keyboards, laughing heads, etc. They get confused without purpose. The parade of trivial images is mostly generic titles from Getty Images and others, and digital manipulations of heavy hands are amateurish in the worst imaginable way. Surely someone involved (Steven Soderbergh, executive producer?) Could he say that applying a solarization filter on almost any frame was a VERY BAD idea? The rough loop, the layering and distortion of the images recalls a freshman's Photoshop class. And to make matters worse, computer animation sequences are more naive than a 80s Wall Street pie chart. This does not mean that the improved aesthetics alone would have saved this film, but some little effort in this direction could have made it tolerable as a visual fodder for the accompanying music. I feel obliged to point out that the score of Philip Glass will surely satisfy his fans. Not a radical departure, but rather a refinement of what Glass does best with Yo Yo Ma's adorable violin contributions. If you decide to watch this movie, be sure to focus your attention on the short opening sequence. While you may already be familiar with the Michigan Central Railroad station, once majestic but long abandoned, 89 minutes later you will find yourself remembering this image of the 20th century decay as the critical point where you should go to the EXIT / press the STOP button, etc. You have been warned.
