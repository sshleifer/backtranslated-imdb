Okay, I'm a low-cost horror fan, who along with it, occasionally gets a piece of junk that even the most diehard campers fan can't stand to witness ... TRANCERS 6, direct by Jay Woelfel of DEMONICUS. <br /> <br /> First of all, the TRANCERS series, started in the mid-80s by Charlie Band and his Empire Pictures, is basically the franchise that is due to Tim Thomerson and his excellent performance as the hunter of trance Jack Deth. Well, low and behold, due to the weakened budgets of Full Moon's features (which, despite what people have said, have actually carried out very high quality features, like HELL ASYLUM and DEAD & ROTTING), Thomerson is not back for the sixth Full Moon writer Courtney Joyner returns once more and offers another below-average script, with Jack Deth (played by Thomerson ... in flashbacks, which are extremely badly inserted ... has a different cut of hair as every time it is shown, and a bit of "hemp" on a table) that goes down along the thread of his daughter's body. Well, from here on out, you have "Jo Deth" behaving like Jack ... but it's a shame that you don't really emit the same stage presence as Jack Deth. <br /> <br /> The film, shot at 16mm, is, simply put, an embarrassment for the name of TRANCERS ... without offense to anyone at Young Wolf Productions. I mean, I respect you for wanting to jump and make a TRANCERS movie without Tim, but with a little more time (although it has been shot since December 2001), it could have been better. <br /> <br /> However, check out the Full Moon DVD, which is a dual function with the original TRANCERS, and features trailers for the last 10 Full Moon features. <br /> <br /> Overall, I probably would have liked to have more features if it didn't have the name TRANCERS, but like anything, you can judge it in the opinion of someone and you have to check it for yourself!
