Wow !! I didn't even know about this movie until I was looking for the name of another Mark Hamill classic (Time Runner). Some things are better left unknown. The role of Mark Hamill is rather ... limited. I would compare his appearance in this film with all those appearances by Vincent Price and Christopher Lee in those bad horror movies of the 60s and 70s. In those films, they appeared in the first and last 5 minutes of the film. Mark's memorable acting with phrases as big as "Don't try to escape, you're under arrest". I already said that he said that EXACT thing more than once. Bill Paxton fell into a drug spiral like Uzumaki and alcohol after Aliens, because he ended up in this film after waking up on set after a binge session. The HAIR .. the HAIR !!! .. Bill without price. Really should have been "GAME OVER" for Bill .. but somehow .. he got a treatment .. and it went on better ??? movie. This movie is blowing. It's more boring and boring than The Crazies. At least that movie was crazy ... that's just boring. DO NOT WATCH THIS SOBER FILM.
