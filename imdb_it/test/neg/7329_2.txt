This film is available as a special "bonus" feature on the double Horror 101 and Horror 102: Endgame disc. It has nothing to do with those films, except that it shows that the producers / directors Dudelson and Clavell are in a groove. Like those other films, this includes the young people who go to a building where they are trapped inside and run through the corridors a lot while being picked one by one. Eventually one or more characters reveal they have another identity. This is by far the worst of the three. <br /> <br /> Here, people are invited to a single Halloween night at the Museum of the Dead. The museum does not have many exhibitions and they are all species of ancient Central American relations. In the museum there are also carnivorous zombies, which spread infections and an ancient cannibal warrior and two female warriors. <br /> <br /> The film is very repetitive. It kills people fast enough, to the point that you wonder who they left to kill - at that point some people will present themselves without explanation, so they can be killed. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, one of the characters has a cell phone, and is actually able to call the police, who actually takes it seriously and shows up at the museum. When one tries to take the padlock to enter, the other tells him that it would be "forced entry". If you have people trapped in a wounded building, I think it's irrelevant. Even the cops are stupid when they shoot a zombie on their head, but then they shoot other zombies in their chest and don't go down. You happen to shoot another zombie on your head, and go down. They continue to shoot the rest of the zombies in the chest. Stupid. <br /> <br /> The opening credits and a nightmare sequence are done in a sort of animation effect on the video, a sort of Waking Life thing about a poor man, but not so much like cartoons. It's a bit interesting, however, parts of some of the attacks are done the same way, so there's no logic. <br /> <br /> Dreadful.
