In 1990 I saw Kathy Ireland in person - I was at UNT in Denton during the filming of "Necessary Roughness". Strangely, the voice he is using in this film is not too far removed from his true speaking voice. <br /> <br /> However, the plot goes like this: Kathy receives a letter telling her that her father fell into a bottomless pit in Africa. He goes and investigates the site of his father's death, only to be sucked into an underground world that is partly a dystopian nightmare, a non-exciting fantasy, and inhabited by Plasmatic waste. This movie really wastes Linda Kerridge's talent, which, in my opinion, could have been someone if she got that one role that was right for her. However, the main hero of the story, Gus, is a rip-off of Mark "Jacko" Jackson. The original is annoying enough to start with, but this guy is really a torture to watch. Eventually the misty Wanda comes out of its shell and ends up wearing a bikini and a pareo at the end. If you're going to have Kathy Ireland in a skimpy movie, you'd better be a bikini. However, the film was all wrong and rightly skewered by the MST3K. <br /> <br /> Avoid this if possible.
