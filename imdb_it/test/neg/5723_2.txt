Summary: as the warrior queen Gedren bred and slaughtered most of Sonja's family, she trained in the art of sword fighting. Now, Gedren has taken a very powerful talisman, which threatens to destroy the world if not destroyed, killing Sonja's sister in the process. Now Sonja is out for revenge and to save the world. Along the way he meets the very similar to Conan (but not Conan, no!) Kalidor, the child-prince Tarn and his bodyguard Falcon. At first Sonja declines all help, but later he is forced to accept it, and together they go to save the world. <br /> <br /> Comments: When you watch a movie like this, and you think it's the story that is the best element of this movie, the movie is in trouble. Because 1) a film like this should draw strength from good fighting and effects, and 2) the story is really, really bad. It's simple and simple and actually offers nothing in terms of character development or suspense. It is predictable and boring, and the obvious couple, Sonja and Kalidor, have no chemistry. And the boy is just annoying. And most of the scenes are designed so long that they become boring. Although the film is not very long, it does not have enough material to fill its time. And so we return to point 1). Combat is slow, uneventful and really ugly. It clearly shows most fighters clearly blocking the opponent's blows long before the opponent has even started to hit. In my honest opinion, I believe that most children, fighting with sticks, create more exciting fights by playing knights than this film did. All in all, this is a really bad spin-off, which should be avoided by everyone who loved Conan movies. <br /> <br /> 2/10
