This film started quite well, maintaining the mood of the book quite well even though the acting was not top-notch. The soundtrack was torturously bad. Saxaphone and electric guitars? It was incredibly incongruous. The female singer was definitely sad! In the second part of the film the story takes a decidedly darker turn. Too dark for Austen. Northanger Abbey is a dark and frightening place, while in the book it was disappointingly domesticated and modernized for Catherine's eyes. <br /> <br /> Who the hell is this marquise with the horrendous make-up and wig? A character totally foreign and not necessary. <br /> <br /> One of the key elements of the book is the general is not a Gothic monster like the characters in Catherine's books. His monstrosity is much more complicated in his oppression of his children's spirits and in his treatment of Catherine based on monetary concerns alone. He doesn't block his wife or kill her, but sends Miss Morland on a 70-mile journey alone in a rented carriage with not enough money to pay for the way home. Only the friendliness of her friend Miss Tilney in giving her money as she walks out the door prevents her from getting stuck. This whole point is seriously confused in the film. They make the General too dark from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Peter Firth shouldn't have sung! This part was painful to watch. His representation of Tilney was not so bad, but in some places it was dark. Henry Tilney of the book played Miss Morland's imagination during a trip to Northanger but it was never dark. Firth would have benefited from a better direction. The young woman who played Isabella needed a better acting teacher. John Thorpe was appropriately hateful. The combination of striped waistcoat and coattails he wore was horrible! Surely it fits his character. <br /> <br /> I think the film would have gone much better with a completely different soundtrack. He threw an oppressive hood over the whole film. If I look at it again, it will be turned off and subtitled. Maybe I'd give the movie a 4 then. <br /> <br /> The sound quality of the DVD was rather poor. The image quality was not much better. This is evident in digital television. <br /> <br /> When I think about what this film might have been, I think of Persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.
