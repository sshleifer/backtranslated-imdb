The White Warrior is definitely one of, if not Steve Reeves' weakest films. Set in the 18th or 19th century, Russia (??) Steve plays a Cossack warrior who tries to defeat a crazy Russian tsar by running from a mountain with his rebel band in a stupid-looking Russian white tunic ... For the most part of the physicist Reeves is hidden in a silly knee-length tunic, with a Russian hat that looks even more silly. <br /> <br /> The action is rather minimal, with only a good wrestling scene from the middle of life up that shows the great physicist Reeves. This is an obvious attempt by the producers to move Reeves out of the sword and sandal genre in another historical era, with poor results. Dialogue from the script is difficult to understand at various points, and only the narrator's comments allow the viewer to understand what is really going on from one scene to another. I would imagine Reeves regretting having made this film, but in an attempt to get out of his toga and sandals and armor stands he helped him launch it into other historical figures such as Morgan the Pirate and the Thief of Baghdad.
