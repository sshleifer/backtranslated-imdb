As a serious marathon runner, I was seriously disappointed with this movie. Its target audience is clearly those who have never run a marathon, or novice marathon runners. Following the stories of two first-time marathon runners, an elder, an injured runner and two elites as they prepare for the Chicago marathon, the film devotes most of its attention to a female beginner whose history is, for lack of of a better word boring While I enjoyed the brief glimpses of Deena Kastor's training sessions, the brief history of the Boston marathon and the marathon in general, I would like to emphasize: these were short! Watching some Joe Runners prepare for a Saturday run with their water bottles and talk about how they see the marathon is not inspiring, and the incessant clich√©s about success and the smiling runners will make you want the movie to be about an hour long. shorter. If you are a marathon runner for the first time, this film can give you the feeling of "I can do it". For anyone else, run away.
