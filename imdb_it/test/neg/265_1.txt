Ocean's Twelve: simply stupid, bad and nothing compared to the other two. <br /> <br /> An art theft. 10 known actors, at least. A weak script and a very slow development idea. This is why I feature a film that I've only seen for at least 20 minutes. Don't get me wrong, you might like it. But I only like Ocean movies because of the Heist theme. If Ocean's 12 is not about Heist, then what's the point of seeing it? Glad Soderberg saw his main mistake and redeemed himself by making a film far superior to the first. Congratulations for that. <br /> <br /> Steven Soderberg is not really a good director. Apart from his success "Sex lies and videotapes" ... nothing else has happened so much to this director's career. Shame on him But only his fault.
