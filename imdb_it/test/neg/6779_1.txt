The problem with this - and with all the films of the Vietnam war - is that they are all too biased. Anti-war films ignore the fact that the vast majority of US soldiers were heroes, while prowar films overlook the fact that many soldiers have committed atrocities like that in this film. This movie sucks. It is time for a film that is neither war nor against war, neither liberal nor conservative, but COMPLETELY ENGAGED.
