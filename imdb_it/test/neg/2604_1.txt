I have to admit that I enjoyed the previous episodes, but probably because I was younger and more stupid at the time. I was a little excited about the return of the family boy until I saw the "new" crap they were putting out. No surprise, it was exactly like the old shit. All the limping jokes were there, including the flashbacks, but this time they added a joke about an old disturbing pedophile that seems to be in EVERY SINGLE EPISODE. this is just one of the annoying gags that the family lives on, and for some reason people keep watching. it's no longer fun, it's just annoying. let him die. <br /> <br /> maybe a family boy was fun at one time, and the cheap laughs and gags were original and fresh, but now it's not fun anymore. if you actually find a funny family boy, you must be delayed or delayed borderline.
