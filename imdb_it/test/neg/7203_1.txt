I rented this film with the impression that it was "Scarecrow 3: Dark Harvest", thinking it was a continuation in the Scarecrow series (another series of extremely ridiculous films and all at once terrible). I was not disappointed though. It was just as terrible, if not worse, than I expected. I was laughing throughout the film. Every piece of bad acting, badly shot and cut movies, and terrible special effects is what makes this movie worth renting. <br /> <br /> The special features include a pathetic vision of the six months of filming of the cast and crew. <br /> <br /> Preferred line, "The sins of my ancestors! They have arrived at this moment!"
