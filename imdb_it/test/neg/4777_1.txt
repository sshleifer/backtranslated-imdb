Plants in an ancient Mayan pyramid structure that kills all those approaching. Yes, it's weird, since travelers don't understand until everything starts to go crazy. And in a film like this, I just wanted it to be absurd and musical bands attacked by machetes wielding plants. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a group of people from vacation in America and go to the mountains with a couple of other newly made German friends who know the place. When they arrive, the Maya begin to scream at them and hide on the structure. And when there is, it is when the plants decide to take them out, imitating the noises of cell phones, humans and ancient Maya deaths. <br /> <br /> Nothing was really scary for the film and it wasn't even funny. Not even the strange ending could save this piece of shit. I kept looking for something really nice, but nothing. Oh good. "F"
