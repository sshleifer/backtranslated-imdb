If you like bad movies for the entertainment of watching bad movies, bad acting, bad production, etc., the quality of Mystery Science Theater 3000 ... you'll like Pacific Hell. Jim Brown will always be remembered as one of the greatest soccer players I have ever played in this game ... as an actor he will forever be remembered as one of the greatest soccer players ever to play ... I'm not sure who he is Rolf Bayer was ... but I hope he was 15 or 16 when he directed this, maybe it could have been the next Spielberg being worked on ... because if he were a grown man who ran this ... a 15 or 16 year old could have do better ... The base or the plot of the film probably had some historical value and maybe even accurate veritieromente ... but the real film could be one of the worst films made in the history of American cinema ... I expected that Lee Marvin , William Holden or Charles Bronson entered to somehow save whatever "face" remained of this film. I would have loved to have been on the red carpet, black gala gala for the opening of Hollywood when this film premiered ... since this film had to have many viewers laughing and laughing softly ... it's on the dime DVD rack now .. .. look for the value of entertainment ... this movie is so ugly that it's too good to pass ...
