If you are a sane person and have seen films before, then you cannot tolerate this piece of idiocy for more than 20 minutes. And if you stay there longer, it won't be because you would expect akshay or paresh (please don't govinda!) But because you value your money too much and want at least a short nap on the luxurious seat in the multiplex in exchange for money they have you robbed! It is hard to believe that the director who gave us a cult movie like HeraPheri can fall to such levels .. it's okay it's repetitive but now it's coming out of all the rankings of third level and expects us to laugh because it was brought in Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar. ..! No, this won't work now ... especially with this stupid script of yours! Even comedy films can have significant scripts (Lage Raho Munnabhai anyone?). <br /> <br /> Govinda doesn't have much to do, so I can't comment ... Akshay Kumar was boring, Paresh Rawal broke some of the worst possible jokes. Lara Dutta had a real margin to act in this, but failed miserably ... the only high point in the film (maybe) is Tanushree's acting! But she is only there for the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> I don't think this movie is worth more space ... (probably not even that much!). So the last warning: don't watch it!
