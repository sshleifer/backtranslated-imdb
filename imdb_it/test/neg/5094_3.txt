A good example of inverted, politically correct racism, in which white men are presented as senseless brutes who are there only to be slaughtered and for their Aboriginal adversaries as noble heroes, superior in both their appearance and their abilities. In addition to making the story too boring, this also prevents the neutral viewer from identifying with one or the other side - it's too simplistic. The repetitive score is incredibly annoying (like the voiceover), the characters lack depth and the viewer is soon lost between questions like "who is this character" and "what the hell should mean". The photography is wonderful, though, and overall there is a lot of atmosphere, but the beautiful views of the misty landscapes alone do not save this film. The DVD box uses Kiefer Sutherland as an eye attraction. In fact, his character could have been interpreted by anyone else because in practice it is just an empty shell (like most non-Maori characters), and disappears anyway in the middle of the film. But if you're keen to see Jack Bauer in a kilt, it's your kind of movie ...
