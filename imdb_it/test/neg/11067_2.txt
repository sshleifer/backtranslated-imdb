I haven't laughed so long - or seen a movie so inept done! Talk about so bad that you make me laugh! <br /> <br /> Firstly, I think that for about 40% of the length of the film, I could not say what was happening, indeed, even what I was seeing. I can only describe the work of the camera as frantic meets the LSD. There are entire segments, long minutes, in which all you can see are blurred flashes and fragments of cave walls, people and various other unidentifiable things. I spent half the movie asking my teenage daughters what was happening, but they couldn't follow him better than me. <br /> <br /> Then there are the "black" moments, when you try to scare us (woooooooo) everyone's lights go out and the screen turns pitch black - and I don't mean just for a few seconds. I think the longest lasted almost two minutes. I imagine the blank movie is a way to keep costs down ... I suspect the "director" recently read a book about all the "must-do's" to make a film of fear, and decided to throw them all inside - about 20 times each. <br /> <br /> There are three positive things about this movie: 1 / It is short at 90 minutes (although still an hour and a half too long!) 2 / All the characters die (after all, it's impossible to take care of any of them). 3 / There was a really good scene - when the group is looking at the well that came down, after discovering the rope that fell on the bottom (saw THAT it's coming), a big rock is pushed through the opening, sealing them. I WASN "I was expecting this, and it was really chilling. <br /> <br /> And what happens to the first scenes of the fire with the shot, after the shot, after shooting from behind the camp lights. I swear the director he used almost the same shot about 20 times in 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> And I'm sure after the first kill, the same HOT blood film on the cave floor is used twice in about 90 seconds. <br /> <br /> All in all, a piece of CRAP film, I will watch almost everything, but this is close to where I would draw the line.
