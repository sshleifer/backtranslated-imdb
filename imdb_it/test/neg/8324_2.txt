(This review is based on the English version) <br /> <br /> The legendary unfinished epic of Orson Welles was just that - unfinished. It should have been left as such, not thrown together in this awkward and boring collection of whatever material was available. <br /> <br /> Although I'm sure it was done with the best intentions, the filmmakers not only failed to do justice to Welles' vision, but they also managed to discredit it by inflicting this version on the public. <br /> <br /> The first thing that strikes the viewer is the amateur quality of the audio. Not only are the new voices dubbed rather scarce, but they are also inconsistent - Welles' original recordings (using his own voice, as he often did) were kept in a handful of scenes, and do not match at all. There was not the slightest attempt at consistency. Add to this an extremely empty sound mix that has only a minimum of sound effects and atmospheres - a long sequence during a big festival (including the running of the bulls) sounds like it's recorded on a deserted suburban street with about three people doing the sound of a crowd that is destined to be among the thousands. <br /> <br /> However, the real problem is the inevitable fact that "Don Quixote" was incomplete, and it is clearly obvious to observe it. The film consists of a handful of scenes put together and dragged into ridiculous lengths only to recover the execution time. Case in point: the sequence in which Sancho searches Don Quixote in the city goes on forever. It is only Sancho who approaches people in the crowd, asking them the same questions over and over again: there is no way that Welles has ever thought of using every single shot in its entirety, but it is what appears here. It lasts more than twelve minutes, when, in reality, it would most probably last about two minutes at the absolute maximum in a correct final version of the film. <br /> <br /> While the beginning of the film is relatively complete and rather well done, the rest has huge holes that simply cannot be filled with endless overlaps of the Spanish countryside and even more shots of Don Chisciotte and Sancho in progress back and forth. There is also no end. No resolution, no conclusion, no final lines, no points. <br /> <br /> Although there is material in private collections that was not available to directors, this could not explain what would be necessary to make it a complete and coherent work. Welles simply didn't complete filming, largely due to the fact that his lead actor died before he could finish. <br /> <br /> However, putting aside the fact that it was not complete, and never could be, I would think that just seeing a collection of films from this masterpiece that could have been would have been enough. Unfortunately, putting it all together in such a slippery way, it leaves a very negative impression on the film. In particular, what was clearly an exceptional performance by Akim Tamiroff is that Sancho is completely destroyed by the new voice and with long and drawn scenes that ultimately make it simply irritating. <br /> <br /> The vision of Orson Welles for this film was something much more ambitious and complex than a simple review of the story of Don Quixote, but it is what has been attempted here, and as such, the point is lost. The only person who could have assembled all the material into something useful would have been Welles himself, and he didn't. <br /> <br /> The movie could have been far better in a documentary that told the whole Welles saga trying to make the film. Welles himself even had the perfect title for such a docum: "When will you finish Don Quixote?"
