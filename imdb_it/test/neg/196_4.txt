I have liked Milos Forman's films since I saw "Someone flew over the cuckoo's nest" and "Amadeus" (two great masterpieces), but when I saw "Capelli", I kept wondering if it was Milos Forman himself. This film is boring and uninteresting to say the least. OK, the music is pretty good, but on the screen it just looks like a bunch of junkies dancing around (wait a minute ... that's what it really is!). In fact, the only interesting part, and the only part in which Milos's talent appears, are the last 15 minutes or so, (SPOILER !!) since Berger replaces Claude as a soldier destined for the Vietnam war. That 15 minutes are moving and well directed, but it is a pity that we have to endure such horrible material before that. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe this is one of those movies that you have to be "on the subject" to enjoy (the subject is marijuana, acid and other drugs that the film glorifies). I'm not, so ...
