It's sad that some people think it's worth watching this movie. I'm Russian and I'm disgusted. There is nothing in this film that deserves praise except cinematography. However, I am not one of those who find beauty in death or perversion. I think this film is poorly designed and directed. There is nothing more irritating and even irritating than shameless speculation in art (if you can call this garbage). Balabanov wanted to shock the viewers with a pervasive evil, and managed to create a hopelessly dark film. But the biggest shock is Balabanov's primitive directorial work. I would never recommend any of my friends to watch it. Huge disappointment!
