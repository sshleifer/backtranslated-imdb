What a sad surprise. <br /> <br /> Being a huge fan of the original series (played by Don Adams) I couldn't wait to do it. Poor fellow, poor me. This is more foolish and more cerebral dead than the bottom of a monkey. <br /> <br /> To say that it was bad would be a severe euphemism. It's / was the worst movie (well the first 30 minutes of one) I've seen for a long time. I could no longer stand the first half hour, preferring to watch my hard disk de-fragment. <br /> <br /> I can tolerate evil ... bad is O.K., sometimes even cute. But with a disgust from Hollywood (and this must be the worst in many years) I won't. This film is a serious insult to the collective intelligence of humanity! My five year old daughter could have written better - and she's not even dyslexic !!! I'm really tempted to try looking at the rest, but I'm afraid I have better things to do ... like making pizza dough and watching it grow. <br /> <br /> What a sad disappointment. No ... I was annoyed! What a scam! As Mel Brookes once said; "Piece of shirt!"
