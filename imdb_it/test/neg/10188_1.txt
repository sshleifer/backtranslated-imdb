This film was a great bait and switch. I rented it because of Rebecca St. James, a popular Christian singer. I met her and wondered what she would do in a UFO movie. Well ....... <br /> <br /> I think he starred in this film to help a friend or friend of a friend. My first clue that this film was not what it should have been was when I saw the special effects of UFO meetings. Cheesy! As the film progressed, I noticed how plastic the actors were. It was funny how almost everyone in the movie wore solid colors. (There are some exceptions). <br /> <br /> Rebecca was disappointing verrryyy. He is always at home and does not show the realistic facial expressions of the one whose husband has returned to the fold. Never leaves home? <br /> <br /> I had to turn the film off several times to finish it. I hope Rebecca does not believe the message of this film - believe in what we believe or suffer and go to hell. Jesus spread a message of love and hope. His message inspired others to change OUT OF LOVE, NOT FEAR.
