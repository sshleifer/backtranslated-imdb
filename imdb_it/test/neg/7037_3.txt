Although I rarely happened to fly, I am very interested in aviation ... and this film has been added to the precious stock of aeronautical cinema. <br /> <br /> 1. Why is the captain performing ground checks? Why do you also measure engine oil levels? With delivery times of up to 15 minutes in commercial aviation this is not a typical pre-flight check. <br /> <br /> 2. WHY is Captain KICK opposed to the aircraft wheel? Strange type of pressure control. Or anger management :-) <br /> <br /> 3. The cockpit has a crew of 3. All the large western two-engine jets built since the 1980s have a crew of 2. Now try to imagine how old the movie script is. <br /> <br /> 4. A helicopter can fly alongside the paralyzed airliner. It must be fast ... and the captain's words to explain the "maneuver" to the passengers are really hilarious! <br /> <br /> 5. With the elevator rudders stopped it is always possible to lower the nose of the plane. It happens, for example, when an airplane moves slower than stall speed. <br /> <br /> 6. The rudders of the lift have hydraulic actuators. Probably, after colliding with the business plan, they would have cut the hydraulic lines and therefore would have rendered them unusable for the steering, but would NOT have repaired them in certain positions. <br /> <br /> 7. The fire in the aft galley was a stupid idea. Was it designed to show that only gentlemen ask for a fire extinguisher and fight fire, regardless of who was actually trained to do so? the flight attendant. <br /> <br /> 8. At the time of the collision, the aircraft's elevators would be in a neutral position. The film could have ended up here ... <br /> <br /> 9. The flight engineer (the third person in the cockpit) has three bars on his uniform. In reality, flight engineers have two. <br /> <br /> 10. Why does the captain cut the cabin of the cabin with an ax to examine the damage? I thought it would have been the duty of the flight engineer, since he would have had to carry out technical checks before and after the flight. <br /> <br /> 11. In every plane, there is no unused space. At least commercial planes cannot afford the luxury of a compartment that can be filled with tons of water. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on ... but in the end I laughed hysterically about how screenwriters imagine air disasters! Woooohooo! Most airline disasters occur in such a short span of time that it is simply not possible to take 90-minute shots from them. But you can always fill 90 minutes with crap to suck and crazy bullshit, regardless of gender.
