Allow me to break this film down for you ... <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes are a showcase for terrible special effects. I'm not the type to debunk special effects, but what you need to understand is that if you can't afford good special effects, you shouldn't anchor your film to special effects. The spaceships shoot bullets of color towards each other, exploding in series explosions, and carinating the moons of the past with a number of polygons low enough to count with the fingers. You will have no idea what is happening. It does not make sense. <br /> <br /> The second act involves a woman walking in the desert. At this point you will be treated with deserted landscapes and boring and illogical fight scenes. Nobody talks. Nothing interesting happens The objectives of the protagonist are not clear and are not very convincing. This goes on for about 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> Then, in a five-minute montage, it creeps into an enemy base, binds to a rocket, tries to destroy a weapon of judgment day, fails and dies. <br /> <br /> None of this affects the eventual direction of the film. <br /> <br /> In the last twenty minutes, the chick's memories are transferred to her daughter, who goes into stasis for a very large number of years, learning the secrets of humanity. After this, we see the first, and the last five-minute segment of human interaction in the film, so the new heroine is forced to choose whether she wants to become part of the material that causes the big bang or not. You know. Because when the universe is collapsing, you have to decide if you want to be part of it. <br /> <br /> Choose yes. BUT THE MEMORIES OF HUMANITY SURVIVE IN A CAPSULE. Maybe we won't make the same mistakes again, eh? If you like movies with characters, then this is not a good movie for you. The main roles could be fully satisfied by any old spring toy that could stand upright while walking in the sand. The whole story is told through a painfully boring narrative. <br /> <br /> The film tries to sound profound by throwing together a lot of undeveloped science fiction ideas. There are enough concepts to feed a number of films, but as it is, it is filled with completely irrelevant details. Two-thirds of this film could have been reduced to a 45-second edit. Instead, the narrator fills the historical value of a story without ever giving us a reason to worry about what happens to the characters. <br /> <br /> There are good ideas here, but nobody watches movies to see ideas explained in an inept way. People watched movies for fun. This film does not entertain.
