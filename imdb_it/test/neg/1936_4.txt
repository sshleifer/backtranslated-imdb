My opinion: even a splendid underwater photograph can save a familiar script and very thin characters. <br /> <br /> For those who have not yet had enough of the FREE WILLY photos, FLIPPER could offer a decent rental. Others (strongly) suggest staying away. Although FLIPPER is a harmless affair, it hardly shows anything for the adult public (unless it's the first time you see a dolphin). <br /> <br /> A remake of a TV show and movie from the 60s, FLIPPER might seem like a good idea at that time: a dolphin enchants the life of a boy and a girl, helps protect the environment eliminating first the toxic waste thrown into the sparkling waters of the Florida Keys and, at the same time, fighting a shark and a bad of the salty sea that seems to be responsible for the toxic dumping and that also happens to hate dolphins. But even in the 90s, especially if a strangely similar film like FREE WILLY was a recent success, FLIPPER is just another harmless but occasionally empty splash film for children. Even if the animals (this, in this case, is the main dolphin, a clumsy pelican and a realistic-looking hammerhead shark, typified as the bad guy) and the pristine underwater cinematography steal the show, there's not much in FLIPPER to steal anyway. <br /> <br /> The story is completely predictable, something that today can be evident even to a 6-year-old child. The (Human) cast, led by a pre-LORD OF THE RINGS Elijah Wood and an out-of-work Paul Hogan, rarely has anything to do but stand up and look beautiful. Their recitative abilities, whatever they may be in this film, are rarely revealed on the screen, unless you consider the "acting" talents of allegro Bottlenose Dolphin. I guess you don't try to recommend FLIPPER because family introspection won't be fair, but anyone over 10 (No, you've got it 8), it's better to rent or buy something else. Furthermore, the film lasts about 95 minutes. This could just give you enough time for something else without worrying about your children. Only this could be worth it. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
