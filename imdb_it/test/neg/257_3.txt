In 1932, Humphrey Bogart was an unknown relative - an untested actor who starred in one of his first films. And, since it was unknown, the film that gave him was clearly a B movie - a fast movie with relatively low expectations. After seeing it, I could see why it would take Bogart many more years and another film studio before it became a household name. Although the film is not terrible, it certainly isn't good - making it more of a curiosity than anything seen today. <br /> <br /> Bogart is a pilot who dreams of building his own aircraft engine company. However, when a rich and vacant girl approaches, her dreams all seem to be pending. As one of the characters in the film said, the combination of the two is like oil and water - they just don't mix. <br /> <br /> While Bogart is throwing away his promising career, his sister is going full speed on the road to Skankville - having met a sleazy guy who convinces her to sleep with the rich kids so they can shake them for tons of money! Bogey has no idea that his sister is NOT the actress who claims to be and does not realize later that the rich woman he loves leaves him for the same boy whose lover is .... Sister of Bogart !!! All this leads to a finish that is reasonably pleasant. However, what follows is one of the stupidest scenes I've seen in a long time! By now, the rich lady will not marry the boy who sleeps with Bogey's sister (wow!) But because now she is poor and not good for Bogart, she is about to fly away and kill herself. Bogey finds out, chases the plane on foot, jumps on the plane while taking off and crawls on the fuselage to take control of the plane and save it !!! This is absolutely silly and ridiculous, I found myself laughing hard. Until then, I could have scored a 4 or 5 - this brought the movie to a 3 (as a reviewer gave this to an 8 is beyond me). <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this was a talking and stupid movie. Moreover, for Bogart it's all wrong, since the action hero at the end and the lover who is having fun are horrible games for his character that was so wonderfully created in the early 1940s. Manly and solid fit better to man - one of the great American actors, but clearly out of his element. <br /> <br /> By the way, those who love Pre-Code movies and their adult sensitivity may want to see this. Virtually everyone in the film believes and practices pre-marital sex and Bogey's curses in the film - things you would never have seen after the hardened and more moralistic Code of production was adopted in 1934.
