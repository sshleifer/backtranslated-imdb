Hope Floats with Sandra Bullock is a real disappointment. The story starts ok. Her husband betrays her and she discovers on national television. So he has to rebuild his life. Here it may have become interesting or built into a plot, but you feel so bored. He moves in with his parents and Harry Connick Jr. who plays Justin starts hitting on her. The two have no real chemistry, yet Justin is supposed to be in love with her. The film ends in the way you understand it but you wish it wasn't finished like any other type. They had a good start with this film and could have turned it into something watchable but instead it is a film you would surely want to lose.
