Michael Caine usually appears in both very good ("Blame It On Rio", "Sleuth", "Without A Clue", "Gambit", "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels") or really bad comedies ("Noises Off", "Death becomes "", "Harry & Walter go to NY"). This falls into the second category. <br /> <br /> TA is a comedy that only succeeds in two things: being able to waste a cast that includes Caine, Gambon and Richardson, who have all the comic abilities and who manage to do it mission not to make the viewer laugh. There is not a single really funny moment in here. an unnecessarily complicated story that is simply too annoying to follow (considering it's just a comedy) that the writer (s) forgot to make fun of the damn thing, which, as far as I can remember, is what the whole point of a comedy. <br /> <br /> I've never seen this quest before or Moron. Some people also say "if you are a Moron fan you will like this" bla bla bla. A Moron fan? Does this non-descriptive person really have fans? A comedy as bad as this requires a mega-talent to get a laugh or two, someone like Steve Coogan and not the usual Moron. <br /> <br /> If you are going to make a comedy regarding the actors, at least make them the real idiots they usually are. The characters of Caine and Moron are not stupid enough. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing about this collection of funny scenes is the girl. Only a really horrible writer would think that to make a script spicy it is wise to include a super clever wise boy. Smart-a ** Children are no longer even fun for Bill Cosby fans. In "Little Miss Sunshine" we had a totally normal baby and it was a lot of fun. This stupid book "The child is smarter than the adults" belongs to a film by secular Marx brothers.
