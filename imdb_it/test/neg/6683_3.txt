He missed it at the cinema, but he was always slightly forced. I found it in the coin bin in my local video store for a paltry few dollars! Now will I give it to anyone who wants it? Probably! No intentional plot, one-dimensional characters, plastic world torn from many much better films, no decent dialogue to talk about. Do you know that empty feeling when you come down from ecstasy? It's that feeling right here. The sad thing is that the Australia I know is heading in this direction, without the melodrama and the simple answers. Interesting only to see the old Australian actors (who had to act in their day to get by) against the most recent Australian actors (who have to LOOK WELL to get by). Like a horribly garish narrative presentation to a movie that never starts ... Poor Kylie, started her career as an actress ...
