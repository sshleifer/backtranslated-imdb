"Sex and the City" has great things to do. The problem is that he is afflicted by a series of negative aspects that really hurt the evaluation and the final review for his six seasons. <br /> <br /> The positive things about "SATC" are that many conversations sound like life, romantic stories are interesting, and the characters are fun. <br /> <br /> Bad things are that few women act like complete whores. These four women have so many partners, even lesbians in some episodes, that you have no choice but to roll their eyes for the absolute nonsense. The men of the show are for the most part depicted as superficial, degenerate, liars, cheaters and buffoons. The vulgar language used by these women is far superior to what a normal conversation entails. Why do writers do these things? Clearly, be exaggerated and get your attention. Another thing that bothered me (without spoiling) is how some of the relationships ended. They just didn't sound real to me or to others I discussed this with. <br /> <br /> But, even though I gave the show 2 stars, in the end, I'm glad I saw the show. Actually I've seen every season several times. I recommend the show to anyone who is not offended by a strong word or soft-core pornography. I could have done less with offensive language and nudity and sexual acts, but the love story was very good and the saga ended quite well.
