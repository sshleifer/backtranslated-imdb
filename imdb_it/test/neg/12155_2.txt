The worst movie I've seen in the last 12 months. The plot of the plot was not interesting, the film ended when it became gingesh khan, I always thought that afterwards there was something really interesting. I knew that Mongolia and all the areas where the film was filmed have beautiful landscapes, but the film did not benefit from it. Jokes where really poor. The narrator, Gingesh himself, could have told a little more about the history, traditions of Mongolia, etc. My co-spectator knew nothing about it, so he was a little lost. I couldn't wait to see this movie, but after all I was really disappointed. It was one of the 3 movies I've ever seen at the cinema where I thought I'd leave before the end.
