1) Men older than 25 years who refer to themselves, without irony, as having "game", or who are either a "player" or a "baller". Gentlemen, from here on out it's a rapid descent into the protagonist of your version of "A Night at the Roxbury". <br /> <br /> 2) Say "The V.I.P." The term "V.I.P." by itself it is not bad, but when it is preceded by "The" it instantly becomes part of the Douchebag Dictionary. This is twice as much for whites. <br /> <br /> 3) People who make TV programs based on things they don't know aren't nice and then go on IMDb as "fans", (... right ...) besides, one of which is from the "United States" (hey, me too!) to bitterly insult members of their potential audience for having inevitably thought their show had been crap. Minus 1 additional demerit point if they employ some variation on the oh-snap-nice-one-bro justification that "If you don't like the show, of course you can't fuck." <br /> <br /> 4) Canadian Hip-Hop / R & B sensation Massari ... a random addition to the list at first sight, but at the end of the day Massari gets the face of gas for the simple reason that the its particular the American low-rent brand aping uncool and general Aqua Velva douchebaggery is wedged with the general sensitivity of "Keys to the VIP" <br /> <br /> 5) Last but not least, "Keys to the VIP " ... for all the above reasons and more.
