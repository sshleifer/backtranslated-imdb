I also waited a long time to see this movie. As far as I know, it was never released in Australia, so I eventually found a copy on the net and ordered it. Weeks after the order was confirmed, it finally arrived and I was extremely excited to finally be sitting in front of my TV ready to watch a movie that seemed so interesting and controversial and filmed in an area of ​​the world where there are so many good movies. What a disappointment. In the first few minutes I realized that I had ordered a B selector but I was still full of expectations. I convinced my son (18) to watch him while I love to share when I find a valuable film with good statements and / or narrative lines. About halfway up he got up and said he couldn't stand to look at him any longer, he was so predictable and amateur. I accepted but watched until the end. The acting was atrocious even by the B Grade standards. Even the stereotypes are predictable and I feel for the good people of Lake Arthur, Louisianna who must have laughed after seeing the film and painting them that way. No doubt some racial prejudices still exist in many parts of the world, not only in the United States, but in reality, these days, I doubt they can get away with all the ridiculous alibi presented in this. I had to double check the date the film was made, as their attempts to film the most gruesome scenes were something I would have expected from a high schooler's first attempt to make an "indy" movie. I'd like to see this film put into the hands of experienced writers and directors, it's an old story but it could still punch if tackled professionally. So disappointed after such a long wait and with such high expectations. The soundtrack was probably the only thing I liked.
