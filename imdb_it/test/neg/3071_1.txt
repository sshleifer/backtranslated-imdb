those who read these comments may think we could hold a great movie. I am Portuguese and I am ashamed that this film has become a success in Portugal. He can't really call this cinema. The direction and the "staging" are fundamental (even Ron Howard does better!); the screenplay is bad and pretentious (a very bad Tarantino); the cast is covered by TV stars, models and reality show stars who do nothing to act. When you put these ingredients on a film, obviously, all fans of this type of TV program will go and see. I'm also surprised that people who make comments here on IMDb say this film is a masterpiece. I thought this site was only for people who really love cinema and understand a little about it. All the movies made to be blockbusters in Portgal always use the same ingredients and are always terrible. if you think this film is reasonable, please don't say your love films and cinema.
