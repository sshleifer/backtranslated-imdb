I like vampire movies, I like B movies, I love B vampire movies. But this has almost nothing for it. Part of the acting is horrible, especially by 3 of the male protagonists. The story is not particularly interesting. With a relatively short time of 88 minutes, it still seems too long and you find yourself doing a little fast forwarding. There are a lot of kung-fu vampire attacks. It looks fantastic? It's not when it's done on a low budget. It becomes repetitive very quickly. There's blood and blood, nothing to get excited about. There is a good job of wires where you can see the wires. It has some beautiful landscapes that have been shot in Puerto Rico. <br /> <br /> The rental is not worth it
