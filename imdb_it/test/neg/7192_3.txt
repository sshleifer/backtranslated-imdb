Johnnie (Bert Wheeler) is an aspiring songwriter; Newton (Robert Woolsey) is an aspiring inventor. Both work in a cigar shop in the lobby of an office building. Johnnie wants to sell a song to Winfield Lake, a song publisher who also owns the building. Lake's secretary, Mary (Betty Grable), is Johnnie's lover. When Lake is killed, circumstances conspire to make Mary and Newton think that Johnnie is the murderer. They conspire again to involve Mary, who goes to prison. But who really shot Lake? Who is the Black Widow, the blackmailer who had threatened him? The other characters in this mysterious murder are: Lake's suspicious wife, a self-satisfied private detective, a seemingly slow janitor (Willie Best), Lake's auditor, a songwriter who thinks that Lake is stealing from him and another who thinks everyone is stealing from him. It is up to Newton and his truth machine to reveal the real murderer. <br /> <br /> The baby-voice wheeler and the Woolsey cigar struck me as an arbitrary match, but they did several films together in the 1930s and some of them were fun. <br /> <br /> Not this one. George Stevens, who had an excellent career, directed this sad comedy with a boring, mysterious murder plot. But two scenes are good, and both have Wheeler and Betty Grable singing the excellent "Music in My Heart", written by Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh. The first time, they sing it by climbing a ladder (after which they descend again). Later, Wheeler and Woolsey are on stilts so they can see and talk to Mary, who is in a prison cell on a high floor. Wheeler and Grable sing each other through bars. <br /> <br /> "The Nitwits" has a few laughs, but the level of the play is best illustrated by Woolsey's phrase: "Sonny, you have the brain of a six-year-old child and I bet he too was happy with get rid of it. "Is Groucho watered down? who did not use the "even" superfluous when he said it.
