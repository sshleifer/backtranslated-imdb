Here is a typically Italian post apocalyptic take on the men who hunt / kill for the sports theme The Most Dangerous Game, Turkey Shoot, Gymkata and The Running Man. <br /> <br /> Certainly the film reviewed here is nowhere near is funny as the other items listed and is also dragged down by a poor quality of work, generally bland action sequences, a series of completely tasteless scenes like a prolonged sequence of rapes and some really stupid and illogical points. <br /> <br /> Take for example towards the end of the film, when our hero manages to infiltrate all the villains. He initially kills a sentry and leaves him in his jeep. After the discovery of the aforementioned corpse, the answer of the bad guys? (bearing in mind that our hero has come to kill them all brutally) ?? They decide to wait until the next morning to look for the culprit (!!!!!!!!!!) <br /> <br /> However, I suppose to be honest, the film nevertheless remains on guardable if you can suspend yours disbelief during such stupid scenes and immensely benefits from the presence of the excellent Woody Strode (even if his screen time is very limited) <br /> <br /> It is not a classic anywhere in the imagination but still almost worthy of a watch for Italian B-Movie fans.
