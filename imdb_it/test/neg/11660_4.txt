Like most musicals of the time, it is necessary to verify the reality at the door. Broadway MELODY of 1938 is not even remotely credible or plausible, but it is rather funny in its strange way. This film is really just an excuse to perform the talents of the stars. Some scenes happen as if they were in a review, not in a plot based on the plot. <br /> <br /> Judy Garland shines and it's a shame she has so little to do unless much has been left on the cutting room floor. <br /> <br /> One of the most senseless events is the way in which Eleanor Powell gets a leading role in a Broadway show and Robert Taylor says it will be work, work, work from dawn to dusk. Many scenes pass and there is no work, no evidence ... NOTHING. He needs money to win a horse at an auction. You have no money. Is it not paid while you try? Taylor has to borrow money to help. It should be a great producer of time. He has no money ??? However, they are only two elements in this strange story. <br /> <br /> Musical numbers are wonderful and this saves him from being a total loss. Broadway MELODY OF 1940 is much better as well as Broadway MELODY of 1936.
