This film was not good at all. I was able to see it at a film festival and I didn't appreciate the content I was forced to watch. It is a well-made film about the family that tries to reconnect after the death of the cornerstone of the family (Gabrielle Union) dies. the film stars Billy Dee Williams as Gabrielle's Union's brother. Well, actually, Gabrielle Union played the woman in her early years, which should help explain why the woman was Billy Dee Williams's older sister. This was supposed to be Billy Dee William's worst performance in his career, ever. He didn't seem to remember his lines in some scenes. He was an unlikely character, almost never empathetic, who was the father of a daughter married to a white woman with whom he already had a daughter. The two daughters are now older and while the daughter she had with the white woman (Lucy) was trying to connect with him, the other daughter wanted nothing to do with him. The character of Billy Dee was so pathetic that the only way to convince him to flee Paris for his sister's funeral was to tell him that the funeral had already passed and that his late sister had left him the responsibility of managing his documents . Why did they have to deceive him? Because he didn't like attending funerals. I know. Are you asking "but did not want to participate in the funeral of his sister too?" Yup! He argues that he didn't like being around the forced feelings of emotions that are shared among people who respect each other. He wanted nothing to do with that. Now suppose we identify ourselves in that hole? The rest of the shows in the film were flat with equally flat characters. The director and editor didn't bother to consider the rhythm of the film. Flashbacks were painful to watch. It was a bad movie. However, it seems to be the favorite in black film festivals; a film that enhances the African-American dependence on Caucasians to find a love with which they can establish themselves, even if it is a healthy relationship. When the limping love stories like this win better than the festivals at the black film festivals, it makes me doubt the judgment of the blacks on the films. In these same festivals, the only films that have won awards are educational films on African American culture and black films directed by Caucasian directors. I'm not saying that there is something wrong with a white person who directs stories written for people of color. The problems with these films are that they never discuss from both points of view, which are usually the films that really speak to the masses. These films are often unilateral forms of education. These films fail to implement the powers of both sides of the topic on which the film revolves. The writers and directors never compose the scenes and sequences that contradict your final statement with so much truth and energy as those that strengthen it. These films always put the topic under discussion. What I'm saying is, it's the people who run these black film festivals that judge a film with pure content, which for me means directing, acting, writing cinematography, editing, etc., or are judging movies out of the strict message that Is it delivered on African American culture? Suppose a movie like Constellation could have a cross-section of the world against films like "Million Dollar Baby" and "Sideways?" What happened to the movie being fun? When I mean entertainment, I mean the ritual of sitting in the dark, staring at the screen, investing enormous concentration and energy in what is hoped to be satisfying, meaningful emotional experience. Why can't these festivals appreciate films that broadcast their messages without preaching? Why can't these black film festivals recognize films that are told with brutally honest works that tell the truth? "I believe we have no responsibility to cure social diseases or renew faith in humanity, elevate the spirits of society or even express our inner being. We have only one responsibility: to tell the truth." - Robert McKee. This is something I totally agree with. These same black film festivals put down "Hustle and Flo" as if it were a terrible film that stereotypes blacks. However, it is an honest film about a pimp with a dream. Can't a pimp dream? I remember the last time I saw a real pimp was a human being. And aren't they the pimp and prostitution a harsh reality in our society in general, not only in the black community but everywhere? The powers that are in the "black Hollywood" believe that films like this are making African Americans look bad to others, as if others didn't know that there are protectors in the hood. The truth is that as long as African Americans in the cinema cannot accept the truth about themselves and dare to share it with the world, then our films will never have a chance in the world. This film was terrible. The best thing was the cinematography and Zoe.
