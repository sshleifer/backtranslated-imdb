This is what I kept asking myself during the numerous fights, the screaming games, the bad words and the general chaos that permeates the 84 minutes. Comparisons also arise when one thinks of one-dimensional characters, who have so little depth that it is practically impossible to worry about what happens to them. They are just cyphers badly written for the director on which to hang his multicultural beliefs, a topic that has been done much better in other films both on TV and in the cinema. <br /> <br /> I have to confess, I'm not really one to detect bad performances during a movie, but it must be said that Nichola Burley (as the best friend of the heroine bitch) and Wasim Zakir (like the bad brother and bully) were absolutely terrible. I don't know which drama school they graduated from, but if I were them I would have asked for a full refund by mail. Only Samina Awan in the lead role manages to amaze in a cast of so-called British talents that we will probably never hear again. At least, this is hope. Next time, hire another scout. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thought is the horribly fashionable soundtrack with the likes of Snow Patrol, Ian Brown and Keane. Now, I'm a fan of music and I know most of these artists, but I didn't recognize any tracks during this movie (apart from the ubiquitous "Run"). B-sides, anyone? We receive many, many musical montages that telegraph as we should hear. These are accompanied by surprisingly original images such as couples kissing from a lake in flood and canoeing in doors. This is a problem, as none of the songs efficiently transmits the atmosphere, and we realize that the director does not have the ability to take the emotional journey to the public through narration and dialogue alone. <br /> <br /> The ending is supposedly meant to be just sweet, since everyone has their snack and there's at least one big shock in store ... But I remained resolutely indifferent because the script hadn't given me no one to cheer for. It is not enough to deal with a hot-button problem, you really have to give us a plot that has not already been made to death and people who are more than just windows. As it is, this film is a noble failure, with only the promising leading actress and some slightly deviant punch-ups to save it from the trash. 4/10. Must try harder ..
