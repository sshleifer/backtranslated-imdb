I don't really like this show. I mean, basically everyone in that school is perfect and rich, and I doubt a college would be as good as that. And why do they suddenly allow girls to enter the school? Isn't it just a little weird? however, Jamie Lynn's spears CANNOT act. He always has the same facial expression, which really bothers me. It's basically emotionless, and all the guys seem to like it. <br /> <br /> and should they not chase after telling you that they like it? it's not that hard! really! None of this show is real life, and she is not "a girl like me" because most normal girls DO NOT go to boarding school, they don't have designer clothes and they don't live on the beach. <br /> <br /> false false false.
