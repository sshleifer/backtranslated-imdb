In a nutshell, the film is about a gang war in the 1950s. Leon, the leader of the Deuce, starts the gang after his brother Od is "junk". He swears to protect the neighborhood. The leader of the rival gang is simply getting out of prison and wants revenge. <br /> <br /> The film didn't really do that for me. The "good guys" were no better than the "bad guys". Very little has been shown to suggest that the Deuces really took care of the community. I suppose the writers were realism here, but I didn't care which part won. None of the characters was nice, or even able to attract my understanding. <br /> <br /> The positive side of the engagement between Annie and Bobby had some snappy dialogue, and the general acting was well done.
