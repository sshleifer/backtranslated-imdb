I can't believe the high ratings that people gave this movie on this site. The writing is incredibly negative with the people who arrive at the right time and reveal exactly what the heroine is doing to try to escape. (Don't you just hate it when it happens?). And acting is very, very bad that you can get a splinter in your eyes from all the scenarios that are chewed. <br /> <br /> A madman holds hostage, the children are out of the open screen, so she whines for help instead of screaming when just a moment ago she was brave enough to smash windows to scream at those same children. <br /> <br /> Finally she is free and alone at home. His chance to ask for help, so what does he do? He wanders around the house and lies down. It's in the basement, locked. so what do you do? He takes a nap. Come on! Most of the film is the madman who wanders and finds her sitting dozing when he wakes her up. Four times! What? If the writer is too bored to write a real storyline, why should we pay attention? I think the key here is that it was originally a radio game, so they filled up with the heroine sitting around rather than pretending to be writers and actually writing any action. <br /> <br /> And the ending is horrendous. <br /> <br /> The entire film is completely unlikely, horribly written and almost comically performed. Watch out for this movie at all costs!
