I honestly can't understand why people love this show so much. A friend of mine watches him and, since I like science fiction, I have been trying to watch him since the show's plot seemed promising, but in truth it is really a very boring show. The only thing that will keep you awake during this show are the CGI effects of the video game and the excessive use of the muppets. Note that I call it muppet because they actually look like muppets, not like the aliens they should be. <br /> <br /> About which; the muppets and make-up effects are horribly abused in this show. You have this boy who could best be described as an alien / dwarf hybrid, you have a pale girl who looks like a cheese vampire girl, you have a floating alien with frog wings with a pipe ... He feels very unnecessary and besides even to the point that you feel distracted by the whole plot of a lost astronaut. <br /> <br /> Each episode is also too independent. The creators of this show have directed this so that each episode feels almost like another show. At least to the point where you see the main characters again / muppet, ie. The entire plot of the main character's return to earth is greatly pushed into the background. The acting is also quite ugly. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: if you want good science fiction, look elsewhere. This is not even true sci-fi, in my opinion, since the show is more focused on fantasy elements with all the puppets and the strange dreams that happen. And if you just want to see the muppets, I suggest you watch the Muppet Show and feel happy that this abomination of a show has come to an end. <br /> <br /> By the way; does anyone have dejavu with the concept of a living spaceship? Oh yes, that's right; Doctor Who started this concept almost 30 years ago! This show is like a collection of "science fiction" leftovers. Scriptures and events that have been abandoned for good reason, just to be picked up by this horrible show.
