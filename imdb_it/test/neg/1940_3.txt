Bam Margera of fame Jackass is back with his reality show, and not only is it not as fun as Jackass, but it's also incredibly stupid! This must be one of the most stupid shows ever conceived. Of course, there are worse reality shows, but nobody is so petty or stupid. <br /> <br /> Bam Margera has grown up, and his parents have decided to save themselves from his fame. Bam and his parents, his uncle, his crew of idiot friends all live together, and while Bam and his friends are breaking things and going bad, his parents are generally stupid at home. When Bam's parents are not at home, they are lazy, they are tortured by Bam, especially by his father. To add humor, we are treated by his uncle Don Vitto who is constantly out of it, and never pays attention. <br /> <br /> This show is really like an attenuated version of Jackass ... toned in this case there are no stunts, but Bam and his friends simply break things, and do limping stunts, and meanwhile the loud music plays to make it even more fantastic. This is not funny at all. I can't imagine a more stupid show than this because there isn't an ounce of intelligence found here. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Bam Margera, and you want to see one of the many follow-up / cash-in sequences of the Jackass series. <br /> <br /> My rating: * on ****. 30 minutes TV14
