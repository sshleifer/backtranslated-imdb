David Dhawan copied HITCH and an unofficial copy. The film is not even 1/2 fun or funny as the original is boring with forced stories like Lara's track of having a son and no husband Plus. There is an unwanted stupid Chota DON and Even David tries to choke the drama, but the film seems incoherent, boring <br /> <br /> It only sings pop-in, as well as romance and all but a few funny Govinda scenes, before-break dancing is worth mentioning Le last scenes are pretty funny but tend to get too long <br /> <br /> David's direction is as bad as MAINE PYAAR KYUN KIYAA, he needs to change style or try something good. The music is saving grace, some songs are good but the situations seem forced <br /> <br /> Govinda seems overweight and seems too noisy and screams his lines in the initial reels, but goes live and gives his best in the office and the scene with Salman in his cabin and towards the end <br /> <br /> Salman only plays himself and his nasal tone also his fake acting style is a headache <br /> <br /> Lara is avoidable, Katrina is fake as usual <br /> <br />
