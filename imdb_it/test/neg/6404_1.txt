This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I didn't go with great expectations, but as soon as it started I thought it could be o-k. It wasn't. He seemed to try Jim Carrey, but he spoke all his lines as if he were a devilish cartoon character. All the other actors seem to do their best but they are made of wood. The plot has a good foundation, but the melodramatic lines make it boring and a bit silly. I was laughing throughout the second part of the film and after five minutes I got tired of that. Most of the plot "twists" could be seen from several miles away. Not worth watching. I really hope I didn't waste any time with this.
