The Forgotten (AKA: Do not Look In The Basement) is a very cheap and very old horror film. <br /> <br /> The plot is very slow and never really reaches anything so it's worth getting excited about. <Br /> <br /> Patients in the mental hospital are embarrassing, especially Sam and the old woman who always mentions an old saying to all. (Look at you from the moment you approach the camera, tell me you can watch without laughing!). <br /> <br /> Now the blood is very poor, with the blood looking pink in many scenes, so it doesn't really deserve its place in the list of video nasties! <br /> <br /> Overall, if you're not looking for a fantastic horror movie and have some free time, it's worth a look.
