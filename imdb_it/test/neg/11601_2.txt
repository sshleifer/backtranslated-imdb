I only voted 2/10 mainly because Hitchcock agreed to run it. He certainly had a day of rest with predictable plot, stupid childish characters who desperately try to be funny. There was a "twee" hygienic, sanitized, emasculated "sex" scenes at a time when the Hollywood Production code was in full force. Lazy male characters in the movie who love "soap" characters never do a job for which they are paid. It always irritates me when food is usually never eaten by actors (an exception was in the scene of "Tom Jones" (1963), even if you consume abundant quantities of drinks - the actors have to leave their mouths free for the next line ! "Carole Lombard certainly adapted Hitchcock's idealized" cool blond "image of a heroine, but what ever possessed it to direct this useless and insignificant script, she should have remained faithful to her thrillers. It certainly didn't go well in the last 69 years. I couldn't wait for it to end because little by little it irritated me.
