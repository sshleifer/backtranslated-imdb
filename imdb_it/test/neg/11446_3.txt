This film really left me thinking ... but not about the plot, the direction, the characters, a background message or an intelligent script. Away from it. I wondered what had gone wrong behind the scenes in Sam Hill. Clearly, something was not right from the start. <br /> <br /> I am amazed at the positive comments for the film and Jodie Foster's performance. From the beginning it was clear that Foster had called that one. A previous comment even made favorable mention of his facial expressions. I must have seen a different movie since Ms Foster (usually a personal favorite) seemed to be totally uninterested. <br /> <br /> In one of his first scenes with Foster, Fred Ward seems as if he too was distracted by his lack of energy and strives to express his lines with every enthusiasm. The moment he is called to take part in a seemingly desperate search for Foster, Floy, even Ward seems to have become embarrassing for the project. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Dennis Hopper has always been a one-dimensional performer, so I didn't expect much from him ... and he handed me over. <br /> <br /> Yes, that left me thinking long after it ended. The fact that Joe Pesci and Charlie Sheen refused to have their names attached to the project suggests that this was a real evil for everyone involved. But only to learn that the director preferred to hide behind a pseudonym speaks of volumes. <br /> <br /> But why listen to me? I always think Foster is ridiculous in a dress, yet it's sensational in lace underwear.
