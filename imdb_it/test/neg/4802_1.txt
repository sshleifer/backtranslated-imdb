I got this little piece of scuzz on the video label "Tales of Voodoo" by VideoAsia. Enough where the voodoo should fit, I have no idea. In fact I would not usually connect voodoo with Indonesia (let alone with WIPs). <br /> <br /> I know and love WIP movies. I've seen most of them. I could not therefore resist this little-known gem from the description given to it on the cover. <br /> <br /> IS ENOUGH. You can't have a WIP movie if women keep their clothes (even in the shower!). Although he nods to the genre of exploitation, WIP without nudity is like a Big Mac without meat. <br /> <br /> As my gym teacher said, overall I would rather be at the disco ....
