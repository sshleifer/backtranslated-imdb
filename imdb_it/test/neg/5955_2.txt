There is a reason why the world has forgotten these creatures: they are boring. This is a production of hammers, which means that anyone who made this film should be hit with a hammer, several times if possible, and where it hurts the most. Most people think more of making a dump than these idiots did in making this film. <br /> <br /> Seriously now ?? The film begins with some cavemen chasing an antelope. Now, the antelopes must have evolved a lot from the prehistoric ones because they actually attack and kill people here. After that, it's time to meet the rest of the tribe: more bearded men, some fashion models and even a couple of granny and very old gray-haired grandmothers. Obviously these old geeks have never heard of people in caves who do not exceed 30 years; they refused to bend to the will of both the logical and prehistoric registers, so they remain alive. One of the cavemen is not bearded; he is clean-shaven. Not really clean-shaven like Tarzan, the Lord of the well-shaved Humanoids who have been wandering in the jungle since childhood and without a razor, but around here. <br /> <br /> What follows is the mandatory earthquake / destruction of the lava-flow sequence that causes many of our not so hairy friends to meet their destiny. It is interesting to note that before the earthquake the fashion models showed more breasts. After that, they must have become shy or something like that because they covered their chest for a while (maybe they were covered in ash so I mistakenly thought they were covered). More action follows the shape of two fashion models struggling in the sand; the best thing about fighting female mud, I suppose. After a good part of the desert has been crossed, our black-haired tribe meets - how could it be otherwise - a blonde tribe. Yawn. <br /> <br /> Follows more spell material. There is that red fashion model who is annoyed to see a teenager in a cave kill a hedge creature. There is also the scene of a woman who dies at birth: those rock fashion models are so fragile. In the end we meet an even darker, dark-haired tribe, that is an evil tribe. One of them becomes a WWF champion after he actually beats (!) A huge bear-thing in a wrestling match. 1,2,3 ... and it is done: the bear is the loser. We are also witnessing a jealous caveman who miraculously heals two serious injuries: first he is stabbed with a large spear in his thigh, yet he walks away as if it were just a scratch. Then he is thrown off a cliff - on a big rock - by the blond caveman goodie-two-shoes, yet he walks away as if he were thrown on a giant sofa. In the end it is not clear if he dies from falling from an even higher cliff or from that voodoo doll that is crushed. Oh yes, voodoo was used in prehistoric times by the white tribes living in the desert and whose females were fashion models. It is always important to learn from movies. <br /> <br /> The message of the film is as intuitive as it is educational: the people of the caves loved to fight for local power and they too loved their fashion models. As if a respectable cave man fought to be the leader of such a sorry group.
