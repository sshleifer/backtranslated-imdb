I wanted to see an American werewolf in Paris for a long time because I loved his predecessor, but this film didn't impress me as much as an American werewolf in London. In fact, to be honest, it didn't impress me at all. <br /> <br /> Tom Everett-Scott and his friends are wanderers to Paris and, in an absurd bungee stunt of the Eifel Tower, saving little wolf Julie Delpy from death. Before you have time to understand if the constant and lumpy dialogue is destined to be the stuff of comedy, a full moon struck and the brats are pursued by the terrible CGI werewolves in the Parisian sewers. <br /> <br /> The script is disgustingly poor, the actors were made to make this film, they are horrible shows that match the state of the film. From beginning to end, this film is never fun, engaging or even slightly watchable. I had trouble watching the whole movie without turning up the dinner, to be honest. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are not exciting, the jokes are not funny and the werewolves are not scary. In short: lose or be persecuted forever. <br /> <br /> Vote for an American werewolf in Paris 2 out of 10.
