This film was offensively PC, predictable and clich√©. I could not imagine a film that better exemplifies the myopic and narcissistic preaching of today's Hollywood. If you haven't seen it, don't worry about watching it. If you have, show some courage and tell people how terrible it is. My wife, a fully-fledged minority, was offended by the intrinsic and endless racist message of the film. This film has nothing to do with the real world and has little, if anything, to add to any discussion of racism in this country. Instead, it is the kind of economic and sensationalist shit that is promoted as a deep and stimulating thought. What kind of bubble do you have to live to think it's really impressive?
