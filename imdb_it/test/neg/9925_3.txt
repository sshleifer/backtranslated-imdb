As much as I love Ellen Barkin (who is really undervalued) I have to whistle this movie. If you can't tell who did it and why in the first half hour you never saw a psychosexual thriller or you never saw 20/20. It's like the filmmakers and actors didn't worry about the way they were shooting and the way they were playing the characters would be a crumbling gift. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is used to light up the perverted dirt that likes to mix violence and sex. It's not a fun movie to sit on, even if you like Ellen Barkin it's nice to see her position a hard woman.
