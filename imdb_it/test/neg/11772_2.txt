I don't often give a horror movie two stars because horror is my favorite genre. A film can be BAD as it is not a masterpiece, but it can be fun based on involuntary humor, bizarre characters, etc. A case in point is a large number of horror / science fiction films from the 1940s to the 1980s. . They are fun for genre fans and for those looking for guilty pleasure because their "nastiness" is fun. However, this film has no humor or effective gory scenes of the original "Piranha" (1978). <br /> <br /> I suppose in 1995 it was the apogee of political correctness, so the blood on TV was at a minimum. Now in the mid-2000s with the C.S.I. shows, TV is an absolute feast of blood! (Good for us horror fans!) <br /> <br /> William Katt and Alexandra Paul are not Bradford Dillman and Heather Menzies (the original 1978 stars). It's not the flaws of Katt and Paul, but the writers and director who created this lukewarm turkey. How the main characters interact is the main flaw of this film. I will not say how it is part of the plot. <br /> <br /> This TV movie probably has a bigger budget than the original, but it flopped like a good horror, as can be seen by user ratings here. Follow the 1978 original if you're in the mood for a killer fish movie!
