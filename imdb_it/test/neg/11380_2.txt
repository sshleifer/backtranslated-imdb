First of all, I personally love Demons and Demons 2, I saw them even though it was difficult to find good horrors without a good official film released here in Russia when I was a child, and this is an immutable part of my adolescence. Then I heard nothing of Mr Bava. Then I saw his ghost son. Well, it's certainly not a good return! Why is the main character, whom we never met at least like him, in an accident in the middle of an empty road? Why do African servants say such stupid and stupid things about the human soul? Why is the plot so primitive? Haven't we seen enough ghosts for 100 years of film production? It is clear that Lamberto Bava has nothing to show us so far. It's a shame.
