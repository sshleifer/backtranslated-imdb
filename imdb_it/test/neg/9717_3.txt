A group of four young people, who attend a prestigious private school, belongs to an ancient alliance that was formed by their ancestors during the witch hunt of the late 1600s. Each of them possesses a power that ages them every time they use it and they suspect that a new child from the academy could come from a family that was thought to have long since died. This new type wants everyone's power for himself. <br /> <br /> This is not a horror film as it tries to present itself as. Yes, there is magic and all that supernatural material, but this is really just an action movie. A very mediocre action movie. Focusing almost exclusively on being cool and clear and devoting only minimal attention to the plot, which has a lot of sadly unused space for interesting twists. But nobody has been inserted and even before the film is halfway through, you will know what is being played and by whom. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes here and there, especially an exploding car that is magically rebuilt after colliding with a big rig, but that's it. What's worse is that the director Renny Harlin, who has to his credit very funny, if not intelligent, films relies heavily on explosive metal music and leads excessively sexy to bring that film and this probably makes the most foolish movie of the horror after the disastrous "Alone in the dark." It's not as bad as "Alone in the Dark" because the few slick scenes are actually slick and not ridiculously incompetent, but in the end, the highest that this film can hope for is a cute and cozy late-night cable home. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Vote PG-13: violent action
