The problem with this sort of lyric film is that either you make a masterpiece, or a lemon: there is a middle ground. By putting it gently, this is not "Berlin - symphony of a city" or "Man with a camera". Unfortunately, there isn't even much to look at. <br /> <br /> The problem with this is that he is casual and half-cooked, as if Michael Moore were on board. It really has nothing to say, or rather, to show us with images and sounds. Koyanisqatsi uses the images cumulatively to propose a thesis. This is just a patchwork looking for a point. (Although, inadvertently, the film tells us more about Uncle Sam's mind than it is, there is something deeply paradoxical in an anti-technological, anti-civilized, anti-media film that is so profoundly made up with the technology. "Do as I say, and not like I do. You just have to love the Yanks, eh.) Tonally, there is something sour and misanthropic in this episode. Both previous episodes had moments of lyricism and euphoria; this time the tone is constantly gloomy It just doesn't work for this duration, as Gustav Mahler will tell you. <br /> <br /> Stylistically, Naqoyqatsi is a mess. The unbridled digital stuff is particularly misleading. It gives the whole a totally fussy and overcrowded look , and also undermines the "realistic" nature of the analogue "found footage". (I mean, I pity the boys, part of the joy of Koyanisqaatsi was that it was a tribute to the use of optical film, but now the optical film is an artifact historical, I have to no "take over" the digital domain, but I don't think they take it out. Digital things often resemble video links from CNN or BBC World.) And with the "found footage", well, digital manipulation is often ugly, and usually just silly, and the false color and solarization made me think a ... <br /> <br /> ... ahem ... <br /> <br /> Sequences of James Bond titles. <br /> <br /> Ahem. Strange as it may seem, there is also the possibility that the film was simply stolen from Yo Yo Ma's performance; is discreet as a voice-over by Lawrence Olivier. The images should be really compelling to stack against all that charisma. Philip Glass itself is in strange shape; I never expected him to eliminate Verdi's requiem! (It made me laugh, which, of course, is not the desired answer to any part of this film). There's even a piece of music that sounds like Brahms. (?) Maybe they changed his pills. <br /> <br /> From our "useless questions" department: Geoffrey Reggio is actually a Hopi Indian? Or did he just do a sweatlodge in Hollywood Hills? Oh, and the various fragments of footage from previous episodes of the trilogy are a comment on how these films are also part of the global media?
