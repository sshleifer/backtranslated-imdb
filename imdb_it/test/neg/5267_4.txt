I couldn't wait to watch this movie. He had all the ingredients of a great cheeker tongue, but he didn't meet at all. Kevin Spacey's accent was tolerable, except that sometimes he forgot to use it and I would prefer NOT to have to listen to Linda Fiorentino's pale attempt. She and Helen Baxendale were totally devoid of charm and personality, fortunately their screen children were loaded, so you could find at least some members of her 2 appealing families. You may have strained spaghetti with the plot and I'm sure the script was written by a teenager in an English high school competition. That said, when I wasn't joking, I was smiling and so it wasn't a completely wasted 90 minutes. I found the overlap of Kevin's face on the painting very clever and quite funny. Maybe I'm a little tough, but I was expecting a bit of quality vision and it never came.
