OK, this movie was far worse than the first one and the first one was sucked! The zombie trick was extremely fake! The acting is very poor! And it doesn't actually follow the first one! While watching this I continued to think wow the first is a masterpiece compared to this. I'd say take it on TV, don't spend money on it! It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's on the list. I started watching it last night and fell asleep, so I looked at it today and fell asleep again! The plot was useless, I mean, I have the fact that a small military group is sent on a mission to get the blood of the lead zombie and bring it back so they can use it to save lives and stop the zombies, but they did where you wanted everyone to die. They did a lot of bad guys that were really annoying. If you ask me, this was a rip off of the resident evil and not a nice rip-off. The plot could have been realized if the acting had been good and if they actually made you feel scared to see what's around the corner. With these zombies my grandmother could have entered that building and survived! from a 1-10 I give him a 2.
