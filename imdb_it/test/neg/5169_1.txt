Kokoda was inspired by events on the Kokoda track during World War II when the Australian militia slowed down and eventually stopped a push of 10,000 Japanese soldiers to move overland and capture Port Moresby. What they really mean is that the film is set in this period of time, but it's a fiction and everything that happens is just a mixture of standard scenes from other war movies. The first hour is just a clich√© after another. Some scenes are simply there to be able to make us think that this conflict is horrible without equal, when there seems to be little evidence of this. Both sides fought hard to control the track and no mercy was shown by either side. Both sides suffered from logistical deficiencies and the terrain was of great level in this conflict. When the Japanese approached Port Mores, their supply line grew and this eventually led to their ruin. On the other hand, as the Australians retreated closer to Port Mores, their supply line diminished. Some scenes seem to be directly outside the manual on standard scenes to include in any war movie. The film was misled and highlighted the youth of the production team. At a time when Australia could have made a great film about one of the best moments in Australia, the Kokoda film is a superficial disappointment.
