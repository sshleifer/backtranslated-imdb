"Graduation Day" - <br /> <br /> I bought this movie last week and I waited a while to relax and watch some "good" 80s gems, I had this and "Xtro" for look, never seen any of them. I just saw it and realized that my external speakers were also on. Can I imagine just what my neighbors thought when "Felony" came to sing their only 10-minute hit? I'm sure he was strong and I'm sure they think I'm weird, with that and the chainsaw they play and scream from other movies. <br /> <br /> this was a nice slasher film comparable, without suspense, no story, some nice death, it seemed almost like an amateur, I usually like movies like that, but I just didn't click with me, now I'll watch "Xtro" for the first time and I have a margarita! <br /> <br /> DJ Eric Austin TX
