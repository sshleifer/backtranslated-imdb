This German horror film must be one of the most bizarre I've seen. <br /> <br /> I was not aware of any connection between child abuse and vampirism, but this is supposed to be based on a real character. <br /> <br /> Our hero is deaf and dumb due to repeated beatings at the hands of his father. it also has a doll fetish, but I can't understand where it comes from. His collaborators find out and make fun of him terribly. <br /> <br /> During the day a mild accountant, and at night break into cemeteries and funeral homes and drink the blood of dead girls. They are all attractive, of course, otherwise we wouldn't be interested in the fact that we usually tear our clothes to the waist. He finally graduated to kill, and this is what captures him. <br /> <br /> As I said, a very strange film that is dark and very slow like Werner Pochath never speaks and spends his time drinking blood.
