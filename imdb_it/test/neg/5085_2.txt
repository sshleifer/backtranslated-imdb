I thought it was difficult, if not impossible, to look at, and not because of the horrors it describes, but because of the way they were depicted. Imagine what Costa Gavras could have done with this true horror story. What I object to is the idea that the need to report, that I endorse, is sufficient. How about showing it to us with the power of the powerful cinema. I feel that the enthusiasm of the filmmaker, perhaps even the justifiable anger, did not allow him to see it clearly from a cinematographic point of view. Or if this was a cinematographic point of view, I mean, I didn't like it at all. I was more disturbed by the way the film was shot than by the film itself. I'm sure, but unfortunately, it's not enough.
