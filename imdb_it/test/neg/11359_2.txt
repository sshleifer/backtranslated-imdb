This film is really bad, the attempt to create scientific explanations for the zombies always ends up taking away credibility from the film's history. There are so many things I could point to on the film that I could almost write a book about how much the movie sucks. For example, there were 50 people on the plane, they killed like 100 and kept coming, apparently the "virus" gave liver complications because everyone had yellow eyes, even the virus makes people roar like lions or something, and the virus not only regenerates the tissues as it also gives superhuman strength, not to mention that this virus messes up people's hair. It is also important to note that if you shoot someone with a gun (probably only on airplanes) that person is put back in the air. Remember that if you are escorting a prisoner to an airplane and losing it, always look inside the bottle-sized drawers and cabinets, you never know where those bastards will hide. And if by chance you can land a plane full of zombies against a mountain and survive (it happens all the time), after seeing dozens of people killed, you just have to get away from the plane, watch the sunrise and make jokes about dating the flight attendant. :)
