The authors know nothing of Russian prisons, the film is absolutely cockamamie, has nothing in common with reality. Furthermore, they do not make foreign prisoners in Russia have a special prison so that foreigners NEVER live with the Russian criminals. The uniforms of this film seem to have been stolen somewhere in Latin America. Even prisoners in Russia do not work outside the prison. Every kill in the Russian prison is being investigated, so the prisoners kill each other only if there are very important reasons. Football is also forbidden in prisons, contacts between prisoners are very limited, no possibility of bloody fighting, etc. etc. So this film has nothing in common with reality.
