I had seen this movie a few days before Halloween 2004. I noticed it around lunchtime and it was an interesting description in my menu box, so I decided to watch it. Seriously just a movie only suitable for late night TV ... you know, after Conan but before the kind of commercials. <br /> <br /> Although this film has very little to do with the web, it has a lot to do with spiders, refer to my column if you need an update. <br /> <br /> I found the idea behind the absolutely fascinating story. A hidden nuclear generator, a scientist and a credible portal ... It would have been a good start for a fantastic fantasy but then it will go downhill after 15-20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The cast is poor and unremarkable shows, poor quality queen who had amplified breasts ... considering that spiders do not wear breasts. As well as poor sound effects. An obvious low-cost film, even though the cast has tried. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> 4 electricians stumble into a hidden nuclear generator while engaged in work. They will play with buttons and open a portal. 2 workers fall in the portal and closes ... trying to understand what is happening, the party still in our world seeks help while the other party observes the surrounding environment. <br /> <br /> Help does not arrive so they open the portal and follow the meeting in a parallel dimension. They meet a race of human spiders nicknamed soldiers. After a death and a chase they are saved by the survivors. <br /> <br /> Now it becomes boring ... they hide, talk a little, try to build another portal and then attack the hive. After losing two other electricians, they open the portal and escape their return to the world ... about 200 million years ago. <br /> <br /> Sounds interesting eh?
