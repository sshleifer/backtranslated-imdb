This film begins with children telling urban legends like the poodle in the microwave and something to add in a chicken place. Unfortunately, it turns into your basic anthology film. The first concerns a janitor with a little secret. This is okay at best. Then it gets worse because the next story of this guy who is obsessed with dead flies is on and continues to work again and again. It is long and not so interesting to begin with. After that you get the typical shock scene and it ends. You need more in an anthology film. You need at least three stories and you shouldn't be so long that it gets terribly uninteresting, especially considering you can see how it will end up a mile away.
