Tommy Lee Jones was the best Woodroe and no one can play Woodroe F. Call him better. Not only was he the first and the best, he was the only person capable of interpreting his pain and confusion. It was a nasty disappointment and I am surprised that I even showed up. I can also start to say how pitiful they were doing Woodroe. I understand that at that time he would be old, but everyone knows he would NEVER let him pull him down. The first film was the best and the only one I've ever seen. I hope to God that there are no other directors who intend to continue or remake the wonderful classic without Tommy or Duval. Without them, movies are a waste of time and money for everyone, including the director. IF YOU PLAN TO MAKE ANOTHER LONESOME, KEEP THE FILM OF ANY KIND, take mine and billions of others, don't waste time. Continuing the films is just grinding the first into the ground. Thank you.
