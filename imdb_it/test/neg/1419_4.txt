I saw this movie in a Saturday matinee with a friend. The theater was 70% full. <br /> <br /> Although there are some funny lines, it is more of a drama / suspense with humor on top. Robin Williams offers a decent performance like Laura Linney. Being a fan of the Daily Show, Lewis Black is pretty good at it. Even Christopher Walken gives a good performance. <br /> <br /> The film starts slowly and stays like this for about the first thirty minutes, then the suspense part starts and keeps you a little aloof for the rest of the film. Suspense in an alleged comedy movie? I know that I, like everyone else in the place, was struggling a little with this. A character would make a joke during the suspense sequence and you could only hear one or two laughs in the theater. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, after the film was finished, there was a smattering of applause. So surely some people liked this movie. <br /> <br /> I gave this film four out of ten, because I think the comic aspect doesn't work very well in a suspense / drama movie and the actors' performances, while not bad, were simply decent. <br /> <br /> Once again, this film is not what was advertised.
