Cameron Mitchell's legendary turkey is about an actor / make-up artist being burned by the head of a studio when a drink is thrown in his face while lighting a cigarette. Reduced to a scarred mess and an eye patch, Mitchell works at the Movieland Wax Museum. It also kidnaps and kills people using a solution that paralyzes them so they can be turned into displays. Really bizarre bad movie that defies description. See how the various wax figures try not to move, look at how the whole tobacco is consumed outside for different Southern states? See how things get weirder and weirder. It's a terrible train accident in a movie and you can't take your eyes off the screen. A classic bad movie that will amaze you even if it leaves permanent scars on your psyche.
