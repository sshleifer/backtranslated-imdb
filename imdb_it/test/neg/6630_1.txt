Should I expect anything other than Carrot Top putrid? This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's by far the worst comedy I've ever seen. "The president of the council" has not added humor to my attitude, rather it has infuriated me. True, Carrot Top is such a bad comedian that I was furious that this man is making movies.
