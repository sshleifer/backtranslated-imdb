The film moves quite well but acting, directing and editing leave a lot to be desired. The characters are mostly relieved from other movies and the Vinnie Jones look-alike came out of Gone in 50 Seconds. The comedy gangster movie is a genre that should have a lot of contrast, the silly Lock Stock sellers and the shootings that leave everyone dead. You should never really know whether to laugh or just stand there in shock. This film had the right elements but it is too easy to sit there like a person who knits and the small details that should have been fixed somewhere along the line and once the cupboard has been suspended, one becomes more and more critical . Too bad because it was a brave attempt and even though Clint Eastwood is famous for saying that it will be fine for a scene, he puts the job before shooting and he is Clint Eastwood. Here a little more imagination with the camera and a little more coaching and line delivery tests would have made a big difference.
