This tyrant-to-devil story, set in nineteenth-century Russia, may have been an attempt to extend Steve Reeves' career beyond those "Hercules" films. However, despite the different costumes, it is still a "Hercules" film with the usual stylized dialogue, casual dubbing and cardboard characters. On the other hand, there is a lot of action, the rhythm rarely flags, and Reeves gets to do yet another one of those scenes in which he is stripped to the waist, tied with ropes, and given a vigorous flogging that, I miss to say it has little effect on his provocative character.
