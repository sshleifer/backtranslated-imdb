When I saw this film three years ago, I thought it exemplified many of the features of Singapore artist films: slow, with a minimum of plot and dialogue, depending on the composition of the film to make it work. > <br /> During that time, among local filmmakers, the inability to appreciate "Be With Me" amounts to panning for "Citizen Kane" or one of Ozu's old movies. I have no idea how "Be With Me" has reached such high levels in Singapore's cinematic consciousness, but I always thought that Khoo's "12 Storeys" were a better film, even if the latter doesn't boast a good director of photography like Adrian Tan, DP of Khoo for "Be With Me". "12 Storeys" has a story that relates better to most of the people of Singapore and also has a bite, something that the consummate melancholy of "Be With Me" does not have. <br /> <br /> "Be With Me" is basically a trio of barely interconnected narratives, united by a film by Khoo and its screenwriter Wong Kim Hoh. It is a security guard who falls in love with a girl who sees only in the distance; two girls in a horoerotic relationship; and the story of deaf and dumb Teresa Chan. <br /> <br /> "Be With Me" is very well captured by Tan, using a Varicam camera. The compositions of the film are masterful. The film, almost completely silent, has no dialogue. The characters move, not in a realistic way, but almost as if they were models under the guidance of a director, almost always looking at the screen and emulating: or loneliness or sadness. Unfortunately the characters do not act against each other. This type of film has been seen many times: in the films of Tsai Ming-liang, in the Khoo Royston Tan movie "4:30" and elsewhere. Unfortunately, its ultra-slowness (essentially the plot less) and the use of a slow piano soundtrack simply don't like me. <br /> <br /> Criticizing "Be With Me" almost seems to deny the inspiring story behind it, that of Teresa Chan, who is blind and deaf and yet lives a fulfilling life despite all this, yet I fear that this film does not do a lot for me. I am ready to applaud Chan's constant and courageous march in Tan's life and surprising cinematography, but for a better view of the same topic with more meat (without the other two boring and distracting sub-themes), Werner's "Land of Silence" test Herzog and Darkness "(1971).
