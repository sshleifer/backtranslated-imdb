I loved blood and blood. The kind of violence is what the Alien and Predator movies that nobody spares are talking about. This really answers the question of what it would be like if the aliens were on Earth. The answer is simple. We're screwed. The effects were beautiful. How come there are real problems. <br /> <br /> 1) The acting was horrible on the part of Human characters, the witch almost put me to sleep because of how dry and boring it was that really interrupted the flow of the film and was very annoying. The writers could have done SOOOOOOO much better. The best part was the acting of Alien and Predator which I thought was done very well for the most part. <br /> <br /> 2) The size of the Predator ship was much smaller than it was in the first AvP movie. I scratched my head <br /> <br /> 3) The predators have their mask on while they are still on the ship. This upsets people and I don't understand why. It's not a plot hole like most people do it. So I tell you that people calm down. It is nothing serious. If it will make you feel better, remember, they made sure that the face-hugger is bored in filing so that this can be a good reason why. <br /> <br /> 4) Predator who throws his plasma wheel inside the ship. I thought it was pretty stupid on the Predators side. But then I started thinking if he was a younger Predator panicking. <br /> <br /> 5) The hunter and his son arrived almost instantly at the crash site after he fell several miles away. At least they don't bore us by showing them running through the woods for 30 min. so be happy. <br /> <br /> 6) Why did only one predator go? I thought it was weird. But then I thought it was because he thought it was just a Predalien he was dealing with and not an outbreak. <br /> <br /> 7) Why don't the Predators in the ship self-destruct? Well, if people paid attention, he did, but he was killed before he could fully activate it. <br /> <br /> 8) The unlimited blue goo that melts. I thought he was pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> 9) Predator who hides the evidence with the substance, but takes care of a policeman. That too was stupid. <br /> <br /> 10) The blackout. Well, come on people, an Alien and Pred fought it on a power plant. <br /> <br /> 11) Predalien is half face-hug / queen. This really struck me. I'm a fan of Alien and Pred. I know for sure that the aliens DON'T DO THAT !! Just like they don't give birth like a human does as they showed in Alien4 !! Of all the comics, games, books and films 1,2 and 3, CLEARLY shows their behavior. They need a queen to lay eggs, the eggs hatch in the host of the unhappy face-hugger, the parasite pokes out and kills the host and becomes a drone if it infects a human, a Predalien with a Predator and a Runner with any kind of four-legged animal. And then after having lived for years and years they crowded in a Preatorian (a mini me queen who doesn't lay eggs) I can go on and on but I won't. But that scene almost ruined the film for me. If the directors are intelligent, they would come back and modify them by making a face hugger that infected pregnant women. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you see this movie, go see it for the Aliens and the Predators. And when the scene comes when Predalin infects pregnant women ... Close your eyes so you don't have to see that insult to the Alien and Pred universe.
