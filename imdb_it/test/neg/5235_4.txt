After the thrilling fast-moving aerial shot in the opening of the film, it slipped into total boredom and a monotonous note to the end. <br /> <br /> Where to start, well, I'll start with the characters. I liked the book a lot, here were all types and idiots of a dimension that had "Victim" or "Asshole" written on the forehead from the beginning. As no one has seen through the shop owner, Lealand Gaunt (in a Hammam performance and out of Sydrow's place) is beyond me. <br /> <br /> This film lacks chills, suspense, and in a sense yes, fun values. It stretches too long without many profits. Why should introducing too many annoying characters die quickly and then forget half of them? In the book practically everyone who entered the shop met a horrible fate. Here, in addition to one of the few decent scenes that translated well from the novel (the fight between Wilma and Nettie), it was a disappointment and didn't have many balls. I'm sorry but later, an off screen death, a boring shot, and some bickering and then a couple of explosions I didn't do it for myself. Sadly the brutality and wickedness of the book was missing. The explosion of the church scene was so exaggerated and poorly performed, suddenly the whole city was in a fight? It didn't make sense and characters that weren't introduced all the way are suddenly, who are these people and why should I worry? <br /> <br /> The story is everywhere and none of the scenes had a moment. I thought that Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedeila were good actors in this, but the film doesn't give them enough substance so I don't care. Amanda Plummer was credible but too pathetic to be truly understanding (in the novel she was a sad and depressing character) here was a note too. J.T. Walsh was funny, but the role was anything but interesting or layered. Too predictable. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was too classy for the material it was supporting. It stood out like a sore thumb. Easy friend, easy. Something a little less theatrical than I would have imagined would have worked. <br /> <br /> I admit that some of the gores he managed to get were pretty good, I suppose, the director seemed to hold back a lot of times though. If you are going to make a film that reaches the 2 hour point, make sure you have much more to do following this disaster than an adaptation of the best Kings of novels. <br /> <br /> I have often found myself laughing at scenes that had to be taken seriously (speech by Ed Harris at the end, or the character of Hugh Priest in general), and most of the others were bored and uninterested times. Personally the director should have done a lot more with this story, his approach is too gentle and hides behind a photograph that is too sharp to ever be seen as a decent film. The film looks good, but not what I think this story deserves. I mean, this guy skippered ALASKA, not a good sign. <br /> <br /> I'd rather just read the book, as you should too, like it's a lot more fun, the development of layered characters, the gruesome violence and chaos, a bad sense of humor and much more grit . This is a slaughtered version, which doesn't have much to offer. <br /> <br /> ** out ****
