'Volcano' is a B movie at most, and at worst it is more of a disaster than what it should represent. To be honest, you have to be prepared in each film to suspend disbelief for an important concept. 'Vulcan' asks you to suspend disbelief in science, human interaction and common sense. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones becomes the chief expert of the 1990s of the emergency management office, and is fine when he's not stuck with the stupid dialogue that the script provides. However, Anne Heche gives a terribly bad performance as a crafty geologist who becomes Roark's love interest (while the city is burning, natch). Gaby Hoffman goes from Field of Dreams and American President to one turn as a whining, needy and life victim of Jones. Don Cheadle gets to sit in a really coooool office and take Jones's phone calls, doing the job that Roark actually should and should do. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film really starts to go downhill when Heche's geology partner gets sucked into a mouth of lava as they break into the subway lines. He picks up speed when Jones begins to suggest that they use buses to stem the flow of lava flowing down the road, the geologist from Heche (who loves to lecture on The Science Of Geology) apparently being oblivious to the fact that the lava is hot and melts metal, and rock, and a dead bus shouldn't have much effect. He really starts sucking when the film introduces the racial tension similar to Rodney King between two bad actors dressed as policemen and an angry black man who can't understand why firefighters are busy with this great river of flowing lava. But in the end, the three of them will work together to build a K-rail dam to prevent the lava from devouring its neighborhood, even if the dam is built in the wrong direction and the material used will not stop washing anyway. Furthermore, the K rails are not watertight, but I imagine the lava would not think of sticking its head through the empty spaces, not when Tommy Lee Jones is staring at him. Don't even get me started on the subway subway, where a boiling lava tunnel is coming down but strangely, it's not too hot to attempt a rescue, it's not too smoky to see, and not all poisonous gases so everyone can to breathe. This must be LA Lava, or Lava Lite. You know, eat cars but it's ecological. <br /> <br /> There are moments of pure camping here that almost make you wonder if this was a comedy. For example, the two security guards who pack Hieronymus Bosch's paintings have a nonsensical and farcical conversation about weight, and in the end, as soon as the Roark / Jones kid has saved notice that everyone looks the same while covered in ash, which a thunderstorm rains and cleans everyone - and then the sun comes out and Heche says something like "aw, shucks, Roark". <br /> <br /> 'Volcano' almost reaches the state of Battlefield Earth, but with the exception of Heche no one comes close to Travolta's wickedness and the technical aspects are managed quite well. If you're coming from the Los Angeles area as they are, it's pretty fun to think of a lava flow that erases Wilshire Boulevard. I gave him a three for the effects and the little tension that comes from this.
