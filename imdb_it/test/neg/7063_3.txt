No one will swap THE SQUALL for a good movie, but it's certainly memorable. Once you have performed the performance of Myrna Loy as Nubi, the hot-blooded gypsy you will not forget the experience. When this film was made, Miss Loy, an exotic beauty, was still interpreted as a foreign fox, often Asian and usually sinister. You are certainly an eye here. It looks like her skin was darkened and her hair was curled. In most scenes she is barefoot and wears little more than a skirt and a wide peasant blouse, while in one scene she wears nothing but a fancy towel. I suppose I'm focusing on Miss Loy's appearance because she's by far the best, if not the only, reason to tune into this creaky old and keep watching. Surely you will not be attracted to dialogue, which is hopeless. In a typical passage, Nubi looks out of the window at the departing caravan and becomes poetic: "Always the gypsies, they sing, strange and sad, when the great sun has the burning breath of fire and when the pale moon looks from behind the cloud and breathe cold air like death, they sing ". Poetic, or what? Purple prose lovers will have a field day. I can't help but wonder, though, if in her last years Miss Loy would rather not remember her involvement with this project. <br /> <br /> Like so many early speeches this was an adaptation of a recent Broadway hit. The stage version opened at the 48th Street Theater in November 1926 and lasted over a year. The drama caused a famous episode involving the humorist and theater critic Robert Benchley, who was known to have an aversion to the characters who spoke in pidgin dialect or English. According to a very repeated anecdote, Mr. Benchley squirmed uncomfortably through the initial part of this show. The setting of the Spanish village (moved to a village in Hungary for the film, for some reason) has given the actors the freedom to practice their accents with varying degrees of success, but Benchley's patience has reached its limits when, during a sequence of family dinners, a door goes out open and an actress dressed as a gypsy rushes into the room shouting "Help! Help! Then she threw herself at the feet of the landlady and exclaimed" Me Nubi! I'm a good girl! I'm here! "Then Mr. Benchley got up and announced to his companion:" I Bobby, I bad boy, I'm leaving ", and left the theater. <br /> <br /> The movie version offers numerous examples of unintentional humor but never nearing the level of Benchley's spirit.The melodramatic plot concerns the Lajos family: father Josef, mother Maria and son Paul, a student from the nearby college.We would consider this prosperous "middle-high class" family as landowners with servants and all the comforts of life, but their comfortable existence is suddenly thrown into chaos when a gypsy caravan arrives in the village and their home is invaded by, yes, Nubi the gypsy maiden girl. during the title storm - which symbolizes stormy emotions, I suppose. The girl runs away from a violent relationship and begs for the sanctuary. After considering the matter, the Lajos family agrees to hide it from her lover angry, which occurs soon after, but is removed. Nubi becomes a servant at home. Kindness motivates the family's decision to welcome her, but soon that little good-for-nothing conniving, Nubi, repaid them by seducing all able-bodied males nearby, starting with Lajos's servant, Peter, and then going back to his son Paul. Nubi interrupts Paul's relationship with his girlfriend Irma (played by Loretta Young, still a teenager), leads him to run away from school, and then urges him to buy his jewelry by stealing the savings of the Lena family's maid (ZaSu Pitts) . Lena, for her part, still mourns the loss of her boyfriend Peter, seduced and put aside by Nubi when he turns his attention to Paul. In the end Nubi puts his sights on the infamous father Josef, and I suppose that if the execution time had been longer, she would have gone after Uncle Dani, Maria, the village priest and God alone knows who else. <br /> <br /> I imagine it is obvious that a scenario like this lends itself easily to parody, but during its first half THE SQUALL still exercises the undeniable charm of a daytime soap: we watch, hypnotized, while the Bad Girl does his spell on men - unwinds and destroys like an irresistible force of nature (almost like ... a storm! Ah-haa, another metaphor!). But as the plot machinations weaken, the fun of the camp fades away. During the following scenes, Nubi is de-emphasized and the focus shifts to the dysfunctional dynamics of the Lajos family, and after a while these people become a real resistance. The son, in particular, behaves like a real heel, but the parents never recognize him or face their own shortcomings; everything, we were told, is the fault of Nubi, that tramp is not good. <br /> <br /> Cast men are boring. Apart from Miss Loy, the only actress who can handle the performances in talkies is ZaSu Pitts, formidable as usual. The mother of the Lajos family is played by Alice Joyce, a long-standing silent star who was out of her element with language roles and who retired soon after. The fresh freshness of Loretta Young offers a pleasant contrast to the dark charm of Nubi, but her line readings are so embarrassing that it is a little eye-catching. No, there is only one reason to watch this movie, and this is the same as Nubi. I can't think of another actress who could have played this silly role and managed to get even half. I'm not an objective observer, though. I have a desperate crush on Myrna Loy and I'll look at it in everything, including THE SQUALL.
