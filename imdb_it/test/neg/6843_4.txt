The most fertile man in Ireland revolves around Eamon Manley, who is 24 and still a virgin. He lives with his mother in Belfast. He is also a very shy boy towards women. Everything has changes for Eamon when he is seduced by a woman (as far as I can remember a neighbor). It is not because he loses his virginity but discovers he has super power. Despite having protection, this neighbor becomes pregnant. He is told by the doctor that he has a very high number of spermatozoa. His mother brilliantly finds an idea that makes us see children with ginger all around the end of the film. Start helping women on both sides of Belfast to conceive children. First of all, voluntarily, with the help of his colleague, he runs a business. The most fertile man in Ireland has his funny moments but needs to come up with better jokes and with a better script. I couldn't help thinking that it gave me the impression of a television sitcom rather than a movie. Kris Marshall is a different name on the silver screen but does not shine like a star. It's more like the guy you saw in this or that movie. As if it were in Love Actually (I think it was very funny in that) .. Well, it was ok to watch but couldn't help dozing off from time to time. ** outside *****
