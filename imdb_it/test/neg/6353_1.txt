Wow, Jeez, I don't even know where to start commenting on this thing they called a movie. I honestly don't know what the hell David Bradley started smoking after making Hard Justice, which in my opinion was a good movie after the features of American Ninja. I hadn't seen any of this guy's latest films since Cyborg Cop. Fortunately I saw them on Amazon for about 5 pounds each and I can safely say the following: if I had thrown down the 5 pounds I spent on Total Reality, Crisis and Expect to Die, I would have been happier than having to sit through the 90 minutes that each of them lasted. My God, how come HECK can label these as "movies" ??? And why do actors of martial arts and actions fall to their knees in a more smelly horse dung when they have reached their peak? I mean, David Bradley didn't deserve the Academy Award, but his first films were pretty funny. A tough and cool guy with a very good martial experience who gave sad lines but at least entertained fans of action and martial arts to some extent. But seriously, I'd like to know what went through this guy's head after doing Hard Justice. His last 3 films must frankly be the WORST I've ever had to sit on. As I said before, I'd like to get my money back on the 3 DVDs I bought. The crisis was the epitome of drowsiness, Total Reality was hard but this Expecting to Die is just an absolute nonsense. I bet the director was mega-stoned when he did this or was just peeing from every David Bradley fan who would sit in the middle of this shit pile. The plot revolves around a doctor (Bradley) who develops a type of virtual reality game in which he is only killing different people one by one. Sorry but I couldn't bring this guy seriously to play a villain with that dark hair, glasses and gray pants and absolutely NO physical combat (frankly, his best asset). The film is even worse than all those Saturday afternoon movies, because the acting is ridiculous, the direction is horrendous and the few fights in the film, well, what can I say ... The actors seem to be training with their fellow gym. We get a stupid brawny cop who starts to show his fighting stuff like an hour in the movie and fails heavily ... a furry French version of Van Damme who can't fight, act or talk to save his crazy and Bradley life , the alleged protagonist, playing the evil doctor for whom I was really happy when he stopped making this kind of expendable garbage. I also think he didn't kick in this movie probably because of his heart already playing it. For a B-actor, I have to admit that I really liked this guy, his style, physique, fighting skills ... But I'm really, really happy to have stopped acting after this monstrosity because honestly I couldn't have sat through others ninety minutes of pee material like this. Avoid at all costs even if you are a family of David Bradley, you will be glad you did, word.
