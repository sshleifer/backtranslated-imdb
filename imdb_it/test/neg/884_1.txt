Let me understand: <br /> <br /> "The Hotshot plastic surgeon loses a patient on the operating table while removing a cyst from his face and ends up falling in love with the guest bed and recently separated breakfast in about 24 hours of meeting her at because of his solid advice on the way of the bed. <br /> <br /> Wow. Move to "The Notebook", there's a new baby in town. <br /> <br /> Where to start. What about the depth of this "relationship"? I think we can safely summarize the basics of this immortal love in the following passages: <br /> <br /> 1. Swap courteous pleasantries with a bite of salad. Drink copious amounts of Jack Daniels, play basketball with old food 3. Give useless and unsolicited advice against each other about your terrible lives 4. Make love during a hurricane 5. Devote your lives to each other by air. <br /> <br /> I noticed that George C Wolfe has "The Hairball" and "United Kanye West Pr oject "in his dossier. Would it be "too hard for your gender" to be too hard? Enough said. I think most would agree that the best love stories make us cry, laugh or even hope. But the reason I'm able to do it is that, somewhere during the plot, we really start to worry about the characters we're looking at on the screen. To make us worry, it takes time to develop these characters ... their lives, their story, because we're looking at them now. Wolfe didn't seem to want to "waste our time" with such platitudes, and instead gave us all about 8 minutes of basic information about each character before launching into an intense direct interaction between two ACTORS that we "all came for adore, but two PEOPLE we could care less about. <br /> <br /> For a brief, delicate moment in which Richard Gere exclaims that he does not expect her to listen to his problems, and she invites him to dinner, viewer sees a glimmer - a beginning - of something special between these two characters, but instead of being able to enjoy the anticipation and playfulness of "what happens next" in the wonderful, unpredictable joy of courtship, we are instead pushed headlong into a love story between two people we barely know. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, we all listened to a monkey in romantic movies, but the reason we managed to Bogart in "Casablanca" or Nicholson in " Something 's Gotta Give "is because our hearts and minds have been raised to the heavens and dragged into the mud and turned back with these characters, and when they deliver the line, we are so deeply involved with their situation, we don't even have noticed the cheese factor. Since Wolfe doesn't allow us to love or even love our protagonists, all that's left is a fromage sandwich and giggles in the audience. <br /> <br /> Wolfe takes up the phrase of the old Hollywood director "cut to the chase" too literally here. As each cast liner is delivered by our cast, the viewer wonders if director Wolfe is subliminally saying to the public: "Come on, it's a Richard Gere love story. Just buy it." <br /> <br /> It is the result of this astonishing lack of character development or relationship that the climax of the film fails miserably in our hearts. When the character of Gere dies, I felt like I was watching the news about someone I didn't know about disappearing. Or watching the rowing race of eight women during the Beijing Olympics. As soon as. he did not. Care. <br /> <br /> Epic. To fail.
