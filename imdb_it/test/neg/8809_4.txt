Eh. This is a popcorn movie, nothing more. I watched it with a group of friends (and although this could NOT be the best way to see a horror movie ...) and most of the dialogue and actions were ridiculous. <br /> <br /> A real movie has left me nostalgic. :) <br /> <br /> The main problem is the lack of tension in the film. It continues to flash in the "explanation" scenes, which dissipate any perceptible tension. <br /> <br /> And the "twists" of the character relationship? Yes, they suck. I won't say what they are, but they simply don't add anything to the movie / plot. <br /> <br /> (By relationship, I mean the two main characters.) <br /> <br /> Eek. My recommendation is this: watch this movie if you can't think of something better. Mediocre at best ... Maybe not even that.
