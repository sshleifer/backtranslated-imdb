I thought maybe ... maybe this could be good. A first appearance of the Re-Animator (Jeffery Combs); many tributes to old horror movies; the Troma label on the front ?? this movie could be a gem! I thought it was wrong. <br /> <br /> Frightmare is a boring, exaggerated tribute and a bit dazed to the films of fear of the past. The story is old, young people break into a house, get drunk, make love and tamper with things that shouldn't be tampered with. Often? here the formula of the recycled slasher film is used, this time with the thought of being the dead actor named Conrad Radzoff to kill. In fact, the performance of Ferdy Mayne, Radzoff's actor, is the only saving quality of this film. The scornful character of Dracula does very well. But as for children, it's not so nice, with Combs having only a fraction. <br /> <br /> The film lacks the value of entertainment, and presents only one interesting character, and one or two scenes that can attract your attention. I don't recommend this movie unless you desperately want something to watch, and this is the only film left to success.
