I am almost embarrassed to admit having seen CALIGULA twice. The problems with production are almost too numerous to mention. The script is below standards (it's easy to see why Vidal tried to deny it). The management is worse. Most of the film is made up of long shots interspersed with close-ups interspersed with transversal cuts of mostly erotic porn (more frequent, of course, in the "uncut" version). Cinematography is particularly sub-par, giving the entire production a faded low-cost look that undermines some of the elaborate set designs. The film should have looked much better. The general concept of putting actors by name in what would easily have been an X-rated movie (Guccione called it "paganography") runs out after the first hour after Peter O'Toole and John Guilgud's release. Bob Guccione obviously spent a lot of dollars, but it all seems a big waste. If you want a better understanding of the Roman Empire in the first century look at the BBC production of the 80s in the middle of the century, CLAUDIO instead ... and if you want porn, jeeze-Louise, look elsewhere.
