Obviously, the comments above that fawn above the film were made by someone who is part of the crew. I don't remember ever seeing a movie that offends the talented actors or the watching audience more. In my 30 years of watching movies, this is the only one I've ever walked by. Bad humor, bad jokes, bad gags, bad touch-ups, bad plot, etc. <br /> <br /> Note to the producer: it is never fun to hunt humans based on race. It's great that you've tried to be politically correct by incorporating all races, but you're still chasing humans based on race, and that's disgusting.
