That's all I can really say about this movie. It's DBZ ... like Tree of Might and The World's Strongest, actually ... it doesn't fit the timeline for the show, although it's supposedly positioned just before the TV series begins. The action is quite beautiful in general. The plot has a pretty good base, with a good background that explains why these guys hate each other and everyone. Good enough overall, there ... The problem is ... there's a lot of really weird stuff. I mean, really weird stuff. Like The World's Strongest, there's a really, really weird song in this that could only have been created in a drug-induced haze ... it is disturbing that Gohan, while singing, is practically drugged alone. Horrifying. The bad guys are weird and pretty comical ... more than the usual DBZ type - it looks more like a Dragon Ball movie than a Dragon Ball Z movie. In general, it's pretty funny, but ... just ... strange.
