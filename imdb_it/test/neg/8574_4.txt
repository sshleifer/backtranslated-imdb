The main flaw in this Spanish slasher / shocker is in the script. For the first half hour it is a positive effort, building some suspense and an atmosphere of fear and terror. We also have good killings! Then it goes completely downhill and turns into a whole catalog of "your basic slasher clich√©s". I have to admit that I was pretty disappointed because the trailer promised much more. The last thirty minutes consist of some murders and many running into an abandoned convent. It should have been much better (even if the final scenes in the flooded room are quite right)! <br /> <br /> First of all, we have dialogue. It's terrible most of the time (there was a lot of laughter among the audience here and there when I saw it) and simply adjusted elsewhere. It is also barely audible during many scenes, drowning under the pressure of sound effects and the soundtrack (however it may not be so bad after considering the stupid lines we need to hear!). There is a line throughout the film that refers to the film "I know what you did last summer", indicating that the directors wrote everything as a big joke, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> And the ending ... well, some will hate it, others will dig it. For me, it was primarily a question of the first because the final turn comes from nothing! If the public had been given some clues about the mental state of the girls, I might have thought otherwise. Also throw away all the logic from the window, because the killer could never be in place for some of the killings! But as a passionate horror I've learned to live with these inconsistencies in Spanish and Italian films. <br /> <br /> But not everything is bad. The film has a very cheap look, mainly due to the excellent cinematography (the scenes of past times here really shone), the tight editing and an atmospheric soundtrack. Although most of the actors are pretty bad, Anita Briem is an exception, making the most of what she has to work with. Real presence on the screen! <br /> <br /> And, as I said before, the murders are pretty bloody for fans of these things and are usually accompanied by excellent special effects that relate to images of water (but the theme of water "In the end however it tends to get boring. <br /> <br /> So to finish this review, it's a movie that is quite funny in a "so-bad-is-good" way and is also pleasing to the eye. too much because you don't get it as you probably think it will be, judging by the trailer and plot descriptions.
