It's Valentine's Day and we decided to stay, have dinner and watch this movie on TCM instead of going out. We are in our 40s - 50s, romantic love, and we are both "sophists", but this film was just bombed for us (it's hard to imagine it being nominated for the Oscars, etc., but I guess it was then ). The cinematography has been beautiful but for the most part the film as a whole is terribly dated. The character of Jennifer Jones made so many references to her being Eurasion that we started counting and after a while we were giggling every time she said it. Add to that the "theme song" played incessantly throughout the film and we couldn't wait for it to end, so we could watch the evening news.
