In general, I prefer horror films that insinuate me so much that I'm afraid of everything for the next day or so, not those where people behave in a stupid way and are killed by an indestructible monster. This is one of those movies. The chupacabra of the legend is a gray-greenish dog-skinned monster that jumps like a kangaroo, has fangs and claws, has a row of sharp thorns sticking out of its back and sucking the blood of cattle. As in many horror films, both good and bad, this film takes liberty with the legend. It not only attacks humans, but eats their intestines and has a bulletproof, almost indestructible constitution. So tell me, how can a hypodermic needle get into his skin when bullets can't? And why, when sailors understand that piercing bullets can injure them, do they split up so that the chupacabras can eliminate them one by one? John Rhys-Davies offers a performance that rises above the ugly movie, and Chelan Simmons and Dylan Neal also deserve credit for their performances. Otherwise, the rest of the acting was from bad to bad, just like the rest of the film. My assessment is based on Rhys-Davies, Simmons and Neal.
