I really wanted this film to like it, but the pace was too slow. <br /> <br /> It was a good story, but it was really like watching a snail race. <br /> <br /> the film would have been better served if it had more action. I do not mean anything exceptional, but at least something in the background. <br /> <br /> It could also have been helped by songs that defined the tone / mood of the longer periods that were absent from the dialogue. <br /> <br /> It's been about 10 years since I saw it, so I might have to give it another chance. <br /> <br /> 3/10 or * 1/2 (out of four)
