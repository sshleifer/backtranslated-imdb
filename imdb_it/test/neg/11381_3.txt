"Ghost Son" is the best film by Lamberto Bava and, at the same time, also his worst. I suppose this statement requires a slight clarification. It's his best because he's well directed, ambitious, accessible and very elegant, but his worst because it's a boring film, not original and undeniably a huge disappointment for all the true fans of Bava's past efforts. Let's face it: many fans, including myself certainly, would not have been interested in this film to judge by the plot, by the famous names attached to it and even by the title with the boring sound. The only motivation here was Lamberto Bava, who brought us large quantities of twisted Yellows and fun splatter movies in the past. "Ghost Son" is a bit of his return movie, alongside "The Torturer", and although the latter is definitely not a good movie, at least he lives up to his fans' expectations, with excessive amounts of sleaze , blood and sadism. "Ghost Son" is a weak and intolerably soft horror film, which also speaks in terms of mainstream ghost stories. The emphasis is too much on sentimentality, and this severely affects the already limited number of horrific and disturbing atmospheric moments. The basic premise could present one or two potentially good ideas, but the film is overall boring and too cliche. John Hannah and Laura Harring are a happy couple, living on a remote ranch in South Africa and raising horses for a living. Perhaps joy and happiness could not improve, so naturally something tragic is bound to happen, and it does. Mark dies in a car accident, but the inconsolable Stacey remains on the ranch where he is in constant contact with Mark's spirit. She even becomes pregnant with her son, but soon after Martin's birth, mysterious events are born. It seems that Mark's restless and selfish ghost has "possessed" the child and uses it to encourage Stacy to commit suicide. With an emphasis on the couple's relationship, many of the events and subplots are underdeveloped and / or remain unexplained, like the whole background of the young maid Thandi. There is too little action and the only real moments of fear are too clearly borrowed from classic films like "The Exorcist" and "Rosemary's Baby" (green vomit, mobile furniture). Purely speaking in terms of horrible entertainment "Ghost Son" is a painful infamy, but it must be said, it is a charming and charming good looking. The cinematography is extremely elegant and many camera angles are really imaginative and suggestive. Sometimes the moody score even manages to create a disturbing atmosphere, even if nothing significant happens on the screen. There are many beautiful pictures of the South African fauna to be admired but, if this interests you, I suppose you are better looking at National Geographic. There is not much to recommend here. Atmosphere-inspired ghost story lovers have much better options to choose from and Bava hard fanatics are invited to (re) watch "Demons", "Macabre" or "Blade in the Dark".
