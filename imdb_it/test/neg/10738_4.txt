Ok, there is a nice heartbeat (when the dead rise from their graves, the names of the old "horror" directors like Jacques Tournier and Jean Yarborough are present in the gravestones) and the destruction of Repu / morally bankrupt rightist is in danger: evil skanks that preach morality, etc. But why are these soldiers anti-Republicans? Because they went to war, most of them should be Republicans, right? Why don't they go kill the enemies that killed them or something? Why does EVERYONE want to vote against Republicans? Why did this story make a movie? The questions never answered ...
