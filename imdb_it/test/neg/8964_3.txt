As someone has already mentioned on this forum, it is very difficult to make a fake documentary. It requires enormous skill, rhythm, patience, directorial "distance", a plausible premise, a narrative flow, and a REALLY credible acting (ie GREAT acting). <br /> <br /> Such is not the case with "Love Machine". He begins to show his fake hand on the 20-minute mark (with 60 minutes left to watch), and the viewer begins to realize that he has been captured. It's downhill from there. <br /> <br /> Director Gordon Eriksen simply peaked too soon. But to be honest with Eriksen, his problems started early: as he explained in the extras, he started wanting to do a REAL doc, he couldn't get funding and was content with a cheaper way to make his film. <br /> <The premise - the people who have secret lives entering a porn site - was perhaps more interesting in 1997-98, when the film was made. Eriksen does a lot of complicated things - an "intrusive" host, hand-held cameras, zooms, grainy blacks and whites - I imagine, to arouse a sense of authenticity, but it just doesn't work. The film is confused and forced, but what ultimately makes it fall is the credibility of the actors and the rather horrible dialogue.
