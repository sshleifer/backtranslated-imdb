Greetings Everyone, <br /> <br /> Isn't it surprising the power that movies have on you after the first viewing? <br /> <br /> I have been so happy since the first viewing of this film, I could not not stop talking about "Flatliner" to all my friends for weeks - think that I was a very impressionable 18 year old then and my tastes in movies they have become a little more conservative since then. <br /> <br /> So somehow I forgot this movie until I saw the DVD in my department store and I remembered how fantastic it was I thought "Right! I'll kick you off the shelf when they take out the Special edition". <br /> <br /> Last week, I was overjoyed when my best friend invited me to see Flatliners on DVD. The expectation was that I would have liked this film to the second vision even more. How wrong I was! <br /> <br /> Verdict: after 11 years my point of view on this film had changed from a very scary 1st class film to a total garbage that overturns the religious and supernatural side of things rather superficially. <br /> <br /> I've never been a huge fan of the acting of Julia Roberts (except Erin Brockeridge in which she deserved her Oscar) I think the problem with this film certainly lies with the director and such a mediocre script. I left this film feeling that it had no real substance or potential, and only a couple of chills to say the least scary that weren't very well made. Not even the soundtrack of James-Newtown Howard, which I prefer as a film composer, could fascinate and amuse me. <br /> <br /> In 1990 I would have given this movie 9.5 / 10; but in 2001 I would be lucky to give him 2/10 at the most. <br /> <br />
