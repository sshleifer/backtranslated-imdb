Within the first 5 minutes of this film I knew I was in one of those "choose the faults" movies. The acting was terrible, the script was even worse. Anyone who lets these people write such shit for a movie must be fed with the same Komodos. With Russian jets posing as US air force jets, and guns that can miraculously fire 50 to 60 rapid-fire shots without reloading is a poor detail for any story. In one scene komodo kills troops of special forces during the night, while in another they are explaining how the komodos and cobras are in cold blood and do not come out at night !!!! Even with fantastic special effects available in today's film industry, they were only average for this low-budget film. <br /> <br /> All that has been said, I looked at it until the end intrigued by what other wonders the bad movie could produce. Shame Shame for having produced this decomposition !!! <br /> <br /> This film should have been left on the cutting room floor !!!
