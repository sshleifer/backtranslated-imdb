<br /> <br /> Never take a movie just for its beautiful title. <br /> <br /> Although everything starts well, the film suffers from the same imperfections you see in the B movies. It is as if at some point the writer no longer acted like finishing the film, so it ends in a way that nobody suspects that you think this way is brilliant. <br /> <br /> A film to be listed at the top of the waste list. <br /> <br />
