There are bad movies and then there are movies that are even the worst. This is the view. <br /> <br /> The film is simply bad on all points. The plot, the acting, the work with the camera, the music and everything else are absolutely terrible and I can't understand how this garbage came to the big screen. <br /> <br /> The simple fact is that Saw is riddled with holes in the plot. The beginning is tempting and leaves much to be desired, but it does not hold up and the plot becomes absolutely ridiculous and absurd. The film is not creative and will not leave you with a single bit of credibility. People who claim that this film is gory, violent, sadistic and scary are girls who have nightmares after seeing CSI because it's far from that. <br /> <br /> So I warn you that you know, don't try to look at this if you have some kind of intellect, because you will be disappointed. A real boredom and a mediocre film as can be.
