I started watching it but didn't believe any of the characters. In particular, the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress didn't work at all for me. The scenes between the bakery owner and the assistant were nice but the rest was just very slow. It was a very superficial film and gave me the feeling that I was watching the game rather than a movie. The characters were very "stage" and the plot was very similar to a theatrical farce. The moment the pyromaniac gave up the assistant, I got bored and didn't care anymore about what happened next and so I was turned off. I'm glad I didn't pay to see it. Don't laugh or smile once. There seems to be a strange tendency for Americans to classify their films as "comedy" when they are fun rather than amusing. I finally learned to avoid what Americans call dark comedies that usually turn out to be macabre and little fun. Now it seems that I will have to be a little more perceptive when they also call a romantic movie comedy. Perhaps comedy means something different when applied to a movie rather than a series in America. I don't understand why America can produce incredibly fun comedies like Two and a half men, Will and Grace, King of Queens but I can't make really funny films without resorting to humor in the toilets. This film was not disgusting or anything. But it wasn't really a big yawn ...
