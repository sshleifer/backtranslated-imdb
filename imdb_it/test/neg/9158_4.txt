This is a "whodunit" below average with the clich√© of everyone in the living room routine. Charlie Chan is a secret service agent who carries out government activities and must find out who killed a scientist who is working on a bomb to defeat German U-boats in World War II. There is little to recommend with this film, since neither the bomb nor the scientist nor the war have much to do with the plot. Fans of Charlie Chan will most likely find this film disappointing. Who dunit? Who cares?
