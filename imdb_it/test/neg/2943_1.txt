at first I thought it was bad because I had high expectations for this film, but after thinking that it is so bad. I was almost caught up in the promotion of bad stars in bad movies. The new generation of hk actors and actresses, not to mention the bad screenwriters, is breaking down the sector. at the moment I'm still trying to figure out how serious it is so high. normally you can't lose in a movie with womanhood yen and ekin (forget Jackie, she has exceeded her peak). but then I should understand when the twins were on the cover. it's a mess, campy, very corny, I try to laugh at a few jokes, but not only is the effect minimal, but the jokes are very recycled and not fun. I'm sorry I bought the movie. the only reason some people think it's so beautiful is because they have been brainwashed into the clamor that the twins are cute, and everyone likes them, and that everything they do is good and fun. and that if you like twins, then you are up to date ... <br /> <br /> sigh ... I miss the good days of hk cinema when the jet movies and stephen chow dominated the box office ... < br /> <br /> films from mainland China are much better than this, and are shot for lower budgets.
