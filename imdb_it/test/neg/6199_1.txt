I saw this film only because it was expected to be yet another entertainer of David Dhawan. <br /> <br /> Return of Bad Bad by David Dhawan. He made a lot of funny movies in the past that didn't make sense, but none of them was shit !! What was the waste of talent and beauty? Donno, because the actors agree in making films like this. <br /> <br /> There was not a modicum of practicality in this film. The film is below par and does not justify the standard and potential of Bollywood. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth watching in this movie was katrina, but we don't need to watch a movie like this to see it! Being a remake of the Hollywood Hitch movie it's clear that Bollywood directors can't even make a real remake. I consider this the worst movie I've ever seen. Terrible 1/10
