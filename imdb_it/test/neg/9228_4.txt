Here's what this movie really takes. A great piece of cheeze. This film is about a couple of brothers and sisters Bonnie and Clyde who create their own party line to attract their victims and trap them and kill them. But why? Just for the sake of getting away with it? Richard Hatch arrives who introduces himself as a luscious gentleman lover. A real BAD version of a gentleman. And gets involved in finding out who's behind all the killings on LA. Finally he meets a teenager who helps him find the killer and rest is for your fun and enjoyment. But there are parts in this film that really make me go like the scene with Lief Garret dressed in his mother's wedding dress acting like a sissy in front of her sister telling her he needs her and can't live without her and watching as she slaps him on the face that dominates him. I can't believe it was Lief !!! Well, I guess I can do it. But it's worth watching, but only seeing one of the worst Garrets movies I've ever made.
