Once again, Mr. Costner dragged a film much longer than necessary. Apart from the terrifying sea rescue sequences, of which there are very few people, I didn't care about any of the characters. Most of us have ghosts in the closet, and Costner's character is made soon, and then forgotten until much later, at which time I didn't care. The character we should really be interested in is Ashton Kutcher, very arrogant and too self-confident. The problem is that he comes out as a child who thinks he is better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a messy closet. His only obstacle seems to be Costner's conquest. In the end, when we are well beyond the midpoint of this skunk, Costner tells us all about Kutcher's ghosts. We are told why Kutcher is driven to be the best without any warning or foreshadowing. No magic here, it was all I could do to not turn it off after an hour.
