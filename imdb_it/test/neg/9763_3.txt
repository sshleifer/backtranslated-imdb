I loved the beautiful Greek scenery but the story, which is not something you can still follow, was even more difficult to follow in the film. I can't imagine how someone watching the movie can have any grip on it if they haven't read the book, and then, like me, they'll probably wonder why the Australian Allison became French Anne and many other seemingly useless changes history. The mysteries of the book seemed to have popped up or left in the film. I saw it when it first came out and I had the same problems then, since I had read the book several times. I saw him recently with my niece (very intelligent at 20 and usually in the films I like) who especially marveled at the young Michael Caine and Candace Bergen, but otherwise he couldn't imagine why he would look at him if he didn't for the scenario.
