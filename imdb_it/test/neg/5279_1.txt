Low budget films like this give me hope as an aspiring screenwriter. In other words, if there are people out there who are willing to finance a piece of schlock like this, then there is certainly much more than a glimmer of hope for someone like me who can actually write stories. This film is right there, or should I say "down there" with the Ed Wood's of the world. History, if you can call it that, and dialogue, not to mention sophomoric acting, is a disguise towards the genre itself. Someone was supposed to drive a pole through this stink while he was still alone on paper. It follows that since the literature has been practically eliminated, the film should follow. To have a good or even passable movie, you must have at least good writing. The legendary Curt Siodmak comes to mind. They have used many of his stories for low-budget films since then, but today they continue to be good and serious entertainment, such as "Donavan's brain". The cast of this "work" should seriously consider returning to work in their respective burger or shoe stores and forgetting any future weak attempts to appear in front of a camera. Avoid this like the same plague !!!
