This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. They said this was the man's answer to Waiting to Exhale ... All I will say is that we really didn't respond at all. I couldn't believe it was actually made. The director should choose another profession, because he cannot make a film. The script was not good. It made no sense and was very messy. The bet movies are much better than this, and I was terribly disappointed to see the talented actor Terrence on this negative excuse for a movie. If I could go back in time I will not go back to Media Play to never buy the film, I would just wrap it on the shelf instead of wasting time looking at it.
