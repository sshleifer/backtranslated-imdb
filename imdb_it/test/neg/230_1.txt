Bruce Willis, as usual, does an excellent job. <br /> <br /> [warning: can be considered a "spoiler"] <br /> <br /> While my friend thought it was good, I kept looking at my watch during the whole film wondering when it would be over. After watching great films like "The Patriot" and "Chicken Run" I was very disappointed with Disney's "The Kid". <br /> <br /> Willis plays a middle-aged man with a hard and realistic attitude in putting positive rotation on people's images (he is an image consultant). An unknown child shows up. Yes, he is but younger, and even Lily Tomlin can see it. At this point I am reminded of a cross between a poor episode of "Quantum Leap" and a bad traveling movie. <br /> <br /> Kid and Willis pass trying to understand why it is in that period. They understand it. They meet Willis when he is older. Never mind that it never goes into details how old Willis teleported them in a period of time and puts them together to begin with, how he got that knowledge to begin with, how he realized he needed to do it, and so on. br /> <br /> Basically, it is a very tired, unoriginal, uninteresting plot that has some great actors in it. The good news is that the actor "The Kid" is not at all as annoying as it was presented in the trailers on television.
