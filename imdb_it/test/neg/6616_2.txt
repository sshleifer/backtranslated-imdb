"Season on the Brink" is one of my favorite books of all time: a penetrating and insightful look at Bob Knight and his Indiana Hoosiers. And Dennehy is one of my favorite supporting actors of all time. So I committed to looking at this adaptation. <br /> <br /> Disappointed at every level. Dennehy's performance was less than inspired, and he seemed unprepared to play Knight - as if he had accepted the role just before the shoot. The rest of the cast is not much better. <br /> <br /> And it was obvious that this was the first ESPN film. It was poorly directed, poorly filmed, and the lack of budget was obvious whenever games were played (smaller gyms, empty seats, etc.). Skip this adaptation and read the book - it holds up well until today!
