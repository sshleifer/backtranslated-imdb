Well!! the film contains Catherine Zeta Jones. It's a branded TV movie. It is based on a novel by Thomas Hardy. She has Catherine Zeta Jones in it. She is by far the only one in the film that performs better than my high school theater class. Oh yes, there are Clive Owen. I'm not British, so this means almost as much as being a Thomas Hardy novel. Except it was in "The Bourne Identity", and I liked it. This wraps everything around people. This is really all there was. I'm getting repetitive, but I like CZJ, so I brought it to the end. The computer is telling me that I don't have 10 lines and I keep counting them. I always count 11, but maybe I don't like my style, but this is also my opinion on the film.
