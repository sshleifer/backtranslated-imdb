It's the New Year, a policeman-murderer (in the form of Laurence Fishburne) ends up in an area that closes due to snow. When people are besieged, cops have to deal with opponents to survive. This revisitation of the John Carpenter classic just had to add some twists beyond the stupid storyline, eliminate all the tension and add a horrible John Lequizamo to the cast, right? The first film was electrifying, gritty and a joy to watch. This is more Hollywood, clich√© and painful to watch. The only thing I got from this movie is that obsessive compulsive disorder can be very annoying ... VERY. The final song is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: comment by Richet, Demonaco and Jeffrey Silver; Delete scenes with optional comments; 5 minute "Armed and Dangerous" featurette on the weapons expert; 7 minutes and a half "behind Precinct Walls"; "Plan of attack"; "The Assault Team"; 12 and a half minutes behind the scenes of featurettes;, trailer for "Unleashed", "White Noise": seed of Chucky "<br /> <br /> Miscelanious: I took it at Best Buy and arrived with a record bonuses including the first 2 minutes of "Cry Wolf", a first 10-minute look at "Unleashed", the trailer for that movie and an interview with Fuzion with John Leguizamo
