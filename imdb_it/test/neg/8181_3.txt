After seeing Avalon (which was decent only for the fantastic digital fx) and several anime films written by Oshii, including Jin-Roh (which is fantastic) I decided to take a look at the box set of the Oshii cinema trilogy. Since the red glasses and the stray dog ​​are connected, I will comment on both here. And let me tell you, it was one of the biggest waste of money I spent in an instant. I first saw Stray Dogs and then The Red Spectacles. I'm sad to say that these films are probably the two most boring movies I've ever seen. For only about 10 minutes in each film you can see some action between the characters, who are dressed only in the "Panzer Cop" clothes for some fleeting scenes. The rest of the time you will see some very elaborate scenes full of boring dialogues in less than impressive locations. I really don't understand the motivation behind these two films. I love the clothes of the Wolf Brigade and the idea behind the plot, but the films themselves leave a lot to be desired. I would suggest NOT watching these films and I certainly wouldn't buy the casket like I did, unless you like wasting money. Oh, and if you're wondering what I think of the third movie on the set, Talking Head, I couldn't even bring myself to watch it before I deleted the casket from my DVD collection via eBay at a loss of $ 20. If you want a live action Japanese, take a look at Returner, or Ichii the Killer or the Zeiram series.
