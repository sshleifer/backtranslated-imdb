Two things always indicate that you are watching a bad movie: <br /> <br /> 1) If you instantly remember other films like THE TERMINATOR, HARDWARE or BLADE RUNNER during the title sequence <br /> <br /> 2) If there is a death during a sex scene immediately after the title sequence <br /> <br /> Actually there is a third warning sign and this is a caption indicating a lazy exposure that warns the poor ignorant public naive of the dangers of corporate greed. Guess what ? CYBORG 2 begins with a caption that warns us of corporate greed in the future, followed by a sequence of titles that reminded me of THE TERMINATOR, HARDWARE and BLADE RUNNER followed by a death during a sex scene! Hey, don't you think I'm gonna watch a bad movie by accident? <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, this is a bad movie. It's basically a series of action scenes written around a weave of a cyborg fleeing an avid company. It is poorly written, directed and acted and above all it is badly lit, which means that it is very difficult to see what happens on the screen, even if I am not entirely sure that it is really a bad thing. The only interest is that it is the film debut of Angelina Jolie who plays the cyborg on the run and who says the prophetic phrase "They are adorable, I wonder if they are real?", Which is something I ask myself every time I see one of his films
