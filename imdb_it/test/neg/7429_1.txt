This will be my first review on IMDb and I'm glad the standard rating is 1 out of 10 because then I don't have to change anything ... <br /> <br /> Before there are terrible movies. Movies where you can laugh, like Island City, Battlefield Earth or Conan The Destroyer. This is absolutely acceptable. They make a great party enhancer. Then there's the worst movie ever. I can't believe how bad this pile of steaming dog poop was. <br /> <br /> I found it in a second hand store on VHS and bought it quickly because I like sci-fi, Terminator, post-apocalypse and stuff like that. Everything about the art of the box was very promising. Then I loaded the tape quickly when I got home and the first thing I noticed was ... WHAT? There have been maybe 10 minutes (or more) of switching between present clips and flashbacks in a very annoying blue effect, with sounds that make you vomit. And it simply continues over and over again. Then a bit of "acting" intervenes and you wonder why you were ever born in a world, where this abomination of humanity really exists ... And then I realized that TWO PREQUEL EXISTS. I didn't think of it before, but the title says "3" in it ... And I was horrified. But since I actually felt pain and agony until the end, I thought that nothing could ever make me feel worse than myself and this universe ... But then a small text appeared that said ... "Come in ... . "and ... NEMESIS 4?!?!?! NO PLEASE NO !!!!!!!!
