I bought the DVD of this movie because I'm a fan of William Devane and I was really disappointed with "A Christmas Visitor". The story of the film is so boring and slow in development that you want to turn off the TV or DVD player after about half of it. The dialogues are really bad and belong to a daily soap opera, but not in a TV movie. William Devane was good in his part and he performed quite well, but he did it much better in other films and projects. Meredith Baxter was horrible and couldn't really bring the warm-hearted mother to the spectators. Instead it sounded very good and was no better than a middle-class actress. I can't recommend this movie at all. Save time and money for this.
