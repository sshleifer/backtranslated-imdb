I'd like to write a short summary of the plot of this film, but ... there simply isn't one! If you just look at the keywords of the plot for this title, you know practically the whole content of the film: sex, breasts, exploitation, female frontal nudity and female prison! 80 minutes of pure sleaze and nothing more. "Escape of the Island Women" (an alternative title that is not even listed here) clearly wanted to become another well-known and controversial classic of the woman in prison, but totally lacks the brutality of one. WIP movies are meant to blend graphic sexual images with shocking violence, but the violence here has just been replaced with more sex. Director Erwin Dietrich certainly can't compete with industry specialists, like Jess Franco or Joe D'Amato, and he should have kept to the realization of normal soft-core gestures. The only aspects that look a little like cult movies are the resemblance of the tyrant-president with Fidel Castro and the gang rape of a girl (minor?) By the soldiers. The girls are lovely, though, and the location of the Ibiza shootings seems very fascinating.
