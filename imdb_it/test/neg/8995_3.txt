In most cases a deadly undertaking, Naach speaks of this dancer / choreographer (Antara Mali) who considers herself a kind of author, beyond the petty commercial compromises that the people around her, including her actor beau (Abhishek Bachchan) build their careers. Nice idea, only it turns out that she has the most terribly bad concepts on dance costumes and movements, stuff so rotten that it even makes the forces behind those ultra-cheap South American superpowers that contend in serious embarrassment. <br /> <br /> The story follows a predictable pattern for yawning ... dancer and boyfriend meet and have a relationship (yes, sex included) ... boyfriend gets success, but rejects his attempts to help her ... Beau throws the attitude and they walk against each other ... the dancer meets a very unlikely director who wants to "do what he wants" ... incongruous bags, bags even more incongruous in popularity .. beau's attempts to reach the audience are pushed back to the climax where he breaks out of how he can't live without her ... D-uh end. <br /> <br /> Actually I didn't really expect this movie to be very good. So why did I see it? Because I have a fetish from Antara Mali. She is an actress with IMO enough talent to reach great heights, provided she has the opportunity. Alas, his role in the film seems much better on paper than in real execution, ironic for a film that should be an uncompromising character. To give her credit, she puts the effort into play, shining well in the few scenes that actually ask her as an actress. I just wish the film had been more worthy of her. Even Abhishek Bachchan throws some good punches, the last scene somehow saved by a boiling tack that is pleasantly reminiscent of his father. <br /> <br /> Recommended only if you can sit among huge stacks of poop for the return of some grains of good moments by kind permission of the main actors.
