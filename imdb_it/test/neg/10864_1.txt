This is easily one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time (and I recently saw Starship Troopers 2 !!!). I didn't find anything to redeem this movie. Acting, which is probably the best aspect of the film, is fair at best. Michael Madsen sums it up in his standard character character. Denis Hopper doesn't seem to know what it should be. Vinnie Jones's accent is bizarre. One positive thing is that Leonor Valera looks fantastic. His acting is pretty mediocre, but I doubt that's why he's there. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is really terrifying. It's just rubbish. I don't know who signed it, but next time they will really need professional help. <br /> <br /> This film is the reason why the IMDB classification system should be able to include zero stars out of ten. Avoid at all costs.
