Fortunately, I didn't see this movie in a movie, a big screen, only on a small screen in video. I doubt that I could watch the film in a cinema and witness all the violence in the film. After watching the first 30 minutes, I became both disappointed and curious. <br /> <br /> Disappointed with the difficult plot to follow, the difficult-to-understand screens, the enormous amount of aggression - I still don't know why I was shown the Daesu (main character) who pulled out the teeth of a another person, his bestiality for women, he who cut the tongue. And also curious, to see what the film will say as a conclusion, what is the final summary of all this brutality. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, even though the film was not boring, I had no response to all these cruelties that I had to observe from beginning to end. In my opinion, if you want blood and you want to laugh, there's Kill Bill 1-2, if you want more meaningful blood, you can take any recent war movie, and if you want an oriental movie, there are much better titles out there. Later I will take the evaluations from the Cannes Film Festival with more precaution, since Oldboy received a lot of praise from the jury, he didn't have much to tell me and he was only 4/10 on my scale. <br /> <br /> I am hungry to see something beautiful, harmonious, with true feelings and a clear message.
