I'm an atheist. For me history and truth mean a lot. <br /> <br /> This film is made after a novel published in 1921, which is still being updated until today as if it were a history book. Well, it's not. The film is about the 1950s version of the novels. Some actors were BIG but that doesn't cover the plot. <br /> <br /> In short, the man invents a super bomb, so God and his friends hold a court to see if they have to intervene. The analogy of the devil haunts man, and in defense we have the spirit of man. What is the spirit of man anyway? And why was Adam the first defendant? In the end we get the Christian propaganda of the United States in a fifth-grade history book of the time. Although other religions are mentioned, only European Christianity is explored. <br /> <br /> First we take the story of the Cavemen. Women are skinny stereotypes of damsels in distress. The real rock women were as strong as the men and equally resistant. Hard times, hard life, adapting and surviving. All this is watered down by the stereotypes of the middle of the century. <br /> <br /> Next we get the first pyramid building in Egypt. Today we see a different story and we know that there have been many fewer deaths and even regular citizens at work. Losing the mentioned amount of many lives in the process would have been a national disaster and no one would have tried to beat him after that. As if there were only ONE pyramid configuration. <br /> <br /> The part about Moses and a true god was as if the Spanish Inquisition were pretty. The Inquisition itself was never mentioned in the film. <br /> <br /> The wickedness of Helen of Troy was so vile that I didn't understand why so many were interested in her. In reality they were only soldiers, following the orders of the commanders, who were "discussing" a political question of power. It was just an excuse. <br /> <br /> The story of Cleopatra was that I saw this film was inaccurate and full of propaganda. Here brother was much younger. She was not obsessed with poison, was educated enough to restore the contents of the library, and was politically competitive in dragging Egypt down from the earth. <br /> <br /> The part with Nero and the Christians who prayed in a cave were disgusting. Yes, burnt Rome. Yes, there was persecuted Christianity. But the way they described it was as if the Colosseum was built by itself and there was no Vespasian to rebuild Rome. Attila the Hun appears briefly and we jump on King Arthur. The crusades are mentioned with a minimum of bloodshed. And there is no mention of the crusades to the east towards Russia that ended in an ironic battle. The knights have just returned home and started joking to have fun. MANY things are put down without feathers, hygiene and covered sores. <br /> <br /> Then they cover Joan of Ark, where she always has makeup and looks like a prince. Territorial policy has been replaced by an unjust court. The sun sits alone on a stool makes me want to ask how someone could follow here. At this point I wanted to scream "Hura! Now you die already! Special economic effects, where's the fire?". <br /> <br /> When they mentioned Leonardo, I was already fed up with the movie. Columbus, Spanish massacre in America, shouting Queen Elizabeth "kills the Spanish army" and so on. <br /> <br /> The ONLY reason I wanted to see this film was the fact that it was the last one with all 3 Marks brothers. And all they got was the scene with Manhattan and the Indians. Funny, but not more than a smile. <br /> <br /> Witch hunts are mentioned briefly, as are sores (after the rebirth). When they begin to portray revolutions, things become power hungry and anarchist. The American revolution was pursued by the French revolution. Oppression and incompetence are bad, but you can't just blow the old way out of anger, you have to replace it with something. Thus they replaced the French monarchy with the new French monarchy. So we get Napoleon and his ambitions to go to India by land. But they replace his motifs with unity and tie him only to the title of "Emperor". The conquests in Europe, the defeat in Russia are plundered in Waterloo. <br /> <br /> The American Civil War, the rich English inventors (Tesla not included). "Mister Watson, come here, I want you" almost made me laugh for teenage reasons. Hard technological work has been watered down to the final discovery and misuse of the comedians. <br /> <br /> In the end, after 85 minutes, we arrive at world wars and organized crime, but none of its horrors. The words of Adolph "I invade Russia, this is my last territorial request" were hilarious. It was his LAST territorial request. <br /> <br /> To build the suspense God puts a countdown to the judgment day on the "wall" for the final words. Do all the powerful fail to suspend the universe for a second? There was no need for the persecution speech, but the defense made one last shot. <br /> <br /> Last we see the man of tomorrow as the final defense. Apparently a paradoxical man, because the bomb had to pass today. His toys are a music box in the shape of a gun and a box of pencils. Now is it so wrong ?? Pens and pencils have designed so many weapons projects that their number of killings exceeds the atomic bomb. And make music with a weapon? The deluded selfish generals make music the fire of arms. So the man of tomorrow is already a monster. <br /> <br /> The way I see it, all the defense had to do was blame the devil as the real conspirator for the death of the man and the closed case. And honestly, compared to all the barbaric things that our ancestors did centuries ago, we are quite human to stab back painlessly these days. <br /> <br /> To sum up, I will mention only the episode of "Firefly" "Jaynestown": "It is my esteem that every man ever got a statue made by him was a son of a bitch other, it's not about you, Jayne, but about what they need ".
