I'm always interested in seeing neglected films that seem to have good credentials, but in this case the negligence of the film appears to be justified. Evidently based on some real incidents during World War II, the film does not connect with the viewer for some reason that is not clear enough for me. A very probable reason is that, in the print I saw on TCM, however, none of the scenes in which the Germans spoke among themselves received titles. This interesting concept of directing - letting the non-German speaking viewer understand from the "context" what the Germans say about each other - is, in my book, a complete flop and helps to block the viewer. Furthermore, the way the film starts - it makes us fall into a very confused situation without many settings - is confusing. Brian Keith is pretty good here, but the reputation of "The Great Escape" and "Stalag 17" will not be challenged by this film.
