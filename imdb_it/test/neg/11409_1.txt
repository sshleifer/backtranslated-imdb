In another of the terrible horror films that I seem so masochistically attracted to, we have a group of friends stuck in a haunted house that are slowly killed one by one thanks to a horde of zombies that spit yellow blood and have very serious dental problems . The first 45 minutes are all talked about, and considering that young actors cannot go to a paper bag and have the most banal dialogue that they never play dispassionately, sitting down is particularly painful. If you can stay awake through this nonsense, things don't improve ... with bad makeup to say the least and poor, special effects (not so special). As for the conclusion ... well, what's the bet that the veteran who warned them against going to the spooky mansion will first show up and save the day for the last two survivors (a boy and a girl , of course) with his mystical powers? Please .. life is too short for this kind of film. Donate the time you would have otherwise spent looking at this tripe to help the community, take a couple of shifts in a canteen or something. You will feel that you have actually done something productive with your life, and you will not have put money in the pockets of studios that produce irreducible garbage like this. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's already too late for me .. now, where did I put that copy of 'Pumpkinhead'? 1/10
