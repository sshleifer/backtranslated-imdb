Stripes, a military training comedy with Bill Murray and directed by Ivan Reitman, is one of my favorites. Meatballs, a summer camp with Bill Murray and directed by Ivan Reitman, is a complete waste of time. It takes a considerable effort for four writers to produce a film (the word "comedy" infers a work with miraculous omen) as witty, anemic and boring as this. <br /> <br /> Murray evidently reached the same conclusion during filming, but his usually reliable improvisational powers escape him and his failed attempts to inject life into proceedings only add embarrassment - the singing scene "It doesn't matter" is heartbreaking. It doesn't help that the supporting cast is lacking in talent - the funniest thing about them is their hair, but then Meatballs was created in 1979. ("And introducing Chris Makepeace as Rudy" announces the opening titles. ?!). <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Reitman rectified his mistake two years later for Stripes. Murray's shtick is a lot more fun when he's having fun with John Candy, Warren Oates and John Larroquette. Drop it and watch it.
