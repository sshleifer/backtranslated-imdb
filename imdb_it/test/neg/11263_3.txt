This is bad movie. There is no denying it as much as I would like. Tommy Lee Jones is the best possible with the script they gave him, and he had a couple of decent action sequences that really felt out of place because of their acceptable quality. <br /> <br /> Somewhere along the line someone realized that all the flaws in the script could be neutralized if they were to take on every single actor in the industry, unfortunately also really talented actors like Goodman, Beatty, Sarsgaard, Gammon, Steenburgen, MacDonald, Pruitt Taylor Vince and not to forget that Mr. Jones himself is unable to adjust the wooden dialogue, and the progression of the plot has gone absolutely nowhere. <br /> <br /> In fact at some point I looked up, sure that the movie was running the last 2 hours just to find out that I had 51 minutes. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most painful point of the film was the subplot of the ghostly Confederate soldiers who seem to be of little or no help to history. Other than a bit of a deduction from the business confused at the end with the image. * if you have not seen this film neglect this past statement that might seem tempting and know that it is not, you will not understand it better after seeing the film. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this film could be that it is actually a sequel to the movie "Heaven's Prisoners" starring Alec Baldwin in the same role as Tommy Lee Jones in this film. I might have to look at it now, before seeing if it's as bad as In the Electric Mist, and secondly because I can't seem to (no matter how hard you try) break my man's crush with Alec Baldwin.
