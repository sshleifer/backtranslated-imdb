There are so many things wrong with this movie that it's hard to pick just a few. Let's start with silly and annoying songs. Like "Ride Little Cowboy", which tended to accentuate Klinton Spilsbury's urban appearance. The stupid cowboy kiddie songs in the background during the movie have hurt every credibility or momentum that history has had. <br /> <br /> I had seen the media publicity before this film was released, and I saw Klinton Spilsbury interviewed on various television shows, and he had a very sweet, sweet and passionate voice. His body language was not exactly what people remembered who were the fans of Clayton Moore and the TV series Lone Ranger. Spilsbury didn't help things by acting like a diva and talking about trash about Clayton Moore after the producers got an injunction prohibiting Moore from appearing at conventions and other events like the original Lone Ranger. Clayton Moore was not even allowed to sign "Clayton Moore, The Lone Ranger". He could only sign as "The Masked Man". The incredible amount of negative publicity that this move gave the film was added only by Spilsbury's petulant attitude, which was very quick in telling reporters that Clayton Moore would soon be forgotten once the film was released! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, even after the film was a total flop, the company that owned The Lone Ranger refused to raise their injunction against Clayton Moore, and he was never allowed to sign anything except as "The Masked Man" "and could not wear his black mask in any public appearance. Between the personality of the Spilsbury diva and the negative publicity of the film, he certainly did not contribute to making a good impression on the public. Worse, a few weeks before the film was finally released, the news was leaked that Spilsbury's voice in the film had been nicknamed by James Keech because the producers thought Spilsbury didn't look very convincing as a cowboy, the ridicule and ridicule that this news brought to talk show and the comedies of that era put the last nail in the coffin. <br /> <br /> But then there was Merle Haggard telling his way through the film. rodutters hoped that the macho image of Haggard (one of the country music outlaws) would lend Spilsbury credibility as The Lone Ranger. Merle Haggard's narrative was just another annoyance that the public had to face. Sometimes Haggard rhymes with his narrative, and it sounds like a strange children's film. Combine the rhyming narrative with the songs of "Ride Little Cowboy" and every credibility that Spilsbury could muster was destroyed by Haggard and the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Tonto was played by Michael Horse and, as others have pointed out, The horse had much more personality than Spilsbury. In fact, perhaps due to Spilsbury's supposedly combative attitude during filming, it seems that Cavallo was given much more dialogue and viewing time than expected from Tonto. Tonto takes the lead and is often the leader instead of the Lone Ranger. I was expecting (or hoping) that Billy Jack would make a cameo as Tonto's brother (he would have made the film much better). The horse is not only more interesting than Spilsbury, but it says more and has better scenes. Perhaps it was a case of Horse stealing the show from Spilsbury. However, since the film was so miserable, Cavallo did not get many awards. Unlike Spilsbury, Horse has had a very productive career in the film industry. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the last downside to this film is the Powder Blue outfit from The Lone Ranger. The material chosen for Spilsbury was more dusty blue than what Clayton Moore normally wore to appearances. That choice of color for the outfit made Spilsbury appear more effeminate in his role. The comic version also showed The Lone Ranger a red shirt and black pants, and that alternative dress would help Spilsbury look more convincing as The Lone Ranger. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast mostly sent in their performances. They all look as if they were working on a television episode and no one seemed very convincing. Even the villain, Cavendish lost the advantage because of the people around him. Overall, I'm sorry for Spilsbury. Not only did he do a terrible job of acting, but it is obvious that production and advertising were horrible and effective at sabotaging any chance the poor boy had. Even if he were an excellent substitute for Clayton Moore, I doubt the film would have had a good result because of the other factors. As it is, this film is sadly funny.
