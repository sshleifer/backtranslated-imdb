I had never heard of Soap Girl but I saw a poster with a five-star review from Film Threat outside the theater, so I thought, how bad could it be? Well, I soon found out. My god, this movie was horrible. The most wooden acting I've ever seen outside of a porn movie. Absolutely dying dialogue. I can't understand how it was done and why someone agreed to be part of it. And I find it absolutely incomprehensible that this was actually shown in a theater and that the money is loaded to see it. How did it happen????? And most importantly, WHAT WAS THE THOUGHT OF THE FILM THINKING?!?!?!?!
