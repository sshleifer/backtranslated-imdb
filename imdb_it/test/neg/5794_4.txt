Even Disney is guilty of pack cow disease, after the roaring success of The Love Bug in 1968, the mouse house was cashed in by Herbie Rides Again, Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo and Herbie Goes Bananas. Neither of the two sequels has captured the charm and harmless charm of The Love Bug back in 68, in this we find the pilot Jim Douglas and his partner Wheely Applegate, who enter Herbie in the Monte Carlo Rally. Of course things outside of the race start to take precedence over priorities, get confused in a diamond robbery and Herbie falls in love with another car! The car acrobatics are obviously pleasant and easy to see, and it would be strange for me to really vent the poison on such a friendly piece of plush, it's just that the film doesn't go anywhere fast and personally I can now see it for the piece of work motivated that is. You can still see Herbie taking a bath, foiling the bad guys and of course dancing for the lady in his life, so something for everyone I think .................. 0.4 / 10.
