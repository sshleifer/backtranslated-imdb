This show was performed live throughout the country with a wide variety of casts. I first saw it in the Provincetown production the first summer in P-town (2001) - before, curiously, it was banned in that overwhelming gay location (the codes that led to its closure were later changed). I saw him later on off-Broadway, the longtime production in New York. Strangely, P-town's production was far better than New York's - fresher, nicer, livelier and more fun - but only in the 2001 screening; subsequent attempts to clone production ("Bare Naked Lads" in 2007) were decidedly third category. This filmed production features a production cast of Los Angelos, and is, as other comments have suggested, not the best. I would rate it somewhere between the 2001 P-town production of first quality and the P-town show of "Bare Naked Lads" of the third band last summer.
