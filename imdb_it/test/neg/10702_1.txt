All I felt while I was growing up was gender equality, and here we have a film that not only exemplifies the imbalance, but continues with a whole concept that sex is better. For as long as I was watching I was hoping for that redeeming quality to make the viewer feel like there was hope for the future, and it wasn't there. I admit I didn't finish the movie, I had to turn it off in the part where the old bitch told the genetic man Adam that she would be a whore and get, and I quote, "More tail than any man in the past." It is a bad review about me, but it is the responsibility of the writer and the crew to develop a story that will keep the viewer interested, and they have failed. This film betrays all the true qualities of the feminine nature of the mother figure and the need for balance. Instead it exemplifies what America was running for natzis lesbian would be like, and I'm not against lesbians. Thank you, Mr. Director! Someone please give me a quality that redeems ... wait until I have it! There is no sequel!
