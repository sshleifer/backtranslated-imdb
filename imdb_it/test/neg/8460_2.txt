If this was nominated for a screenplay award by WGA, a professional screenwriting association, then it's time to hang up the word processor. Writing, direction, production, at all levels, surprisingly inept, even for a TV movie. No clich√© is not exploited in this film with its mouth open. What were they thinking? Does anyone really believe that children are stupid enough to watch this?
