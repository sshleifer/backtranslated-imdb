Where should I start with this movie. All I know is it's a mess. Be the script, the story or the actors. First of all, this film is very disappointing to Salman Khan who gave us a fun Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge and Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega before that. The second Rani is getting really annoying, appearing in every stupid Kuch Kuch Hota Hai movie (glad that Saathiya stopped this nonsense). The story is stolen from The Wedding Singer, but it spoils the funny movie. The dialogues are missing. Could I have laughed here and there, but amused? NO!!! Salman Khan was tolerable in the films mentioned above, but here he is crazy. His character is poorly written. A minute is poor and the next minute you wonder how poor he is. Rani Mukherjee looks like a simple jain and was not making any effort. He fortunately redeemed his career with Saathiya because his career was going haywire at that time. Pooja Batra has put a little charm here with its appearance but it's still not enough. Jackie Shroff is wasted. The beauty and acting of Kashmira Shah escaped her because she chose such a horrible script. Raveena Tandon is beautiful, but offers little performance. Mohnish Behl gets the award for Worst (Supporting) Actor (they need Razzie's because there were terrible movies in India). He says stupid dialogues, dances terribly, seems strange and is not in its normal form. Just to say, there's more to the cast than they're terrible. If it were not for the extraordinary beauty of Raveena in Aa Meri Life Bana De, I would not give a point to the film. Otherwise Salman's dance was terrible. Pooja Batra was dancing like a wind in Savariya, otherwise I'd like the costumes redone and the rest of the cast (and their monkey dance) blown away by the wind. The good song on the album was O Priya O Priya which doesn't have a pretty good performance. The same goes for the decent title song halfway. Otherwise this film (and the rest of the songs) are a no-no for everyone.
