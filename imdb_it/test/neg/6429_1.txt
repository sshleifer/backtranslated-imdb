What can be said of a film so pathetic? <br /> <br /> - Bad acting! The main actress seems to know only a facial expression: fear mixed with weakness. Like a poor beaten dog ... The other actress (the one who plays evil) looks like the female double of Ozzy Osbourne, with a horrible red wig. The other actors are so pitiful that they are not even worth describing. <br /> <br /> - There is absolutely no plot. The story begins with possibilities but does not go anywhere: we know nothing of the meaning of "11:11", nor of who Rayden really is, except for the simple "she is bad" or "she is a daughter of the Apocalypse" ... which is not an explanation. We don't know why the parents were killed, what kind of danger is growing and why Sara was chosen. As the film progresses, we only watch pseudo-scary scenes with bad music. Moreover, the end says nothing: we see only two possibilities as if one of them was a bonus scene or the director's cut ... There is no plot, so no interpretation possible. <br /> <br /> - "11:11" is full of clich√©s! It's so obvious that I couldn't help laughing. For example: the deserted library or the bathroom scenes, the silhouettes of the ghosts who walk with a gust of wind, ... there is also the fashionable "little scary girl" as in "Dark Water" or "The Ring" . Of course, the main character is bullied at school and looks like a stereotypical Gothic girl (dark hair, red lips, skinny black clothes). Is it an obligation to make it credible? I don't think so. Sara's psychology is so underdeveloped and so typical that it doesn't make it credible, nor appealing. <br /> <br /> - Terrible direction: as I said, nothing original, everything has already been seen thousands of times and is used here without any real purpose. <br /> <br /> - There are some funny inconsistencies. For example, I don't know if "science ghost", "paranormal course" or anything else being taught in American universities ... In Europe it is not really the case: teachers talk about negative energies or use "non-material" sensors. .. ridiculous. Also: how can you watch a movie shot in the sixties with a Super-8 camera on a computer screen without spending hours of your time for a digitization (in the film they immediately watch it on the computer screen) And as you can, in this old movie , isolate a small detail, zoom in and see a perfectly identifiable face? I wonder if the director has ever tried to digitize an old analogue movie ... <br /> <br /> Finally, "11:11" deserves to be seen if you like to laugh at stupid movies, or maybe if you want to fall asleep on your sofa ... But it's an expensive way to fall asleep!
