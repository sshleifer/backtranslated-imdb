... but memorable because it includes an actor that I actually recognize! James Horan is, according to these film standards, Lawrence Olivier. He gave decent performances on things like Highlander and various Star Treks, so it's pretty funny, though slightly depressing, to watch him run down here. Ok, yes, there is a plot. The character of Horan and his wife are fighting, he has a relationship with a critic while he is trying to make his "masterpiece" movie, and their host decides to enjoy the wonders of stripping. But watching Horan is really the only enjoyment that can be found here.
