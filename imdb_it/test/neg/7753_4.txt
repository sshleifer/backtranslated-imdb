I bought the DVD to get Julia Ormond. Well, I took it in spades. He was adorable in romantic scenes; too bad Bill Paxton was flying the autopilot for the entire effort. I almost missed my lunch when he pulled out his big white fat behind his flight suit to say "engage" with Julia. <br /> <br /> I realized that Julia was very good in French while looking at her in "Sabrina" '. I looked at "Sabrina" with the French soundtrack to see if Julia nicknamed her dialog. They used someone else. In any case, Julia was chosen for this Dutch film on a native French speaker with enough English to communicate with the American flyer. Perhaps they wanted at least a household name for the British / American market. For my unfamiliar eye, Julia's features could pass for the Belgian. <br /> <br /> The whole film has a strange nature. It was a Dutch film about Belgium in the Second World War. I imagine that national pride would have required a theme of heroic Dutch resistance to the German invaders. The Belgians were far more passive during the occupation than the French or Norwegians were. The wildest fights of all came to the Balkans, where Tito's communist partisans agreed with the Germans. <br /> <br /> I noticed in another review that "dbdumonteil" believed that Julia Ormond was an American instead of the true British nationality. Perhaps Julia's acting skills were big enough to give the impression. <br /> <br /> After seeing this movie several times, I suddenly realized how off-season the film is. It is set on 16 January 1944 when the American plane crashes into the Belgian agricultural campaign. The trees seem to be mid-autumn with lots of leaves and the weather is warm. People walk in light clothes and the grass is still green. There is no smallest trace of snow or ice. This must have been the mildest winter in Belgium. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film was a disaster. Where to start? For anyone interested in the history of the Second World War, the film was considered a farce. The reconnaissance plane used was a huge bomber converted to 4 engines. Such aircraft existed, but would have required a massive escort of fighters to have any chance of survival. In reality, smaller and faster aircraft were readily available and would have been much better suited for this task. The film's vital code books would never have been transported on the plane. The crew did not need this information to complete its mission, while the compromise of this information would have been an enormous defeat of intelligence. Also in light of the premise of the film, the first articles to be removed from the plane would be the code books. They should have arrived in Berlin within 10 minutes of the arrival of the German troops at the scene of the accident. <br /> <br /> The Daussois house, where Major Brice took refuge, was a farm where nobody had less interest in agriculture. The food would have been very scarce in Belgium right now. The Germans would have required substantial amounts of locally produced food to support their forces. The family truck would have been dispossessed long before the arrival of the American bird. There would have been no fuel available to run it anyway. <br /> <br /> The twist in which Henri Daussois transforms the American out of jealousy is pathetic. He should have revealed everything he knew about the resistance to be able to live. He would have to act as a double agent to frustrate any effective opposition. The woman with the secret radio would never have survived the war. <br /> <br /> 'Major Brice' was captured in civilian clothes near the end of the film. This made him a spy under the laws of war and subject to execution without defense. He would not have surrendered meekly to face the unhindered interrogation by the Geneva Convention. Better to force them to kill him and spare his friends if possible. <br /> <br /> I haven't read the novel on which this film is based. If this film is a faithful adaptation, it shows an abnormal lack of development in the novel. Regardless of the novel, the writers could easily have produced a superior script that would not waste this opportunity to offer a much better film.
