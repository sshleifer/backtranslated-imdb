Some people like to tell you that Deep Space 9 is the best of all Star Trek shows, because it emphasizes the development and continuity of the characters, and presents a more complex background and ongoing storylines. In some ways this makes it more satisfying, but in many ways the show fails completely. <br /> <br /> The series begins as a soap opera on a space station, with two entire seasons of generic science fiction stories balanced with a trivial subplot on the characters. The characters are a nice group, and most of the actors are decent, but I think the writers have tried too hard to make them "normal". For "normal" they actually mean "ordinary and boring". <br /> <br /> At the end of the second season we are introduced to the Dominion, which wanders threateningly for a while before finally going to war with the coupons in the fifth season. This is the main "narrative arc" of the show, but occupies only a part of the entire series. We continue to have self-sufficient episodes, the heroes remain stuck on strange planets for forty-five minutes, and there is a huge variety of comedies with the greedy and extravagant Ferengi. A lot of episodes are simply boring, and some are unwatchable. <br /> <br /> The Dominions, the main villains of DS9, are determined to dominate the galaxy for the convenient reason that, well, they don't like anyone. The entire war is presented with a naive lack of moral complexity and imagination. Impressive pyrotechnic space battles appear with great frequency from the third season onwards, but these are performed in ridiculously simplistic ways, like two huge fleets of super-advanced ships that fly against each other and fire. DS9 writers (including the talented Ronald D. Moore, following the fame of "Battlestar Galactica") have enriched their monotonous show by starting a war, but in the end it is still a pedantic soap. <br /> <br /> DS9 remains a very frustrating experience. The continuous plot is too flat and obvious to be really compelling, and the characters never really develop in interesting ways. "Babylon 5" and "Battlestar Galactica" have both fulfilled the promise made by DS9 and have done everything much better. For Star Trek, follow the original and the next generation.
