The plot of the film seems to have been built from a disjointed dream. There is not enough realism to maintain the viewer's interest. The Vermont Farm scene was a failed opportunity to show the way farms were created and the families of the farms that were going to be interesting and fun. There was little or no research on the bootlegging whiskey trade of the period. The customs of the Canadians seemed something of the French revolution, absolutely incredible. The sound of the violin was good and of the period of time, but Chris's movements while he was supposed to play were incredible. The appearance of the owl was a mystery never explained and the train that disappeared into nothingness was too much. I could not understand how a living trout had frozen in the ice and why two men in the desert without food would release the trout, a good source of food.
