I saw this movie in the cinema. I attended classes at Chicago's Second City and, of course, the buzz of this movie was intense. It's a Woodward movie about one of Second City's native children. <br /> <br /> Everyone knew Johns story. Everyone knew how he died. Some knew that the tradition did not make it particularly friendly towards women in improvisation or comedy. <br /> <br /> But hey. man led his life and was intensely loved by the people who were in his world, and tradition also claims that he treated all his intimate friends with love and respect. <br /> <br /> This movie. Well. Forget the idea of ​​poor Michael Chilklis (who is a great actor) in a really incredibly ugly film, and really only relegated to making an imitation of man. <br /> <br /> Forget the idea that they could not get the rights to one of Belushi's works ... and all the SNL scenes were never portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> Get closer to the idea that half of the historical information in the film didn't even follow Bob Woodwards works. Saying "Ok ... we are about to joke with Belushi ... now let Woodward go too ..." They also decided to take the premise of It's a Wonderful Life and turn it into "Horrible Life on Crack". <br /> <br /> Is it a guardian angel or the devil? The flipper is the devil's auxiliary electronic device ... how many different endings can you attach to a movie? It's one of those movies after it's finished ... you look at the person you're with and in incredulous disbelief go "What the hell was that ?!" In some circles this film has become a cult classic. But for good reason. <br /> <br /> A good cult classic you sit on the screen and tease (or throw out a snappy screen) on the screen. A cult film is never good. And most people would never look at them in a serious context. <br /> <br /> If you want to see some late 80s classics at the fair? Wired rental. If you want to know about John Belushi ... you can get more information from the walls of Second City of Chicago than this movie.
