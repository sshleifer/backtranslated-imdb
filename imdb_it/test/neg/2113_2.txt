If I were British, I would be embarrassed by this portrait of incompetence. A special branch protection officer unable to defend himself from a sick, unarmed and untrained attacker? Does the Ministry of the Interior send a single "Scientific Advisor" to investigate a possible Level Four biological risk and that "Consultant" does not make sense to wear a mask and gloves? Totally unprotected London police officers working side-by-side with technicians in a complete biohazard suit? Does the "Counselor" and his bodyguard support the den of a sociopathic doctor who experiments on human subjects without any support? Puh-leeze! One wonders if the producers could not afford to hire technical consultants or if, for some arcane reason, they consciously decided to portray the principals as hopelessly incompetent. Even my wife, who had neither experience in medicine nor law enforcement, was rolling her eyes in disbelief. After the first episode, I was discouraged; now that I've seen two episodes, I give up.
