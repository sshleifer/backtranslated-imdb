An ugly Quentin Tarantino cares, at least I hope that's what they wanted because at least at that moment I could respect the director for admiring Tarantino. A scene in which a "singing" scene with Rose McGowan is by far well done and ingenious for this film and may have only been stumbled by this director by mistake. So in addition to his Quinton and Rose McGowan inspiration and his only good scene this movie sucked. Some of the most disgusting dialogues I've ever heard, I'm willing to bet on why McGowan doesn't talk much because of how disgusting his dialogue would have been. It tries to be funny, it never is, it tries to be dark and it is not, it tries to be elegant and it is only bland. Those who put money aside to make films like this, I hope they were all the directors, so none of the money was wasted. If it's not for McGowan, the whole cast is horrible and when McGowan is your best friend, I have to ask myself.
