The Texan revolution of 1835-1836, including the preceding and immediately subsequent periods, is represented in this mediocre 3-hour television film, whose only redeeming value is bringing light and paying homage to Stephen F. Austin, the so-called "Father of Texas" whose life story had long been obscured by that of the legendary Sam Houston. The rest of the film is simply the usual plot of "Santa Anna is a tyrant" and with a weak attempt to show the Mexican perspective with an imaginary Hispanic character that shows a stereotypical Latin machismo. Combined with short low-budget battle scenes, such as the Alamao and San Jacinto, this film is only recommended for real history buffs who are not from Mexico. To his credit, Mexican uniforms seem accurate and the romantic subplot (another love triangle) does not take up too much time on the screen. Overall, this film describes the violent secession movement of the Anglo-Saxon racial minority of Texas as a positive and fair revolution against Mexican tyranny as personified by General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, the so-called "Napoleon of the West".
