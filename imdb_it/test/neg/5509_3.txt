OK, nobody will confuse him with Citizen Kane but you have to love a movie where women are always topless. There are some battles and some kinds of vicious sex. On the other hand, I hope they didn't pay the boy who wrote the dialogue more than they should. Here is a first example. After one of the captive girls dies: <br /> <br /> "This is terrible, it reminds me of the day Zenobia died" "A relative?" "No, my favorite cow." I guess they saved a little money in the script and blown it on great special effects like that plastic crocodile. I will say that it took me three sessions to overcome this beautiful work of art, never a good sign. I guess that's what happens after a while when everything looks the same. I hope the people waiting to rent it don't get too impatient. Don't worry, folks, it's on the right track.
