Say what you want in the "Wizard of Gore" of cinema, Herschell Gordon Lewis, it must be admitted that from his first films (1963's "Blood Feast" and the crackerbarrel of 1964 "Two Thousand Maniacs") to his last (1972 "The Gore") "Gore Girls"), the man remained faithful to his muse happily inspiring the bodies of young men and women for the delight of the camera.In "Gore Gore", for example, someone mutilated the strippers dressed in suede and pasty at Club Tops & Bottoms, and the tedious detective Gentry is hired by a hot cube reporter to assist in the case.The film features remarkably annoying and repetitive background music, terrible lighting, abyssal acting, repulsive characters, problematic sound E, of course, some of Lewis's patented coarse scenes, so one of the strippers has her face pushed in hot oil, one has her head torn off, another has her face ironed and her cap cut ezzoli; and yet another has his ass rowed with a meat tenderizer until the entire back is covered with what looks like the Buitoni tomato sauce. (I could be wrong here, it may have been Ragu.) The film also throws a rather lame humor, although some lines are quite funny. For example, we learn that the real name of the Suzie Creampuff stripper was ... Ethel Creampuff! A bottle of acid says "Made in Poland" (I don't know why, but I thought it was funny). And some of the lines of the strip club owner Henny Youngman are, of course, fun. However, this is NOT the movie to show to Aunt Ethel or Sister Agatha. It is one of the most disgusting that you have ever seen, with only one sure moment of joy for the public - the title at the end of the film that reads "We announce with pride: this film is over"!
