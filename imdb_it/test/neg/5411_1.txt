To be honest, the film was so HORRIBLE that I loved it. Never in my life have I seen a TERRIBLE film. I was shocked. I mean, I don't even know what to say. <br /> <br /> The characters could not even hold their guns, a minute a man had an M16 and his friend had an MP5, then in the next scene they changed guns. (Don't ask, trust me I know my guns) And I'll never understand how they came from a place that looked like Vietnam, an Arizona highway, my backyard, and then a chemical plant in California, that's what I got from it. <br /> <br /> Why would you be afraid of a guy in a Halloween mask wearing a garbage bag for a cloak and shooting you with plastic arrows? How scary is it? I wanted to swallow the arsenic in the middle of the film. I love the way the "skeleton" decided to randomly go on a special day. But hey, whoever made this film should be shot in the knees and fed a mound of fire ants. <br /> <br /> Good morning.
