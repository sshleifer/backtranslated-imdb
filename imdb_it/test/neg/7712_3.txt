Isn't it weird how shitty movies always tend to be a little better when you start looking at them with an attitude like, "boy, this will suck harder than few things have ever sucked before"? Is it practically impossible for anyone to rent this movie with a high level ?? or even remotely - expectations, since "House of the Dead 2" is a sequel to something that is generally considered one of the worst disasters of its kind ever published. The abysmal reputation of the original actually turned out to be a great advantage for director Michael Hurst, as it was really easy to exceed the quality level of his predecessor. And exactly how embarrassing this must be for Uwe Boll, eh? Having to recognize that a straight-to-video sequel without star power or promotional campaigns is MUCH better than its pretentious interpretation of video games? In case anyone still doubts: NO, "House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim" is not at all a good horror movie but, YES: it is definitely better than the first and it is also worth hiring if you are looking for a so undemanding film splatter with a lot of bloody, lousy slaughter and stupid humor. There is no real connection to the events of the first film (another advantage) and this second part opens like a typical rancid sexual comedy set on a university campus. The male brotherhood club plans to attack a house of sisters, inhabited exclusively by blond coed with huge breasts, but the party is interrupted when a mad professor (Sid Haig!) Who drives his car for a girl and brings her back to his laboratory to turn her into a zombie. This is the beginning of an epidemic that is rapidly spreading and deadly but, don't worry, since the government is ready and sends their best scientists and soldiers on campus to look for survivors and bring back blood samples for an antidote. The hunt for zombies seems the most common thing in the world for this squadron, it has also named them Hyper Sapiens, but their constantly increasing quantity eventually puts the lives of the most hardened soldiers at risk. The director Hurst has fortunately found his inspiration in the most eminent classics of the genre, like "Aliens" by James Cameron and ?? of course - the trilogy of George A. Romero, in particular "Day of the Dead". Fortunately he did not make the same mistakes as Uwe Boll, who inserted the video game of his real video (why?!?) Into his movie. It is * slightly * exaggerated with the use of CGI techniques. HotD 2 contains heavy images of violence, such as dismembered female corpses and detailed amputations, but it never becomes really sickening or shocking. Obviously, there is not even the slightest suspicion to enjoy and even here the terrible horror clich√©s. The film is very funny until screenwriter Mark Altman tries to explain the origins of zombie epidemics. Corpses are falling with their brains dangling out of their skulls, so we don't really need to know what caused their death. Especially not when the explanations are given by a blonde student bitch who clearly has no idea what all the medical terms mean. Just avoid being bitten, sweet.
