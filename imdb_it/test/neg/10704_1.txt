I don't think this can legally qualify as a "movie". The plot was so inconsistent, the dialogue so superficial and the jokes so terrible that I couldn't believe that someone had actually written the lines down, he said: "Holy sh! T! This is a masterpiece" and then actually threw it to a producer. I, for example, am still amazed and will always remember this film as a sign of the degeneration of intelligence in America - that, and "Crossroads", of course.
