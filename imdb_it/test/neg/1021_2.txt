Southern Cross, written and directed by James Becket, is a waste of good celluloid and actor efforts. A formulated film is not necessarily negative if it pays for its promise, which this film does not do. It is an annoying concoction of cinematic clich√©s that can be traced back to thousands of different films of the past. It is full of random and empty twists that add nothing but aimless actions, like a journey of the protagonists in a ghost town where the villains (inexplicably) follow them. This was obviously devised as an excuse for a shootout and an escape scene on the border with the absurd, with people coming and going through the doors and passing in front of the windows while shooting guns at each other. It is believed that someone told Becket that there was a ghost town at the foot of Chile and said, "Oh, well, let's take a scene out." <br /> <br /> Don't waste your rent money on this either. It's a bunch of random fragments of hundreds of different movies put together to call an action drama.
