This film is about a woman who falls in love with a friend of her boyfriend. From that moment on, he has to share his time for the two boyfriends: Jack during the day and Joseph during the night. <br /> <br /> This film looks like it was made with a minimal budget. Most of the film is set in an apartment with minimalist decor. There are only three main actors, all the other actors listed in the credits only make momentary appearances. The wardrobe does not seem to have much to do, as the actors wear very down-to-earth clothes, and in reality most of the time they are still naked. <br /> <br /> The film is very conversational, it should have compensated for the shortcomings described above. However, the dialogues seem too complex and uncomfortable. At the beginning of the film, most of the dialogue is a person who utters a very long sentence, and then the person says "Me too". After the frenzy of agreement, the dialogue descends into a mess of salads and confused salads. <br /> <br /> The only merit of this film that I can think of is that it acts as a feminist outlet that conveys that it is not only men who can be unfaithful. <br /> <br /> This film is a big disappointment.
