My friend and I rented this movie and in the first 5 minutes we had no idea what was going on. It seemed like it should have been finished within the first 15 minutes. It was a terrible film, my little brother could have been a better actor than some of the film, and the plot (if one can say so) was full of holes. I would never recommend this movie to my worst enemy, yet to anyone I really like.
