This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. The acting was really bad. Anthonie Kamerling is usually a pretty good actor, but in this film she seemed to be reading her text from a piece of paper. Above all his voice was extremely wooden. Beau van Erven Dorens was completely over the top as a frat boy Fraser, although this probably had more to do with the disgusting dialogue. 'Ik ook van jou' is an adaptation of a book, and it seems that the creators of the film have forgotten that the dialogue on the film follows different rules than the literary dialogue. It all seemed like a way to book. <br /> <br /> Some of the situations were very badly viewed. Example: somewhere at the beginning of the film there is a scene where a canoe ends up in a rapid. This bit is too incredible to be true. You see a piece of river, obviously quite shallow, with many rocks just below the surface (hence the rapid). We hear suspenseful music to warn us that there is a danger coming. A canoe with girls goes further in that rather superficial rapid. Our hero then dives several feet below the surface to save one of the girls. The girl faints in his arms and says the words "You saved me ..." Vomiting! <br /> <br /> Actually it was so ugly, that it became fun. This is sad, because it was not intended. At the interval I heard someone behind me say "O god, there's another part!" My feelings exactly. What scares me is that the credits of "Ik ook van jou" were in English. Does that mean he will be released abroad? Just when the Netherlands was starting to get a good reputation after films like "Antonia" (Antonia line) and "Karakter" (Character) ...
