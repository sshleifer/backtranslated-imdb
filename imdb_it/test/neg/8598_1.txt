The most famous comedy I've ever seen <br /> <br /> It's not a patch on the naturalism of the eccentric Twin Town challenge <br /> <br /> Vegas I, as usual, but this script is so terrible English can be predicted so well in the worst way (English films have been terrible all over the last few years) Ireland has at least produced the commitments, Scotland with Braveheart and Trainspotting 2 have been great films and Wales has had Twin Town, Zulu, Dolwyn's Last Days, Torchwood, Doctor Who and Under Milk Wood etc. <br /> <br /> The comedy is painted by numbers, the actors are walking dead because there is no characterization and originality and it is so unpleasant <br /> <England is late, regardless of how many sad north films produce. It is the old class system that destroys English films. Oxbridge graduates spread endless screenplays on characters from the working class they never lived with. It's pathetic. Monty Python was not fun, nor was anything from Oxbridge. <br /> <br /> Let guys like Jonny Vegas and Peter Kay, Rob Brydon, Billy Connolly write their dialogues and forget about the archaic system of failed class people and the real talent that comes through the system do they appropriately appropriate writing, and will the British and British film industries once again resurrect what the future Prince Edward would have written a modern day Oliver Twist?
