I couldn't wait to see this film that I really can't understand how I got the impression that I would have liked it. I'm afraid it's really a yawn party - every single patron in the cinema that I attended yawned and fidgeted often during the entire movie. This is a shame because it is a fantastic story - I am inclined to think it would be a better read. It is not helped by the main character that only shows his teeth once - and this was the result of the camera angle. As the story unfolds, it becomes easier to understand the dilemmas of the main character. However, the suspense and drama that could have made this film truly exceptional have been completely ruined by the boring treatment. Boring as a semi-cooked documentary!
