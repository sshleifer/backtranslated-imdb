I didn't care much to see Step Up, but my friend kept bothering me and bothering me in seeing this movie, especially since she's so in love with Channing Tatum, I constantly tease her that it's the only reason she loved the movie. But she somehow convinced me that it was a movie worth seeing, that if I loved movies like Dirty Dancing, Take the Lead and Save the Last Dance, I should love Step Up, eh, what the hell? I imagine that every film has a certain right to a vision. <br /> <br /> Well, do you know those movies I just mentioned? Dirty Dancing, Take the Lead and Save the Last Dance? Well, put them in a blender with some gangsta love and that's what you have. Not to mention the fact that you've seen those movies, well, frankly, you've seen Step Up. Because Channing is lower class with street intelligence who simply hears music while that classy snobbish girl has to follow step by step, how will they ever fall in love if they are so different? After all, this is their chance to "intensify" the passion, the mystery and the concupiscence of dance! <br /> <br /> OK, this was a stupid explanation of the plot, but as I said, as long as you've seen those movies I mentioned, or even if you've just seen the plot, get the movie. I don't understand how he actually has a 5.5 rating, I bet they are Channing lovers! LOL! I'm kidding with you guys, but it's okay, I guess I didn't get what the others did with passion, the mystery that is dancing! Oh, Antonio Bandares, where are you when we need you ?! <br /> <br /> 4/10
