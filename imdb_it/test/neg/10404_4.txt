This badly sweet and painstakingly traced 5-reeler is certainly not among Harold Lloyd's best films. The gags are meager and mostly banal. Saccharin melodrama is abundant. The installation lasts forever, like Lloyd, the unconventional, but incredibly kind, country doctor makes his rounds, bringing some sunshine into the lives of children, the elderly and puppies. It's like a 1922 version of Patch Adams. Ugh. 4/10.
