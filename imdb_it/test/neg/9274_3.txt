The film has a good plot, the action is good in some parts, but not all. Some parts, I felt as if the bad guys had not yet settled, from my experience in taking Martial Arts. Some are long actions, as always mostly for the boss, but for less important ones, they were killed or dosed with a few shots, but some where they were not realistic or could have done a better job at. <br /> <br /> The less important actors or stuntmen were the right choice for the film, my girlfriend started having a crush on them that started watching the movie more than she spends her time with me . <br /> <br /> The film is good, that's all I can say.
