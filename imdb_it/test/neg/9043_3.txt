I recently saw a copy of this (under the title "Eaten Alive"). Talk about terrible! Any movie that Ed Wood has ever released seems like an Oscar material compared to this laughable tosh. To be honest, a couple of lines from the script will live long in the memory like "These people (Cannibals) don't buy frozen meat from a supermarket like us, they take it every day from people like you or me" Classic! The crazy "Jonesville" type leader in the jungle was the best character in the movie, he looked really crazy. I think he was the only actor not to be nicknamed (bad), if these Italians had to have American characters in their films, because they can't convince Americans to dub in dialogue instead of the British doing their best to play like Annie Oakley. I'll give this 3 out of 10, I'll give it three because it's really more fun than most comedies these days.
