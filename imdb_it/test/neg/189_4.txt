In 1904 Tangier, a wealthy American woman and her two children are kidnapped by the Berbers, pirate desert murderers who despise the Moroccan government and, in doing so, kidnap "the American pestilence" that attracts the attention of US President Theodore Roosevelt . The historic fictional epic is a less grandiose adventure than it is a particular, somewhat exhaustive one, returning to the 1940s desert sheikh film (with the addition of a bit of "The King and I") . Portraying the cloaked, mustachioed and bloodthirsty chief and his contemptible and disdainful prisoner, Sean Connery and Candice Bergen could act in two completely different films (no one seems to know how far the elements of the field of their characters and dialogues can lead, and both seem singularly without a right direction). The various (and anonymous) cracks and beheadings that occur are arbitrary: we do not know any of these victims, and the great action scenes become blurred and noisy montages of sand-swept violence on horseback. The pluses: a soundtrack much appreciated by Jerry Goldsmith (nominated for an Oscar, but a defeat for "Jaws" by John Williams), beautiful location and film shootings. * 1/2 from ****
