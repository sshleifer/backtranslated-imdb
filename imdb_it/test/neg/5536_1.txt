So this ugly boy with long and bad hair and his girlfriend end up in this house and argue and discuss his old girlfriend. There must have been something scary but I didn't see anything scary. There is some mention of a sea demon, but this is not going anywhere at all. I wish I had done it because then he would have removed the tension from the jealous love triangle. The film's title makes it look like a scary and exciting movie, but it's so far away that I can't believe it. I waited and waited for it to end and I was so happy when he did. It was not up to the title as it should be so boo hoo hoo. The cover had a nice image but I shouldn't judge a cheese film from the cover.
