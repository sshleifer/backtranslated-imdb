I saw this movie last night. <br /> <br /> And I'm worried that he's turning me into one of those leftist liberals who rightly make fun of South Park. Because I found it extremely offensive. Am I ridiculously sensitive? First, there is the old staple that is America the only country in the world that is physically capable of anything, ever. <br /> <br /> Secondly, and chilling, there is the first meteorite that hits someone (unnamed ?? because they need a name?) Asian country. The reaction to this is to look at it as a warning. As in "my god, imagine the tragedy that * could * happen". Because, you know, it happened to Asians. It could happen to American whites, and * this * would be tragic. <br /> <br /> Then, later, a larger meteorite hits Paris. Our cast on the ground is irritated, because this could mean that our kids have less time than they thought. Not very angry in America. Not many people are said to have died. <br /> <br /> Then there's Michael Clarke Duncan. A wonderful, wasted actor. Never has a black man been so symbolic. Among a team of hardcore drills, his work seems to consist of a position in the back, sometimes saying "Hey, you man". Really. Why did they even bring it? It's not like she's petite - she weighed that shuttle down for nothing! It never lifts an instrument, directs a spaceship or helps repair something that explodes. <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore the Russian cosmonaut (Peter Stormare, another great actor wasted in a useless role), who seems drunk most of the time and hits things with keys instead of fixing them because "Dat it's like we do denting in Russia ", it's pretty horrible. <br /> <br /> All naturally cemented by the site of blond, blue-eyed American children who celebrated in the cornfields when they were saved and all was well. Because all deaths and destruction in the rest of the world are irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Do you expect the evil script, dubious acting, implausible plot (fat, middle-aged men who are trained in 12 days to become astronauts? Including one that seems to be retarded?). But I could not believe the racism and xenophobia implicit in the film, and the constant disregard for the lives of anyone who was not fed with American corn. <br /> <br /> It is a chilling accusation about the attitude of a Western section Society in the world. <br /> <br /> And it's also a lousy movie.
