This is the kind of movie that BEGS has to be shown on TV at 3 or 4 in the morning, if at all. <br /> <br /> No doubt the directors responsible for "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman" thought they were making a pertinent statement about women and clanism and the dangers of demon rum, all wrapped up in a science fiction allegory . <br /> <br /> Or maybe it was an abandonment of taxes. <br /> <br /> In both cases, "Attack" turns out to be better for the viewer in the following circumstances: a) extreme drunkenness, b) seen on a double bill with some of those Jacqueline Suzanne movies (maybe "Once is Not Enough "?) or c) only one night when you feel insecure and the world around you is a bit too perfect. Pop in "Attack" and you will feel great, guaranteed! <br /> <br /> It's good for a laugh at the expense of the hockey script, the special rubbery FX and the four-eyed sheriff. And I think the last line should be engraved in a monument somewhere in Washington D.C. - it's just so memorable. <br /> <br /> Four stars for "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"; buy a copy, send it to Gloria Steinem - she will love you for it.
