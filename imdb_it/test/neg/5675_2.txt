It makes me understand how people can describe this adolescent exercise as a film noir. It is true that there is a gun, a bottle and a lady and lead is a private eye, but this is not what makes gender, people. This sounds like a series of TV shows heated on TV - a lot of bloody and terrible continuity - with a hint of Chinatown memories thrown in. Difficult to look beyond the first 10 minutes. Want a contemporary twist, look at anything by John Dahl.
