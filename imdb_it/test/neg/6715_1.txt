Sigh ... what can I say? <br /> <br /> Because a horrible script like this is approved in the first place. It is not wrong to have a complicated plot, but it has not been correctly explained to the public! <br /> <br /> Having his wife explain the plot through flashbacks is bad. Even having such a tight assembly for the fight scenes is bad! Such an imaginative montage appears only in trailers. Reduce the whole look! <br /> <br /> And who are the Russians at the top of the film? Who is the guy who gets tortured? Is it with the CIA? <br /> <br /> This film deserved not to be released at the theater. But it doesn't deserve to be produced in the first place. It's a joke for Hollywood.
