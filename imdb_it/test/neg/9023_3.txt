While most of Wayne B's efforts are fun in a fun way, this film has been modified and written so superficially, it's a real disaster. Only the first ten minutes show Wayne and bandits in the night scenes that alternate with repertoire material, obviously filmed during the day. Dwire plays a half-white bandit, half Apache with a strong Mexican accent and doesn't seem to be able to tear out the nationality! I give this a 3.
