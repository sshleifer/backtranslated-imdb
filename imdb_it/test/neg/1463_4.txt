It opens - and for half an hour, runs - like an educational program on the Old Testament, although not without humor. The film finally begins to grow wings when the biblical chant is dropped. In a scene of mixed successes, Martin Donovan (Jesus) decides to give up the Apocalypse and the last quarter of an hour is a sort of humanist "what is all this for?" play-out, gilded with optimistic conjectures against a (retrospectively, miserably ironic) revival of the twin towers of the WTC. <br /> <br /> In addition to the authority of Donovan, the acting is divided. There is the theatrical melodrama of the rest of the cast: this, although formally conceived for the biblical presentation, is appropriate for the modern paranoid comedy to which Hartley points. But I was also pleasantly surprised by the contribution of PJ Harvey (credited in this way, and in danger of existing within the film exclusively as a pop star entity that he is, not least in a scene in a record store and a dangerous column sound for which contributes). It remained strong - a sort of disinterested lack of attention - in the manner of many pop icons that took the film (I'm thinking of the Jagger of Performance here), but still maintained a convincing integration with the cast and the project. <Br /> <br /> Ultimately affirmative, but this bittersweet essay is a bit too much like one and is based more on perseverance than on the imagination of its audience. 4/10
