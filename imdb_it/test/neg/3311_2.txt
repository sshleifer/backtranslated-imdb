The only reason why anyone remembers this smoking load of fecal matter is because it was marked by Pink Floyd. (Or as they were known then, "The Pink Floyd".) Stefan, a really annoying Eurotrash hitchhiker, connects to the American model Estelle and they proceed to stand tall and naked throughout the film ... <br /> <br /> And the point of this is, what exactly? Which drugs are bad? Or just heroin (horse) is it? The problem becomes that there is no crap on the characters, and besides, even Pink Floyd were not up to their best work. When Steffan overdosed at the end, you're almost glad to get rid of him because he was so annoying.
