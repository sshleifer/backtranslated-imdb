I don't know how this DVD came into my collection - my wife suggested it was one of these "3 for £ 20" in a high street store. The thing is not worth 66p, let alone £ 6.66! Having invested heavily in it, I felt obliged to look at it until the end, just to make sure it was equally bad to the end - and it was. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was horrible, the story line was impenetrable (I still don't understand what the hell was going on, despite having read the synopsis), the work with the camera was disjointed and hopeless, the acting was in wood (not helped by dialogue). <br /> <br /> In fact there were no safety features - no, not even the beautiful Sandra Bullock, on whose glittering subsequent career this slag pile was probably sold. He should convince his agent to buy all the rights and then bury it as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> As an amusing example and ineptitude of the director, there was a scene in which the young protagonist was conversing with his ex-accompanying father while driving. This was the clearest point of dialogue in the film - no engine noise whatsoever! I look forward to the engine damping technology finally crossing the pond in British cars!
