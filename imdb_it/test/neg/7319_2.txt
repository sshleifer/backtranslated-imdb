Roomies is the story of a boy who loses everything but his incredible girlfriend and an idea for a corn dog that he plans to patent and sell. Immediately his uncle dies and leaves him a house and a car, and receives some roommates to help pay the rent and get a job. Then his girlfriend gets drunk and betrays him, so he goes and writes a book on roommates and becomes famous. <br /> <br /> 88 minutes. None of these plot details are explored in any detail, what you read above is more or less interesting than the film. When her uncle dies there are breasts on the screen, one of the potential roommates I interview is pretty funny for about 40 seconds. The finish is literally the worst I've ever seen. I want the other 87 minutes of my life! <br /> <br /> I didn't think anyone could make a film with so little merit: Surely there are rules against this kind of thing that reach the public? The script cannot be longer than twenty pages, and the budget must have been miniscule because the entire film has about 3 locations and a car. The only plausible use for the Roomies, in my opinion, is if you hold someone hostage and want to frustrate them beyond human thought. If so, have it repeated and you will have a wreck full of butterflies within the day. <br /> <br /> one-and-a-half on 10
