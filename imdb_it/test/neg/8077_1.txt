This is the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot is a joke, the effects are terrible, the cinematography doesn't adapt to the tone of the film, the dialogue is poor, and the actors do a good job ruining the rest. People simply do not act this way in real life situations. My question is: who financed these crap? <br /> <br /> The film begins where some miners fall into a mining well after a fireman fails to rescue them. Then we join some cyclists in a forest that run doing tricks on their bikes. A boy falls and breaks a leg or something. The fireman arrives to help them. Meanwhile, someone lights a fire. More bicycle stunts. Bla bla bla. <br /> <br /> I lost time. <br /> <br /> I don't watch this movie.
