This film is number 1 on the list of the worst movies I've ever seen, with "Lessons for an Assassin" in second place. <br /> <br /> The acting is very bad (I'm sorry, Sandra Bullock, but your performance was horrible!), the soundtrack could have come from a bad x-rated movie and the story was definitely ridiculous. He had this in common with a typical action film: the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of words of a syllable. But unlike the average action movie, there was no real action in this. Boring. <br /> <br /> The only reason I kept looking at it was in the hope that at some point, there would be at least one interesting scene in this movie ... <br /> <br /> Thumbs down on this
