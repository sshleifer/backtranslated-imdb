Ru Paul plays a secret agent called Starrbooty. He joins with another drag queen agent to fight the evil Annaka Manners (Candis Cayne) and get her kidnapped granddaughter back ... or something. Seriously ... I had difficulty concentrating on the plot! The film is apparently directed by someone with a serious problem of ADD - rapid camera cuts ceaselessly making it impossible to concentrate on anything. Sometimes the dialogue is incomprehensible and when you can hear it you want it to remain incomprehensible! Actually, acting is pretty good, except for Ru Paul, who behaves awkwardly. Even the film is full of disgusting bathroom humor that is just revolting and not nearly as funny. After 30 minutes I had to leave because I was bored, sick and couldn't take it anymore. I'm proud to be sitting through everything, but this has gone far beyond my limits! People are comparing this with the early works of John Waters. I do not agree. Waters' work is sick but good - this is just sick. To avoid.
