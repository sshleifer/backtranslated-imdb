I do not understand! The authors of the "Horror Star" series are all devoted fans of horror, but when their favorite idol (Conrad Radzoff) dies, they dig his corpse and do all sorts of disrespectful things with him, like dancing around the house and throw the leftover food at this. Doesn't it look like something real horror fans would do now? I'm a huge fan of horror and immensely idolizes abandoned icons like Vincent Price, Peter Cushing and Boris Karloff, but it would never occur to me to ridicule their memory. No wonder Conrad returns from the dead ?? certainly, after a seance ?? to dry them all from the face of the earth! Mr. Radzoff was not already known for his friendliness in life, since he occasionally killed the directors who disagreed with his visions, and even after his death he suffers from a huge ego. Even inside his grave there are video messages to petrify possible visitors and the group of teenagers will live a vivid experience that also likes the activity of murder outside of his movie sets. "Horror Star" (a.k.a. "Frightmare" and "Body Snatchers") is a rather unpleasant horror film from the 1980s, but there are a handful of cheese and enjoyment highlights. The film suffers mainly from its stupid plot, since nobody? not even a film school student ?? he is stupid enough to steal a recently buried corpse and actually thinks he will leave, and there are too many boring moments to deal with. Conrad's video speeches from beyond the grave are overly talkative and certainly undermine the tension, but on the other hand his killing methods are pleasantly imaginative. One teenager enjoys the experience of being cremated alive and another (Jeffrey Combs in one of his first roles!) Loses his head in a delightful beheading sequence. In the most absolute sequence, the head of a poor girl is crushed by a coffin. Writer / director Norman Thaddeus Vane wanted to pay tribute to vintage horror movies and of course how to make the film look sinister. The locations and scenarios are fantastic, but Vane lacks the necessary funds to provide his film with adequate continuity and editing work. The performances are generally acceptable, with Ferdy Mayne (who imitates Christopher Lee) and Jeffrey Combs who play the most memorable roles. "Horror Star" can hardly be called a must-see or even a good movie, but it's worth tracking it down if you're an enthusiastic B-horror fan.
