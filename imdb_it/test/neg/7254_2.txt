Did watching this movie make me wonder, just because Universal produced films like this? They had a wonderful series of movies with all the classic horror movies. The dawn of the atomic age caused an assault of films of giant creatures. Spiders, ants, praying mantis'. With The Deadly Mantis, we have a giant praying mantis that flies around the Arctic, scaring the Eskimos and being haunted by the armed forces. The insect reaches a tunnel in New York where soldiers eventually destroy it. Of course, this is made much more watchable by looking at MST. Who thought it was a good idea to start the film by showing a giant map?
