The costumes are outrageous and the Australian outback scenario is fun to watch, but there is an advantage in this story - an average advantage - about drag queens. I noticed in particular that in the character of the Terrence Stamp, "Ralph Bernadette Bassenger". Perhaps it was appropriate since there is nothing "good boy" about Ralph-Bernadette and his group of "queens". <br /> <br /> Once again, we have the strong liberal inclination that says that everything goes and if you are not "with it" - or in this case, homosexual, then you are a homophobe. (Gasp!) <br /> <br /> The really scary thing is the end when a guy leaves with his "alternative-lifestyle" father and embraces his gay lifestyle, not because he adapts to the story, but because it fits the agenda of the people who wrote the script. Pitiful.
