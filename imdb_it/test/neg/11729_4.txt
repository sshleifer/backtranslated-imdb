Plot Dodgy, a badly recommended script, almost all doubtful in fact. The most convincing performance is that of Joanna Pacula in the role of Lauren, but even this does not save this useless and obnoxious film. The implicit invitation of the director to the spectators is not simply to suspend disbelief but to suspend the judgment. <br /> <br /> Presumably it is meant to be wet and threatening, but although the film has its erotic moments, they are few and far between. This kind of thing has been done better by many others. Don't go out of your way to see it.
