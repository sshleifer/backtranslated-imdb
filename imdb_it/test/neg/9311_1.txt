I feel more stupid after watching the first 20 minutes, fortunately I came out and saved the rest of my brain, people should watch better movies and take notes on why they are highly valued, not because of the film's budget or special effects, just simply good acting and simple and right things, and above all MOst - not to be LAME--, but I imagine it was produced for those Sheeple without taste and is not a clue of what "Good movie" is afraid of low-level movies, save your unpopular high scores for "once in a lifetime movies". Keep in mind that many people use IMDb for trusted reviews and opinions, don't spoil the broth with sugared sugar Peace & love
