I've always liked Bill Murray in films like Lost in Translation, and the trailer for this movie looked really good, but the result was very disappointing. Basically, Murray plays Jack Corcorin who recently discovered that his father is dead and expects him to listen to his will. He discovers that his father was a clown, because he left a big shoe, his squeaky nose and his main legacy, an elephant! The only way Jack can get rid of this elephant is to travel 4000 miles in four days and give him a safe zoo for $ 30,000. Also played by Pat Hingle as Vernon. There are small little moments of humor, like the front of a truck leaning forward, and Murray screaming, but overall, it's useless. Poor enough!
