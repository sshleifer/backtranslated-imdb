Clearly this would have had potential in more capable hands, but given Uwe Boll's track record it would have been surprising if there was any merit in this farce. <br /> <br /> The first 5 minutes are the madness of the classic monster movie - even the horrible one-liners delivered by GI Joe soldiers feel like they are taken away by another adventure in the same genre. <br /> <br /> You'll do yourself a favor if you leave the movie at this point. You have already passed all the highlights and you will have spared yourself the suffering of attending some of the worst recitations in recent history. <br /> <br /> So, enter the absolute talent of the garbage. The protagonist man has the same amount of charisma that you will find in a garden snail. <br /> <br /> There is a bit of artificial romance launched - this is so wrong you can only imagine why this scene was first evoked. Normally the genre uses interludes of romance and nudity to inject a bit of humanity and sympathy into characters cut out of cardboard otherwise - here it turns against all the cylinders. <br /> <br /> The effects are bad and the action incredibly boring. Where other classics show originality and imagination in the face of budget restrictions - it seems that everything has been spent on catering. <br /> <br /> There are indeed no saving features here - not even the "it's so bad is almost good" applies. It's just ugly, and in a bad way. <br /> <br /> Our hero questions the main star about the night spent together and how he would evaluate it. She gives him 2 out of 10. I give a whole report 1 (I would have gone for 0 if it were possible). <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this dribbling, there's a lot of shit cinema out there, which overcomes this ridiculous grumble in the jungle. <br /> <br /> Oh, and finally, the movie has little or nothing to do with the popular game Far Cry (at most it's extremely based on it). <br /> <br /> Horrible, move!
