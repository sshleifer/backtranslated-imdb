before seeing this film, the 1998 version was my only experience of this Dickens story. I didn't really like that movie, but this 1974 adaptation moves particularly annoyingly. <br /> <br /> Actors don't shine, the main couple Michael York and Sarah Miles are mostly wooden cases. the only character of real interest to me was the intelligent jaggers of anthony quayle. <br /> <br /> the so-called plot is ridiculous, but the story itself is fantastic. it's a real lesson on how your distorted values ​​and obsessive principles can destroy you. live with an open mind and do not care what others say, you are what you are, if others cannot accept it, **** 'em. this was said to Pip early, but he did not listen. <br /> <br /> the girl adopted by the strange old lady reminded me a little of the old hauser kaspar story, not in that same horrible level, but in the way she shaped the child to create the performer of his personal revenge against the entire opposite sex he thought he had deceived her. Pip's childhood didn't seem much better. the ending did not seem to fit the rest of the style of the story. the sets seemed cheap and arriving at imdb I'm not surprised to see that this was really a TV movie (of which I had no idea when I borrowed it from the library). <br /> <br /> live and learn. so many beautiful films, so little time. that's why the reviews are here. so you shouldn't waste your time on this type of film. <br /> <br /> 3/10
