First of all they are in the mid-40s. I've been watching horror movies since I was a kid, so I saw a lot of variety. IMO, it's not as bad as the multitudes that gave this 1 or 2. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a low budget horror movie. Dialogue is soso and sometimes tolerable. The basis of this film is actually pretty good. For those of you old enough to remember or lucky enough to have seen them on DVD. This is very similar to a movie from the 1970s. Just add blood and minor blood, minor T&A and swear words, without big names. It's like that for a T. I'd rather see it than Jason vs. Godzilla or whatever shit of the continuois is out there. Although not good, EVIL DEAD was a low-budget film. At least give these guys credit for trying. With an adequate MIL budget this could have been a nice coup. My score is watchable 4.
