I'd rather someone cut my eyes with a razor blade than watch this movie again. I watched it from beginning to end thinking it couldn't get worse .... BUT He's dead. Writers and producers should be slapped for putting this kind of shit on television. The actors are ALL terrible. Get out of Hollywood and you're crazy and go to work at McDonalds to sweep the floors and empty the garbage. Anyone who thinks this film is also remotely should be hung. I am an embarrassment to humanity. To think that we have soldiers who put their lives in danger for anyone who produces this type of garbage. It makes me embarrassed to say I'm an American.
