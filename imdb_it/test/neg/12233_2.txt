You might think that since this movie has a bad reputation that I would have exaggerated when I say that I hated this movie. But I'm serious this film was so stupid and so funny, and such a waste of time. I mean after the first 30, I had a severe headache and the smile on my face (which was preparing for the most part to laugh) was fading. When this film was finished I was so happy and because I had good expectations that it would be fun I was extremely disappointed. The acting is not exceptional, the moments of comedy are lame and not amusing. Very good all that is good, because I laughed like 2 parts. All this is so boring and I can't tell you how horrible this is, I think this could be used as a suicidal technique. I mean, I don't think it's even watchable for some. So my last words about this are, AVOID ALL COSTS.
