Well, I had seen a lot of reviews on this, and a lot of promos that always showed the beheading scene. But this film is difficult. And I mean it in every way. It is difficult to find a copy because it was a low budget independent version and since MPAA was looking for every copy on VHS, it came out without rating but had to be evaluated for MPAA. So the copies disappeared in the underground scene. All the people involved in this film have never done anything else in the biz. So he made this film unique. VHS copies almost never appear on eBay or other sites and if they do you will pay more than $ 100 to get one. But due to US connections, I was able to get a DVD version sold worldwide. Limited but had to be some sort of officer. Sometimes there are still some projections of this splatterfest. But is it worth all the clamor that surrounds it? As mentioned above, it is difficult to grasp but also to sit. There are bloody killings, there is necrophilia, there is nudity but there is also much talk in the branches. And to be honest, if you'd like to see the movie in 5 minutes, watch the finale, it's a flashback to the murderer's mind. Blood flows and in fact is a splatterfest but not the entire 80 minutes, splatter galore for 10 minutes. The quality of the film is ok, the sound is fine, no hissing, the colors are fine, black is black and not blue like in many low budgets. It's okay to watch it but you'll never be scared but it's one to watch with your friends who drink a beer and a pizza I believe. 555, naaaaaaaaaaaaaaah 333.
