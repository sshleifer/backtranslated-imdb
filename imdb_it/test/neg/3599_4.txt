Ewww! A Disney sequel that is rubbish! Who would have thought that? In reality, very judging from the comments here, and they are not wrong. Actually, I couldn't wait to see this terrible movie based on my taste for the original. And here is all the "cash" mentality of Disney. Shovel any old garbage on the back of a hit and people will go and get it. Don't you think they're so cynical? Ask yourself this, then ... How many Disney movies have sequels? And then ... how many of these sequels generate a sequel? A significantly lower number. <br /> <br /> Kronk's New Groove is just another example of this. The plot is ridiculously simplistic and pulled out. Even more annoying was the increase in the number of objects and scenes "out of place", for example an old people at home and, God forbid an Aztec version of the Boy Scouts! Worse yet, the opposite end of Kronk's Chippamunk has an eccentric English accent that is absolutely disconcerting for no reason. An accent that, after a short time, intensified the nerves. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of good things. The animation is very beautiful and the vocal talent does well with the sub-standard dialogue that is given to him, especially Warburton in the main role. But beyond that there is really nothing to recommend. Of course, children might like it, but there is little fun for mom and dad as they sit in this tortuous disability of the original concept. <br /> <br /> Avoid this monstrosity with the same zeal that you will use to avoid a pack of raptors-eating lions.
