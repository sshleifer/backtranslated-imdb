Being a big fan of Conte d'ete (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115940/) I expected to be thrilled by another romance on the French beach with a lot of honesty, realism and humor . Same director, same actress, what could go wrong? Unfortunately, Pauline a la plange is a huge disappointment. It is very slow and talkative that it would be fine if the dialogue conveyed insights into the characters, whether meaningful or original. But it looks like a typical soap opera that alternates between irrelevant chatter and jealous accusations. The only thing that saves this film from being a complete disaster is a small amount of character development or at least "character change" compared to Pauline. The starting material is a standard rate (sexual awakening during a beach holiday), but it would have been a decent film if any of the characters were interesting enough. Unfortunately this is not the case. Event although there are other shortcomings with Rohmer's cycle of seasons, most of his subsequent films are far more numerous than this.
