Hannibal must be the most terrible film I've seen in a long time. In fact, I want my money back. What a waste of time. No plot, minimal character development, questionable reasons, poor dialogue, acting below standards. What else can I say? If you haven't seen it, don't worry. I don't even want to rent the video and if you happen to come on TV ... change channels. The only reason anyone could watch this movie would be to see if gratuitous violence lived up to all the hype (which frankly is why they added it). If you want to see some food eat his brain, then advance quickly up to that point. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of this film? It is as if someone had just asked "I wonder what Hannibal has in store for these days" and we went on the journey. It is free at the beginning and is free at the end. In between there is a lot of self-indulgence by Anthony Hopkins and the directors. Julianne Moore bravely tries to inject some life into her Clarice, but they gave her a standard script and, as far as I'm concerned, she was set to fail. <br /> <br /> In my opinion this is just a very bad story in every sense. The only reason he made so much money was because of the senseless violence they added, which at the end of the day leaves you more with a sense of contempt than the horror you should try. <br /> <br /> I give you a GREAT RASPBERRY!
