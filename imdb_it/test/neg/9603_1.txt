Normally for film reviews, I try to be constructive and objective, but there's only one word for this, uh, "movie": SUCKY !!!!!!! The dialogue, the acting, the special effects, the plot, the set and the characters all look like they were invented by, well, my potted plants. Do not see this for the sake of all that is good and just in this world! :)
