The first time I saw this movie was with this cute girl I was attracted to. we had a lot of fun laughing and generally enjoying ourselves. So my impression was that it was terrible but watchable for the value of the cheese. Then, as part of our anniversary, we watched it together again on video. Apparently, the film is simply terrible and unwatchable. It's amazing how pretty girls can change the way the world looks.
