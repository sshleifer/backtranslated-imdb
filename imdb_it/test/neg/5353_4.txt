There are other reviews that express similar opinions, but I still feel compelled to add my comments. The film is generally well done from a technical point of view, apart from perhaps being too long. The acting is mostly very good, although Kevin Spacey is not given much space to explain the motivations of his character (apparently ambition rather than racism), and the only function of Sandra Bullock seems to be a pleasure for the eyes, which she certainly handles very well. /> <br /> At a fundamental level, the heart of the film is in the right place to oppose racism, and I have the impression that it has tried to be a sort of definitive treatment of racism, perhaps because so many famous names have accepted to be there. However, it seems that the writers have been biting much more than they could chew (I haven't read the book, so I don't know how much of Grisham is in part). The biggest problem, as many others have said, is that it ends up supporting the vigilante's justice. Apart from the fact that I disagree with this position, I do not believe that such an opinion actually helps the anti-racist cause - it is more likely to be applied to acquit white defendants who kill black victims. Eventually the prosecutor invites the jury (and the public) to imagine that the raped girl was white - but follow her and imagine that the defendant is a white man who murdered black rapists ... in the end the message seems to be that it goes good to kill someone if you hate them enough. It is also convenient that the killed man was presented as totally evil and his guilt had no doubt, which removes any probable moral ambiguity in a real case. <br /> <br /> Samuel L Jackson offers an excellent performance, but unfortunately this also undermines the plot - he runs into someone with considerable integrity, but it's hard to believe he would be willing to hide behind a request for madness (and in effects it does not, when the critical moment arrives). Presumably we think it is because he is sentenced to death, but in fact at some point he is offered a request for manslaughter, although if you blink you might lose it. Why not take it, since he must know that his chances of acquittal are poor? Or if you want to take a stand in court, why defend madness? <br /> <br /> There are also less serious flaws. The medical experts, on whose testimony the case is allegedly based, are jokes - both are discredited for highly plausible reasons, and none of them offers a true psychiatric diagnosis. The message seems to be that expert witnesses will say everything they are asked to say, and should not be believed. The fact that the injured policeman supports Jackson is moderately plausible, but still a bit convenient (and if he died?), I find it hard to believe that the KKK can march down the road in broad daylight. Other apparently serious crimes (riot, arson, kidnapping, attempted murder) pass without any visible attempt to locate or prosecute them. And the scene where the dog comes back is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> My final reaction must be left rather dirty - as if I were a racist because I don't agree with the resolution. It may be that the film has the purpose of exploring different points of view and letting the public decide, but in this case it seems that they have forgotten it when they arrived at the end. The film made me reflect on my points of view, read what others thought here and add my opinion, so at some level maybe he succeeded - but I fear he might have strengthened highly illiberal views in some people, which I hope is the opposite of what he meant. <br /> <br /> Final Thought - try looking at Law and Order, cover issues like this with much more depth in about 38 minutes of screen time!
