Right ... so you have a dam, tons of water (which seems to flow very slowly) and a small town that is right under the path of destruction dams. Throw in a greedy profiteer, an apparently unstable and unsatisfied architect and his son, and then to make things clearer add a weak plot and a bad acting. All in all, when you watch this movie from a paying customer's point of view ... I would feel extremely annoyed if it were a pay-per-view movie. If you want a laugh ... then you really need to watch this movie.
