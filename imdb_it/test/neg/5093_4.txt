I really couldn't wait to see this movie, but unfortunately it didn't live up to expectations. <br /> <br /> A good movie has the audience that identifies / empathizes / sympathizes with the main actor. Unfortunately this was very difficult with Samantha Morton. <br /> <br /> The plot seemed very detached and did not flow as it should / could have done. <br /> <br /> Keifer Sutherland seemed to be little more than a window and I wonder why he agreed to play what seemed to be a little part. The beautiful scenery and the acting of Tem Morrison and Cliff Curtis were the only advantage. <br /> <br /> Perhaps being a kiwi I set the highest level for locally produced films. Perhaps the change of director / presumably difficult to work with the main actor has influenced my opinion. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm just trying to find excuses for a movie that could have been great. <br /> <br /> A lot of maybes that still don't explain why this movie just lacked something special. <br /> <br /> It could have been fantastic, it wasn't.
