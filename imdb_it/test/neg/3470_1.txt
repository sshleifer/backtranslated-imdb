Sorry if I disappoint anyone about what I'm going to say to this fact about TV movies. But I paid the money for the film and discovered that this film is a disaster. The director is really terribly bad. But, after consulting his information here, I realized that there may be reasons for the poor quality of the direction and production. Maybe they have no budget, but anyway, Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility had little money, but it was a success. The director of this film really did a bad job telling the story and the film couldn't even maintain a rational continuity in itself. Keep pulling me out of the scene. Maybe someone needs to work hard on the story line / board. Even the dubbed sound is terribly bad. My God ... Normally, I would appreciate every movie because behind it lie ideas and imaginations of an individual. but this time, I'm just angry, "I really want to hit something hard." ... Simply don't do the job if someone can't make it at its best. Bad arts (not even art, what is it?) They really hurt people.
