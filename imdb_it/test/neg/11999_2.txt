Ladies and gentlemen, let us introduce you ?? The Toltecs! This ancient Latin American tribe, even before the Aztecs, presumably had the most evil and bloodthirsty sorcerers, yet their asses were screamed by a pair of college guards and a lawman of a hundred and forty-seven years with a whip! But before you can see it, however, you must face more than 40 minutes of pure boredom, childish jokes and squalid sequences that contain no real flaw. In the event that I have not fully understood it yet: "The Dark Power" is an indecipherable and intoxicating piece of 80s horror crap that still manages to be fun due to its pure and somewhat fascinating stupidity factor. The intentions of the writer / director Phil Smoot were obviously admirable, but he? as well as the rest of the cast and crew? He lacked the talent and the financial means to offer something even half decent. Smoot carefully observed "The Evil Dead" and other similar demonic-themed films, and somehow he must have thought he could do it too. The film opens with an old Indian who dies in his isolated country house; barely saying his last word over a whisper ?? Toltecs. His nephew promptly lends a home to a group of college chicks, including a typical 80s aerobic girl, a cute black girl and a racist and redneck girl. They will soon find out why exactly the old Indian lived like a hermit, since he was actually the guardian of an ancient Toltec cemetery. The Toltec sorcerers buried themselves alive, only to emerge again thousands of years later and feed on the flesh of the living. And honestly, is there meat that is tastier than bimbos? As already mentioned, the first half of "The Dark Power" is terribly lame and sleep-inducing. The jokes of clich√©s, the delayed dialogues and the ridiculously long footage of Lash LaRue swinging around his whip seem to go on forever. Thus, the film loses the last dose of credibility when the Toltec sorcerers emerge from the ground. Instead of threatening, they seem to be hard rock star addicts with foolish masks and drunken gestures. It is worth mentioning an exaggerated moment, when a boy's lips are spread all over his skull, but overall the appearance of the carnage of this film is disappointing. The only remotely useful moments are absolutely meaningless, like when a 9-year-old boy (named Cletus!) Walks around in his uncle's truck or when the vulgar chick fucks the beer in the bathtub after working. Seriously, unless you notice before the sight of a 1940 western veteran swinging around his whip with nothing, I suggest you skip this movie.
