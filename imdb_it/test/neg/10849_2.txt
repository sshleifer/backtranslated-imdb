As I said in other comments, I've become a big fan of David Bradley since I saw him in "American Ninja 3". The guy is good at martial arts, he has a sort of charisma and he is an interesting looking guy on the screen. Unfortunately, he went to the DTV department since his debut and remained one of the kings of TV movies until 2001, where he apparently stopped making films. Now, it's one thing to look at Cyborg Cop or Hard Justice, which are disgusting cliché movies but very fun to watch (because they're fun if they have any meaning) but it's another thing to look at a piece of insipid boredom like Total Reality. I mean, this and Crisis are the two biggest pieces of horse dung this guy ever made. I wouldn't even recommend it to Bradly's biggest fans. If I had known this and the crisis would have been so fucked up, I wouldn't have spent the 3 or 4 euros that cost me. Total reality is as boring as the crisis, although strangely, starts to promise. A group of military prisoners in the future will have the chance to stop some kind of disaster in the past (sorry, I didn't pay much attention to this atrocity) and have only 24 hours to return or something like that. If they don't, they're stuck there forever. The poor director who oversaw this, "proves" some humorous (?) Clichés like the condemned arriving on Earth and not knowing what a truck is for example (wow, hilarious ...). The film follows David Bradley who works with a girl from Earth for the rest of the film. This bored me so much that I had to force myself to watch it in 3 or 4 installments at least to use the 4 or 5 euros it cost me. This is coz every time I tried, I fell asleep. And if you get a movie with David Bradley in a single 10 second fight scene, then this is the final touch that could help launch him from a 100-foot cliff to never see him again. I wish I could meet the "director" of this pile of poop on the street and I swear to God I would ask him to come back for me for 5 euros. I'd also like to meet David Bradley to ask him why in the name of God he chose to act in this poor excuse for a movie. Don't even worry about this movie, I mean from the bottom of my heart, not renting it out and especially not buying it.
