There is a famous story about a man who becomes the prey of a safari hunter who has lost interest in hunting anything but humans. It's pretty good, and it's been done and redone many times in movies and on TV. Some are noteworthy, but this urbanized version, which injects the old and tired themes of racism, sucks. The farce of Leguizamo is almost as weak as the little funny script. Chaplin, this guy isn't. There must be people who find a dwarf who can't stop dancing in a fun way, I mean I suppose it's funny in a pathetic and bizarre way, but it's not enough to bring a movie. Do you have the usual Nazi or neo-Nazi raid, whatever the way we should think, write bad, who is the son, of course, is gay, German accents ... get the picture?
