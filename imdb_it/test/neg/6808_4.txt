Attention, spoilers ahead (although I doubt anyone has seen this yet) <br /> <br /> The film starts off pretty well, but in the middle it flakes off and becomes a trivial, sweet, predictable and unrealistic mess of ' romantic harmony '. I mean, it is obvious that there are serious problems in the marriage of the main characters, but these problems are never solved but they are only forgotten. <br /> <br /> Basically, as soon as he decides to have a child behind him (without even asking) all their problems magically disappear without a trace or explanation. Given what had happened so far, it would have been much more logical if the marriage had failed rather than become banal and the clich√© "having a baby will change everything". <br /> <br /> The two main characters "Families and neighbors are also extremely one-dimensional, and do not seem to serve any purpose other than to irritate the viewer, and mysteriously disappear from the film as soon as the" harmony moments begin ". <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I tore this film, but given the start I would have expected something more. 4/10 for me.
