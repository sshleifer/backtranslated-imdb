If you think Hannah Montana or the Life Suite are at the bottom of tween sitcoms, then obviously you've never watched iCarly. iCarly is without a doubt the worst show I've ever seen. From acting without life to low budgets, the show stinks like the Chinese takeout last week left to simmer in your overheated car. <br /> <br /> The show revolves around a beautiful, lively, and "should be" funny girl named Carly, while she and her friends do a live web show called iCarly. Carly lives alone with her older brother who seriously needs advice or something, because she is a little short on cells. <br /> <br /> The plots of the shows are highly ridiculous and unbearably annoying. But having to watch Carly and her friend, Sam, make their little iCarly show on a show is even worse. In practice they show strange images and attack the nose while the trace of laughter is reproduced again and again. I mean seriously, every two seconds the laughter track seems to come without reason. <br /> <br /> So what's the point of this review? could you ask Just to ridicule iCarly? Well, yes, but I also warn you to pay attention to this show. Why seriously, if you had to choose between watching iCarly and Barney? I have no questions about it, I'd choose Barney.
