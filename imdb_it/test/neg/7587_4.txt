Generally I don't appreciate light attempts to create humorous stories, which means that "Anita no perd el Tren" can't score a very high score for me. The story is good: a middle-aged but still good-looking woman finds a new love. But attempts to make this film as a romantic comedy have sometimes managed to be quite comical. <br /> <br /> Rosa María Sardà has cleverly shown that she can be a serious actress in productions like "Amic / Amat" (qv), "Todo Sobre mi Madre" (qv), "Las Amargas Lágrimas de Petra von Kant "(qv) and" El Embrujo de Shanghai "(qv). However, the powers they have had over the years have deprived them of many trivial things, for cinema and TV. Something similar could be said of José Coronado: perfectly capable of producing serious performances. María Barranco belongs quietly to this group. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, I still had the feeling that I would be really pleased to see a new version of this film, in a serious tone, that would allow the actors to really show off their performing skills. And the curious thing is that it should be done exactly with the same main actors. Talent wasted on a rather stupid movie that could have been very promising indeed.
