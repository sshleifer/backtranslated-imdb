PDQ Bach has done better. Most of the speaking part of "Bach" is composed of letters written to various patrons who complain about the amount and speed of its payment. Anna Magdalena's diary, mostly about the death of children and other family issues, is a more engaging story. The music is disconcerting: orchestras and choirs of chapels from the 17th century that produce the sound of the concert hall of the 20th century. The overall quality of the production reminded me of a junior level slide show. JS Bach was a brilliant man whose music speaks for itself. This film does not add anything. Netflix sent me 2 records that they would not play, so I streamed the movie. Clearly Netflix was trying to tell me something.
