This was a very good show. I liked the construction of real time and flashbacks, seeing the old Diggers that meet again and remembering the terrors of their captivity in the Changi POW camp. The main problem with the way the show was written is that the scenes of life in Changi are more like a holiday camp than the place must have been. I'm old enough to remember the filming of the men freed by Changi and other Japanese prison camps. No actor could lose enough weight to have a resemblance to the status of those men. They made Belsen's Jews look like sumo wrestlers. I have met several Changi veterans over the years. Many will never ride in a Japanese car, let alone own one. The physical and mental tortures that these men endured were too horrible for them to talk about it. What percentage has survived? John Doyle could be OK writing comedy for "Roy and HG" (I hate that too) but this is a serious coating of sugar that should never be tolerated. I am happy that the satirical writers write "The life of Brian" and make fun of the Crucifixion because it is obviously a comedy, even if some consider it in bad taste. "Changi" is written as a portrait of a real event and, as such, could be considered by young people as a true record. Great performances of a refined cast cannot redeem this light script.
