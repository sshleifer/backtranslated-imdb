I worked on this atrocity ten years ago. Fortunately for me, nobody knows why I didn't make the final cut. And when I saw the film in theaters, I was happy! My agents were crazy about filmmakers (apparently for the first time), rewriting the script every day and changing their agreements with the agencies as often. Later they told me that, once back in California (we shot in Atlanta), these "professionals" had 4 1/2 hours of footage! Even modified up to 90 minutes, it is at least twice as long as it needs to be. I found Hulk Hogan surprisingly fascinating, but otherwise - what a waste of movies!
