This film was released shortly after the films Conan, a sort of female Conan, Red Sonja played by Sylvester Stallones' ex-wife Brigitte Nielsen. Unfortunately she is not a very good actress, as demonstrated in Rocky IV and Cobra. The whole film seems cheap, but strangely Arnold Swarzenegger appears in this film but not like Conan, although he looks, acts and fights like Conan in Conan's two films, I don't know what it is. However, it only appears every twenty minutes and does not last long. Did Arnold film this in his spare time from the shooting of Conan the Destroyer or something like that? In any case the film is a way to slow down and get bored of an action movie, skip this and watch Conan the barbarian instead.
