This was by far the worst movie I've ever seen! My husband and I own over 600 DVDs, most of which are Sci-Fi and Horror B-Movies that are not high quality, but still fun. Dracula 300 had absolutely no redeeming qualities! The writing was horrible and the acting was even worse. It took 3 attempts to pass the entire film, because we could only tolerate it at 30 minute intervals. We thought that surely should improve ... we were wrong. I'd rather see a stuffed corpse than sit down again !!! When my husband and I finished we looked at each other like "Uh ... is that it?" It seemed like the end should have been more, but they invested their apparent $ 500.00 budget and they were like "Oh, shit ... we're broke ... now ... quick..roll credits!"
