Sex is the most noteworthy aspect of existence. It is perhaps the most interesting activity that exists between birth and death. LE DECLIN DE EMPIRE AMERICAIN studies human sexuality in a dry and boring way. In reality, worse than just being boring, seeing the 40-year-old unmarried is, well, unpleasant. <br /> <br /> I believe there is some shock value in having adults as old as our parents talk about sex, but after twenty minutes, this stops being interesting. Perhaps if the characters were all 20 years younger, the film would be more visually appealing. <br /> <br /> LE DECLIN DE EMPIRE AMERICAIN is not worth it.
