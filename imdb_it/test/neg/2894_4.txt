This is a very boring movie with underdeveloped characters, subplots that go nowhere and barely tolerable acting. It looks like a badly designed "2001" scam. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is worth it are the sets, costumes and visual effects. But even that wasn't enough to keep me from taking my head off. I would like to have the soundtrack, especially the music during the space flight sequence, for the nights when I have difficulty falling asleep.
