The genre of B-series movies from the 50s that were still very funny is what makes Predator Island a tribute. Shot in Connecticut, Predator Island is located on an island called a Hell's Beacon lighthouse that is inhabited only by the lighthouse couple. In the typical science fiction style of the 50s, after half a dozen young adults crashed into the rocky beach of the island, horrible creatures from space invade the island after a meteor hit nearby. The creatures begin to inhabit both the bodies of their victims and to devour them. A lot of curses and lame comebacks are the main form of dialogue in this film. It's so tough that you have to laugh sometimes. If you are looking for a movie that is stupid, but in a fun way, then this fits the bill. <br /> <br /> Interesting note: I appear in the film as a corpse in the distant background of the final scene. They needed about 50 extras during filming, yet around 300 people showed up for the opportunity. In the end they used almost 200.
