I bought this DVD as part of a set of 50 "historical classics". It is certainly not a classic, and since the plot was updated at the time of its release, it is not even historical. The current title on the DVD is "Indecente" and also subtitled "The private life of Becky Sharp". Myrna Loy is not very convincing, although in her defense she is plagued by a terrible script and a trivial dialogue. As with many early talkies, and especially those made by smaller studios, there is little skill shown by the cast and crew. Loy wears some clothes that are quite elegant, but his costumes and tricks in the following scenes are exaggerated. The only thing that saves is a tolerable performance by Billy Bevan, who plays one of his many suitors
