This thing, should not be called a film, is almost worse than "Manos", but you just have to see it is fun. If you see it at the video store rent it, if you see the tenth anniversary edition, yes, there's a special edition, for less than $ 10 buy it, if your friend borrows it, you just have to see it. The acting is so bad, and the blood is so fake. After seeing this you are wondering why they did this insult to the art of the film? This assumes that your face does not melt like the Nazis in "Raiders". If you can see this, make sure you rate this movie as 1 (horrible) so that it can make the fund 100, it really deserves a place there. I'm surprised it's not number 1 right now.
