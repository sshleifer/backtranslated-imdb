I had never heard of "The Clearing" until one day I really got bored with some friends in the local Blockbuster and caught our attention. The description on the DVD jacket caught our interest, but once we put it in the DVD player, boredom was just beginning. <br /> <br /> The plot has been dragged for too long. It seemed to follow the same pattern as other films that include a kidnapping. The most suspenseful parts were at the beginning of the film, however. Subsequently, the structure was followed exactly and this made "The Clearing" non-original. The flashbacks were too many and the pain of the victim's family did not provide anything interesting or improved the nature of the film. And I also found that I didn't like the ending, so I probably didn't like the movie at all. <br /> <br /> The acting wasn't horrible ... it wasn't the best, though. Robert Redford has done much better. The tragic character of Willem Dafoe was the only one I really saw develop throughout the plot and the viewer really sees that change in the last ten minutes or so in the film. The portrait of Helen Mirren as Robert Redford's wife was flat and followed the same generic pattern as other films that include a tragic and heartbreaking event. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Clearing" is nothing exciting about. Use your money to rent movies on something else ... like "Garden State", maybe?
