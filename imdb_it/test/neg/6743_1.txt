Absolutely nothing is redeeming about this total piece of garbage, and the only thing worse than seeing this movie is seeing it in English class. This is literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It totally ignores and contradicts any theme that may present, so the plot is really really boring. Thank God, the 1980s are over, and God saves anything that actually started as "James Bond III".
