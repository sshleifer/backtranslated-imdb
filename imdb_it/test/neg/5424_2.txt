There's really not much wrong with Crash of the Moons. Basically it is some episodes of Rocky Jones, Space Ranger merged into a movie. It is extremely dated, however. Winky's treatment of Vena is a good example. It must be remembered that it was designed to be shown to children in the 1950s. In this sense, it is successful. If you like science fiction for children in the 50s, go ahead and take a look. You will see John Banner in a pre-sgt. Schultz role. It does a good job. All in all, I would give it a 6 out of 10. Not great, but not bad.
