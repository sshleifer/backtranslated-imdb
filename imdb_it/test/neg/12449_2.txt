Return to Sender, a.k.a. Condemned, it is almost imperfect. The only positive thing about this particular film was that I was never bored. That said, reviews that consider this film a low-budget hit may not have seen the same movie I saw. <br /> <br /> Rather than write a review and tell you what happens and what works Work, I'll just comment that nothing works. There are holes in the plot in this movie that you can drive in semi-through. The acting in the film is not very good, although this could be the result of a script so poorly formulated that it could have been the ghost writing of George Lucas. There was no need for exceptional sets or costumes for this particular film and everything seemed appropriate. Did I mention that there were holes in the plot? At the end of the film, you're wondering how a blind man can be a good shot with a rifle, because Kelly Preston trusts Aidan Quinn, because he falls asleep the night before his client is killed, as Aidan Quinn can drive 400 miles in so little time with a car that continues to collapse during the rest of the film, because Aidan Quinn didn't make a fifth instead of a bunch of nuggets, etc. <br /> <br /> With that said, this is certainly a B series movie and terrible. The unfortunate thing is that it is not so bad as to be good. If you consider your time, please let this be a public service message to stay away from this.
