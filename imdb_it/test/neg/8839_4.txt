Lone Star Productions certainly made them in the 1930s, and "Star Packer" has the feeling of one of the most impetuous. John Wayne is the American Marshal John Travers, who is investigating a dishonest thug known only as "The Shadow", responsible for theft of cattle, stage robberies and the like, and giving orders from behind the door of a secure fake wall . Yakima Canutt is Travers' trusted Indian companion, aptly named ... well, "Yak". <br /> <br /> At the beginning we find out that Matt Matlock, head of the Cattlemens Union (George pre-Gabby Hayes), is really The Shadow; the gift is when he offers to buy his (alleged) grandson Anita, half of the Matlock Ranch, since "this is not a place for a girl". Like Anita, Verna Hillie doesn't have much to do in the movie, although at a comic moment, she can use a six shooter to hit the target of one of the villains in a night raid. <br /> <br /> There are some curiosities in the film: for example, the character of Wayne alternately rides a white horse and a dark horse in the first half of the film. In what could have been a clean device, a hollow tree stump used by a henchman is right in the middle of the road. And finally, the film does not live up to its name, as Sheriff Travers never wears a badge for the whole film, which is a stellar packer without a star. <br /> <br /> The horse chases, the fugitive scene scenes, the stagecoach off the cliff (another curiosity, the horses comfortably detached from the stage) are all pretty standard things. But John Wayne fans will want to see him for the charisma he showed early in his career. For those more critical, the white handkerchiefs worn on the forehead by the good guy could only mean that they all had headaches.
