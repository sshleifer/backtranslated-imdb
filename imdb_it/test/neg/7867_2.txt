I hate being too critical, but this was really bad. I like the Baldwin brothers, I just hope there's more talent between them. I liked the general plot, but there was only too much "attempt" and not enough real "action" regarding quality acting. <br /> <br /> My favorite character is the bald cop. It reminded me of Dmitri Valtane (I think of Jeremy Roberts) of Start Trek 6: Undiscovered country. Simply without hair. <br /> <br /> If you have the Hollywood Video MVP program and are really trying to get your money's worth, then through this with one of the three MVP movies you collect. It's worth it for a few laughs. <br /> <br /> The single most impressive special effect of the entire show is the sound of Stephen Baldwin's rifle. I suppose you leave a little bit about the quality and excitement of the rest of the show.
