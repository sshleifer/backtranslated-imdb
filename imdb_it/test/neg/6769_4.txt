Apparently cropped episodes from the Gangbusters television program on the big screen. Although this was often done in the 50s and 60s, because people did not have a color TV or TV and the producers wanted an increase in investment return (ticket sales for large screens or if it was resale of a series that is not in syndication), the results were usually lower than the sum of their parts. The only time I saw it work was where multi-part stories (Ala Rocky Jones or Man From Uncle) or in the case of the horror anthology (The Veil and 13 Demon Street) were put together. Here the effect is to have stories of American criminals in the 20s and 30s (Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Bonnie and Clyde, etc.) Inter-cut between them while a narrator talks about how the FBI has them hunted. It's a strange concoction that doesn't work enough because it's clear that there are things here that don't belong together. More than once I watched TV strangely because things didn't seem right. In all honesty I will not describe the cheapness of the production since this was what was the first TV (and the series). It's not bad, but it's not very good either. To be honest, the episodes of the series I've seen work best on a single episode where we don't expect much. Given the choice, I would have rented the DVDs of the show instead of this movie.
