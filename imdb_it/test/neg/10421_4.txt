What is French talking about? First, they (apparently) love Jerry Lewis much more than the United States does. Second, they seem (appear) to appreciate the work of Edgar Allan Poe more than anyone else. It must be the "Beaudelaire" effect. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong ... I'm a Poe fan too. But this trilogy manages to transform three of the stories below Poe's average into ... well, I'm not sure what they were transformed. <br /> <br /> "Toby Dammit" is a good Fellini film, but it has nothing to do with Poe's story, at least in terms of theme. It's fun at first sight. Terence Stamp does a good job with an interesting role. However, it has nothing to do with Poe or the spirits of the dead. <br /> <br /> "Metzergenstein" is a big mess. How were Vadim's films produced? It's just awful ... not even by the standards of amateur film schools. Depending on the DVD menu you have, try skipping and saving time. <br /> <br /> "William Wilson" is actually the most loyal segment of Poe's work. It doesn't have much style, even if it includes the strange snowball fight that I think I've ever seen in a movie. (Looks like the guys are pulling handkerchiefs, or maybe handkerchiefs, that have been rolled into balls.) My advice is to skip "Metzergenstein", look at "William Wilson", and then, if you're a Fellini fan (don't are) keep "Toby Dammit" while cooking dinner or having a snack.
