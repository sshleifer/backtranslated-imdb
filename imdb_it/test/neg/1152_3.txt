I had never heard of this movie until DVD. I was immediately intrigued by all this: the actors, the title, the cover and in particular the author. Arthur Miller, you can't go wrong with him, can you? Yes. I didn't read the novel, but I guess it was much better than the movie. I had high hopes for this film. I love Macy and Dern, and it seemed interesting to me. Unfortunately, this film never rises above the cookie messages on racism and fanaticism. If you've never seen other films that deal with this subject, or if you never knew that America was founded on bigotry, then maybe this movie will amaze you. The others will probably find it predictable, stale and general tasteless.
