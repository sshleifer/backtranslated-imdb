I recently saw a series of speleological films and this film managed to put together all the worst aspects of this type of film. Very little appreciation is gained for the speleological environment or the monster they face, while the characters are clich√©s (spiritual boy, leader with tragedy in the recent past, etc.) and the ending was only weak. It really annoyed me that the director kept shaking the camera or showing almost total darkness to create atmosphere. I read that this film gave a real representation of speleology and yes, I guess the caves are dark. Showing the total darkness close to half of the film really brought him home. I really liked the "descent" which, for my money, played better, showed closer caving situations, better monsters and had a good ending. <br /> <br /> **** spoiler ****** <br /> <br /> The monster turns out to be a guy whose plane crashed and the parents were killed, letting it grow in caves . It seems to have developed a super strength and speed, but because it is never dealt with - perhaps the same force that dried up the torch batteries caused it, but during the movie every time someone is killed you get the impression of something big with claws tearing every victim to pieces (see how much blood splashes the walls!) but in the end it's just a guy with a fur coat draped over him and a mask? I would be willing to overlook this if great heights of suspense were reached, but this was not the case. Then he starts to rape the last remaining speleologist and pulls the credits ... Almost absurdly bad, I thought. Sometimes a movie is so bad that you can enjoy it and maybe have a laugh, but this movie can't take lightly. <br /> <br /> You looked at it, you can't find out!
