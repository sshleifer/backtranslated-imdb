The only good thing about Persepolis are the shadows created in the animation style of German expressionism and a bit of history. This film bored me. It was a woman dissatisfied with her culture who tries everything else and then returns to her roots. Here he still finds great discontent and eventually leaves the final to allow everyone else in his country to understand the situation and what they will do now that he is not there to support them. It does not reach any conclusion and leaves us with the feeling that this woman has no loyalty. Mind you, she is divided between cultures and does not have enough of a background to understand what is important and real. He is always listening to so many voices and will most likely end up being a citizen of the world of some sort who has no connection with his native Iranian culture. The only thing I received from this film was anguish.
