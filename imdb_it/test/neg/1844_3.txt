I'm usually a very generous voter on IMDb and I don't bother to comment on films I don't like, but this was simply boring. Actually I turned it off 15 minutes before finishing it, to see "This Is It" (because my gf wanted ... I chose the lesser of two evils). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie: imagine this film as a collection of "horror" stories worse than the average, like "scary stories" that you find in an issue of "Reader's Digest" in the waiting for your dentist. <br /> <br /> I did not expect anything particularly terrifying or amusing, I am not the "I want to see the blood!" - kind of person, but this "film" is neither "horror" nor "comedy" nor amusing in any other way. <br /> <br /> It's probably scarier / more fun and fun to watch the movie "You've Got Mail" for 90 minutes while drinking chamomile. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: a "horror comedy" for people between 4 and 7 years old.
