I felt that the film Skammen, directed by Ingmar Bergman, was very dry. Show the things that people will do to survive during a war and the shame that comes out of these actions; however I believe that it is not complete or that it is attention. He has never fully entered the plot or deep into the character's emotions or the reasons behind his actions. The only thing I found rather attention in the film was the transformation of the two main characters, Jan and Eva. Many times during the film there were only the two main characters sitting around or doing their daily chores and they didn't even have a conversation. I understand that this was to show the reality of these people, yet I feel that there are other ways to show reality and make it fun. I think Ingmar Bergman could have filmed this film in a more compelling way.
