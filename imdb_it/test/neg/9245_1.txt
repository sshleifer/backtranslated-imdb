Why would anyone make a film like this? Why would anyone invest in a movie like this? Why would anyone in the film business work on a film like this? Why should every theater show a film like this? Why would a TV channel plan a movie like this? Why should a critic worry about reviewing a film like this? Why would anyone watch a movie like this? Why should mental examinations not be made by writers / producers / directors of a film like this? Sometimes there are films that are so bad that they are good. This is such a horrible movie that it's horrible. IMDb must really set up a "0" or even a lesser scale to embrace the works of this terrible and frighteningly terrible.
