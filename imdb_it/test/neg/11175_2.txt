Ring! Ring! Horror film hotline, how can we help you? Um ?? Yup ?? Ready! I mean hi, is my name Rugge ?? err, call me with my initials R.D! Okay Mr. R.D, what seems to be the problem? Well, the reviews on my last film "Dial: Help" were all negative and harsh and, frankly, I feel like my career has seen better days too. Okay Mr. R.D, and why do you think it is? Well, I gained fame and deserved cult status thanks to my controversial and shocking film about the wild tribes of cannibals that devour a film crew and another on ruthless thugs who terrorize wealthy people in a house on the edge of the park, for which I took borrowed the idea from Wes Craven, but "Dial: Help" rotates on ?? err ?? it does not matter! No no, Mr. R.D, go ahead and tell me what the movie is about. Um, it's a spiritually owned phone line that chases a sexy model and kills the people around her. Ah understood. That premise seems really a bit silly and not petrifying like cannibals or rapists, but I suppose there are deeper themes in your film, right? Oh yes, of course ?? Um, what do you mean by that? Well, isn't the symbolism of the telephone line for another kind of terror? Or is it all happening all alone in the mind of your female heroine? Um, no ?? It's just a phone that goes crazy and kills people with cable, vibration, electricity or even ordinary coins. Interesting, Mr. R.D, but how do you explain all this supernatural material to the viewer at the end of the film? You see, I thought that the plot of the mystery of the phone that was slowly revealing would not be so important or relevant, so I focused on processing all the possible phone tricks I could think of. Telephone tricks? What do you mean? You know, like the wind blowing through the horn, the tones of the dial invading the mind, and the rotating benches that catapult into the air! Very original, Mr. R.D, but not exactly horrible and as an experienced director, you should know that, in the end, people expect a reasonable clarification of all these events. Oh, there it is! Everything has to do with negative and unprecedented energy, if I remember correctly! It's all a bit confusing, I admit. Hmm ?? I see. Oh well, as they always say, a good movie is based on more than just story. Have you at least processed some of your normal brands in the film, so that your fans at least recognize your style? I tried! The Lord knows I tried, but the murders and bloodshed simply don't shock anyone! It's really a shame, Mr. R.D, but what about sex? Everyone likes a good deal of sleaze and nudity in their horror movies and you told yourself that the movie was about a sexy model in danger! Yes but ?? But what, Mr. R.D? Well, actually, we promoted "Dial: Help" as an erotic thriller with Charlotte Lewis's revealing shots on the cover, but in reality there is no sex in the movie and Charlotte even refused to topless. Mr. R.D! Now I'm really disappointed, this is only shamelessly tearing people and attracting them with false promises! I know, I know, and I'm ashamed, but I just wanted everyone to rent "Dial: Help" and adore him! Well, to top it off I can comfort you by saying that every great director has the right to make some wrong decisions without this affecting his career immediately, but be more cautious next time and do some research first, OK Mr. R.? I will do it; thank you! You are welcome. Tell me, do you already have any ideas for upcoming films? Yes, it's a fact, I know! I was thinking of creating a Yellow with a killer washing machine! Doesn't it look fascinating? Hello? Hello?
