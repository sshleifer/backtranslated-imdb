Boring, clich√© and predictable. The only original piece was Brighton's position for the gangsters. It is certainly not "Lock Stock etc .......". Hannah was nice in "Sliding Doors". In "Circus" I didn't develop any empathy with his character and I couldn't give a shot what happened to him or his girlfriend. Although this film was so obvious and predictable, the ending was not a surprise, I was so uninterested that I didn't even care why the film had the name "Circus" ....... Booooring .... ... Don't visit this great top.
