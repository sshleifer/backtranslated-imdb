As one of the victims of the entire Enron scandal, my mother forced me to watch this movie with her. How many times can I say terrible? The script was so weak, using clichés after clichés. It appears that the authors reconstructed this story along with some articles on Enron. Watching the film, we were honestly able to complete about half of the lines and thoughts of one-dimensional characters. I realize that this was supposedly adapted from a book, but was the book so ugly? I do not know what to say. Simply terrible The best thing about the movie? Shannon Elizabeth actually kept her clothes. In addition to this, this film gets a big fat F.
