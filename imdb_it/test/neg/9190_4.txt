This film fundamentally seeks to represent the heroism of firefighters by making the entire film run around an American father with a good heart who puts others before himself. Now I know they are trying to show Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) as a typical American father who is a fireman, but as if there was nothing interesting about him, why, so when the film reaches its peak there is only little or no emotion. This film basically tries to make the life of a firefighter exciting, but it becomes boring like any other job except to save lives or property by turning off the fire. John Travolta plays the role of captain of the fire station, but anyone could have interpreted his role and is a boring character like the rest of the film. What could have been a good film is that firefighters are made like heroes because they are firefighters and transform the whole scenario into an uninteresting melodrama. <br /> <br /> 4.9 / 10
