I just saw this last night and to put it bluntly: "Style instead of substance". We can already guess that there had to be much more to Jerry Lee Lewis than is represented here. The character of Jerry Lee Lewis in this film is not depicted as a real human being for a minute for the entire hour and a half plus the running time, but then again, all the other characters are just a stroke of a pencil from total cartoon characters. <br /> <br /> Let's take the beginning. We see Jerry Lee and his cousin Jimmy Swaggart sneaking closer to the Black Jazz Club and we see that Jerry is being inspired. It could be possible. Let's see how the two cousins ​​choose different paths in life (even possible). Then we move on to Jerry Lee who plays the adult piano (now played by Dennis Quaid) and is electrifying and a little creepy. Cut to a scene where he first meets his second cousin, Myra. From that moment on, everything turns into a summary of some events played in a style that adapts to a high-speed reel of news. <br /> <br /> Not that the film is not a little fun and it's nice to hear new versions of the songs that made Jerry Lee. Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Swaggart is also a reason why you should at least take a look at this, an indicator of his greatest successes in the years to come. Winona Ryder as Myra is the most famous character in the film. She teases, she sobs, chews gum and plays flirtatious and that's it. There has never been a reason why she became the third Mrs. Lewis and talks about wives, where are the first two? This is why this cannot be classified as a biographical film, but rather as inaccurate news. We see Jerry get his first song played on the radio, we see his second single entering the top ten, we see his third go to no. 1 and so on. Then comes the inevitable ruin. Absolutely, no basis in reality. <br /> <br /> To conclude another minor quarrel: The film takes place from 1956 to 1958 and again Myra says: "I am only 13 years old" until the end.
