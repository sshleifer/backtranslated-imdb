At university I studied marketing and, even though I lost a lot of lessons and never paid attention, I will always remember the main and most essential principle of marketing, namely: it's not what you sell; it's how you sell it! This principle applies completely to "The Devil's Triangle", as it is basically a wonderfully wrapped and tempting but empty package. The writer / director Richard Winer knew exactly that he had to distract the viewer's attention from the main inaccuracies, so he threw some elements that never fail when it comes to providing a disturbing atmosphere, like the narrator's left voice Vincent Price and the strange music by King Crimson. And I imagine that Richard Winer's dirty tricks worked very efficiently, since during the mid-1970s there was a huge publicity on the Bermuda Triangle and literally every film production ?? if it was an imprecise documentary or a bad attempt at exploitation ?? covering the topic earned a lot of money at the box office. "The Devil's Triangle" overwhelms you with unstructured and often irrelevant data, but the dramatization of the facts and, of course, the intimidating and severe voice of the all-powerful Vincent Price creates an atmosphere of fear and horror. The narrative continually jumps back and forth in time and covers a massive amount of "strange events" and "mysterious disappearances" of ships and airplanes in the Bermuda Triangle for a period of almost an entire century, but the reports remain extremely vague at all times and the eloquent Mr. Price invariably ends up in each chapter with the sinister words "just another unsolved mystery of the Devil's Triangle?" After a couple of cases the whole formula becomes simply ridiculous and almost pathetic, but I imagine it caused a real mass hysteria in 1974. The documentary expands a little more on the most famous mysteries of the Bermuda Triangle, as the five plans of Military Flight 19 which inexplicably disappeared all at once and the peculiar case of the USS Cyclops, but still in these chapters only a minimum of useful information is provided. The cameras at one point never go under water to explore the depths of the Bermuda area, for example, and the testimonies of the apparently real witnesses of the plays seem suspiciously scenic scenes. If you are looking for an informative and objective documentary on the Bermuda Triangle, I certainly would not recommend this film, but if you want to sit down and listen to Vincent Price's hypnotic voice for almost a whole hour, this is your chance!
