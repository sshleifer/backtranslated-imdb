The opening of DEATH IN VENICE resembles a Duran Duran music video with classical music and this is the highlight of the movie <br /> <br /> "In terms of what Theo?" <br /> <br /> In terms of everything, but above all excitement. I doubt there ever was a moving film slower than this. Yes, it's a European art film, so I didn't expect Charles Bronson to massacre hordes of bad guys, but even so I expected a certain substance if not a real plot <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Professor Gustav Von Aschenbach visiting Venice. Gustav visits Venice and goes by gondola, Gustav eats in an expensive restaurant, Gustav looks out of his hotel window and if it's exciting you want Gustav to have a flashback <br /> <br /> Pretty ugly if it were the whole movie but gets worse because Gustav notices a rather nice teenager. So you have an aspiring middle-aged academic after an adolescent he has seen, an old queen is becoming obsessed with a stranger. Great idea for a movie? I don't believe it either and thanks to Gawd it remained a party of yawns instead of an obnoxious precursor of gay porn <br /> <br /> I noticed that many people who praise this film have tried to intellectualize it. I can only be monosyllabic and unpretentious in my opinion and say that the only subtext I could refer to was Gustav's physical and emotional disintegration but it was not caused by the adolescent's effeminate beauty - It was caused by watching such a boring and ostentatious film
