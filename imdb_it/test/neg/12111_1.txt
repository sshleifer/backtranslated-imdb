This thing, directed by the French Patrick Sebastien, is the worst of all the turkeys you may have seen. Forget Independence Day, Kazaam, The Patriot, etc ... get the picture, this is the hole. Sebastien is a TV celebrity in France, (if you need an equivalent, let's say it's Jerry Springer with an I.Q of 13), this is his first film we hope is the last one. I hope that Troma or someone will distribute this film in the United States, so that you guys out there can discover the French stench in the worst way. Let's make a short cut, this is the masterpiece of S ** t.
