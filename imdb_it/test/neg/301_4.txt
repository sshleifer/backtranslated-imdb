*** Possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I read about Dahmer a little and saw the new Dahmer movie (with the same name) previously. This film focuses on victims and killings, too little on Dahmer itself. The movie called "Dahmer" had the opposite problem, it was too little for his crimes and too much for himself. <br /> <br /> I did not find the acting to my satisfaction, it had a certain amateur feeling, especially the surveillance officer. It also seemed that Dahmer's acting got worse every time he played against the surveillance officer actor. But I could be wrong. <br /> <br /> What bothered me a bit is that some scenes were rather scary but that the filmmakers seemed to try and show "the real deal" on what they did anyway. Okay, but what I don't understand is why the guy who escaped from his apartment while Dahmer was out for the beer, was not pictured naked, since that's what happened too. Not a big deal, but simply further consumes the quality of the films that those details are left out. What was not shown or even mentioned was the sexual obsession of the Dahmers with the dead. Once again, I don't care that they didn't SHOW IT, but at least they could mention it or have it integrated into the film somehow. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think the really good Dahmer movie is yet to be made, a film that incorporates not only Dahmers crimes but also who it was, and why it did what it did. I think that 1.5 or 2 hours are not enough to capture the complexity of this. This film was just a clipping (excuse the pun) of the life and personality of Dahmers and does not give you any 'close to good' insight into his life or personality. <br /> <br /> 4/10
