In the past I loved Tim Burton. I loved Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands and even Mars Attacks. But I hate this movie. The scripts in costume at the beginning were the kind of badly done and heavy things that used to hurt the historical drama 25 years ago. Then there were all the cut scenes, which left me cold, and that's the kind of thing that should mean something, I would think. Yes, there were some beautiful bare trees and foggy evenings and the knight leaping from the tree was a nice special effect, but overall the film was simply boring and useless.
