Decent action scenes, but the film is flanked by a slow and complicated plot, almost non-existent dialogues that lead to minimal character development and a seriously horrible plot ... <br /> <br /> I said the plot didn't make sense? But, in his defense, the action scenes were quite impressive, even if they let you scratch your head about why they just happened. <br /> <br /> There's not much more to say about the film. It is a lucid, unreasonable action adventure that makes absolutely no sense. It's like watching a worse version of the Matrix and skipping the whole plot and dialogue.
