This film made me want to hit my head against the wall. It is difficult to compare this evil to something, but some say that watching this film is similar to bleeding from under the nails. And that comment comes from the writer's cousin. This film was so shocking, it made "Hulk" (The second worst film ever) similar to "The Departed" (one of the greatest films in the history of cinema). If you like boring family movies with predictable story lines, then you'll love this movie. If you have a brain, then surely you won't. When I rented this movie, I fell asleep while watching it. The next day, I finished where I left off, and it was the worst decision of my life.
