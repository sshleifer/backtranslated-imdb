Typical Steven Seagal cuisine: that is, it's shit. The plot is based on a series of incredibly unlikely coincidences; there is a great deal of conspiracy theory that would be much more palatable if we didn't know that Seagal takes everything literally; and once again, the multi-billion dollar film Seagal tells us all about The Rich's evils. <br /> <br /> Seagal's survival is based, as usual, on the fact that Bad Guys never shoot their guns out of arm reach, and always like to give a little "I'll kill you" speech before doing jump a man's head. <br /> <br /> Watch this right after the worst * Fire Down Below * and notice how the carpet in Keenen Ivory Wayans' apartment is more flammable than a large puddle of gas. <br /> <br /> Oh, and look at the final fight scene for the Incredible Disappearing Forehead Wound, which is probably the funniest thing in the movie.
