This movie did well at the box office, and the producers of this mess thought the stars had such good chemistry that they projected them into the darkest farce, The Gazebo. Frankly, I'm shocked to see all the positive comments about this ridiculous non-funny comedy. Both protagonists have the maturity of seven years and are much less interesting to spend time with. A veteran support cast including Fred Clark, Harry Morgan and Eva Gabor lend excellent support. And the beautiful photography certainly makes the rich countryside of Spain lush. And there are four or five really funny scenes with two wise scenes and a bunch of recycled and non-advertising mess. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend it It started with a kiss.
