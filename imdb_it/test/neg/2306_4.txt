Although this film was nothing special as such, I am attracted to comment on at least one factor that expressed itself in its favor - that of the female lead in the film, Dyan Cannon. Despite the film's ridiculous plot and what goes on here, his was the best acting job in the film, making the incredible seem more plausible. His raucous scene with gay photographer David Hemmings must be seen to be believed. Good work, Dyan.
