I'm desperately trying to stay awake while watching the movie Solomon Kane. I have about 20 minutes to go. If it gets better, I'll come back here and let you know, but somehow I doubt it will happen. Solomon Kane seems to be based on the video game Dark Watch, and it sounds like it's based on the video game Legacy of Kane, but unfortunately neither is true. I have heard that it is based on some comics or graphic novels or pulp fiction or something else that I have never heard of, but whatever the basis, there is nothing original about this terribly boring film. The atmosphere was stolen from the movie 300, which wasn't all that great. The boring overacting takes itself so seriously that it is almost hypnotic, and to be clear I mean it in a negative sense. The plot is practically non-existent: the violent who tries to be non-violent meets the friendly family, the friendly family is killed, the violent becomes violent again. All the characters are stereotypes taken from Waterworld or Book of Eli or The Hills Have Eyes or, anyway, choose another apocalyptic slash fantasy movie you've seen and there you have it. Someone said, somewhere, this is how to make a film: use a blue filter to make everything mysterious, add a lot of slow-motion strokes of horse hooves that spray into dark puddles, add snowflakes that you they go around while two boring characters talk to each other, and oh yes rain that drops dramatically to distract from the fact that nothing is really happening, and not to forget the black shapes that walk towards us with burning fire behind them, and many torches that burn, and obviously blurry fighting scenes during which it's unclear what's really going on because we don't have the budget for the bloody special effects, so just throw the clanking metallic sound, and, oh, by the way, don't let any character live long enough for the audience to understand them, relate to them or sympathize with them, and cross their fingers, hoping that sword movie fans and witchcraft eats it, even if it is complete doo doo, and they go directly to the video, do not pass GO. . .
