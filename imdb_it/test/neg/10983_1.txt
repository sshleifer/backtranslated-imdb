This woman is a terrible comedian. He can't make a joke. You don't have a real character. This is another example of typical American junk, of which people laugh, because they have no idea how to react, so they say "well, it's a comedy", so I'll laugh, I think. > <br /> I can't stand this miserable woman and her poor excuse for comedy. He deserves nothing but whistles. <br /> <br /> Because America cannot download this kind of Turkish delight, and look for something that really contains humor. <br /> <br /> It's not fun. Not at all. Why oh, why does a person like this idiot too?
