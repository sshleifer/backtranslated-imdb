Seriously ... I'm amazed at all the good answers this show has here. All we have in this show are two stupid guys who continue to laugh annoyingly and do fun things OCCASIONAL only in ... 2 of the shows, while most of the others suck ... as they comment on music videos that I can't endure in person while they love or love. <br /> <br /> In most of the episodes, the only things you will hear are the repetitive "let's go score with chicks", or "I'll kick your ass", or better still and usually used quote " that was nice "and above all, their annoying laugh. <br /> <br /> If you want a good animated show, try The Simpsons, Ren and Stimpy, South Park, this show does not deserve the time or energy to watch this terrible MTV series in a sincere way.
