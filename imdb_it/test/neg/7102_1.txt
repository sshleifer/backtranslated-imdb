Because Lori Petty was cast as a tank girl, I'll never know. His acting is not very bright. His voice is jarring. For me it is almost impossible to put into words how bad this film is. <br /> <br /> In the film there are many "modern-pop" references, which I found very strange, since the film had to take place far in the future. It would not have been difficult to make this premise interesting. Some better writing would have helped the loads. <br /> <br /> Naomi Watts makes an appearance as a mild techno-geek. I think they probably should have changed roles. <br /> <br /> I'll never know why someone would like this movie, unless it was a Petty fan. <br /> <br /> Try not to see this movie. Total waste of time
