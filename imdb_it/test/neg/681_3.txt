This documentary is full of problems. <br /> <br /> How arrogant is it to make a documentary about your family? I understand that you think the topic is interesting. I was bored with it. This is not a fascinating story for me, and I don't know why you would think it was. <br /> <br /> I don't want to be bad, but I have to say: most people in this movie are simply not attractive. All right, not everyone is nice. But your photographic technique, to attack the lens so that you can't help being overwhelmed by their unpleasant appearance because it fills your 47 "TV, is not pleasant. I had to raise my hand half the time to screen myself from warts, wrinkles, bags under my eyes and yellow teeth ... Actually, I'm trying not to sound inhuman, but pull back the camera so it's not like strangers are breathing in my face. <br /> <br /> The operation of the camera in this "film" is amateur, it is the type of photographic work that can be seen by everyone with a video camera during a family picnic: not interesting shots, uncertain, even shots Static are carelessly done if you intend to do it for a living. <br /> <br /> I honestly can't figure out what the big deal is with this thing.
