Honestly, I didn't have high expectations for this film, but at the same time I was confident. Having the direction of Albert Pyun - one of the most famous authors of b-movie - didn't exactly fuel my hopes. I mean how many Albert Pyun's strokes are so high? Yes, exactly ... but the film still advertised a decent cast. Rob Lowe, Burt Reynolds (pre-renaissance celebrity), Ice-T and Mario Van Peebles. <br /> <br /> This all amounts to squatting, since the film is so boring and moves so slowly that the energy seemed to drain out of me the longer it went on. It runs for over 90 minutes, but is telling a story that could have been told in 30 minutes. I don't know what Pyun was going here. I mean the movie drips in an artistic style, but sometimes it's a bit confusing and maybe I'm an idiot to expect more from Pyun this time. Here he seemed to have a budget and a potentially great cast for the material, but it's all wasted. Crazy Six is ​​not a great action movie, it's not much of anything actually. I imagine the saddest thing is that I found the credits in the funniest part of the film. The soundtrack is actually half decent with some smooth female vocals, but the rest is a complete waste and the less it is said the better. To avoid.
