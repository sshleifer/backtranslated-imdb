Although this series and the mini movie in particular were very important at the time of release, I think the series as a whole was actually written rather badly with a weak cast. The issues at the bottom are very well represented but it is difficult to relate and understand the problems of the film when the acting and the script are not convincing enough (especially watching the mini movie). <br /> <br /> I also don't think this mini movie or series has stood the test of time, because now many scenes are rather laughable. The issues are still crucial, but Boys From The Blackstuff cannot fully help the cause of understanding problems in Britain in the 1980s.
