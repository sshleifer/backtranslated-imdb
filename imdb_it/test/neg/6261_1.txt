A film like this makes me appreciate the work that professional actors do. I think film-goers, in general, are a little too strict with professional actors and are ready to hit them for the tiniest reasons. Watch a couple of minutes of "Cheerader Massacre" and believe me, you will change your opinions. A raid would be almost a compliment for these talentless actors. But then again, it's a Jim Wynorski movie. Wynorski is a famous director of these ultra low-budget B-movies (having worked with Roger Corman on many occasions). The problem with this film is actually trying to develop a plot. And when you have actors who play lines like reading letters from a map, how should I worry? In "Bare Wench 2" by Wynorski, he did not try to develop a plot. He simply tried to do a softcore porn / goofy takeoff on the "Blair Witch Project". It was fun and titillating. "Cheerleader Masscare" is not fun. There are a couple of mandatory female nude scenes, but they are few and far between. Therefore it is not even worth to enjoy on an erotic level. I have to say that the worst scene is one in which Nikki Fritz crosses a bridge that is about to collapse. First of all, his character didn't have to cross that bridge. Second, as the bridge starts to creak, rather than doing its best to cross, she stays there and acts helplessly. And ultimately, we don't actually see the bridge collapse because the filmmakers did it for a $ 2 budget !!! Unlike many B-horror movies, this is really boring. And that's what makes the worst of all bad movies. One of the few bright spots was Lunk Johnson, who is probably the most natural actor in the film (though certainly not more than half decent). He was funny in "Bare Wench 2" and even had some funny scenes in this movie.
