I accidentally came across this movie when I was looking for something to watch while I was having lunch. Actually I turned to the WE network because it said that the last 20 minutes of a film about the importance of "attenuating it" for some gymnastics team - I imagined the goodness of the genre. Well, I had some cheese. <br /> <br /> Firstly, I lost a good 20-40 minutes at the beginning of the film. Fortunately, most of them have been summarized fairly quickly, especially in the bedroom scene where Crystal admits she feels responsible for the death of her rapist. <br /> <br /> I love Jenny Garth and will look at everything. She's so cute and I want my lipstick to be as perfect as hers always is. It is beautiful during this film and does not age much for what appears to be more than a decade. <br /> <br /> In general, I felt bad for the actors watching this movie. Everyone tried to sell their parts, but all of them were so badly written that it was a constant struggle. Frankly, I was surprised to see Terry Farrell and Mitch Ryan (the father of Greg by Dharma and Greg) in this film. <br /> <br /> But writing wasn't the worst part of this movie. About half an hour before the end, his mother dies, and when they show the tombstone the date of death is 1979. Having missed the beginning, I got the impression from the wardrobe that this happened in the 1980s. Not a leisure suit or a bell in sight. Too bad for the person who made the wardrobe for this movie! Don't get me wrong: all the clothes in this movie were beautiful, but they were completely wrong for that time. I almost wonder if they told the person in the wardrobe that it was a period piece. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: good for a laugh or to feed a correction to Jennie Garth. :)
