There isn't much on "Reckless" that seems right, starting with the sprawling title (thanks to screenwriter Craig Lucas, who adapted his show, bringing the title with him) and continuing with the casting (Mia Farrow playing wife to Tony Goldwyn, who is young enough to be his son). The couple lives in an idyllic winter world that seems to be the inside of a snow globe, but Farrow gets a surprising dose of reality after admitting he hired a man to kill her. She runs away into the night, taking refuge with a very strange couple who wants to help her rebuild her life. The design of the production and the artistic direction of "Reckless" are fine, but they are services rendered for a completely alien script, often alienating. It should be a dark holiday comedy, even if the cast is at a loss with this material that is not very honest, sometimes offensive. * 1/2 from ****
