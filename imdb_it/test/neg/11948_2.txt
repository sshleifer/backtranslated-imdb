There is only one word to define the whole film, that is: terrible. How "Mostly Martha" was redone is horrible. The film's title is terrible. The actors are horrible. And the idea of ​​combining good food and the United States is terrible. If you've seen "Bella Martha", well, this is the original title and means "Bella Martha", this is a punch in the stomach. Ms. Jones's acting is so scarce and unnatural that even Jessica Alba, considered one of the worst actresses (http://www.razzies.com/history/05nomActr.asp) would have done better. Not to mention the cook, who would do better to play a different role. And the child ... not worth mentioning. Bella Martha was a very beautiful, authentic film ... why was it redone? There was a story ... they pulled it out here. There is no story ... What will it represent? In a sense, this film was also perfect. Do you know when all the ingredients fit together? Well, this is the case here. A perfect crap ...
