Boring film Poor plot Poor actors. The film takes place in a room that is supposed to be in Morocco, but actually in some American city! The "Arab terrorists" are the patriots the blond patriot is the "Arab terrorist" ... DAMN! <br /> <br /> There is still something good about this movie (that's why the score is 2 out of 10). The director transforms the ridiculous stereotype about terrorism that the media feeds us every day in reality, terrorists are Americans (or Westerners if you want). <br /> <br /> The film is divided into two parts. The first part of the film is about the journey of the Dutch (15 seconds), while the second part concerns the overnight stay in the incredible dark brown room (1 hour and something like that). <br /> <br /> The Dutch boy will deliver money to Morocco for some "charity organization", he descends from the plain, takes the bus and ends up kidnapped in a dark brown room. He is kidnapped with another boy who is hit after saying "They won't shoot us". The Dutch survivor is forced to play chess with an Arab boy like Morpheus for so long that you will also learn to play chess! In the end the Dutch guy reveals his plot not because they took four fingers off him but because he is deceived by such a lame game you should watch the movie! <br /> <br /> Good when you're so tired I can't sleep
