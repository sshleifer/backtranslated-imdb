"Milo" is yet another answer to a question that no one has ever asked you. Do we really need other cuts? I think we already have more than enough. I imagine that the high professional boys have been overloaded so in this we will deal with a homicidal boy who is also a zombie or a ghost when he feels like it. A long time ago, he drowned but this does not bother him and he continues to kill people ("Friday the 13th", what is it?). One day, his survivors have a great reunion and as a surprise, Milo comes to visit her. Through some really bad shots showing everything but the murders, the cast is reduced until only the last girl is left to discover Milo's darkness, I mean the dark secret. She and her friends are dying to know. Once discovered, Milo continues another murderous fury (isn't it time to go to sleep yet?) And the girl, well, screams a lot. The acting is not even the bottom of the barrel, the barrel refuses to be associated with it. Milo can be a creepy bastard from time to time I give it to him, but some films cannot be saved without a free script or nudity.
