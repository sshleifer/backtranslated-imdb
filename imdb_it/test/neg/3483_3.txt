This film is a great stereotype. The acting (except Philbin and Harrison) is horrible and the horrid script makes things worse. I must say that I agree with another review that the "local" characters seem ridiculous, as do the "Caucasian" characters. 3 out of 10 stars for 1) Philbin 2) Harrison 3) surf scenes. (1/2 * on ****) Watch "Aloha Summer" (**) and / or "Beyond Paradise" (***) for well-made Hawaii, especially BP which I found fun and brilliant.
