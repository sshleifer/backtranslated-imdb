Talk about false advertising! I lost an hour and twenty-five minutes looking at this piece of shit and there was not a leisure suit, not a platform shoe, no fingertip dance, and not a single disco ball. I watched it one Saturday night and I had a terrible fever, but it had nothing to do with music. <br /> <br /> Seriously, with or without John Travolta, this film was sucked. <br /> <br /> From the opening scene you will be asking the question: "Where does that rope come from, and please hang me too?" From his brazen prejudice against the driving skills of the Pennsylvania Dutchmen, to the shameless promotion of the seemingly eternal abilities of Alienware laptop batteries, to the cheap horror effects directly raised by Japanese cinema, this is the worst movie for theater by The Grudge.
