This person is a so-called entertainer who must use swear words, vulgarity and slander to try to make others believe he has talent. I have often seen comics use a little of both with effect but when all that can be said is intertwined with it, it is a sign of a mind deformed by drugs. It makes me think of where his twisted and fried brain will be in some other year of abuse. Poor!!! I admit I couldn't see it all - too stupid for words. The incredible part of this is that someone really believes he is a philosopher !!! No wonder self-respect and decency are diminishing and perversity is increasing. Could it be that the UFC may have been a factor in its insensitive brain?
