Congratulations to Christina Ricci for making this film and putting her mojo behind this important subject and trying to make a great movie. Ricci is my favorite actress: she is so gifted, so natural, her reactions are perfect and so is the energy that constantly radiates, which gives credit to the term "star" often incorrectly applied. <br /> <br /> The film lacks its trademark for many different reasons, but perhaps in particular due to the apparent inability of the screen to make it a compelling narrative ... we'll talk about it later. The cast is excellent at first sight, but if you think about it, Jessica Lang as a Jewish mother is too Protestant and not quite right, Ann Hetch doesn't come close to showing the psychiatrist's compassion and dedication from the book, and when you make a movie, like can you justify saying no to Anne Heche and Jessica Lange? But the real problems are in the construction of the film: first in not provoking any kind of lasting understanding for the character of Elizabeth Wurtzle, and secondly for saying something meaningful about the too common and horrible situation in which this poor girl finds herself. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for the construction of the flashback, Lizzy appears as a teenager certainly more affected than most, but not as badly ill as it appears in the book. This is a big problem. This story had to be told from the beginning to the end and from the therapist's couch. She is only eight or nine years old when her depression starts because of devastating social factors, both in society and in the home, and this is a crucial point not only to elicit the right understanding for her, but also for the gravity of her case. He has such a talented and vulnerable and dissatisfied spirit so soon that his heart cannot help but reach it because of his victimization. This is missing in the film. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, you have to deal with what the film is trying to say: it's a biographical film about a severely affected girl, but it's also a film about a nation who can't get her act together; this is very clear in the book, but it is not interesting in the movie where the Harvard chosen ones are even more messed up than the normal college students. The film is finally unable to get one of these messages in a compelling way, and this is too bad. Is Prozac a good thing or a bad thing, or a mixed blessing or an apparent need in a country where so many people can't function without a chemical crutch? These are complex and challenging concepts to work with and writing does not actually attempt to address any of them in a more or less engaging way. The Challenger disaster is an interesting image to symbolize a dysfunctional America, but this does not have the effect supposedly due to crosscutting and the insufficient previous development of the control themes. <br /> <br /> Ricci's performances are tight and sincere, and one of the best of his acting career. <br /> <br /> Michele Williams is also superb in his role.
