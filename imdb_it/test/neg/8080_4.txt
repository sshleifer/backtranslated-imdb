** MAJOR SPOILERS ** Visible only for action sequences and not for the plot or acting "Nature Unleashed: Fire" has one of the longest and most heartbreaking endings in the history of modern cinema. We have the intrepid Ranger Jake, Bryan Genesse, who leads this trio of hysterical motorcyclists to safety at all levels of an explosive fumes that run down my well! This during a furious forest fire! It seems that Ranger Jake, with all his knowledge of the great outdoors, did not realize that a mine shaft leaking with dangerous and explosive methane gas is the last place to go when all the woods around him are on fire ! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER FROM THIS POINT ON *** All this started some time ago when Ranger Jake in an attempt to save the non on the ball miner Tiny, Chris Harz aka "The Sherd", leaves that slides through his fingers and fall to his death at the bottom of the mine shaft, or he did! Although we have been waiting for those who set the forest on fire for the first half of the film, it was no surprise that Tiny was the culprit! As you would expect in movies like these, Tiny seemed to be made of hardened steel as nothing had ever happened to him, fired explosions and impalements, could stop the mad miner. <br /> <br /> Before Tiny's reappearance, either Ranger Jake was involved in the rescue of bikers Chris Mel Sharon and Marcus, Josh Cohen Melanie Lewis Anastasia Griffith and Ross McCall, who were trapped in the woods with fires that they break around them. Having the usual I know it all, Marcus, among the bikers things are not as good as those that Ranger Jake wanted them to do. Marcus not only the eggs on the mild Chris to do something stupid, he jumps with his bicycle on a stack of 10-foot logs, but he has the boy breaking his leg. This makes it almost impossible for Ranger Jake to make Chris disappear the air before the fires burn out like his fellow bikers! <br /> <br /> For the rest of the film Ranger Jake, who has taken charge, makes boner after boner in his attempt to save himself and trapped and lost in the woods bikers! All of this ends with Jake's brilliant idea of ​​hiding in a dangerous and abandoned mine with the rescue team a few meters away from saving them if they stayed in the open and where the rescue team could find them! <br /> <br /> Although it should have been the life of the party, or of the movie, Tiny, despite all his efforts to be another indestructible super-criminal, came across a man who spent too much time out in the sun . The make-up work on Tiny was so outrageous that it seemed he had poured a jar of spaghetti sauce over his head instead of burning it to make it crunchy. <br /> <br /> Ranger Jake came across some naive or retarded in his being so caught up in the dangerous Tiny in always trying to save the unleashed psychopath who never hid his feelings about what he had in mind for the Forest Ranger rules game. In fact Ranger Jake actually encouraged Tiny to do both him and the bikers by showing him how incompetent he was in trying to save them. The fact that Ranger Jake was successful was not because he was so smart, but because Tiny, despite his indestructibility, was so brainless!
