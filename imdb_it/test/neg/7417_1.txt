It definitely looks like the "amateur" time. How come this piece of junk has ever been released is beyond me: acting, history, characters, seemingly special effects, etc ... it's all wrong. Why Lance Henriksen has accepted it will remain one of the great mysteries of cinema. Maybe he was in desperate need of money or maybe he was under the influence of some illegal drug. <br /> <br /> It's useless trying to explain what this movie is about. This is the legend of the big foot but made in the worst possible way. In fact, this smells like a direct release to the video. <br /> <br /> Avoid ALL the costs! 0 * out of 10 *
