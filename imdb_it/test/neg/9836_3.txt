A young man, named Danny, ran away from home and meets a tramp by the name of Bix, who agrees to tag along with Danny and pay attention to him ... and his money. They end up in a small town where they meet Carrie, a shy and naive girl who works in her father's restaurant. Bix starts to see Carrie but has plans to leave early (because he's a tramp, see? It's not good, do you understand?). Meanwhile, the creep of the city, Jesse (played by a perfect Jack Elam), continues to show up at the restaurant and annoy Carrie. Danny continues to inadvertently take the whores right and left (because he is laden with money ?? he has almost a hundred dollars!) That Bix must continually chase away (there are a lot of ambiguous gay nuances between Danny and Bix in this film). In the end, Bix and Danny decide to leave the city, but the trouble is unleashed, because of Jesse the creep. <br /> <br /> My review of the film itself: a terrible, dated "50s Troubled Youth" movie. <br /> <br /> My review of the MST3K version of the film: I must say that this is one of the best MST3K episodes ever. Riffing is permanent, always. Except for the somewhat downbeat ending, this film is an easy material for Joel and the Bots, particularly for Danny's constant detours that Bix must save from him. The host segments are also quite good, especially the "Train Song" segment. I hope Rhino publishes this episode on home video one day.
