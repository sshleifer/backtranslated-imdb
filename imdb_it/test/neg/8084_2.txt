This film is one of the worst I've ever seen. Even being a hangover didn't help. The plot is bad, if it exists. The relatively large number of beautiful girls cannot help. I imagine that seeing an episode of temptation isolates with the sound turned on would give the same kind of experience. DO NOT watch this movie
