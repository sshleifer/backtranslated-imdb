I can't understand how lazy the director is with this movie. Instead of creating scenes in a creative way, he relies on boring old zombie clich√©s. <br /> <br /> Where the two unarmed leaders have to go down the college steps in the van surrounds them with zombies but neither of the two protagonists is bitten. He can't be bothered to direct a decent fight scene, so we see that the cables slide down the steps. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the zombies limp and in others they run like the wind. This is really convenient for the director because he can create whatever he likes without worrying about the continuity of zombie behavior. <br /> <br /> With careful planning and much more inspiration this film could have been much better.
