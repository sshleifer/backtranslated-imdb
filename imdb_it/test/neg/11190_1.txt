A man kicks a 2 'dog in the air. <br /> <br /> A woman kicks a cow from her bed. <br /> <br /> A man kicks a violin on the sidewalk. <br /> <br /> A woman sucks a statue's finger for 15 seconds. <br /> <br /> A man kicks a blind man in the stomach. <br /> <br /> Jesus violates a young girl. <br /> <br /> Here it is. I just saved you an hour of your life. Surely there are those to whom this "shocking avant-garde of cinematographic expression" would appeal. But I didn't find it different from the puerile and disconnected videos I used to shoot with my friends in the 9th grade. Except we never had a real cow. <br /> <br /> After listening to endless sermons from artists who caress the beard about what a film this important is, I thought it would be worth it. Make no mistake, this is shit. If I hear another person call Bu単uel the "father of cinematic surrealism", I think I'll punish someone. If nothing else, he took a big step back from the pioneering surrealist beginnings of his elders Fritz Lang (Metropolis), F.W. Murnau (Faust) and Robert Weine (Caligari) 10 years earlier. This made a joke on the whole thing, as if Bu単uel didn't have the certainty of truly embracing art with sarcasm, without absurdity. It would take another forty years before Bu単uel perfected his style in something admirable. Skip the first few things and jump straight to 1970 if you want to be more impressed by his work. I'm sure he would agree. In 1977, Bu単uel himself declared that he would happily burn all the footprints of his old movies. In this case I would be happy to pour the lighter liquid.
