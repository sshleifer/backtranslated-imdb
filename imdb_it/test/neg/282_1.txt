Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) meets Danny Ocean and his team and asks them to repay the money they have stolen (in Oceans 11) plus interest. However, he restrains himself from the violent action while under the instruction of the greatest thief in the world, the Night Fox. The team must then pull off a series of robberies to pay back Benedetto while testing his skills against the Night Fox who wishes to maintain his position as the greatest thief ever. Put simply, this film is a complete mess. The masses could argue that it is "cool" and that Clooney and Pitt have done great shows, but these are the same people who have a subscription to "Hello" magazine and think that David Beckham has the potential to be a great actor. The plot is complicated, not complex or intelligent and has no curves and intelligent contours, it is just a complete disaster that spreads in multiple directions with the hope that the public will think that it is beautiful and intelligent (readers of the Hello magazine). Any observer of the respectable movie will still see the film for the farce that it is. While Oceans 11 wasn't a great movie, it had a decent pace, it was elegant and had some decent twists. This film loses its way very quickly and therefore basically gives up. It's like the director and the cast were saying to each other, hey this isn't working, just let's laugh! In fact the cast seems to be enjoying themselves but I don't. I will not delve into the plot because its confused evolution does not guarantee any examination. The addition of Catherine Zeta Jones is largely annoying. The scenes in which Julia Roberts personifies (with Bruce Willis playing a cameo role) while it's slightly funny seems to be a desperate move to keep the audience interested. The film is so full of holes in the plot that it's like Arnie has emptied a 9mm Uzi in the movie studio. The credit can only be given to some scenes in which the Night Fox uses Caopeira to carry out a robbery against the flip side of funky music, but this is hardly justifiable to watch the film. The final scene presents the team in a senseless drunken astonishment; this accurately summarizes the film. Stay with the original.
