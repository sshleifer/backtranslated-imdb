The Evil that Men Do (1984) was one of the few non-Cannon films made by Charlie Bronson in the 1980s. Unlike most of Cannon's films starring Charlie, this wasn't funny or fun. Charlie basically tortures and brutalizes people for over an hour and a half. If you thought you were Mr. Emotion first, wait until you see it! <br /> <br /> In this, Charlie travels to an unnamed Central American country and shows the population that anyone who has problems with Chuck or his people must pay the piper. This is not fun. It is not cheese or campy, just brutal, sadistic and not in a positive sense. <br /> <br /> I didn't like this. I have no love for this movie. No recommendation because it's not worth watching. Maybe if they hadn't cut him off. Watch with caution. <br /> <br /> Don't disturb yourself.
