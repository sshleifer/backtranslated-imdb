This is not a good movie. It is a proven remake of the English film "The Hitch". But he insults the original one. This film is certainly not a film expected of a veteran director like "David Dhawan" who is credited as a director of films like "Raja Babu", "Coolie No.1", "Hero No. 1" ... < br /> <br /> The main theme of this film is taken from "The Hitch" with some changes in order to attract the Indian public, but somehow the plot and the script are not convincing enough. Also the acting from the main roles, Salman Khan and Govinda, is pitiful. They seem to need the least provocation to take off their shirts to reveal their bare chest. I do not consider this fascinating and even less comical. What was the director thinking? Added to this, viewers must support the Govinda Over-acting case. It was simply unbearable. I RECOMMEND VISITORS TO SEE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. My rating of 2 for this film could be considered very generous. <br /> <br /> Instead I would advise the spectators to watch the English film "Hitch" which is much better.
