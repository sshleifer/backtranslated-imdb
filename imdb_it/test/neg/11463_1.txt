I realize that many people do not know who Solomon Kane is and that the film is presented to a much wider audience. So why bother calling it "Solomon Kane" first when the name has no commercial value? The characters certainly have NOTHING to do with R.E. Howard character. Except he has a big hat. That's where the similarity ends. <br /> <br /> It is always a bad sign when a superhero / fantasy / science fiction movie focuses on a story of origins, but when you invent an entire fabric like this for a character that doesn't have If it has one, you have already completely lost the point. Kane is no longer even the fanatical Christian warrior of stories, but rather a former villain who is trying to save his soul (this part is in the opening scene). <br /> <br /> With the most basic elements changed or simply ignored, the use of the name Solomon Kane is simply a source of perplexity. Is this how they can say "From Conan's creator" and hope to enter a budding franchise if the new movie "Conan" takes off? Ignoring the complete departure from the stories, the film is competent if completely generic for the first half but then turns into pure stupidity in the climatic scene that involves more super villains (think three "boss levels" at the same time), none of which is the less interesting or threatening. <br /> <br /> If I wasn't a fan of Kane who was disappointed that they completely ignored the starting material, I would probably give the movie a 3 or 4 instead of a 1 Even for most viewers who will come to to know anything about Kane, it's a pretty thin jelly.
