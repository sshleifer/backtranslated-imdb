As the other guy said Sux, you can count the words that were said in that entire movie about one of your hands, Too naked, became naked 7 or 8 times in a half, well beyond the nakedness you have I will find a porn movie behind that movie, he filmed all his film for a long time, bad acting, bad story, bad language, Carmen was swearing all through the movie, so you come out of that movie, pornographic scenes and dirty language, to many gaps in the film, a great silence every now and then The only positive thing in that film is the beautiful places where they were filmed, otherwise it's an hour and a half of your life that you'll lose yourself if I see that movie Good luck It's really Sux
