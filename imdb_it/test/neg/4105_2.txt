This film was really ugly, clear and simple. The way a film like this gets a big spread is a marvel to me. <br /> <br /> It's a decent idea, but it didn't work out. Edward Burns is a decent actor. I liked his little role in Saving Private Ryan. <br /> <br /> We come to the big problem here. <br /> <br /> The images were so incredibly bad, I was thinking of watching an old "3D Dinosaur" CDROM point-and-click adventure demo on Windows 3.1 I mean, I saw scenes cut in the pre games -2000 who have more beautiful dinosaurs than this. I mean, hell ... the original T-Rider T-Rex looked better than this. <br /> <br /> Lizard monkeys were ridiculous. I thought they were a kind of ripoff creation from "Killer Instinct" I saw puppet monsters just now that I think about it. <br /> <br /> You know, there's a lot of TV movie facts that are better than this. How does a jewel like Scifi channels "The Shining" have such a small audience, but this load of "CGI, easy to do 4 Kidz" is put on display? I don't care if it's a Ray Bradbury story. Lameeeee
