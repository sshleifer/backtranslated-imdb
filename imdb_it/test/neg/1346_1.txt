This film is not a comedy. It's not even funny in the department "this movie is so bad it's fun". Rather, it is simply ugly. Other reviewers mention bad lighting, but beyond that there is an abundance of bad plastic surgery. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a lot of great acting talents have been wasted on a bad script and uninspired direction. The main characters are one-dimensional and boring. (It is difficult to feel sympathy for any of them). It is also difficult to see the four characters as close friends. It just looks like a group of women put together, pretending to be close. <br /> <br /> I will not list all the problems of this film, as it does not deserve much attention from anyone. (Nor is it worth the time it takes to watch it).
