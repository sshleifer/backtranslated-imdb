This film shows what you can create if you have a camera, paint and replacement carton, a toy ship, some friends who have performed in a community theater and the wrong idea that you can make a movie. The end result is an elusive waste of time to skip, unless you remove it from the DVD player and do it first through the window. <br /> <br /> Acting in the opening scene (in particular the roundabout Lee Morgan as "Captain") and the toy ship "crashing" between the rocks before the credits is a good indicator of what you are doing (with all the foam, it seems that this "special effect" was shot in a kitchen sink, I guess Boyette thought he'd save some money by washing the dishes at the same time). As for the ugly cinema, the funny thing is that "Dungeon of Harrow" seems to have inspired (perhaps coincidentally) the final twist of "Manos: The Hands of Fate". Yes, it's the same lame "I was the victim, and now I take the place of the evil villain" ironic ending. The biggest irony is that two inept, unskilled, filmmakers could make two equally miserable horror films, films in Texas and get away with it. <br /> <br /> The monotonous nerd Russ Harvey is a nobleman in a large family (because they were great he is never confronted), boring us as we mourn the death of his family line and crest it before his ship it also crashed (we're also dealing with a whirring narrative throughout the film). Unfortunately we are not so lucky. His family's toy ship crashes into polystyrene in a sink, and is washed ashore with his inflated captain and a woman, comfortably deposited on an island of the mad count. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the Count is visited by an evil spirit who, dressed in a Blackstone Magic Kit, attacks him with various puppets (spiders, snakes, bats ... all icky things). The Count (William McNulty) outperforms Shatner and has a visibly difficult time maintaining a straight face through the typical ranting of a madman. I would be angry too if I were to be in this disaster. The woman is promptly killed by the count's ferocious dogs and the two idiots are captured by her servant. The Count accuses them of being pirates (apparently his worst fear), slaps his servant around (apparently his greatest joy), Fatboy is tortured, there is a woman who is a maid and one who is a nurse, the putrefied leper - a Contessa wedding dress in the dungeon (digs Nerdy Noble and is the only effective and gruesome thing in the film), a lot of inanimate dialogue at a dining room table, the Captain's whiner he is killed while making a pathetic escape (trying to watch a laziness fight a pack of lions). . . it's all a bad mist for me. I spent most of my time on the fast forward button. <br /> <br /> In any case, the angry nobleman and nurse make a run and think that they will be saved by three boys in a rowboat on the lake (yes, we should believe that a lake is the ocean) . They don't, since the nerd's hair has turned gray and scares off potential rescuers. Honestly, I think they just took the opportunity to get away from this horrible movie while they had the chance. They return to the castle, the nurse begins to rot like the Countess (and your stomach at this hour), and we end up with these two who are preparing to descend into the. . . DUNGEON OF HARROW !!!! Blech! <br /> <br /> I love old, horrible horror films, but they must have some sort of entertainment value. I feel ripped off, even at a low low price of $ 5.99 for this cookie. The Mystery Science Theater would have had difficulty making it fun. I was greeted by some crazy reviewers who claimed that this film had an atmosphere and some gruesome moments. Mistaken! Avoid this tripe at all costs, and don't waste even a dollar if you find it in a dollar basket somewhere. This film makes "The Terror" by Corman a true masterpiece of horror and atmosphere.
