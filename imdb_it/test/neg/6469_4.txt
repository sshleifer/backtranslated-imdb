this movie was not good. I thought it would be a cute Disney movie just like the original. mistaken. it was embarrassing for Christina Ricci, who I expect a lot more than this, one could simply say by looking. I think doug e. Doug did the best he could. sit in front of a 5 year old child and they could start falling asleep.
