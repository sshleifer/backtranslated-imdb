... this is not worth the cost of a movie ticket. What these filmmakers have done cannot properly be called filmmaking; rather, they have just chosen sixteen students of a certain diversity (though not as many diversities as the reviews have suggested) and have freed them. The results are, to be brutally frank, much more often boring, self-indulgent, exaggerated and blatantly grabbed than the truly insightful ones. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, moments of recognition and identification of the type possible only in the documentary, but overall there is not much more truth here than in "Bully" or, for that matter, a discreet documentary TV of the same type. Although full of speeches about sex, sexual diversity and racism, the film brings nothing to the table that will be useful to anyone who has seriously thought about any of these problems. And although some segments have absolutely no purpose whatsoever other than injecting some comic relief (certainly welcome), most often the five-minute limit still doesn't get emotionally involved with any of the students. An interesting idea, but thumbs down for CAMERA.
