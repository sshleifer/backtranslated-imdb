No no no no no no no! This is not a movie, this is an excuse to show people dancing. This is not good. Even the dance is slow and not half as fun as the mediocre 'Dirty Dancing', not to mention other good dance films. <br /> <br /> Is it a love story? Is it a musical? Is it a drama? Is it a comedy? It's not that this film is anything, it's that this movie fails in everything it tries to be. The film turns out to be even more insignificant as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible on every side, the script is certainly trying to tell us something about the relationship, but fails miserably. <br /> <br /> WATCH THE MOMENT - When Patrick Stewart comes on the scene and you think the film could improve while it cheers up the boring atmosphere. For a second.
