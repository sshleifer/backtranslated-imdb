George Sluizer of THE VANISHING fame (he realized both the disturbing European original and the Hollywood remake) directed CRIMETIME. He should not be blamed for this confused and poor film, because all the problems are in the screenplay by Brendan Somers. He is poorly focused and written lazily. For example, the killer wanders around a nightclub waiting to collect a victim, a victim and starts talking to a teenage girl. Go to the next scene where he tells the bad guy "Did I tell you everything about me, tell me about your life?" Unfortunately the girl told the villain her life story off screen and is a terrible example of how the writer is unable to bring a character to life through dialogue. I know for sure that it's damn hard, but for a script produced the writer should have tried more <br /> <br /> It's difficult to explain the message of the film. At one point he seems to be trying to be a British NATURAL BORN KILLERS who satirizes the voyeurism of the media with crime (maybe even influenced the infamous MANHUNT video game) but the script is not witty enough to carry it forward. When you have a sex scene that does not progress in the plot or in the characters or in the subtext you know that you have a poorly written script and CRIMETIME is a poorly written script.
