For me this film is essentially like a pilot feature film for a TV series. It reminds me in particular of the British remake of the TV series Wallander, with Kenneth Brannagh. The people interviewed by the police are as resistant and often bitter as the weather, the principal investigator has enormous family problems, the investigations invariably lead to cruelty of the distant past, and the plot is labyrinthine with strange happenings and subplots that make sense only at the end. Both have excellent photography. <br /> <br /> The tracking of Jar City resembles a series of standard crimes in the United Kingdom or the United States. Indeed you could take the plots of any of the Touch of Frost episodes and transplant them to the top of the desolate setting in this movie and have an effective following. <br /> <br /> The script really couldn't be more obviously from the cookie cutter. You also get the most familiar reasons, like the police going to the local prison to interview a manipulative and dangerous psychopath, which inevitably explodes at the end of the interview. <br /> <br /> I am absolutely convinced that this is scones and jam for many people, but I feel that it needs to point out to people like me who don't go to the cinema to watch television. What I felt was an acute lack of message. The film focuses on genetic studies in Iceland. Icelanders in genetic terms have remained largely isolated from the outside world, presenting a great opportunity for scientists to study their genetics. Much information regarding population inheritance has been retained and many unique genetic diseases in Iceland can be effectively tracked down in a population that has refrained from crossover, and is remarkably genetically homogeneous (it's like trying to put together a puzzle of the London Underground Map, instead of a puzzle of a field of daisies). A company called deCODE genetics attempted to create a database containing all the genetic and hereditary information for the entire Icelandic population. Due to privacy issues this project was interrupted and at the end of last year the deCODE genetics failed in Iceland. The episode is a topic full of debate. <br /> <br /> But in this film genetics and medical science are not there for education, they are there for a strange atmosphere. <br /> <br /> It is a scary movie if you are interested in this, and there is often a morbid concentration on food to accompany the events, like a coroner who eats lunch between incisions. The most nauseating for me was when the chief inspector devoured a sheep's head. Unfortunately for me this has become occasionally farcical. The film attempts the rather delicate task of mixing the sentimental macabre and ends up providing an involuntary humor towards the end. This is the equivalent, in cinematic terms, of the attempt to prepare fugu, if you are not well qualified, skilled and pungent, you poison the client. This rather novice director should have lowered the rate of his performance. <br /> <br /> I came out of this movie feeling rather bad for myself and for life in general.
