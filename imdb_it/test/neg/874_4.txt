Not really a bomb? The only thing missing was enriched uranium. In reality the script "could" have worked if the main roles were played by younger actors, but the drama of a Diane Lane acting like a teenager (or even a twenty) was too much to bear. Whenever she (Adrienne) jumped into Richard Gere's arms and then pulled both heels up behind her, you could almost see the grimace of pain on her face as she was probably thinking, "Oh, my aching back .. "Well, of course, it doesn't weigh more than 125 pounds!" However, both characters were definitely unpredictable, especially those of Richard Gere: a self-absorbed plastic surgeon (Dr. Paul Flanner) who was in some sort of " soul search "after a failed operation left him with a dead patient (an older woman from a small farm). Then there was the husband and the angry son he had to deal with to explain what had happened. Dr. Flanner is on the way to meet the angry husband (at the request of her husband) when he meets Adrienne. She was recently separated from her unfaithful husband (shock) and is helping a friend look at her beach cottage. Sure, that's where Dr. Flanner ends up and they are both in love with MADLY (especially after finding out that he's a rich doctor and a plastic surgeon). Between romantic interludes and a nauseating song / dance that Lane (Adrienne) plays while listening to an old LP (without a CD?), They both try to understand how their lives were so totally wrong. Even Dr. Flanner was not very father and he has a son (who is also a doctor) who resents having not been there for him while he was growing up. (Of course, Dr. Flanner was more interested in his medical career than raising an impetuous and distracting boy). To make a short (predictable) story, Adrienne helps Dr. Flanner confront his inner demons and confront the angry husband and son of the woman who died on his operating table (after taking a "routine" of removing the cyst of the face). Dr. Flanner is finally able to tell her husband (played atrociously sympathetic by Scott Glenn) that he is sorry for what happened, even though it was all that anesthesiologist's fault. "I told him she was too old for that juice!" Glenn's character (Robert Torrelson) seems to accept Dr. Flanner's apology. It's hard to say why his emotional response is so passive right now that you wonder if he's not even listening to the good doctor or if you think of some cultivated area that needs to be plowed. Increasingly circumspect, Dr. Flanner decides to visit his son (who now practices pro-bono medicine in a third world country) to repair their relationship. Unfortunately, this means that he must temporarily grant adieu to Adrienne. Of course, while entertaining the natives in Timbuktu, he writes a love letter every hour of the hour to Adrienne (who almost faints like a schoolgirl every time she receives one) and tells her that the hardest thing she ever had to do was say goodbye Evidently, apologizing to Robert Torrelson for the death of his wife was the second most difficult thing. In the end he is killed in a mud trick (poetic justice as in the mud pack?) And he remains alone with the memories of what could have been ... we hope there are no more sequel to Gere / Lane!
