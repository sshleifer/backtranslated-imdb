Savage Guns (title of the video) is a cheap dirt at the end of the spaghetti western barrel in which the survivor of a massacre hunts the bandits who killed his brother and left him dead, reaching him in a city controlled by their crooked leader. <br /> <br /> Despite a lot of violence, this manages to be both boring and colorless with bad characterizations and almost without imagination or humor. <br /> <br /> The protagonist Robert Woods lives up to his name with a wooden and non-charismatic performance that fails to generate warmth or sympathy of any kind. In other words, the viewer never really has roots for him despite being the protagonist. <br /> <br /> The worst scene (in my opinion) is the annoying dance hall scene where a woman sings heavily and terribly unexploded German. It was the worst scene in Blazing Saddles and the worst here!
