I have 10 computer games older than years with better special effects! The plot is unstable and very predictable. Most actors seem extra inexperienced! All have Scottish accents. It's like watching a bunch of "Tre Scotties" from Star Trek without personality or charm. Unnecessary scenes of people putting up tents! Tents with all the supposedly high-tech equipment! The actors didn't seem to be sure the camera was on them. Nothing to worry about whether these people survive or not! It looks like it was made in the backyard and in someone's garage with low-end equipment! Nothing seems original or even slightly fun. Do not waste your time!
