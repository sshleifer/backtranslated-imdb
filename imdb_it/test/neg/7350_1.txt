Free Willzyx (name / title Stupidest ever) is the worst episode of ANY of the TV shows I watch, including X-Files, Alias, All 3 Orders and Laws, All CSI, Families, Simpsons, Chappelle's Show , Colbert Report and more. South Park has long been my favorite comedy show because of its incredibly obscene content and disquieting black comedy. Free Willzyk has NO ONE of the contents I mentioned before. He was so meek, so inoffensive that he could very well have been an episode of Sesame Street. Kyle goes to Sea World, where some of the workers make a joke about him, making him think that a whale is talking to him. EXPLAIN THE BEACH, REALITY IS THE BEFIZIA. Hello? This is South Park! the same show that brought you "Canceled", "Chickenlover", "Strikes the fan", "Death Camp Of Tolerance" and many more! Not SpongeBob SquarePants! Ugh. Actually I saw the whole episode, which is 30 minutes of my life, I will never come back. Anyway, I was extremely disgusted by this episode and can't believe the shocking decline in the quality of Matt & Trey's work.
