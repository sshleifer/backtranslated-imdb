According to "Lucien Rebatet" in his "Histoire de la Musique" (Robert Lafont, BOUQUINS 1973, page 338), the character of Beethoven was not very compatible with women. He had a good number of "Platonic Passions" with female members of the "Viennese Aristocracy" to whom he dedicated some "sonatas". But the musicians, even the composers, did not qualify for "Belle ladies" Husbands. Haydn was a "servant" of Prinz Von Esterhazy, Mozart died from drinking or Poison and Bethoven was according to Rebatet a regular customer of "street prostitutes" in Vienna. A British biographer, Newman, says that Beethoven contracted syphilis before he was 40 years old. That he had become deaf because of this, it is possible, but it is not certain. <br /> <br /> The Ninth Symphony was awarded on 7 May 1824 at the Kärntnertortheater in Vienna, together with the consecration of the Overture house and the first three parts of the Missa Solemnis. This was the composer's first appearance on the stage in twelve years; the room was packed. Although the performance was directed by Michael Umlauf, the theater Kapellmeister, Beethoven shared the stage with him in silence. <br /> <br /> So what remains of this "female fantasy". The interpretation and characterization of Ed Harris are quite good, but too linear, based on the painting by Ferninand Waldmüller of 1823. I have it in front of me. Show a man who despises (perhaps hates) the world. With good reason
