I'm a big fan of sleaze and horror movies, when you put them together this is my weak point: horrible sleaze. However, you will not find it in this film. <br /> <br /> There is certainly a fandonia, in the form of kidnapped and tortured girls, tied naked to various things. The sleaze is not very shabby, though. He didn't register very high on my distance meter, mainly because none of the girls was less attractive, nor did they try to behave as if they were even threatened. It seemed that they were thinking more about what it was for lunch, or maybe when they could score some cracks. <br /> <br /> Forget the effects, they were extremely weak. The lameness was favored by bad acting; the effects are more difficult to believe when even the actors and actresses are not buying them. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was pretty bad, they could have hired a couple of cameramen from a porn movie and done better. In fact, this could have increased the scarcity factor enough to make it enjoyable. As it is, there are many dark ones in which you cannot see very clearly, and what you see is not too good. <br /> <br /> The horror factor is zero. Null. Zero. Nada. ZIP. Zilch. I've seen children's movies that were scarier. There is not even a field here. It's just a movie that tries to be incredibly dreary, but it doesn't even come close.
