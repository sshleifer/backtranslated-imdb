I haven't seen this movie in years, but the terrible "taste" of Quaid's performance is still on my tongue. Some have commented on how Quaid has Jerry Lee Lewis "for a tee", but the fact is that he only seems to have Jerry's most extreme stage in mind. No one acts this way all the time, and the performance presents itself as hopelessly antics, reducing Lewis to a funny caricature. The nuances of a man's life are lost in the rubble of pure over-action. <br /> <br /> The author of the book on which it is based (Nick Tosches) is a good writer, who has written several beautiful musical bios (I particularly liked "Dino" on Dean Martin); in the Tosches books he gives us a complete human being, both separate and involved in the "biz". Quaid's acting seems to imply that Jerry never acted like a human being. If people were like that, no one would bother to bypass them. As cartoons go, it's slightly fun, but otherwise it's one of the most striking, destroying the films I had the honor of seeing. Terrible...
