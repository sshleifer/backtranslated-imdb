This film is sometimes a wild 80s student sex comedy, others a sweet and romantic one ... Then it has moments of dramatic drama and then bursts into flashes of science fiction ... Its almost ridiculous is so irregular. <br /> <br /> But I would hardly classify it as one of the worst movies I've ever seen, except of course because they chose Peter O'Toole. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing to do for him working with here. Poor dialogue, poor performance to work with, poor everything ... Yet it is fantastic ... There is nothing good on his part and yet it makes it work even with pure charm. <br /> <br /> The fact that he was so able to accomplish so much with so little shines a spotlight on how greatly all others in this film have failed, making it look even worse than I suppose is actually ... <br /> <br /> If any other actor were in the role of O'Toole, I would have forgotten this movie like shit and never thought of it again, but a good performance by Peter O'Toole despite all the odds ensures that I will remember this movie for a long time It's time to come ... If only as a film that, perhaps, could have been good if someone involved in it were almost half as good as Peter O'Toole.
