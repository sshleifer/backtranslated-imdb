My friends and I have just finished seeing a preview of this new Australian movie. Everyone who was in the cinema agreed, what was the point of this film? There was no good story to follow, the characters were not developed and the plot seemed unmotivated. I find it bizarre that this film, which probably cost over millions, has been funded and implemented. It is of no use to the theater community, it adds nothing to the palette of Australian cinema. It was really a waste of time creating this drastic piece of non-emotional work and more time should be devoted to job-shopping scripts and creating good stories, not creating a mess like this. Hugo Weaving and Rose Byrne were OK but severely hampered by a bad script. Pia Miranda's character was not necessary and abstract with respect to the plot, and her lines were average at best. A real waste of talent. The saving grace was the cinematography of Geoffrey Simpson ACS, which like most Australian films, was superb. <br /> <br /> Come on guys, think about it next time, please. <br /> <br /> 4/10
