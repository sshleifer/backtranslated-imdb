Dark Harvest is a very low budget production made by a group of amateurs who manage to become a sort of semi-professional film. Unfortunately the negative effects, the wooden acting and the non-original story make this mediocre horror slasher to the fullest. In no way is Dark Harvest the worst horror film I've ever seen, it's nothing special and has nothing in it to guarantee a second watch or hope for a sequel. You know that a director has doubts about his horror film when a) there is some useless nudity and b) the film is so short that they add some rather boring outtakes to the end credits that nobody really cares about because the film wasn't like that beautiful! A slightly better film that I can't help feeling was the inspiration for Dark Harvest is the 1980s movie 'Scarecrows' which is an OK movie but still quite mediocre. <br /> <br /> Dark Harvest isn't as bad as some of the other comments say it is but you don't think you'll have much fun. One thing I must also comment on is the character of Angela who has a really terrible English accent! What was the point in this ?! Perhaps to give it a certain touch of class? Yeah, for sure! The British DO NOT say "WAAHTAAH" when they mean "water" and I don't care which part of England they come from! If you can't find a real English actress or a non-English actress who can wear a bright English accent (not many of them), then DON'T! Sheesh! Final score: 4/10
