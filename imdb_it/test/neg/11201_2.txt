Has it ever happened to you? I go to my local video store and see some new arrivals in the "film noir" section. I spy on a copy of a new arrival of a film I've never seen called NAKED ALIBI. It is from one of those video mailing companies that it offers (mostly) duplicate copies in search of hard-to-find titles. The description on the box looks good. The film has players that I like (Sterling Hayden, Gloria Grahame and Gene Barry). So I take it home and look at it. About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts. About halfway through the film I started not to like it. When the film ended, not only did I not like it, I despised it. The film opens with the policemen questioning Al Willis on charges of theft. Besides being drunk, the police have nothing on him. When he pushes a policeman and asks to be able to go home, the policemen beat him. Detective Conroy arrives, lets the cops finish the beating and then announces that Willis is in the clear. Willis swears to take revenge. Later one of the police officers is killed. Without further evidence that Willis is "sore" from the beating, Conroy makes Willis his only suspect, despite the fact that his boss calls a couple of mobsters as suspects. Conroy arrests him, but for lack of evidence Willis is released. The next day two more policemen are killed by a bomb. This time Conroy goes to the Bakery that owns Willis and tries to defeat a confession from him. Conroy doesn't know, but a local journalist whose newspaper accused the Conroy department of police brutality takes a picture of Conroy trying to strangle Willis and Conroy. But Conroy continues his research and Willis flees to Mexico where Willis has a lover. Conroy manages to convince his lover (which Willis treats rather roughly) to help him prove that Willis is a murderer. What this film lacks is a convincing script. The script seems to have been written only as a rough draft and the shooting started before a script was completed. Things happen, the characters' personalities change, the twists and turns occur without a real reason other than the one required by the script. Apart from the fact that Willis likes to tip a glass now and not, there is nothing in the first part of the film that makes us think he is a crazy killer who cheats on his wife. He treats his wife, his son and the employees well. At the beginning of the film, one gets the impression that his Conroy is the one who is a loose cannon. It seems to casually endorse police brutality. Conroy, for no reason, is convinced from the beginning that Willis has been a criminal. It appears to operate on the motto of the old Bulgarian communist secret police; "Everyone is guilty of something, we haven't discovered yet." Later Conroy shows kindness to Al's lover and his young son, now we should like him. Sorry! The first impression I had of Conroy blocked me for too long. And he's also a stupid cop. Only after being fired and going to Mexico, he performs a basic check on Willis and discovers that a warrant has been issued for him in Maryland. Why didn't he think of it before? Because this film had not consumed enough time. The cast is good. Gene Barry does well considering how ill-conceived his role as Al Willis is. I'm a big fan of police thrillers from the 40s and 50s, but not only didn't I think this movie was good, it left a bad taste in my mouth (which is what many modern movies do, but older films rarely do it ).
