While it's one of the two Tales of Voodoo Volume 1 movies, there's nothing voodoo or anything supernatural! The box labels it "Hell Hole" but the title of the screen is Fuga da Hell Hole. The title is confusingly similar to Hell Hole (1978) aka "Escape from the hell of women" A group of women bathes in a river and apparently the worst thing they have to worry about is a tom that peeps out, which easily overwhelm. No nudity in this or any other scene, however. <br /> <br /> A woman named Cardena gets in a car and seems to be known and loved by all women. Invite Indri to come and live in the city with her and her uncle M.G. Once there, it becomes clear that M.G. wants to take the virginity of Indri. M.G. he runs a sort of prostitution house, and is responsible for a corrupt branch of the army, or runs paramilitary equipment, or prefers his guards to wear all military-style uniforms. <br /> <br /> Women who reject it or otherwise cause problems are put in prison. Indri is sent there. Women are tortured and sometimes raped by guards. <br /> <br /> Several failed escape or rescue attempts are made, but inevitably fail despite the obvious advantages women have: there are far more guards and relatively few guards have automatic weapons - most have semiautomatic rifles or pistols. <br /> <br /> WIP fans may like it, and the fact that it was done in the Philippines gives it some news, but otherwise ... eh.
