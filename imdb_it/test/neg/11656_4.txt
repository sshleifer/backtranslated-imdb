This was included on the "Shorts: Volume 2" record - a rather boring collection of short films. The shorts are among my favorite films, but somehow the people who assembled this second collection had difficulty finding quality content - and they weren't nearly as good as the first volume or other short film collections. <br /> <br /> This short film seems sadly incomplete. There is a story, but so unanswered that the viewer, like me, feels a little neglected and dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a woman, her boyfriend and her Westie (who is a dog, by the way) going to a lonely beach. The lady speaks with an accent that, at times, is a little difficult to follow. Since I'm hard to hear, I certainly would have liked it if it had been subtitled. Anyway, the boy takes a swim while she jumps. When he wakes up, his dog is gone. She panics and makes the boy follow her in search of the dog. They spend most of their time arguing and being unpleasant. Then, suddenly, they stop for sex. Later, they find the dog - the end of the story. <br /> <br /> As for the characters, both seemed rather dysfunctional and unpredictable. She was a demanding and demanding lady and seemed to despise her. When you wondered why they were together, their little sexual interruption showed what connection held them together. <br /> <br /> Some might like characterizations - I continued to find irritating and unreal people - more like caricatures than people might meet or know. Moreover, the gain for all this is not worth the wait (unless you want to see the naked guy).
