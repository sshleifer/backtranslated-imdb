The Jaws is the most shabby of all Italian "genres", and director Joe D'Amato is second only to the great Jess Franco in the production of trash films. Put the two together and what do you get? A giant piece of garbage, of course. Unfortunately it is not rubbish in the good sense of the term, since Deep Blood offers more boredom than not with hilarity. To the credit of the film, he actually tries something that borders on a plot; but to take credit for the film - the plot is rubbish. It has something to do with a group of friends who take an oath (of friendship) and then an Indian curse that manifests itself in a shark. Or at least I think that's what was happening. However, most of the film is enriched by boring dialogues and "drama", and the same shark - which does not forget, is the only thing we really want to see - is found in a cameo role. Or even that since most of the shark is actually stock material! Despite being a garbage genre, in reality there are a lot of funny Jaws tears; but with this, Joe D'Amato makes it clear that he can't even worry about trying, and the result is what must be the worst Italian shark film of all time. Avoid these wastes.
