According to the budget information provided on this site, Dark Harvest had an estimated budget of $ 130,000. Where this money was spent, I'm not exactly sure. Show me .... costumes ... no ... place and setting ... hmmm, think no .... special f / x ... NOT ... acting lessons ... ah, no. Dark Harvest tells the epic story of a young man who inherits a family farm in the hills of West Virginia. His girlfriend persuades him to bring their friends up there to check the place. Once there, our intrepid hero learns that his great-grandfather used a unique method to grow his crops and now it's time for revenge. The killer is scared for revenge !!! Ewww scary. Well no, not really. We all know that there have been some fantastic movies made with little money, but this is not one of them. This film contains some of the worst recitations and dialogues I've ever seen. Terrible clich√©s with terrible delivery. All in all, do not be fooled by half-decent coverage and avoid it at all costs. I'd like to give the directors at least a D- to try, but I'm afraid they haven't done a good job with that either. GRADE: F
