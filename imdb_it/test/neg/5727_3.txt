I imagine the company that made this film wanted people to think about Conan's films, but unfortunately for those who made this film, it does just that. You think, man, Conan's movies were fantastic ... this is totally boring and sucks. History, who cares? It won't help you make this movie much like it looks like a really cheap movie. Arnold, it doesn't seem to belong to this, because he agreed to play the role is beyond me. Well, probably for the money. I love the monster in the water that turns out to be a machine. Boring! This film is simple and simply terrible.
