I liked the Muppets. The film Muppet, The Great Muppet Caper and The Muppets Take Manhattan were good family films, written intelligently and fun to watch. I never thought I'd see the day they jump on the Hollywood Sleaze bandwagon, but here it is: Scooter like a caged rave dancer, Pepe making obscene and suggestive comments every five minutes - this isn't your father's Muppets. They are no longer even the Muppets of Jim Henson. <br /> <br /> This movie "It's A Wonderful Life" has its moments, but not enough to save it. I shivered as I watched this with my children. I still have hope for their next film, but this was definitely a disappointment.
