Oh God! Book II is more of a bad remake of the original than a sequel to it. It's not that funny, his plot plays too much <br /> <br /> like a rejected comedy pilot, and the use of the slogan "Think God" is a different variation of the idea that worked much better in the original . John Denver was not back for this movie and this made a big difference. George Burns, like <br /> <br /> wonderful like he was playing God, doesn't have the same chemistry with the girl he did with John Denver . <br /> <br /> I would give this movie a rating of 3 out of 10, but only for <br /> George Burns, the rest of the cast is nothing special. <br /> <br /> If you loved the first one, don't worry about seeing this.
