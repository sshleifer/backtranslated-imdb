I couldn't wait to watch this movie since I loved David Lynch's version. In my first attempt to watch it I fell asleep. Nothing was happening the next evening I tried to look at the rest, and again he was falling asleep! Nothing has ever happened in this film that can keep anyone's interest alive. The only time it was a little more exciting was when I tried it on Fast Forward! The DVD came with a second disc that contained bonus material. Needless to say, I had no difficulty with the torture of looking more than Dune (2000). Here are the low points: the acting was bad, the plot moved in slow motion, the sets were and seemed cheap, the direction was pathetic and the CGI visual effects were childish. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch Dune, save your money or rent the 1984 version.
