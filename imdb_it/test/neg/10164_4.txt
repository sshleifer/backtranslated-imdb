Randy Bowers (John Wayne) meets Half Way House at the right time to take a break from the tracks, and discovers a large number of corpses inside, including a man who was supposed to deliver a message - Ed Rogers, owner of the plant . It is observed by the niece of the dead Sally (Alberta Vaughn), from behind a hidden room, where it remained unnoticed during the carnage. <br /> <br /> "Randy Rides Alone" was directed by Harry Fraser. He uses a shooting technique here as in his other films, where he quickly fastens the action from one place to another, usually involving a rider on a horse. It's pretty well done and looks pretty innovative in these 1930s Lone Star Westerns. Pre-Gabby George Hayes is at hand, without a mustache, and this is the first time I see him as a villain. Actually it took some scenes to realize that he was in a dual role, first as a hunchbacked businessman "Matt the Mute", communicating via pencil and paper, only to turn into Marvin Black, leader of a band of outlaws . Black's gang was responsible for the murders at Half Way House, in an attempt to force Sally to sell to Matt / Marvin. Another base player is here, Yakima Canutt as a black follower named Spike. Interestingly, Yakima played a villain named Sam Black in another Fraser / Wayne oasis, "Neath the Arizona Skies". <br /> <br /> There is a fair amount of rides straddling Black's Gang and the sheriff posse, like the John Wayne character maneuvering to expose the villains. In the end, he saves the day by securing Sally Rogers' thirty thousand dollars, at the expense of destroying the Half Way House, where he swaps some dynamite sticks for the loot in a safe. Greedy Marvin Black tries to open it with his six-shooter, and the explosion is a suitable end for the villain. In his best attitude "Aw shucks", John Wayne falls under the spell of the beautiful Sally Rogers, and alas, Randy doesn't ride alone anymore!
