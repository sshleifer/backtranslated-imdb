This film was childish in its writing and laughable in its visual effects. The scenes in which Father Merrin throws himself into his bed and his raids from a crumbling native are signs of bad acting and little imagination. Nothing seems to fit. The story jumps from one scene to another. Elementary writing leaves nothing to the imagination and leaves no room for suspense. The doctor at some point states that she thinks that the city is going to "explode soon" from all the madmen. In fact, there was nothing in the film to make this line relevant. From the terrible work that the film had done, I would never have known that there were tensions in the village. If you like cheesy movies go ahead and rent this, but if you want to see this, take a look at Exorcist: The Beginning
