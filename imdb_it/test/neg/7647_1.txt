Honestly, one of the worst written, directed, and played movies I've ever seen. It looked like a movie made for TV. And a bad one. I can't believe people are still hiring Danny Huston after seeing him in this movie, or they're still allowing John Sayles to make movies. My husband and I stumbled across this movie on TV one night and got so bored that we ended up cleaning the house while it was on. . . and it still bores us! It made me think that the critics were so credulous with the previous Sayles films, like Lone Star, which was exciting at the time, but in the end it didn't contribute much. Spend your time on something better. Nothing.
