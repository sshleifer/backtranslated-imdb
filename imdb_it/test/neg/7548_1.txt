Bottom's premise crossed with Fawlty Towers is fantastic! However, Ade Edmonson and Rik Mayall managed to create a film that barely raises a title. Ten years ago, the crazy look of Rik Mayall and the idiocy of Hades were fun, now they're just annoying. <br /> <br /> The film was promising, although the most horrendous hotel in Britain is not a new idea, but failed to deliver. The saving graces were the competent performances of Simon (Spaced, Big Train) Pegg and Helene Mathieu, and the film lasts only 90 minutes. Sorry, guys, but you really hit bottom
