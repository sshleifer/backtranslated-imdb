OK, it's a piece of historical film that caused an uproar, upset people and was banned. I'll give it, and that's why I gave it a 3 rather than a 1. It may have been ahead of its time, but now it's certainly way behind the times. I'm a big fan of Salvador Dali and I loved Un Chien Andalou. That short was captivating with one creative scene after another. The Age d'Or was too long and boring - just a pompous and self-indulgent piece of film created simply as a weak attempt to try to get out of Un Chien Andalou by creating a feature film (and shamelessly exploiting Dali's name and fame even though it has little to do with it). Total garbage except for (very) few shots of "shocking scenes" separated by long stretches of boring non-action. A waste of time and money. Both my thumbs are down, down. It will go on my shelf to never be looked at again.
