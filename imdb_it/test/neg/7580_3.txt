I decided to watch this movie because it was noticed as the "scariest movie ever" so, that's what I expected. Unfortunately, what I discovered is that the movie didn't have a single scary moment (and I'm the kind of person who jumps very easily). The film was nothing but terrible clich√©s and every time there was a moment of jumping it was incredibly obvious. The professionals in this film would be the music and the strange scene that was shot well (like the last scene in which he opens the door and see Tun in the reflection and when he turns to him you see the ghost on his shoulders). Overall, this film has not added anything new to the J-Horror genre and all around it lacks creativity and fear.
