Some say this show was good in its early years! I disagree with all of them. The show is simply stupid and pathetic. My mother hates him, I hate him, my father hates him, I don't know about my sister, but oh well. Here are some reasons why: <br /> <br /> 1. CHARACTERS: children who are used as style characters are stupid. Children are just precocious and annoying. Adults and adults are stupid and unattractive. The worst character is that Angelica Pickles (really does it for the eardrums when you had a long, hard and miserable day at the office) and also Kimi Finster who appears later; she is too optimistic and a pain in the ass. He cannot decide where he is French or Japanese: it does not matter to know; you are an American citizen you know it and that's it! Oh, what I'm talking about, all the characters on this show suck! <br /> <br /> 2. THE STORIES: The stories are not original and stupid. They do it as if the children ventured into a great adventure, yes, in the courtyard shed. In one episode, that stupid little brat, Tommy Pickles the Leader broke into a television control room and almost literally destroyed it. Do not give children any idea of ​​destroying the normal T.V Station control rooms (they pay a lot of money for them in real life). I can imagine what the broadcasters must have felt to broadcast this episode, they will probably start staring at their cars all day frightened that a child might brake. Sad! <br /> <br /> 3. OVER RATED!: The show has dragged on for years and people continue to invent stories and new series and spin-offs for this. Get off! The Simpsons are going almost the same time, but they are much better and more fun than children. The show is simply overrated! People, where is your common sense! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I've surprised the T.V stations around the world that want to broadcast this series today. The show is absolutely rubbish and should never have been produced. The two films for this cartoon sucked the same! 2/10
