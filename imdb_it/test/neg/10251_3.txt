Yesterday I saw this television production and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I had no great expectations when it came to a television production, but the complete film was a never-ending pain. I felt it last for 3 hours, but it was just me that I was bored to death. Every minute was a long struggle and I really fought hard to stay away from "shut down". <br /> <br /> The film is about a doctor (Dr. Verghese) who receives many AIDS patients and most of them die during the film. It is difficult for Verghese to live with, so his family is punished with his frustrations. However, this film has problems with both sides, focuses mainly on his conversations with patients, and sometimes we see films from his home, but we don't get much of it. The difficulties in showing more than one part of Verghese's life do not improve with the poor recitation of Naveen Andrews, a man who (hopefully) cannot see in any good future film. <br /> <br /> I think he got 7.6 because of the subject (taboo?), but I'm sure there are better films on this subject on the market. Stay away from this movie, it doesn't deserve more than 3/10. <br /> <br />
