Negative numbers are not available to convey how bad this movie is! The wooden acting coupled with a plot that has been reworked dozens of times. Everyone in this film should participate in Overactors Anonymous. One might think that an original story could evolve from the general concept. The young people of a preparation school are working to deal with the Pearl Harbor bombing. It raises interesting questions, but the way they are transmitted makes it more of a joke. Typical characters were present, including the zealous zealous and the nerd (glasses included). I could not have been more uninterested in wooden dialogues and clich√© characters. At the end of the film, I had to throw the DVD in the trash. Stay away from this fool! You won't recover the 90 minutes of your life!
