More than a frisbee like a tortoise with fangs that rise like a wart pig. Other battles with people in bird clothes that look like people in bird suits. A ping pong space ship. Two bad guys who know how to do everything, even get on board the spaceship. More boring music. Another material "Gamera is the friend of children". I remember when Godzill and Rodan left. The movies were very funny because the monsters were actually a threat to people. Now they are just a parade of silly costumes with little behind them. Adults are all ridiculous and stupid. As in American sitcoms, children are the bosses (when in reality they couldn't think of getting out of a paper bag). These monster films must be the Japanese means to partition these little brats. Above all, however, is that after seeing three of these films (with the same plot over and over again, checking the movie), the final conclusion is that they are boring. If you haven't seen it, don't worry.
