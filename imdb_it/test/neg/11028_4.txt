When I bought 4 DVDs for Â£ 5.oo in a local store, I should have warned enough that this movie was not up to the usual David Selznick Productions standard. With a cast containing names like James Stewart and Carole Lombard, I couldn't wait to make a gift. As many other commentators have said it is a strange mixture of plot and scene that does not convince. HOWEVER, I am so happy to have seen this movie because now I have the memorable saying "Never let the seeds keep you from enjoying the watermelon". to live This should summarize everyone's life. Choose those seeds or spit or swallow them - and then enjoy the watermelon - life itself.
