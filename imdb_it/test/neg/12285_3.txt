1st watched on 8/7/2004 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Brett Thompson): Silly and youthful film centered on three kids who were hoed in their favorite cartoon with their parents' experiment. The script left a lot to be desired in this Hanna-Barbara as a Saturday morning rip-off "live-action with people in dinosaur costumes kids show" with some stupid cavemen around. Nothing really to admire and nothing to say. I'm just amazed to have found it in a Blockbuster video library as bad as the way the shops are getting rid of the old VHS movies. I imagine they couldn't even sell it, so he went back to the rental rack he went to.
