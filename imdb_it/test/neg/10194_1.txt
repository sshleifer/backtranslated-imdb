This film was poorly conceived, badly written and badly performed. All the characters were two-dimensional. It was a real amateur attempt. The film was fundamentalist Christian propaganda. The Christian characters are holier than you and are without a shred of compassion for the skeptic or for the undecided characters. The film was a real "bustle" both for the skeptical character and for me as a spectator, putting us in a very unpleasant situation. I complained to the theater management and they gave me a free pass for another movie. I remember another film on a similar theme, "The Rapture", starring Mimi Rogers, which was much better and professionally done. I think I'll watch "The Rapture" again. If you see "Unidentified" and don't like it, don't say I didn't warn you.
