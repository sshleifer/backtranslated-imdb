Mostly a biography of a lustful doctor, "Robert Merivel," (Robert Downey) who makes his way into the king's palace for the first half of the film and then helps the oppressed in the second half, mainly "Katharine" (Meg Ryan). <br /> <br /> The GOOD - The fantastic set of decorations (eg the lush palace of the king) and the costume make it a visual pleasure. The language is also very docile. Ian McKellen and Hugh Grant provide interesting support. <br /> <br /> The BAD - After 50-60 minutes, this film becomes simply boring. He desperately needed to get a spark after an hour, but he does the opposite: he drags himself to infinity. The script certainly needed some "restoration" needed, should we say? The film may look nice, but it takes a couple of hours to sit down ... too long.
