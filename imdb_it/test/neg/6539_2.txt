I would like to sit down and write a smart and well thought out review, however, I think I would spend more time in the writing process than directors did. I live in Los Angeles and I'm sorry to say that the characters seemed SO much non-commissioned officers and ACTORS over-inflated by the ego. There was not a single moment in the film where I could escape the feeling that I was watching the chat conversation of unemployed actors in a hipster caf√© in Los Angeles. One of the worst "indie" films I have ever seen with so little to recommend that the listening won at Sundance have effectively removed any previous interest I might have had to attend, let alone considering that a postural review of Sundance is significant. Look at your own risk.
