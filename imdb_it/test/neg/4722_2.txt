Acclaimed Argentine horror director Emilio Vierya directs a screenplay by Jack Curtis and Antonio Ross. Cheesy and ridiculous are in the mix for the madness method. A doctor's son is nearing his early death, until his desperate father transplants a monkey's heart into his chest. As expected, things will get weird; when this young man turns into a mask that wears a monster and wanders the beaches finding nice party girls to make his slaves. When heroin is injected, its beauties become zombies. The monster calls his minions dazed with strange organ music. So bad ... well ... it's just ugly. In the cast: Jose E. Moreno, Alberto Caneau, Mauricio De Ferraris, Gloria Prat and Gina Moret.
