Stylized Western Hollywood, full of familiar conventions, seem to have eternal life and this is an avatar. Everything in it seems to have been scraped from the back of a drawer since 1939, a larger budget applied, and that was his problem. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper has played this kind of role dozens of times - displaced people from the South, fast on the draw and balances with honor, albeit a little easy to travel whenever possible. He plays Blayde Hollister who travels to Texas in search of the gang that destroyed his cotton plantation. He wears a t-shirt lined with buckskin and makes two six shooters with an ivory handle. He speaks with a terrifying accent: "An attacker could get hurt doing this." (See, "Sergeant York.") The gang is led by mockers Raymond Massey, who buys and sells land, usually by devious means when possible. The band includes Steve Cochran, who cannot play a Westerner although he is very good at foam bags in general. The requested woman is Ruth Roman, daughter of the owner of the Mexican plantation, who looks and talks about Mexican as a brown Boston betty. <br /> <br /> I don't think I will worry too much about the plot. There is no doubt that someone spoke to us in detail and it is not worth mentioning more. As in any western 1939, it is labyrinthine. Everyone except Cooper and his friends are devious and there are more double crossings and past identities and hidden secrets. <br /> <br /> Everything is retro. The plot, the dialogue, the wardrobe, even the music. The score is by Steiner, the brave Max Steiner. It is the boy who marked "King Kong". It was 1932. This film was released in 1950. <br /> <br /> Cooper's name, among other things - "Blayde Hollister" - prompted me to take a look at the RACA records: the real American Cowboy Associaton - to see if that name came up in their archives, dating from the beginning of the period to February 4, 1911, when the last Royal Cowboy died due to an unfortunate encounter with a deranged peccary. There has never been a real cowboy with the name Blayde. Hollister, yes, but not Blayde. In fact, there is no record of any real Cowboys named Wade, Luke, Cole or Matt. The most popular names for true cowboys, in decreasing order of frequency, were Clarence, Mortimer, Noble, Nebukadnezzar, Plautus, Pinchbeck and Hortense. <br /> <br /> If this film was released in 1939, it would have been routine. In 1950, it is a calamitous monument in the history of human recycling.
