New Year. The day after having consumed too many martini and cosmopolitan vodkas mixed with a bunch of sparkling wine at midnight, my wife and I discovered that the local cable company is offering special digital channels for free in January. We had a choice: do we use free channels or start watching the eight seasons of X-Files on DVD that we received from our daughter for Christmas? <br /> <br /> We have chosen for the digital tribute since the DVDs go nowhere and we need something like ten hours of twelve hours to see all the X-Files starting to end. The Drive-In channel offered a classic marathon of three horror films: Asylum (1972), House of the Damned (1996) and The Pit and the Pendulum (1961). The nursery is well reviewed here and the pit and the pendulum were too late for us to watch, which meant that we could really only be duly critical of House of the Damned. <br /> <br /> To be honest, we tried to be serious about the film because its stars have reasonably good acting credentials - Greg Evigan (Tekwars written by William Shatner) and Alexandra Paul (Baywatch's only girl who could act despite having the body of a ten-year-old child). Unfortunately, we soon broke up giggling, under the influence of a small dog hair, while each of us shouted the names of the movies from which this dog borrowed his scenes: Poltergeist, The Shining, Hell House, House On Haunted Hill, Ghost Busters! <br /> <br /> Acting, particularly that of Evigan's real life, was not bad considering the silly script they had to work with. The CGI, for 1996, was hilarious - at its worst point in the final scene, when it should have been the most horrible that it was so bad that my wife and I broke up laughing. <br /> <br /> In general: Acting 4/5, Script 2/5, SFX 0/5
