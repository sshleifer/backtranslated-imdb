I haven't watched every jackass episode. It was pleasantly fun if nothing else was going. But after seeing Jackass # 2 I liked Bam and Dunn. They had a good attitude in the movie jerk, so I thought I'd tune in to live the Bam. The boy was wrong. Seriously, you could pair a group of 2'graders, give them the same budget and I bet they could drop something more creative on the screen. I mean, C'Mon MTV !! At 23, where most people are attuned, you give us this garbage. <br /> <br /> Everything seems so forced. You don't know the characters because there is absolutely no attitude. You can't appreciate Bam or Dunn, or anyone else for that. If there was only a tiny nap of thoughts. All that we will not forget as soon as the next blow continues. <br /> <br /> Finally they manage to create a good scene and you like what's going on. You sit there, just waiting for their reaction, and then some asshole closes the scenes with two limping sentences and bang. Was that the closure for that shot or what, please? If I had been there, it would drive me crazy and laugh. Do absurd things and get my adrenaline pumping but these guys ... Just stupid reactions. <br /> <br /> They take a few laughs from the audience with coarse jokes, or gigantic jokes that I think are such a waste of money. <br /> <br /> Many normal humans who have not been brought under the Jackass wing could in the blink of an eye write a much more entertaining script. Or impress with the work of the visual camera. Even the imaginative and spontaneous kids, without a script, would pull a better job. MTV could bring more relaxing material to the screen on a whim. You just need to fire the writer of this stupid show. <br /> <br /> Some scenes actually require a little courage and therefore 2 stars.
