This is absolutely horrible. It is everywhere and nowhere and has no point whatsoever. I've never understood what's good about Jeff Garlin or Sarah Silverman. Bonnie Hunt is so above this madness, she must have been personal friends w / people involved because she would never read any part of this so-called "script" and thought, "Yes, I want to do it!" Most movies can find at least one or two things that are redeemable or fun. There is ZERO of that in this. It's extremely stupid. There really is no other word to describe it. This is probably the biggest waste of money for making films I've seen in a long time. Skip this at all costs, you'll be glad you did.
