This is an absolutely forgettable image. A friend of mine picked it up in a business basket in a rented room for $ 50. He should have asked for a refund. Or at least a discount. <br /> <br /> The plot is something like this: a giant monster threatens the earth and the aliens decide that the average human being on the planet must be chosen to save the earth. So a small alien from the holographic space appears in front of a post office worker and tells him that he is "he". <br /> <br /> The devil is in the details when it is time to evaluate a film, and on that count Zarkorr! The invader fails miserably. The Zarkorr monster has only a few short moments on the screen, for a total of 5 minutes more (with a generous estimate). The cute alien hologram has even less time on the screen and could be the most interesting character to watch, and only because he wears a stereotypical "teeny bopper" outfit, complete with a jokingly pleated skirt. The final final battle with the monster is over before you can say "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, over". In the next instant you will be thinking about whether you have just experienced a train accident or if someone has just drained 3 liters of blood. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film has produced a line that my friends and I continue to repeat and laugh, and it was the only bright spot in this otherwise abysmal image. While the cast of the "protagonists" is "interrogated" by the fuzz, one of them answers the questions with the phrase "What are you, a kind of question you ask?" It is absurdly delivered that if you are sitting with a group of friends (who will not be your friends for a long time if you have actually talked to your friend watching it), you may actually experience a howl or two of incredulous laughter. <br /> <br /> Even if this is not Manos or Eegah (it is not even bad enough to be classically bad) this film will still bore you with its terrible dialogue, its non-imaginative characters and non-existent special effects and it deserves still to inhabit the lower part 100. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
