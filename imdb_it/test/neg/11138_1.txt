I think Trash really sucks. I saw it a couple of weeks ago and I didn't see that kind of c ** p at John Waters' Female Trouble cinema and this was even worse. The dialogues, the acting; It really smelled, it was so ugly it made me want to leave the cinema and ask for my money back. But actually I'm glad to have seen it, because then I could say my honest opinion. You should see this movie, even if it stinks.
