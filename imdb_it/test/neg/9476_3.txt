Now, I watched this when I was a hungover on a Sunday and my aunt and uncle were visiting one day with my 2 cousins ​​(one was 11, the other 9). We blocked the TV and the passport to Paris had just begun. Both of my cousins ​​had said that they sometimes looked at Two Of A Kind and said they could watch the movie if they liked it. Since I wasn't fit to get up, I stayed in the living room with them and ended up watching the movie! I have to say, as a person who has no interest in this type of TV or film program, I really liked it ... it must have been alcohol lol but, I admit, you would probably like better for girls aged 6 to 13 , but it was a movie to pass the time. There is always a movie or show that you don't like, but for a laugh, you enjoyed it.
