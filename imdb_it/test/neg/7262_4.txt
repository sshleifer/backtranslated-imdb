A giant praying mantis is awakened from its sleep in the artic region and heads south causing chaos. Boats, planes and trains meet their game with the flying creature. Before unleashing his anger on New York, the mantis meets his fate at the hands of the armed forces in a New York tunnel. The special effects are obviously raw by today's standards, but for a ten-year-old in 1957 this was truly memorable. <br /> <br /> The protagonists are William Hopper, Craig Stevens, Alix Talton and Pat Conway.
