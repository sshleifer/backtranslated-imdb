My expectations were high after seeing the trailer. They were even taller when I saw the film having the same director on independence day and godzilla. Independence day special effects were much better than this movie. The whole movie was waiting for the spiders to show up. The rest of the plot was really boring. And when the spiders arrived, they looked very amateurish, like the special effects of a movie made in the 1960s. I didn't watch the whole movie. When it was played for about an hour I turned off my DVD player. I watch 3 movies almost every night and never left a movie, even though it was boring. The only good thing about this movie was the beautiful sheriff :) That's why I voted 2 instead of 1 :) So don't go see this, instead you should go out and rent a Starship Troopers, it's like the same only 10,000 times better.
