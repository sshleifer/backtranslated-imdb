This may have been a great film with great educational potential for teachers around the world on evolution, biology, creative work in science, research and Darwin's life, but it is not. <br /> <br /> The script is mainly historically inaccurate and turns a true story into a Mexican melodrama of soup opera. While it is true that Darwin gradually lost his religious convictions, this was largely due to his discoveries during the Beagle journey and not just because of the loss of his daughter. He was certainly troubled by his loss, but that didn't make him literally mad, delirious and detached from his friends and family. The Darwin portrait is an invention of the scriptwriter. Therefore it cannot be used in any way as a place to learn some of Darwin's life and psyche. According to most historians, Darwin had prepared the theory by the end of the Beagle journey, preventing it from becoming public because he wanted to further develop the consequences and control further data. In the film, it is an imaginary conflict of Darwin with his religious beliefs and the mental illness he developed after the death of his daughter that prevented him from becoming public. <br /> <br /> The film brings a modern situation, creationists vs scientists argue, in Darwin's life and times, so it's anachronistic. Describes Thomas Huxley not as a man trying to develop a further understanding of biology but as someone wishing to "kill God", in his own words from the film, and destroy the church, which would accept the theory of evolution for such purposes and not because it was a summary of many disconnected data. Huxley is presented as a very arrogant and insensitive person, a combination I interpret was an attempt to ridicule active atheists who speak against religion. In real life, Huxley accepted Darwin's ideas after publication only gradually, and before Darwin's work he thought that there was not enough evidence to support evolution. His first support for evolution was published a month after the origin of the species became public. He was agnostic but did not think it was necessary to "kill God", he only thought that there was not enough evidence to believe in the supernatural. The creationists vs scientists debate appears throughout the film, and the creationists' setbacks such as "It's just a theory" are part of the discussion. Of course, at that time there were no such controversies or catch phrases. In fact, the Anglican Church published a positive review of the Origin saying that saw the work of God evolving, in a sense, actually contradicting the way the clergy is portrayed in the script. <br /> <br /> Another terrible aspect of this film is that it gives the wrong impression to the public that scientific research is done by a lonely madman who writes a lot. Nothing could be further from the truth. The conception of the theory of evolution was the result of in-depth observations of living forms by Darwin during five years in the Beagle HMS, and was gradually developed as can be seen from the notes of Darwin's journey. Although the journey of the Beagle was the single most important part of Darwin's life to the "Origin of Species" conception, the journey is briefly mentioned only once at the beginning, and no attempt is made to show that the book came as an elaborate analysis of observations. To make matters worse, Darwin is shown performing a single experiment (breeding pigeons) to test his theory and eventually leaves it. And I'm not really sure that this experiment actually happened. <br /> <br /> Big disappointment. It is in no way a tribute to Darwin and to science.
