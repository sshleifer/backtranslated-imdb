"I remember waiting to be born ..." <br /> <br /> "Visual research that was the American West." <br /> <br /> "We went to a psychic ..." <br /> <br /> "I'm sure their first reaction is that she's a cuckoo" <br /> <br /> " .. .the place is haunted ... "<br /> <br />" I think there is another dimension right here. "<br /> <br /> An artist (Marta Becket) and her husband many decades ago they left the bustle and culture of New York and moved to a city abandoned by God with a population of 10 in Death Valley. There, they renovated a theater - painting is a very artisanal / folk art way. And, once finished, he started doing dance shows for almost anyone. In many ways, it is reminiscent of the Werner Herzog film FITZCARRALDO or FIELD OF DREAMS - although AMARGOSA is a documentary of a real person - not a mythical fool like Klaus Kinski or Kevin Costner. In the end, her husband leaves, largely because of the lifestyle she has chosen. So, today he lives with his ten cats and a sanctuary for burros eventually with his new male partner, Tom. <br /> <br /> What you think of this documentary depends on your prospects. If you like New Age ideas and open yourself to these sensibilities, then you will most likely appreciate the film. Talking about how he remembers his birth, his ghosts, his visual research and his psychics has frankly made the psychology teacher embarrassed in me and this would certainly be the case for many people. Moreover, its donkey sanctuary and the attempt to preserve horses in the desert will most likely appeal to PETA and many other animal lovers, albeit with my environmental and biological background, I see burros and horses as a plague that would destroy the native Plants and animals. Therefore, on two different reports, I tend to think contrary to Marta, who is more a "sensitive" and "sensitive" individual. Depending on how you feel about all of this, it surely colors your opinions - and I'm almost certain that most people will think it's a genius or a fool! You should just guess what I think. <br /> <br /> Now, despite everything, the film is interesting and Marta's life is not at all boring, especially since in recent years people have begun to travel the desert to see it perform. There is a definite following for her and her unusual little world. While I wouldn't be nearly as positive as most reviews, I can't be as negative as the only review, as there is a definite merit for this strange documentary. I like films about unusual people and Marta is certainly unusual! I also appreciate his love for his art and his happy life - this is a rare gift. <br /> <br /> I teach psychology in an art school and it would certainly be interesting to show it to the staff - where I am pretty sure we would have a positive and negative reaction to the film - probably depending on whether the teachers taught the classes art or basic curriculum! It would certainly be interesting. <br /> <br /> By the way, and I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but when Marta's husband was having business, who did it happen to ?! After all, they lived in the middle of nowhere and I was left wondering where he would find partners. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you'd like to see her perform and / or stay at her hotel, she can be found on www.amargosaoperahouse.com/. The site is in English, French and German and the hotel rates are quite reasonable as are the ticket prices.
