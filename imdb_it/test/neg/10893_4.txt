A young couple decides to escape from sunny California. They never reach their destination when they decide to stop at the Rest Stop. <br /> <br /> After a fight with her boyfriend, Nicole Carrow insists on stopping to stop. When she is ready to leave, she leaves the bathroom to discover that her boyfriend has disappeared in her car, leaving her trapped in the back streets of Texas with only an abandoned camper van to keep her company. <br /> <br /> Rest Stop is one of those inexpensive and tacky horror movies that could become a cult classic. Will Rest Stop become a cult classic you could ask for? Well, the three elements you need to become a cult are gore, sex and artistic merit. The rest has a lot of blood, and while I don't want to give too much, it contains a great deal of blood-soaked malice. This film has it all, from the bad guy who runs on the legs of a policeman with his car several times to him using a pneumatic drill on a girl's leg. At times, it can be as damaging as a movie. He also has a free and at the same time rather intimate love scene in the first minutes of the film. Therefore, sex is covered. Now the hard one ?? Does it have any artistic merit? Have you ever seen the bad guy's face? see foreshortenings, profiles, shadowy silhouettes. He is a monster without a face, implacable, that alone has a very high score on the scale of artistic merit. The film contains very few characters outside the main protagonist ?? Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander). Since he spends much of the film alone, he cannot reveal his thoughts during a conversation, but he must speak them out loud so that we, the public, know what he is thinking. Sometimes, this can be slightly irritating; however, it is a brave step by the writer (John Shiban) and works for most of the film. As an audience knows, being completely alone and isolated from civilization is pretty scary even when you're not being chased by psychotic killers. <br /> <br /> So, will Rest Stop become a cult classic? Probably because along the blood, sex and questionable artistic merit, it also has a lot of shivers, an interesting and inventive storyline and gives rise to a lot of screaming on the screen while the main character does a lot of things that you should definitely not do when you escape from a psychotic killer. (What fun are horror films if you can't complain about the stupidity of the victims?)
