I saw it on the cable. Someone had to lose their job to make it visible in the air. Just because a movie is made doesn't mean it has to be shown! Savage Instinct should be shown in ALL movie classes. It's the perfect model for how not to make a movie. The assembly alone is so confusing that you will think it was assembled by a team of trained (scarce) monkeys, who travel through an unpaved road into the canyon of a jeep, blindfolded and drunk. Audio is often not readable. To act? I can't call anything I saw here acting. To act? Hmmm. I can't call it that. Lacking? That works. All that is said ... IT IS HILARIOUS! I cannot stress enough that there is no redeemable factor in this "film" besides the hilarity derived from its incredible ineptitude. Fun, in a strictly masochistic way. Look at him ... if you dare.
