I recently borrowed a copy of this movie mess, which took me three sessions for three days. This is another comment under construction. <br /> <br /> But what I wanted to comment first was the carelessness about the special features of the DVD. It included a memory game, which asked the player / viewer to pair pairs of animals to get them onto the ark. However, whenever he reveals the chosen animal, the screen asks the player to find (or congratulate the player for having found) "is friend". This is a spelling mistake because it should be "his companion" as a possessive pronoun, not a contraction for "it is". It's an annoying mistake to keep repeating 16 or more times to finish a game. Of course, it is a child's activity indeed, but it teaches children the wrong spelling. <br /> <br /> And, oh yes, the game never changes. It's the same game with the same positions as the same animals every time. It also doesn't keep the score, like the number of moves needed to solve the game. So there is no lasting value or challenge to it. It's just a function to list on the package. <br /> <br /> To put it simply, there would have been more thought and attention in this "special" feature, just as there could have been more thought and care in this confusing film.
