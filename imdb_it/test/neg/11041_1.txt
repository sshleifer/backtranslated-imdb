***** Classic **** Excellent *** Good ** Right * Tragic <br /> <br /> Review: <br /> <br /> Oldboy is not for everyone. It is a pervasive violence, its polyp lives and its history is not imaginary. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a man who was kidnapped and imprisoned for 15 years, Oh Dae-Su is released, only to find that he must find his kidnapper in 5 days. Now the story may seem compelling, but once you look at this bloody and unprecedented celebration of blood it develops into a mixture of bitter blood and a strong film. <br /> <br /> Directing is on par and by no means the standards of what should be a South Korean thriller. Oldboys' acting scenes are accompanied by deaf humor and a poorly written script. <br /> <br /> Oldboy is occasionally presented with subtle straw displays that cannot be shamed. <br /> <br /> Verdict: <br /> <br /> Not for everyone, but the scope and vision are not clear enough to see beyond the gray abyss of fog. <br /> <br /> * Tragic
