The film has had something worthwhile - but it was designed for, with a bullying mother, a witch of a rival, and an exuberant queen of beauty who constantly arrives in second position. There was a bit of nonsense, and some points of the plot not plausible (do you get second place in EVERY single competition? ALL?) Unfortunately, the film suffers terribly because of its need for, well, being a TV movie . Rather than ending at the end of the film, a fun turn in which the killer is (semi-plausibly) revealed, the film continues for another twenty minutes, just to make sure justice is done. Of course, now that the killer is revealed, he suddenly undergoes a complete personality change - his character is completely rewritten, because writers no longer need to keep his secret identity. The cheese completely sinks what might otherwise have been a passively amusing film.
