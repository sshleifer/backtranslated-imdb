I have absolutely no idea why I saw Ali G Indahouse, except that Salon seemed to think that a crime was committed not naming Sacha Baron Cohen for an Emmy for his work on Da Ali G Show. It's a safe bet that I'll never watch that show because there was absolutely nothing funny about the movie. Comedy? The torture was more similar. It was just the stupidest thing I looked at. I admit I was fascinated by Rhona Mitra. I had never seen her in anything. It wasn't on The Practice during the time I was watching, so I guess I'll have to check out Boston Legal one of those evenings to see how it behaves in something that might be worth looking at.
