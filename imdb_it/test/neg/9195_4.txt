As much as I respect the firemen for what they do. I was not impressed and bored by this movie. The acting was OK, but Joaquin Phoenix was a bad casting choice. <br /> <br /> What bothered me most about this film was Celtic music that constantly complained about the worst possible movie moment. Even the direction and continuity were pretty bad! <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** For example, after the character of Phoenix has fallen into several stories and is seriously injured, he can barely move to speak to his captain on the radio. Then, miraculously, he manages to crawl through a huge space covered with rubble and fire to punch a human-sized opening in a double-thickness brick wall using only a piece of foot reinforcement bar ???? And to complete everything, then it becomes ultra weak and busted again. <br /> <br /> Someone has also noticed that throughout the film, whenever you see shots of Joaquin fighting fires and saving people, there is little or no smoke in the buildings. I would think that the smoke should be quite thick in a building engulfed in flame. <br /> <br /> I also got tired of hearing the search and rescue team yell "I need some equipment here !!!". <Br /> <br /> I really thought I would like this movie, but I found it to be a weak attempt to represent the real life of a firefighter. The intention was there, but honestly I think this film could have been much better. I couldn't help thinking that the producer was trying to meet a deadline with this film and had to rush to put it in the cinemas. More time should have been devoted to editing and making sure there was a good flow of the film. <br /> <br /> The special effects were impressive in some scenes but disappointing and almost ridiculous in others. Kind of like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. <br /> <br /> Call me a critic, but I can't see what's so good about this movie. At least it wasn't as bad as "The Whole Ten Yards", which is by far the worst movie I've seen in recent months. <br /> <br /> I really hope that there is not a Scala 50 in manufacturing!
