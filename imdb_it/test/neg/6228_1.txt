I must say that there is a speck that redeems about this "film". Firmly establishes the bottom of the barrel. Now the directors know what to focus on when they make a movie. On top of that, I'm sorry I watched this debacle. What was shameless to abandon the realization of this "film" was. What a waste of $ 100,000 (it's just people, a hundred dollars). This "film" reminds me of the show "Adult Video Awards" in which a group of "industrial prostitutes" praise themselves, believing that they are real actors, actresses and directors. Ironically then of how I saw blue films with better acting, directing and writing. I also found it amusing that the executive producer, Justin Ament, should simply be in the "movie". Deputy Jake Barker plays. I'm sure his "acting" career took off ... Ted Pfiffer, the writer, has a part. No doubt he was rolling in the clich√© glory he created. It should be noted that Carrie Finklea has a leading role in the film. You could remember her as an Elephant of Gus Van Sant. Although I'm not too sure he will want to write this film on his resume. And I'm not sure which is a more depressing point; money was spent on making this movie or people will watch it. Together with "Torque", "Godsend" and "Sky Captain and the world of tomorrow", one of the worst films, IF NOT THE WORST FILM, of 2004.
