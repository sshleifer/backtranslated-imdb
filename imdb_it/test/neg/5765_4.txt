This is an embarrassing yet another remake of the same plot in the umpteenth series of idiots-young-adult-in-danger-because-they are-idiotic slasher movies of the first millennium: this time we have the story of a crazy miner who returns from the dead to resume its gold from the hands of the usurpers. We have hardly any shudders, almost no naked flesh (even if the girls are really hot, only one of them shows her naked ass for a few seconds), the usual horror sunset bouquet in cameo (this time Karen Black, Richard Lynch , John Philip Law, Jeff Conaway), a lot of fake blood, only the mad miner resurrected as a zombie is cold enough to leave you stuck - well, not exactly - on the screen until the end. Do not waste time if you are not a completist.
