I worked at the company that originally made this film, Vestron Pictures. Vestron had the same problem that they had many small independent companies, they didn't have much money to put in the production values ​​of their films. Not that the money alone will buy you a good movie. Watch Kevin Costner's Waterworld, for example. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, if you have a talented in-house person to do acquisitions or development, you can create your new talent. But in Vestron, there was no such person and they always spared in some crucial area. In this case, he was the director and writer. Which makes it pretty hard to have a decent movie, even with the big cast of this movie. <br /> <br /> I think the basic premise of this film was "Let's put a bunch of wacky characters in a room and see if something interesting happens." It's an intriguing idea, but it's not worth looking at the your time. <br /> <br /> Most of the Vestron films had a very special appearance for them. My wife and I have developed the ability to identify this quality even in non-Vestron films. Many times, we were even able to identify that quality by watching only the trailer or TV commercial. We sat there, watched the trailer or the commercial, and later turned to each one, and almost in sync, we said "Now it's a Vestron movie!" This is a Vestron movie.
