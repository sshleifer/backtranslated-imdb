Seeing the names of the leading actors (Statham, Snipes and Phillippe) I thought the film should be at least fun or interesting. Instead, all I got out of it was not only boring 92 minutes, but the frustration of knowing everything that was going to happen, and hearing tons of lousy and worn-out "bad cop" sentences. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the film does not have a good story to begin with. And when you have it, how no one can help you, not Statham, not Wesley Snipes ... not even John McClane could save this movie :-) It might be nice for kids, if they aren't older than 12, because to them it doesn't matter much about the story, and there are some big explosions in the film.
