Well, the name in the summary should tell you everything. FRED OLEN RAY - the modern king of low-budget films, both for TV and for direct video (I doubt he produces for the big screen - with the death of the double drive-in B-movie features and all). <Br /> <br /> Creator of such classic cult (?), Like Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers and Dinosaur Island .... <br /> <br /> Well, I like this kind of guys. It's mostly fun (in a decidedly approximate, campy and particularly cheap way) and if it's one thing, it's a professional - something that can't be said for all the cinema guys. <br /> <br /> But this film here is among the weakest of its time. The insipid acting, an uninspired script and limping jokes conspire to make your brain numb in a few minutes. If you are out for a real F.O.R. goodness (or rather badness), attention to those mentioned above, and in general to his things of the 70s and 80s (I think he has lost a bit of advantage lately).
