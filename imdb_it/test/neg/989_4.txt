Let's talk about being boring! <br /> <br /> I expected a fascinating vision of the life of the man who wrote the legendary Night on the Galactic Railroad. I expected to see crazy stories and hints of an eccentric man and to discover his inspirations for such a bizarre material. Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Spring and Chaos are mostly boring with only sporadic moments of innovative animation. It is certainly nothing to write home about and not even close to NOTGR, which is something I recommend watching. Leave this boredom alone. If you absolutely MUST see, then either rent it or find it somewhere cheap. Don't pay the best dollar.
