Bridget Fonda is the sexually satisfied wife of the handsome Hart Bochner. One afternoon he returns home, calls him "sweetness", and quietly prepares him a drink, only to discover that he is sullen. Minutes pass while she surrenders in an accomplice way with her frowning silence. Suddenly, he bursts into anger, accusing her of infidelity in the complete absence of any reason to do so, he calls it the word C, bangs his head against a locker, slaps her, and ends up throwing her away from the second floor balcony, breaking his hand and a pair of ribs. <br /> <br /> He wakes up in the hospital where, it is revealed, he is deaf, although we notice that he reads his lips perfectly. This avoids all the embarrassment associated with an ASL interpreter or his ringing words in a simulacrum of language. <br /> <br /> Okay. Let me just illustrate the basic plot elements. This beautiful and devoted handicapped woman is beaten by her husband, misunderstood by her elderly mother, betrayed by her sister, whose bank account emptied by unknown hands, almost raped by a fat man who approaches her in a bar, is thought to have killed the her now deceased husband, and is pursued by two policemen (Kiefer Sutherland and Steven Weber), one of whom is only interested in justice, while the other seems to hate all women and is embarrassed by their presence. In the end he finds her alone in a deserted bus stop with a hand full of money - alone, in tears, but brave. <br /> <br /> Now, a pop quiz. There is only one multiple choice question. "This story was written by: (a) a man or (b) a woman". Don't look sexist. One could easily represent a scenario on a decorated military hero and a trained warrior who is captured by his enemies, betrayed by his organization, beaten and tortured, runs for exact revenge and ends up with the woman he loves, whom he thought he had "Ho lost a long time ago. <br /> <br /> The management is functional and conventional: when Fonda regains consciousness in a hospital bed, we see from his point of view the faces of anxious doctors and nurses who look down on her from above down - that is, to the camera - an echo of every scene in a myriad of second-rate films in which the stretcher is hastily brought into the corridor and people wearing starched and stethoscopic gowns hover over the camera. Hart Bochner has played a number of evil people in an interesting way - some of which the characters are stupid ("Die Hard") and some are more than just plain ("And The Sea Will Tell"). A virile beauty has a kind of evil tint. It would be too easy to choose him as a hero. Beautiful, intentionally bland interpretation of Steven Weber as a stupid policeman - perhaps the best in the film. <br /> <br /> Bridget Fonda is also interesting. His acting field is limited but he is here on show. What makes it an object of interest is its almost stereotyped beauty. She's like a high school queen. Very feminine Of course she can't do anything about it if she crawls or moves her hands gracefully. She can't do anything for her nose either. For most of its length it is perfectly normal and attractive, but at its tip there is a protuberance towards the outside that follows the natural glow of its nostrils. The tip of that nose is full of intrigue. <br /> <br /> As for the film - Pfui.
