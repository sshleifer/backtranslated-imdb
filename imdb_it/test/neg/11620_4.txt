There are only 2 reasons why I watch this show ... I invested the time already in the previous episodes and in Col Tigh. For all the supposed science fiction fans who love the new BSG, give me a break! Read the classic science fiction novels of real greats or watch some of the milestone and television films of bygone days and see what hackers these BSG writers are. Their only device is "who is the fifth cylon". Poor writing and really, really no sense of character development. If Adama resigns or tries to take power or cries again or discovers the inner father, it should have passed once again ... ahhhhh! And Roslin is such an annoying character that he was never put on board a starship. Out of the airlock with her. I could care less if there are still six months to go before I finish. These aspiring writers were out of the game in season one. If you don't know, you simply can't write.
