This film was pretentious, crazy and just right is not funny. The shooting technique reminded me of MTV. I'm a Hartley fan. But what was he thinking? So much more thought could have come into this film, considering the subject. This may have been a real theoretical battle for good and evil, but Hartley seems to be using the tripod technique to kill the viewer.
