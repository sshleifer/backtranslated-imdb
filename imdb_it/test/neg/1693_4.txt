A very resistant but harmless cinematographic version of the classic of children's literature that incorporates an animated part in the style of MARY POPPINS (1964) and BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS (1971). The human cast is very distinct - James Mason, Billie Whitelaw, David Tomlinson, Joan Greenwood, Bernard Cribbins - but their roles range from the miscastosa (a 69-year-old Mason like a sweep of thieves!) To the irrelevant (Greenwood as an aristocrat confused) to the bizarre (Whitelaw recites several "exotic" characters - including a circus artist, an old witch, a maid and a fairy - for no apparent reason). <br /> <br /> The animated segment of the film, managed by a group of animators from Eastern Europe, is hardly inspired but funny in itself and, as usual, with this kind of thing, there is it is an assortment of songs that must be endured, one of which in particular is taken up too often for his own good. The film was directed by the well-known actor Jeffries who previously directed (much more successfully) other children's films, THE RAILWAY CHILDREN (1970) and THE AMAZING MR. BLUNDEN (1972, which I have yet to see but which was released some time ago on DVD R2 of Anchor Bay UK).
