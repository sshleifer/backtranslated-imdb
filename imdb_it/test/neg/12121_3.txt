Unfortunately a boring blow, and of course the only way to see it is the Public Domain bootleg version slaughtered, which is so blurry and obscure that sometimes you have trouble understanding where the screen is. The protagonists are a nuisance. The man spends most of his time on the screen trying to look casual, charming and sexy, totally forgetting what the film is about and that he is a suspect of murder because of some lady who interpreted it as a goose for begin. The same lady simply walks through the film, is dignified if she is not committed to looking pretty. It is a rather poorly written material, never interesting or witty. No good photographic work, no memorable soundtracks, no glamorous actresses or atmospheric sets. It only scratches the surface of the genre and nothing happens if you miss this totally missing shot.
