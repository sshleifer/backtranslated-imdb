This is a line often used, but in reality it sums up this film ... "If this is the current state of gay cinema, then we are in trouble". I saw this movie at SIFF due to IMDb's high rating (7.6) and if there had ever been a case for voting on IMDb, then it really is. Look at the number that falls in the weeks of the film's release. <br /> <br /> Easy plot ... Boy finds out that his ex-high school boyfriend is getting married to a friend of his, so he returns to his old hometown (which still carries a torch of 10 years) to see what happened. <br /> <br /> First of all, I liked "Latter Days", the last feature of the director, despite his characters and plot, but you should become a better director with each later version. I don't know how horrible support performances are achieved by so many TV veterans (Robert Foxworth, Joanna Cassidy, Tori Spelling), but somehow managed to do it. The writing was of Lifetime Network quality (far behind when they were REALLY bad) and the situations were incredible and uncomfortably difficult to watch. I kept looking for a non-existent remote to go on fast, but in the end I stopped until the end, hoping for a decent final. Ugh ... no. Even the free male nudity that appeared during the film was so patently free that it seemed to be there to keep people in their seats. <br /> <br /> To be honest ... the 2 main characters, especially in the free nude scenes, were fantastic. There was also a real sweetness between them during their rekindling of friendship as they discovered how they had gone apart. And the film looked fantastic ... good quality and color saturation for an independent film. <br /> <br /> How it is possible that the TV on the net can give weekly weekly big and funny episodes (like "Ugly Betty", "Desp. Housewives", etc.), but so many versions of similar genres can they be so harmful?
