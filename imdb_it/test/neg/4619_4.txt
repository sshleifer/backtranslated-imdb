This is not a big cinema. The film is obvious and in many places is a copy of the original Carrie. The parallels with the original film are surprising, but with an unlikely addition to the fact that the telekenetic powers are congenital. I can't say that I didn't like the film because at least a couple of hours passed ... but these were passed as you read a non-binding book on a long train journey. That book would not be a great literature, but would absorb it for a while and it will soon be forgotten, as it would merge with the numerous other books on which the clich√©s are based. In the same way the film was fine as long as it lasted, but it is perhaps forgettable. At least I think it is. I can't remember much about it now !!
