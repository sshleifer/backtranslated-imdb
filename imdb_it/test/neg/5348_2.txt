So many great actors, so little to watch. But with a script that lacks so much of what made the book special, I don't hold it against anyone on the screen. Although imperfect, the book was one of the few of Grisham that I really liked, especially as it captured the taste of a small city in the deep south, a world slightly different from a coastal urbanite like me. I also loved the concreteness, the naturalness of what happens in the book. In the film the characters have a "nobility" of personality that seemed so well written. The bad and the laminae are flat and 1 dimensional. But as in many of Joel Schumacher's works, genuineness and authenticity are evidently absent, and each point must be delivered by mace to the central section. So preacher, prodded and superficial about such a horrendous tragedy, I wish someone would remake it and that the story was a little more just.
