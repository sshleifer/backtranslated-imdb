As Anthony Bourdain said ... "I wanted to stick my head in a lye pail, pull my eyes out and jump off a cliff." This summarizes my feelings about this pathetic waste of human effort. Artless, self-indulgent, reckless and simply bad. Bad beyond comprehension. What else can I say? If you are unlucky enough to find yourself in an area where this piece of junk is playing, please have mercy on the soul and avoid at all costs.
