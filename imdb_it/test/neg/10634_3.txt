Great arguments, directors and cast somehow add to a truly abysmal film, told in that semi-documentary style that was so popular during the time this film was made. (And hello, this is NOT a film-noir!) The dull, overly complicated, over-populated story has no arc, no focal point, little excitement and staggers from one scene to another without a visible purpose, except as a Greeting card for the alleged and highly dubious cooperation between the American and Mexican governments on the issue of illegal immigration. <br /> <br /> The scene that made me hate this movie is when Montalban and Mitchell make a daring escape from their captors, the race to presumably save Montalban's injured comrade from being killed by a goon with a gun driving a piece of farm machinery, Montalban says something like "fast - we have to try to save it", but instead of doing it they lie on their stomachs and look agonizing for about 5 (!) minutes of screen time while the machine he rests on Murphy and FINALLY invests him (or so we presume - the car simply stops, another henchman detects the presence of the two "rescuers" and shoots them while they run away again.) Scene over. Everything is so horribly filmed and absolutely anticlimatic. There is nothing worse than a protagonist (apparently, Montalban, even if he is off screen for more than half of the film) that he doesn't even try. Jeez, Ricardo, do SOMETHING! <br /> <br /> I know it's Anthony Mann, but hell, not ALL his films are classic, folks. How bad should an old movie be around here to get something lower than a 6?
