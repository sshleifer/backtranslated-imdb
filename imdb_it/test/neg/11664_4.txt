Everything you do in this world should have at least a little common sense. Unfortunately very little of "Delusion" makes sense. Jennifer Rubin is adequate in her role as the main bully of the Kyle Secor hit man. Secor on the other hand will exaggerate to the point of irritation. Jim Metzler, the yuppie without appeal is really incredible as the novice, the revenge he seeks, the adversary. When Jennifer Rubin returns the money she has carefully hidden, all credibility flies out of the window, and the guns pointing to the final clash between Secor and Metzler is beyond the ridiculous. Avoid "Disappointment" unless you're delusional enough to believe the wrong positive reviews here. - MERK
