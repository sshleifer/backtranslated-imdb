I like Errol Flynn; I like biographies and I like action movies. This has characterized all three of these ... but I didn't like this movie. It lasted too long, although the last 20 minutes were excellent, especially in photography with some good low-angle shots. However, it seemed to me that it took six hours to get to that point, and I really can't say why I feel that way. <br /> <br /> The action is interesting, Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland are fine. Indeed, it was pleasant to see de Havilland supporting Flynn instead of his normal role as an antagonist towards him. Yet something is missing in this film. <br /> <br /> The film has been severely criticized for its historical inaccuracy, but I don't feel the same criticism for many other films that have done the same. In fact, it is RARE when a film is historically accurate. For some reason, this revisionist story has offended most critics. If the film had made General Custer much worse than it really was, they probably would have appreciated it. Good, too bad. In their twisted way, critics prefer villains to heroes. <br /> <br /> I really wish I would have enjoyed it more, but I'll take a lot of other Flynn adventures on this one.
