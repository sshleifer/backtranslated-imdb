this is a complete crap do not look at the main character is so fucking worried that the doctor's air-raid shelter is not big enough for everyone and therefore states that the doc is playing god saying who lives and who dies everything during his 13itching, kills people Without Thinking twice and beating people even close to death, the main character is a bit selfish to erase as he did, the doctor who did the hospitalization is dead and his friend is dead. he also killed several unnamed police officers the main character is just a crazy dumb king who has no idea of ​​the superior good, this film has no sense of the king. tell me why would a comet cause seismic activity? (if you say gravity, I'll get the king raped to make the comet smaller than the moon and you don't see the moon cause volcanic eruptions and earthquakes and avalanches). <br /> <br /> because a comet causes atmospheric discharges (the red lightning, also because it is red?) besides, if you don't know it, the FUC KING MOONS BEEN HIT OF COMETE THOUSANDS OF TIME !!! that's why there are fucking craters all over the moon. the size of an object needed to shatter the moon into fragments as depicted in the film would require a comet around the dimensions of the moon itself. <br /> <br /> requires huge amounts of KE to blow up a satellite this way. <br /> <br /> The film is that the nuclear explosion in space has caused a disc-shaped shock wave. this is not correct as in space, the explosion should have produced a spherical shock wave. this inaccuracy is evident even when the comet hits the moon. <br /> <br /> Also, does anyone tell me why the commander (the person who drives the old big broken plane) suddenly felt the need to die? I mean it's like walking with them to the shelter, then it stops, greets the main character. <br /> <br /> WTF?!? !!?!? the protagonist is also a bad hole @ $$, has a huge forehead and sparse hair. Disgusting. <br /> <br /> IT'S AWAY FROM THIS FILM !!!
