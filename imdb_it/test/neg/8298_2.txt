This film clearly has an agenda, which can be summarized as follows: Never, never across the border (physical or metaphorical). We avoid all that is on the other side with a wall or fence or something else, let's pretend that all the "gringos" are evil, satanic or drug dealers. Everything that is outside the borders of your country (and in particular the US borders) is dangerous, malicious and the people there will hate you, or envy you or try to steal you or something else. The "based on real events" is just a perverse sign that can be attached to anything to give it some credibility or, in this case, just to help push the film's ideology down some naive throats there out. The film's perversity lies in the fact that it reduces countries, people and everything else in stereotyped categories in black and white: Mexicans in disgusting people, Mexican police in a group of corrupt policemen, republicans in right-wing idiots, democrats in almost humanist hippies and etc. Is there anything good in the film? I hardly think so, but you might think differently.
