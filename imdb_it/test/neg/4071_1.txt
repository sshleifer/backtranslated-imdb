Aghhhhhh! What a disappointment. A nice piece like Antonio Sabato Jr. and nothing but an embarrassing crap coming out of his mouth. I have reduced to 95% of the Dialog! It would have been better to have made the character dumb! How Antonio Sabato and Michael Pare can say these lines without losing control of certain bodily functions is beyond me! If the character of Michale Pare preceded or ended only another sentence with the word "Men", I think I would have thrown the iron through the TV (I like multitasking, especially to go through bad movies). It must have been a meager year for both of us to sign up for this movie. Washing cars to make a living would probably be good enough for them now. And the bad guy ... if he was that bad, because he didn't shoot all those rich college kids instead of promising toilet breaks. Even the title was a misnomer. A 'Crash Landing' means that the plane actually crashes and does not only land without a token or no one injured. Instead of landing safely, the plane should have crashed and burned just like the script. <br /> <br /> THIS FILM IS STINKER!
