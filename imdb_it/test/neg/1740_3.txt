This weak attempt to turn your typical Japanese horror movie more towards a gruesome cult hit didn't have the ammunition needed to keep the viewer involved all the time. Translated to the vortex, Uzumaki speaks precisely of this - an irrational and overabundant tribute to the strange spiral descending into nothingness that has apparently fascinated an entire small city in madmen obsessed with dementia. While this surely makes a b-movie on the surface pleasant, the traditionally annoying acting, directing and screenplay will have everyone, except for Asian horror fans, who shake their heads in dismay. What could roughly be translated into Japanese equivalent of a first piece by David Lynch, instead makes us suspect that they are spiral expedients even before they have the chance to explain themselves - which of course is not the case. Apart from some ingenious techniques used, the film rarely links the feared themes with the obtuse script, ending up being an economic exploitation of the cult genre, replacing the empty imaginary with the genuine substance. When the film was finished, there was almost nothing to gain from any of the interactions, except for a few scenes or images that rose above the film to a note. I appreciate the creators for having at least tried to bring the genus into supernatural and metaphysical realms and to understand the hard losses lost in the translation, but with the null substance to turn back everything is probably relegated to the dark fanboy's basement bong.
