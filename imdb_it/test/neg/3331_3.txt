This extremely low budget monster focuses on a group of miners exploring an abandoned gold mine to see if it's worth re-opening. They remain trapped after a cave and discover they are at the mercy of a strange slimy creature that seems intent on throwing them down one at a time. The word that came to my mind when I was watching this film was "desperate". The script and the acting are terrible, the effects of stop-motion monsters are unintentionally funny, and since most of the film takes place in underground lighting, the sets seem convincingly a logistical nightmare. All this said, however, for some reason, I felt that this film was not the result of a lack of commitment, but perhaps of the lack of budget, experience and / or lack of creative inspiration. Everything came out as if it were a university project or a first film made by amateurs, I have a certain amount of affection for films like that even when the target is completely missing. I think what I'm saying is that I give him a B for the effort and a D- for real results, not insultingly bad like some low-budget monster movies I've seen but still not worth seeing if you don't have much free time on your hands I will vote for 4.
