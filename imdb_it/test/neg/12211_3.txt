This film was so frustrating. Everything looked energetic and I was totally ready to have fun. At least I thought I could stand it. But I was wrong. First of all, the strange loop? It was like watching "America's funniest videos". The damn parents. I hated them so much. The typical Latin-stereo family? I need to talk to the person responsible for this. We need to talk. That little girl who was always hanging on to someone? I hated it and had to talk about it. Now, the final scene transcends, I must say. It is so gloriously bad and full of malice that it is a separate film. What a nasty dance. Horrible and beautiful at the same time.
