"Busy", as in Heather Graham being COMMITTED to saving her husband / marriage, and then being COMMITTED in a psychiatric ward in failing to do so: that clever and intelligent use of words. <br /> <br /> One of those insignificant films that want to be philosophical in which narration is a series of oh-wise observations that touch on poetry (a poem-club-poem of the 90s, better known as "poetry chit -chique "). Oh, it's so je-ne-sais-quoi ... Written / directed (or "auteured") by a woman (Lisa Krueger, whoever you are), this is a useless and lethargically full street film of New Years of spiritualistic nonsense and characters that are meant to be interesting but are simply seen first or simply trivial. The Latinos in this film, as part of the poor urban minority, are typically glorified in all their primitivism obsessed with mysticism as a "spiritually superior" people, which is the "highlight" of the political correctness of this film. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is lifeless and ceases to be so only when occasional cast members appear (Kay Place, Baker, Wilson). On the other hand, we have Casey Affleck, who is one of the best examples of why nepotism is on a par with first-degree murder as a crime. I have rarely seen a more apathetic "actor"; a thin and ugly idiot who sleepily crosses his lines, almost as if he were uttering them in a half-awake near-dream, in addition to that weak voice, one of the weakest male voices I've ever heard in my life. (He must have gone to the Toby Maguire Lethargy School of Acting.) To launch this idiot in ANYTHING, he talks about ANY film, that is ANY director or producer. So, Lisa Krueger is a waste of space without talent. We also have that moron who played the lead role in the MST3K-spoofed "werewolf"; I think his name is Goran Vishnjic, but I'm not sure. Check his ridiculous accent and stupid speech.
