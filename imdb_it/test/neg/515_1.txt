This is really a terrible movie from any of the normal parameters. Plot, plot, acting, effects, direction - I could go on. Suffice it to say that he is poor. However, it has a certain charm. Many totally out of context sex scenes appear, it's fun to look for Batman references. Umm - that's all. Really poor, don't worry.
