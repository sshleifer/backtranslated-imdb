This was one of the shows I wanted to follow. But, I couldn't really dedicate my time to this show. To have a show centered on the theme of politics, you really need a strong plot with twists to improve the atmosphere of the show, something like "The West Wing" or "Commander-in-Chief". Rob Lowe was OK, but actors like Kyle Chandler couldn't act (it was terrible in "Early Edition"). It was a pain to sit through this show. With his lack of suspense, urgency and characters that can actually act, I had to give up this show and I'm glad it was canceled so I wouldn't have anything left to lose. <br /> <br /> Grade D-
