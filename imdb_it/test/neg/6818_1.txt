Absolutely ridiculous movie that mocks the college admissions process. While it is true that the SAT is not all in a student's assessment for college admission, what the film talks about is completely ridiculous and is not worth resuming or seeing. <br /> <br /> College admissions officials are made to look like stupid people who have a very narrow vision of the whole process. The film is an insult to high school students who work hard and have to go through a long process until they receive that letter of acceptance or rejection from the schools they applied for. <br /> <br /> This film certainly deserves rejection at all levels.
