First of all, I will give this film a low score of 4 out of 10! It was nothing more than a movie for aspirants. I felt very disappointed watching this movie. I was brought to the people would be more dramatic and more facts about the true story on which it is based. Instead I spent more than an hour watching middle-aged media break the law and take drugs. <br /> <br /> It's a bit like a football factory, but without a real plot and not a good ending. After watching the film I was asked "What was the movie about?" If you like movies without a real plot and a lot of drugs and curses, then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of gangster and gangster movies but this movie isn't alive for the hype. I see where the writer was trying to go with the film but he never reached his destination. One of the worst British films I've ever seen. If only the film had more than one storyline, this would be a bad film.
