This film was terrible. I thought it would be OK but it got worse and worse. From the starting scenes it looks like he's heading for another safe safe, but by the time he gets home he disintegrates. None of the characters has a depth and the only person who was almost believable was Tom, although the way he became so easily distracted only bothered me after a while. The dialogue is ridiculous and the structure of the film is almost completely non-existent. In an offensive comedy attempt, the writer / director introduces a new character or event into virtually every scene, none of which is realistic, which makes it very confusing to keep track of what is happening. The plot is barely an excuse for a film: the boy likes the girl, the house sits at the fathers' house to meet the girl, destroys the house, takes the girl. A complete waste of time.
