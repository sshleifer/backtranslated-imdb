Being an admitted chess enthusiast, I was thrilled to see a documentary about the 1997 revenge between Garry Kasparov and IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer. I was hoping to see an in-depth view of the game and much of what Kasparov had to say. The boy was wrong and was wrong about a mile. This documentary looks a lot like many modern documentaries: there is a lot of flash but not a real substance. After looking at him, I am sad to say, I felt like I had lost time. One of the most annoying aspects of the documentary is that it doesn't stay in one place for a decent amount of time. It has the typical MTV type editing, in which the camera shows different images and quick bites from people every five seconds. It is very sad that the film production has been attenuated by the attention of a 10-year-old child. <br /> <br /> I understand that it is difficult to make a chess film, but this does not mean one should make it flashy. 'Game Over' had a couple of interesting ideas though. Has raised the idea that computers can think like human beings or not; if computers have advanced to a new unique level. This is what Kasparov thought after the game, but this film is not deep enough with this idea. Furthermore, this film tries to introduce a bizarre theory. Try to imply the paranoid that a human being was making the moves along with computer help. Kasparov had suspicions about this, but to this day there is no evidence. Towards the end of the film, he tries to imply the bizarre that perhaps Anatoly Karpov may have been the human being who was secretly making moves with the help of Deep Blue. Interesting to think, but I don't know how plausible or realistic it is. I would not recommend this film anyway, not even for chess fans.
