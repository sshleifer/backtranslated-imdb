For science fiction fans this will be better than anything that can work on TV at any time; this is the best you can say. Good points; blow and sense of humor are less boring than usual in these films, the plot is consistent and does not use mystical magical revelations. Negative points; writers try to make good sciences, but it falls in direction and production (for example, a mole that uses overheated rock perforations breaks the surface under water with a boiling bubble or cauldron to see), the characters are clich√©s and the plot is unfolding is pretty standard series. OK for a typical evening too tired to do - anything; but don't expect major building or even discussion points.
