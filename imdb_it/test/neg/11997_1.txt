This film really started when a poor boy is attacked by a pack of wild dogs. After a tense chase, he is saved by a grandfather with a magic whip. <br /> <br /> We are then presented with a series of annoying housemates, including a tart that is always half-dressed. During this phase the film increases the tension with strange "plinky" background noises that put me on the edge of the seat. <br /> <br /> I stopped paying attention for a while but when I looked back at the screen where the strange creatures do things that go around grunting and killing. A tip if you are trapped at home by some crazy person - take cardboard boxes and a tray. <br /> <br /> Even if we missed half of the film, because it was not absolutely interesting or memorable, we are now at the splendid conclusion, the last surviving creature fights a "Whip Duel" with his grandfather and his magical whip . I won't say what happens here, but I can say that the battle of the whip is full of tension, with aerial clashes, split-level clashes and all sorts of drama. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to push this movie through the door of a neighbor I don't like.
