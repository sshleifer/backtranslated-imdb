Aaran is one of the movies where you find holes in Indian cinema. Here is a good example to show how writers, directors and excellent actors succumb to producers. Here is one of the most wonderful actors, Mohanlal, who plays a film about a true story in Kashmir. The seriousness of the film is massacred with sub standard comedy scenes and songs. There is this character, Havaldar Jaykumar, who is actually the son of the film's producer. So he doesn't have his hair cut despite his officer asking him to do it. This kid does not know what he is acting and he is the "hero" of the film. God Help Indian cinema with these producers. <br /> <br /> This film is a pathetic demonstration of what is happening in Kashmir. A sensible observer can intuitively understand the constraints of wonderful writers, actors and directors who want to share their real-life experiences. But the unfortunate part is that a film on the highest levels of the Indian Militia turns out to be a pathetic show that suggests the film was stupid. <br /> <br /> We should oust these producers in the film industry and pave the way for good cinema.
