Entering the teaching of Mrs. Tingle, all I wanted was a fun and enjoyable teenage comedy that would entertain me for her running time. Despite a rather good first half hour, the film quickly slips into a dull and banal mess that is as fun as pulling out eyelashes with pliers. Rusty pliers, to that. "Scream" writer Kevin Williamson has written and directed this film, and has shown that Scream may have been an accident. Most of the elements of this film have already been seen a million times in other films; and while it was OK for him to steal items from other Scream movies, because it is intended as a slasher tribute; here it seems that he is short of ideas. The plot follows the most intelligent girl at school, played by Katie Holmes. After being caught betraying with two of his friends; the three decide to take the teacher who took them hostage in his own home. However, this is not just a teacher; it's Mrs. Tingle, the meanest bitch at school. Not even she is tied to the bed lying down, as she starts playing mind games to turn her captors against each other. <br /> <br /> The plot is very similar to the 1997 movie "Suicide Kings" and a whole series of previous films. In reality it is not a bad idea for a film, and if Williamson could have popularized the film with interesting characters; it would have worked really well. Mrs Tingle's character is the most interesting of the film, but it is massively one-dimensional, and like all the other characters in the film; it is simply a caricature. The acting is largely diabolical, with the exception of Helen Mirren in the title role. She is adequately evil in the role, and while she doesn't have much to put her teeth into; he clearly enjoys playing the central figure. The youthful cast is not worth mentioning, with only Katie Holmes standing out; and this is true only for his star profile, not for his acting talents. Williamson has draped almost all of the scenes into boring rock music, which would be really boring if the movie wasn't absolutely terrible. Honestly, this film has some moments that are quite good; but basically, if you want to see a good example of teenage comedy, this is not the movie you want to see.
