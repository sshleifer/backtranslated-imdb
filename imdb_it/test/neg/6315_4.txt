This film is based on the Street Fighter Alpha (or Zero) series! It is positioned in another scenario than the Streetfighter, the animated film! This film is all about Ryu who is accompanied by Ken and Chun Li. I recognized Rose, Zanghief and Birdie! There were no other characters used by the video game (that I could discover)! The fighting scenes were OK but nothing really spectacular! And there weren't many of them! It's strange for me! It's not Streetfighter to fight! Streetfighter the animated movie (1994) is far superior to this film. Try to be more than it really is! The use of "Hada Power" and other supernatural elements have nothing to do with the skills that the characters have in the video game! And in this case it's a bad thing! The story is so boring that you don't care what's going on! The action is greatly attenuated! Why? And what happened to the other characters in the video game! Surely they are more interesting than the villain in this story! The main attraction of the video game are the characters with their special abilities! In this film it's all about Ryu! This is why this anime fails!
