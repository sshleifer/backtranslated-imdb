August 25, 2003 League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is one of the greatest of all time and I've been a fan of his since the 1950s. I went to this movie because Sean Connery was the main actor. I had not read reviews or had any prior knowledge of the film. The film surprised me a lot. The scenery and attractions were spectacular, but the plot was unreal to the point of being ridiculous. In my mind this was not one of his best films could be the worst. Because he chose to be in this film is a mystery. For me, going to this film was a waste of my time. I will continue to go to his films and add his films to my video collection. But I can't see wasting money putting this film into my collection
