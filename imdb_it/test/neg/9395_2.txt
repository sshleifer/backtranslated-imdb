This film was completely unhealthy, disturbing and unsatisfactory. Apart from some good shots of Italy, there is nothing to recommend this film. As usual, Hollywood draws the wrong conclusion from a fractured existence: the next guy you meet, with whom you sleep after learning for a few hours, must be Mr. Right. As for humor, there are some in the film, but I can't see how anyone could label this a romantic comedian since about three-quarters of the film is absolutely depressing! My recommendation? Skip it in theaters, wait for it to come out on DVD, then jump there too. I want someone to give me back the two hours I wasted watching this disaster, drivel, waste.
