This "movie" will give me nightmares, I'll wake up drenched in sweat, screaming "I didn't make this movie, please don't blame me!" Honestly, I think it would have been more fun to watch a fat boy eating lard in his moms' cellar for an hour or two, rather than watching this shit. I understand that the money was tight, but damn what the hell they thought there was no thought, plot or effort put into this. This film needs a warning "Please, for God's sake, do not fund the local JC acting department". On another note these are the least likeable characters I've ever seen, and I've seen films with Hitler in them. So, last, follow my advice the next time you plan to rent this, just blow up a few hundred Adivls and let the sleep come.
