Only this is a waste of time. Nowadays MTV is churned out for TV movies in quite some time. A friend of mine recommended this to me and I rented it, needless to say, I will not pursue his advice anytime soon. This film shows the roller coaster of drug use. The problem is that you don't care about any of the characters due to the lack of credibility and self-discipline. This film is in a word, annoying to look at, from the terrible corners of the camera to the quality of dialogue and rhythm. The "digital" format seeks realism, but gets distracted. If you want a real target on drug observation look at Requiem for a Dream.
