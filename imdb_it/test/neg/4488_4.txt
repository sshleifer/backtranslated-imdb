This film has the potential to be a great movie for me, Nicholas Sparks is a great novelist and this film has all the credentials to live up to The Notebook, but apart from the two has a dream team. leads in McAdams and Gosling, but here the balance is thrown miserably out of Channing Tatum's inept acting <br /> <br /> I heard that many scenes were irregular due to his performance, many of the emotions in various scenes are lost because she can't act, leaving an embarrassing and irregular situation, Amanda Seyfried gave a great performance just to drop Tatum and the mood is lost and the scene can't recover. <br /> <br /> This story deserved to be just cast, but what he got was a nice guy who can't act. Tatum should stick to what is good, the films that most affect his physical abilities, even if horrible, like GI JOE, step up and Fighting. The less you talk, the better. <br /> <br /> Try not to think of me as a hated Channing Tatum junkie. I went to this movie with an open mind, because I was surprised many times by how Adam Sandler in Reign over Me. I gave Tatum the same chance that I didn't see him here as the sum of his past roles, simply for the his performance in this film, which sadly was a disappointment
