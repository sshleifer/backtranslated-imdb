I actually own this movie which is the MST3K version called "Cave Dwellers" which is really the only way anyone can really watch a movie like this. If it weren't for Joel, Crow and Tom Servo constantly making jokes, it wouldn't be possible to go through this piece of shit. You have a hero named Ator who looks a lot like Jeff Spigoli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and looks only slightly smarter, just without being stoned. Face cavemen (cave dwellers?) Invisible boys, a giant snake (with a group of retentive anal snakes who like to align all the skulls the same way), invents a hang glider that looks suspiciously like a modern aluminum one with some screws cheap wrapped around it, and then fights with the evil guy from John Saxon. Then he rides through the tire tracks where someone has been on four wheels. <br /> <br /> Yes, I received most from MST3K, which as I said is the only way to see this turkey from a movie. If it weren't for that, it would get zero stars.
