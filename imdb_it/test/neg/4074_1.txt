This film was embarrassing in its clich√©s, poor acting and generally low production values. He starts off badly with the long-haired 3-star general calling the hero, Masters, "older" when he obviously wears the silver oak leaves of Lieutenant Colonel. But the most distressing thing was the crew of soldiers on the Neptune atoll. How can you not experience any kind of reality? They were all experts at flying over a 747 and the scenes of the soldiers digging the moat were beyond comedy. ATTENTION: THIS FILM IS DANGEROUS FOR YOUR INTELLECTUAL HEALTH! LOOK AT YOUR PERILO!
