I saw this film when it was premiered in Los Angeles. I think I laughed 2 or 3 times. For the rest of the time I was shocked at how ridiculous / ill shot and poorly written. Kirby is the only thing that saves in the film. I was disappointed with Larry Bagby's performance, which I usually find amusing. If you like watching your friend's home-made short films shot on their mom's 8mm video camera, then there's a small chance that you might like this movie. Then again part of what makes those movies enjoyable is that your friends play all the parts. You don't know these people, so you'll probably find it as boring and stupid as me. Dear Mr. Nelson, back to film school, intern for a while as a technical assistant or a work fist or low-level job so you can see how things are done correctly in the film. So look for the time needed to find a cinematographer who knows what f. stop means, make sure it has the ND filter handy. Then try again. Repeat as often as necessary.
