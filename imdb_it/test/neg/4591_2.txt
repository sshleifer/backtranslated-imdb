I should know better. I've seen too many early Rob Lowe jobs to expect something good from this movie, even if it's Hockey. <br /> <br /> Here we have, once again, another tired sports theme. Kid has the potential for greatness, he has the appearance of going far if his arrogant attitude does not ruin everything. And, boom, it comes out like that kind of helluva player. Is that all you can say about sports movies? Surely, there must be other companies that the athletes undertake. <br /> <br /> However, this film must be one of the greatest cheeseballs. Everyone's interactions are simply silly, and not in a stupid-fun way. And I can't think of any ancillary qualities that can revive my position. Not the actors (certainly not Swayze who plays Lowe's reluctant mentor), not history, not music, and very little from skating sequences. <br /> <br /> Normally, I suck for 80s movies, although they tend to be a bit "fishy" (ie North Shore, the Karate Kid), but this isn't even a good basket of the 80s. For a good sports movie from the 1980s, check elsewhere. There are many out there.
