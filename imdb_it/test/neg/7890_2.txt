The Emperor's dog (Richard Haydn) is engaged to Johanna's dog (Joan Fontaine). However, when Virgil (Bing Crosby) arrives in town to sell a turntable with the gramophone to the Emperor, his dog is attacked by Johanna's dog. After a revenge attack in which Virgil is banished from the city, a psychoanalyst insists that Johanna's dog must face Virgil's dog so that he can overcome his dog fears. This is organized and dogs fall in love. So do Virgil and Johanna. The rest of the film goes through romance and eventually Johanna's dog gives birth. But who is the father .......? <br /> <br /> The history of the dog is the very weak vehicle that is used to try to create a story between humans. It's a terrible plot. There are 3 main musical pieces that are all junk - bad songs and terrible choreography. It's just an extremely boring movie - Bing has too many words in each sentence and delivers them in an almost screaming and irritating way. It's not funny ............ NEVER .......... but it had to be. Bing and Joan have done much better than this.
