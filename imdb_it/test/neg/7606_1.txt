I made the mistake of looking at "Dark Star" (1974) late at night many years ago. It was one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen: <br /> <br /> 1. Bad acting. <br /> <br /> 2. Bad writing. <br /> <br /> 3. Scientifically stupid story. (Destroy an entire planet because its orbit is unstable or otherwise will make things worse: instead of having a large object, easily avoidable, you will have thousands of smaller objects, but equally lethal and more difficult to trace.) /> 4. Completely unrealistic characters A beach ball painted as a space alien? The writers must have done too many drugs. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, most of the actors in "Dark Star" have done nothing else. Of those who have done anything else, most have never played again after Dark Star. Therefore, having Dark Star in her acting resume was a mortal death for her acting career!
