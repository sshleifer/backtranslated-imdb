Parties: The Clonus Horror is not so bad as a movie. I have the MST3K version on tape and it's hilarious, but it's still not the worst movie I've ever made. I would say that it was better than 80% of the films they made fun of. The concept could have worked if they had a better script, more money and decent actors. It could have become a classic if it weren't so boring and had a little more excitement. Unfortunately it was badly put into production and ended up on MST3K.
