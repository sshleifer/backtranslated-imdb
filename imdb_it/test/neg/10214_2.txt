A new wrestling show paves the way for the most feared fighter ever imaginable, the giant Zeus. Network president Brell does everything in his power to lure WWF champion Rip into the square circle to face Zeus for the "Battle of the Tough Guys" championship. But Zeus is unlike any other competitor I've ever faced. <br /> <br /> Normally I would have given Hogan a margin of freedom for the role of wrestler in a film role, however this film didn't ask the Hulkster to do much of a bit, he simply asked Hogan to interpret himself, which has failed miserably. 'Tiny' Lister made a good effort like the powerful Zeus, but his work also left the film devoid of something, or acting! <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, if you wish, with a pinch of salt and a sense of humor, otherwise you'll probably have to turn it off a little over ten minutes in.
