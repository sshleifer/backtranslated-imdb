Don't waste time or money going to see it or even rent it. It's by far the worst move I've ever seen. Your two hours (too long) of your life will never come back. If you are trying to be afraid, go and see something else. We went with someone who still has nightmares about the Gremlins and wasn't in the least afraid. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that make this movie an incredibly poor attempt to make money. Now, before starting, let me tell you that I loved the first Grudge! However the second is something of a different story. The plot is very thorough and intricate. However in the end you're wondering "what the hell was this or that." The acting would be considered poor in a pornography film with a list B. I could find several examples, but I don't want to ruin it for those who are full of pens, but I can summarize two horrible hours in two simple words ... it's spreading.
