In the mid-1990s, the career of director and animator Don Bluth seemed to have fallen to historic lows. First, Bluth had made a series of popular animated films, many of which remained much loved today as "The Land Before Time" (1988), "The Secret of NIMH" (1982) and "An American Tail" (1986 ). But starting with "Thumbelina" in 1994, his films seemed to decrease more and more in terms of quality and popularity and one of the many unfortunate voices is the 1995 box office bomb "The Pebble and the Penguin", a film that did not attract members of the public over parents and children under the age of seven. Frankly, the latter are the only members of the public that I can understand enjoying this rather bland animation feature. <br /> <br /> The plot is absurd. The film is played by a rude, stuttering and chubby penguin named Hubie (voiced by Martin Short) who falls in love with a female penguin with a surprisingly healthy flower on his head (Annie Golden's voice). ORDER OF like in real life, penguins present their spouses with a pebble as a substitute for a ring. But when Hubie is swept away by the current, he joins a lone rockhopper (James Belushi) with a dream of flying and they race against time to return to Antarctica before it's too late. The reasons why they might be too late is one of the many underdeveloped elements of this weak story that would still be weak even if they were there. <br /> <br /> It becomes very clear very soon because this animated children's musical will not and will not work for anyone over the age of six or seven. It simply has none of the qualities required for a good animated function. Number one, the film looks bad because of a very poor design style. The animation in this film is very picturesque (also with regard to animated films); it is dark, gloomy, there is no vividness in the colors, and moreover, the design of the film and the elements in it are universally funny and ridiculous. Take for example the penguins who act in the film. With only a few background exceptions, every single penguin looks nothing like a bird. Hubie, for example, seems ridiculously ridiculous with wide cheeks, a squat beak, big eyes and that absurd hat he wears wherever he goes. Combined with his hand-like "fins", it looks like Chris Farley in a penguin suit. Result: it is an ugly and poorly designed cartoon character. But the most absurd and absurdly designed character is the evil penguin, Drake, who frankly doesn't look like a penguin at all. He is a muscular man who wears a penguin mask. It has a larger chest than Arnold Schwarzenegger's and larger teeth than the teeth of leopard seals and killer whales that act as predators of the film. Basically, it's a two-dimensional recycled villain. He lives in a skull-shaped cave, wears a cloak, laughs a lot and gets angry when people laugh with him. Result: who cares? And what is also bad, and perhaps worse, is that this is an animated musical and there is not a single song worthy of note or memorable to find anywhere in its running time. The opening hymn was harmless, not memorable, but harmless. But after this, the songs became more opaque and opaque and there was one in particular that made me grimace to the end. It is the moment when the spectators press the fast forward button for when it comes out. <br /> <br /> I heard that "The Pebble and the Penguin" was a bit boring, except for the few moments when Hubie and the rockhopper penguin I Rocko are endangered to the jaws of leopards and killer whales , which fortunately did not have dialogues and were treated as animals rather than as cartoon characters. But in a sense, for this reason, I can't recommend this film to children at all. This is the reason. The film shows that killer whales are the natural predator of penguins. My concern is that children who are familiar with "Free Willy" (1993) may be offended or discouraged by seeing their favorite sea inhabitants portrayed as a bloodthirsty carnivore. The leopard seal was a better antagonist and it was more fun to see how his jaws were thrown open more than a rattlesnake and how he seemed to smile as he growled. But the point is really, these moments with the predators ?? and there are only a few ?? they are the only interesting moments. And they are not enormously interesting, mind you. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, I can't recommend it to anyone under the age of seven. My advice: if you have children around that page, rent them for them. They might like it.
