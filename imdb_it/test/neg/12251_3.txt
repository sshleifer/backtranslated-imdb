Your idol will deceive you in this movie. Stephen Nichols is as battered as a young German student still bent under his father's orders, although the actor obviously seems to be close to 40. This makes his relationship (a collection of copulation scenes in practice) with a very young girl all the more disturbing. The character has no dimensions and the depiction of war serves only as a backdrop for this pornographic aspirant. Nichols, who is one of the best performers of daytime TV, shows no passion for what will be the main interest of this movie: watching him always having sex with this girl. It's like looking at two animals that go there. If you are a fan of the talent of this actor in other projects, don't rent it for yourself you will never see it the same way. If, on the other hand, you want to see Stephen Nichols have an orgasm in front of the camera, you might like: Stephen will show you his bare ass, a lot of work on the tongue, his range of groans, but not his talent like this character that is obviously equally motivated by sex and bad judgment as it was for having wanted to do such personal things in front of the camera. He might have found it extravagant but I didn't - a big trick!
