By far this is the worst Halloween movie ever made. The acting is bad, except for Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence. The girl who played Kara (she forgot her name) was ok, but overall this movie was basically a big disappointment. Nothing has moved the story forward, lacked substance, and the fears that made Halloween and H20 so good. All in all, skipping this movie is not worth the rental price.
