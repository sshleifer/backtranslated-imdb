Everyone I know loves this movie, but I'm afraid it doesn't. I hated this movie so much that I had to turn it off in the middle of the film due to revulsion. Too much time is devoted to flattery and emotional madness, the point where Bullock's character is devastated by his divorce is excessively hammered into the viewer's head. Enough already !! And why haven't we heard more about her ex-husband? He is portrayed only as a dress that comes from time to time. Something had to make her want to marry him, what was it? What is it about him that makes her so devastated by their divorce? More than that time could have been spent on that, rather than another shot of Bullock lying slumped on the bedroom floor. The dialogue is drawn up, clich√© and terrible, very similar to one of those trivial "ABC Afterschool Specials" or something like that. There is no imagination or creativity about something in this film, it's all very predictable and therefore boring. This movie also goes into overdrive on the cutting factor, very stupid and not as fun as it should have been! This is just another one of the films "I am woman, hear me roar" done horribly, much like "Waiting To Exhale". If you want to see "I am a woman, listen to me roar" movies that are really fun, original and well made, so see "Gas Food Lodging" or "Ruby in Paradise". Skip this shit !! I give "Hope Floats" 3/10.
