The Grudge 2 ... Let's see. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Japanese horror film or horror or hatred. I loved the first and the original Ju-On. I feel that much more justice would have been done for this. Aubrey existed only to fill in what had to be "discovered" in the finale, (that if you have already seen Ju-On before this, you already know the whole movie) everything that was actually was a complete remake of Ju-On, followed more closely from The Grudge. Although everyone thought it came to America it was a bit interesting, it was expected while the burning house at the end of The Grudge left the second wish for a new plot. <br /> <br /> Save your $ 6.50 and wait for it to be released on DVD, rent it, watch it and then decide if you want to buy it. This movie is good for falling asleep at 2 am. But in general, I'd say a 4 out of 10. Sorry, Grudge fans, it's just ... They just failed at this.
