I enjoyed the first 45 minutes. or so, but then suddenly it was all downhill. The suspense began to shrink a little and the jokes were almost the same everywhere. What made us go ahead were the good actors. <br /> <br /> But the problem with this film is that it's trying to be cleverly funny, like Tarantino and god is obsolete stuff. Tarantino is a bit overrated at times, this film comes ten years late. At best it is for teenagers, and I'm sure many of them find the character of Johann amusing, which is for the first 30 minutes. The other problem I have with this is that the story fades more and more towards the end, I tried to find a recovery point. Perhaps he has not recovered because the lack of passion comes with the effort to try to be intelligently funny. Moreover, as in many films, of course, good actors who can afford it do not seem to ask for a better dialogue, or simply lower the script.
