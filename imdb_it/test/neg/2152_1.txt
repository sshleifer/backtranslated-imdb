I simply can't believe that the people who did and performed in this movie took it seriously. The scenes on SNL seem more real. Everything was ridiculously false. The foolish gunfights, the ridiculous fistfights, the dialogues, the mushy background music and even the blind eye of Bo. If it had been advertised as a comedy, it would have made more sense, but it would still be bad. I can see this as "entertainment" only if you get a room full of college kids looking at it like it's the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Imagine some of the things you saw on Blazing Saddles, like Mongo who knocks down the horse or the old lady punched herself in the stomach. Now imagine that the producer wants you to take these scenes seriously and get the elements of this disaster.
