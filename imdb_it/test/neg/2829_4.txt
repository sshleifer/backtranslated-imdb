After receiving a DVD of this with a Sunday newspaper, I was hoping that they weren't the usual duff movies that are given away because no one would ever buy them. I was wrong. Sheens's acting is on a par with that of a ten-year-old girl in a pantomime production of the school and the same goes for most of the cast. Neill is satisfying, but plays a Russian and is not helped by his Northern Irish / New Zealand hybrid accent, and not even the rest of the KGB characters, who all seem to be at a Cambridge Footlights meeting. In fact, the only people with genuine accents are the extras that provide a strange word here and there, helping us to know at least where the hell is going on in what would otherwise be a complete mush. The "espionage" factor is largely unconvincing and consists mainly of Sheen, who puts on various ridiculous disguises while trying to blend into the background, quickly becoming not only boring but ridiculous. The plot has potential but is completely killed by the rest of the confused production elements. This could have been much better.
