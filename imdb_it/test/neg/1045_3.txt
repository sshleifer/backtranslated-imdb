The Twilight Zone has reached a certain mythology about it - very similar to Star Trek. This is because there are many devoted show-lovers who do not care what they think each episode was a winner. They are those who total every single show at 10 and cannot objectively evaluate the show. For this reason, a while back I reviewed all the original Star Trek episodes (the good and the bad) because the ratings and overall reviews were simply too positive. Now it's time to do the same for The Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> Now I was very surprised when I saw the reviews of this bland episode that described him as "among the best" and gave him scores of 10 If this is the case, then why do everyone I know who Have they seen this episode hate it as much as I do? It is possible that I, my family and friends are all excited but it is also possible that this is another case of rabid fans who inflate the rating in an average episode or below average. <br /> <br /> The episode itself sees William Windom and others as various archetypes - a soldier, a dancer, etc. They are all stuck in a cylindrical room with no escape and only at the end do you realize the "shocking truth" - which is not at all shocking and is in fact largely lame. No, this is a badly written and non-engaging episode. Yes, there were a lot of episodes of the series that deserved a tenth, but few as undeserving as this due to a superficial script and an unattractive resolution.
