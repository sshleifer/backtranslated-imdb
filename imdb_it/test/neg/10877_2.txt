Quentin Tarantino once said that to be successful in the film industry you had to create your Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. The writer / actor / director Larry Bishop seems to have taken this advice a little too literally with Hell Ride and invented a messy tribute that borrows his images, music, work with the camera and the camera too heavily narrative that alters time. But to correctly imitate a Tarantino movie, you need to have a talent to build creative conversations; unfortunately, the main derailment element of Hell Ride is its atrocious ramblings and vulgar monologues that work only to disgust and confuse the public, while at the same time invoking pity for the actors just to get involved. <br /> <br /> The anti-hero gang of motorcyclists, The Victors, is composed of several weathered vigilantes who carry their mark of bloody justice to lawless streets. The leader, Pistolero (Larry Bishop), is determined to take revenge and put out fires. Gent (Michael Madsen) tries only to balance his chaotic and psychotic symphony of life by putting the lead in anyone who crosses his head, and Comanche (Eric Balfour) follows with a fierce loyalty and a mysterious past. <br /> <br /> On the evil front, Deuce (David Carradine) is the mind that orchestrates from afar, though not far enough, and Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) spits venom and obscene explanations for his tattoos while fiddling with a harpoon gun and a general disregard for life. While these characters may seem interesting on paper, once they are forced to challenge horribly ill-conceived dialogues, all the cool traces disappear faster than funding for Bishop's next film should be. <br /> <br /> While Hell Ride is full of imperfections and missed opportunities, the main side of its downfall lies in ill-conceived conversations. And since Bishop's main influences are Tarantino's clear films, there are many. The first twenty minutes of the film are almost unintelligible and would probably make sense to subtitles. When the main compression of Pistolero is introduced and some sentences are abused to the point of nausea, you will pray both for death and for the ability to deactivate the sound. Even Dennis Hopper has trouble staying cool while spitting out such stupid dialogue. Have you ever repeated a word or phrase to yourself so many times that it doesn't seem right or makes more sense? Bishop starts from there and then keeps the madness going until I envy the characters on the screen to cut off the heads. And when the dialogue finally takes a break, we are treated to shots interspersed with female wrestling nude and throats being cut. I'm not sure what effect Bishop was hoping to get, but I doubt he found it. <br /> <br /> Hell Ride wants to pay tribute to the films of Quentin Tarantino, the films of Robert Rodriguez and every film that idolizes the violent and devil-may-care attitudes of motorcyclists. But while his intentions may be noble, the hideously cringe-worthy dialogue and the hyper-stylized montage of timeline-mangling prevents the public from being run over with sturdy generic characters. The moment we discover the mystery behind the characters' motives (and it may be some time before you realized that there is a mystery to solve), it is too difficult to take care of them. And while everyone on the screen is clearly having fun, they completely neglected to translate any kind of entertainment for the public. <br /> <br /> - Joel Massie
