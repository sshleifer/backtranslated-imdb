Speck of white and various shapes, a beautiful nude, random images. This is what this little experimental short film is. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to think that in the early days of the film such images could be transferred to the film, but despite my love for many surreal images and films, and a fascination with the bizarre, this film did not for me. <br /> <br /> I don't mind seeing it, but if there is an underlying meaning in it, I don't do it. I understand it. Visually, it is not exceptional, in my humble opinion. As an example of Dadaism, I suppose it would fit quite well, since it seems to reject any semblance of logic or reason, although I would have preferred it to do so in a more visually interesting way. <br /> <br /> But to each his own.
