What this film has is its realism, you really have the feeling that the writer James Slater has done his homework about alpine skiing, while director Michael Ritchie shoots the film in a sprint about the style of wall documentaries. However the problem is that if you are not a big fan of this sport there is not much in DOWNHILL RACER to get your attention. <br /> <br /> Before anyone asks you why I saw it, I did it because the great Gene Hackman was present in a youthful role but that's not really a good reason to watch
