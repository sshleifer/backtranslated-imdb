This film features a rather decent FX sequence from a 1936 earthquake. The reason you didn't see it is because the 30's audience was in love with the "Jeanette MacDonald photo"; in which the homonymous star made its way through innumerable songs, while the plots stopped completely. The FX cross time very well. MacDonald's songs don't, and the embarrassing inclusion of these songs to show his typical talent is not good. <br /> <br /> The hoary device of two friends who grew up to become a priest and a hooligan is given another passage through the machine (Manhattan Melodrama, The Departed). At the 30-minute score, you've already heard the song "San Francisco" three times. Entertainment in the 1930s is generally an accumulation of irritation. Only the Grand Hotel of the decade gives up the disturbance shown in San Francisco, Dinner at 8, Little Caesar, Stagecoach, All Quiet on the western front, Les Miserables etc.
