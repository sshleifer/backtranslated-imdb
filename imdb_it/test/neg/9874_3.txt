I'm almost a human of two decades who has read comics for most of my life. I'm not a big fan of the Fantastic Four, but I'm pretty familiar with them. In 1994, Roger Corman (legend of the film B) produced the first feature film Fantastic Four, in my opinion. The result was so pure schlock that it was never released. However, there are copies, mostly on the net and at conventions. If you are looking for a laugh and you can find a copy, do yourself a favor and check this. <br /> <br /> The film basically summarizes the origin of the FF and a meeting with Doctor Doom and a villain called The Jeweler, essentially the Mole Man with a penchant for petty theft. As in the case of these comic films, everything has to bind to everything, so the FF plays a vital role in the creation of Dr. Doom, and he and the jeweler play a vital role in them. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would just like to remind you that, despite everything that went wrong in this movie, I actually liked the guy who played Doom. It doesn't get many decent lines, but when it does it hits them. Even the armor looks pretty good. <br /> <br /> For the rest ... it's a dirty and dirty mess. Bad plots, bad acting, bad effects, all bad at the bottom. Boos in particular to Jay Underwood, bringing a new meaning to the word that acts like Johnny Storm. It is not an exaggeration, it is ultracting. <br /> <br /> As for the FF, well, they all look right, and Sue is played by a very attractive actress, but she just doesn't look like a real team. First, they have no reason for Sue and Johnny to go into space. In one of the first sections, Ben and Reed go to visit the two, Johnny's like 8 and Sue's at around 12. It does nothing but make their eventual romantic mating a much more disturbing helluva. Thing's costume seems more reptilian than anything else, not very rocky, and the only time the Human Torch is really a Human Torch looks like the red-colored Silver Surfer. <br /> <br /> I could type for hours, but I think the scene that best sums up is an encounter that takes place with the not-so-human torch mentioned above. He is running a laser beam and finally destroys it with a punch. Yes, a punch. A laser beam With a fist. Then fly up and go "Yippeee!" quite a bit, after which the camera tilts down and he turns back TOWARDS THE EARTH. Evidently Reed the intellectual has forgotten to inform Johnny that fire does not exist in the emptiness of space. This and many other scenes work like Looney Toones, if the character doesn't know they are on a cliff, they don't fall. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I was glad that he had never been released.
