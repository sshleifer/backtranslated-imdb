I took my family to see Barnyard last weekend. We had long awaited but my children had not been there, my husband and I would have left. Coming from a farming community, we found that all the male cattle in the film with udders drawn on them were a bit creepy. We felt like we were looking at crossed cows or something. It was strange to hear a male voice coming from a female body. After checking some of the production notes on another website, I felt like the animators might have collapsed on this. I know this is just an animated and fun show, but putting the female body parts on a male, I had to suspend disbelief so much that I couldn't enjoy the movie as I could. I know that the udders can be found amusing but they were definitely too used. None of the other animals in the film seemed to have gender specific body parts drawn on them and I would have preferred that the bulls of this show had at least the correct ones if they were to be attracted at all. However the children still enjoyed the film, although we took the time to make sure they knew the difference between bulls and cows.
