The way this script was ever sold, less produced and distributed is way ahead of me. The dialogue was so bad that it was disgusting. The train and helicopter scenes seemed to have been made on flash cards by high school students. Lou Diamond Phillips must have been hiding under his seat when this --- this "movie"? it was shown at a private screening after it probably left the back door. The only emotion that aroused in me was the pity for the cast, they had to "bite the bullet" to overcome this. I couldn't bear to look at everything, it was so predictable that it was fun. Who knows, maybe he will be caught by one of the networks as a comedy of the situation.
