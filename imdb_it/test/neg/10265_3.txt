(Spoilers more than likely ... nothing really important you couldn't have understood on your own) Yes, it's really weird. I rented it to Blockbuster for the reason that it had absolutely no description of the film on the back of the box, just a list of the bands that contained songs. But later, I had plenty of time to find it, even here on IMDB. I kept confusing him with "Night of the Demons", but, you know, it's pretty much the same thing. <br /> <br /> The parts I loved most about this movie was the whole thing in the garage. That black gym guy was hilarious in the way he shouted EVERY time. Even when the screams weren't really necessary, he let himself go "LISTEN NOW! LOCK THE DOOR WITH THE CARS !!!!" and so, they would drive cars on other cars. But then he got balls and a zombie fuck with a broomstick I think it was. The other part that caught my attention was the part with the crash outside the building with the guys that their girlfriend didn't want to come ... What significant aspect of the movie did she give us this? What was that? Why was he there? Why did the film end with a boy who broke the TV in a studio? I saw that there was a zombie running towards the screen, but it was quite far. I mean, he could have turned off the TV. Yes, this movie was shot on a whim and yes, I hated it. Good day...
