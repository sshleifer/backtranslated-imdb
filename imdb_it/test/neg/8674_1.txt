I'm not a Jane Austen purist, but why make a film like this if you have nothing to say. <br /> <br /> Billie Piper was so wrong for the part that's hard to know where to start - wrong personality, modern makeup, completely wrong hair (there's no way a girl her age would have let loose in public with loose hair and sloppy in that way), did not seem particularly mild or cheated by the family and I did not understand why everyone seemed to think of her as particularly holy or kind. <br /> <br /> The picnic (replaced for the ball) was so low budget that it was embarrassing to watch and completely lose the section of Portsmouth destroyed the point of the piece (besides losing scenes that could have added a cruel counterpoint to that oh-so-claustrophobic pink living room.) <br /> <br /> To the managers: -If you don't have the imagination (even the budget doesn't matter as much as the imagination) to do something meaningful with an adaptation please don't pretend to be hating Jane Austen. <br /> <br /> It was about 10% of Mansfield Park and 90% of nothing at all <br /> <br /> PS Edmund was very good
