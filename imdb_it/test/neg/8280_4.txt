A pretty lousy and horrible asshole about someone who kills members of a high school athletic team after their star racer dies during a meeting. <br /> <br /> Christopher George gives an exaggeratedly exaggerated performance as an athletic team coach. I don't think anyone has ever caught on as seriously as Chris does here - not even in the Olympics. It's a typically divine CG performance, and if you're a fan of man / legend, you should run outside and get a copy. <br /> <br /> But let's look at the snipers for the murders (you know it's true), not the performances, and on the day of graduation he can't deliver the most counts (there's a good kill). The real horror comes only during a performance of the band "Felony". Ever heard of them? Watch the day of graduation and find out why.
