I wrote the spoiler alert, but there's not much that can be ruined. It's like ruining rotten meat. This film is probably the worst I've ever seen. Not because of the actors or special effects, but because of the huge number of errors, both factual and physical. First of all, MIGs are not really MIGs. They are Mirages and they are French. And how the hell can Doug's dad put up with the maneuvers his son does to fight the "Mig" without a suit? And why would Chappy try to get on his plane without a suit? And how could Doug defeat the enemy's ace so easily? Anyway, I didn't like this movie. And the worst part is that it has 3 sequels, the last of the later ones in 1995. Now it's scary.
