The Comebacks is a parody of inspirational sports movies, and let me tell you: it's not a good idea. Tom Brady (the director) probably found it exhilarating to refer to sports films (from Gridiron Gang, Invincible and even Miracle! A The Longest Yard and Dodgeball-yes Dodgeball!) And throwing a couple of sex lines, that would be more fun since Airplane! Well, he was wrong. They did such a slippery job, you thought it was written in a week. I discovered that if a director loves the genre, the film will be good. Obviously, Brady doesn't like the kind that is spoofing. This film is a rancid piece of trash that isn't worth seeing, so don't see it!
