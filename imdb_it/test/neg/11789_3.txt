I really wanted this movie so much. Great cast ?? Walter Pidgeon in a role that reminds us of his iconic "Forbidden Planet", Barbara Eden and Robert Sterling as young lovers, Frankie Avalon as a musically inclined sailor (is he a submarine sailor?), Even Peter Lorre as a scientist with a predilection for sharks. Maybe it's a good movie for children but I had trouble staying awake. Lorre was severely underused. I suppose it was a red herring, like Pidgeon ?? you expect him to go crazy and try to throw the hero or his girlfriend into the shark tank. Not much luck. By the way, why is there a tank of sharks on a submarine? It is typical of the film's lack of ambition. They explain why Lorre is doing the shark back and forth (because we are seeing it), but we are just waiting for it to accept the fact that there is a shark on this subtitle for some reason. "Search?" Yes, scientists always do that research, who can understand them? Of course, if there wasn't a shark, who would kill the bad psychologist (Joan Fontaine)? I'm sorry, but even children's films from the 1950s are able to be less predictable and frankly idiotic (not to mention exploitation). <br /> <br /> The first 10 or 15 minutes really have my hopes. Great theme song sung by Frankie Avalon. Pidgeon driving Floyd the Barber (Howard McNear actually, sorry Howie loved you in "Blue Hawaii") and Joan Fontaine on a guided tour, careful to skip the room with the huge "ATTENTION" sign on the door, beyond Peter Lorre with the aforementioned sharks, and then we see a full-screen shot of Eden shaking its moneymaker in Avalon's passionate horn! The film quickly passes downstream from there. There is no real explanation for the firestorm that threatens the Earth, so there is a distinct lack of dramatic tension and no bad to use. Instead, Pidgeon's character is transformed into an unconvincing red herring of the Ahab variety (I believe "The Caine Mutiny" was still fresh in people's minds), and Fontaine's character suddenly becomes evil for no reason at all. Oh, I suppose the reason is that it's a surprise to the public. And it's a bit surprising, since the only negative thing he has done is speak ill of the captain's mental health and there is still no reason why he did the sabotage after it turned out to be the bad one. Very badly done and unconvincing. The guy who was the pessimistic bible of the bible was better ?? at least his character made sense. <br /> <br /> So what else could go wrong? Endless and endless underwater shooting. I never understand the charm of this kind of thing. A giant squid attacks the ship for a minute, just so there is a monster for the theatrical trailer. Perhaps this has deceived some people into thinking it would be a fantasy adventure movie, instead of a suspenseful movie on fire on military scientists who never make mistakes. Yup ?? perhaps worst of all, it is barely a fantasy film and much less a science fiction film. He never did anything for my imagination because the whole premise was nothing but another disaster / apocalypse and these characters never feel any sense of wonder or discovery. I'm done with Irwin Allen. I've never liked his later films, but this made me pretending to be Jules Verne when in reality it's just another formula for escape from disaster. The whole film is just waiting to see which character is unlikely to transform the evil and die. He has always hired an actor / actress with a fascinating and sympathetic character to play these roles and this is the only element of "surprise" to be found, since there is no logic to these characters. What a pathetic waste of time for these actors. George Pal's films are 100 times better (the only one who was lame was "Atlantis", which, not surprisingly, was the most allen-esquire), full of wonder and excitement and ?? think about it! ?? ideas! Apart from some effects scenes and Barbara Eden, there's nothing worth seeing here, in my opinion. I guess it's fun for those involved in catastrophic movies, but I think they're a boring and boring kind of movie.
