An involuntary and hilarious talkie melodrama with Kay Francis while Countess Balakireff chases everything in her underwear. At the beginning of the film she "throws back" the groom to be too young before leaving for the driver! The English high-pitched set in which he moves is a group of so trivial harummpfers that it's ridiculous. But the topper is Basil Rathbone as an Italian violinist with a Chico Marx accent! "My violeen! How come I played eet again!" "Patreecia, my meelk is cold!" It is camped beyond imagination.
