MINOR PLOT SPOILER AHEAD !!! <br /> <br /> How have so talented actors been involved in such a drastic grid <br /> <br /> drivel? Robert DeNiro plays a stupid Hollywood version of the standard <br /> <br /> cop prone to violence (that is, he beats the bad guys and throws his eyes <br /> <br /> to the cops who prefer to remain the book), and Eddie Murphy plays a not-too-hard policeman who would rather be an actor (that is, he exclaims, <br /> <br /> "Freeze, police!" And has his "hard look" down). Of course, they are affiliated when Bobby's cannon tactics take him into boiling water <br /> with the media and he is essentially blackmailed into the lead role in a <br /> <br /> "Cops" -like Reality show. Take a breath, because it's so fun like <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> No energy has been included in the script - it looks like a pale reconstructed of <br /> <br /> every copy of the friendly film is thrown into a blender with "15 minutes" played, <br /> <br /> yes, the same DeNiro as, practically the character who is playing here. <br /> <br /> The lines fall flat, the action seems listless and no one seems to have enjoyed <br /> <br />. He died on the screen. <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time. Even if you have an overwhelming affinity <br /> for one of the actors - avoid it and do it a favor. Becauze if this <br /> earns, these types of scripts will be considered perfectly acceptable <br /> <br /> for the actors of their quality. <br /> <br /> And for Mr. DeNiro. You used to make serious films. I remember them - <br /> <br /> they were good. You have been nominated for the prizes for them - remember how it was very funny <br /> <br />? Now after "Analyze this" (which was good), "Meet the <br /> <br /> Parents" (which was also good), and "The adventures of Rocky and <br /> <br /> Bullwinkle" ( which was NOT good), I think we need to see you parody less, and BE yourself more. "Casino" seems a long time <br /> <br /> ago. And no, I don't count "15 minutes" as serious Bobby. Anyone who has taken this media satire seriously must receive the world's weekly news
