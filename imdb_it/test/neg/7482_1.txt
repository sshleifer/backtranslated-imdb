Carson Daly must be the only late-night talk show presenter who is not a comedian. What was NBC thinking! It's not funny! The writing is horrible! All the splashes are painful to watch. The current new karaoke is not funny at all, especially because it tells you what they will sing before singing it! Escalator interviews are simply stupid and needless to say it's not funny at all. All the jokes, especially during the monologue, are the least intelligent, stupid, non-amusing jokes ever put on television! I mean, every time he jokes about Jessica Simpson, he ends up with "because he's stupid", which cancels out any fun that was in the bar, which was already very low. Any child of 3 years could have invented jokes and sketches on which he put this inconvenient excuse for a show. Seriously, don't watch this show unless you're on the edge of suicide and want something to push you over the edge.
