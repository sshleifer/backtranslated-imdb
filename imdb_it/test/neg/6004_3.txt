A faceless rip-off from Se7en and not suitable for cleaning his shoes. The word "predictable" must be invented precisely for this occasion. Lambert is made of wood, as always (his moments of "emotion" are laughable, like his accent). The "climax" is not at all as we have had so many signals, and in the end we are simply immune to flesh, putrefaction and more. Overall a real mess.
