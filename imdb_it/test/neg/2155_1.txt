It is useless to try to describe in detail the twisted and too melodramatic plot concerning the bitterness of the Civil War, a head of dishonest cities and other complications. It's all bad. <br /> <br /> Stella Stevens, Andrew Prine, Bo Svenson, William Smith, Tim Thomerson and Lee Majors are all good actors who may not be bigger stars (or big stars) but always fun movies. <br /> <br /> Here, they are all wasted on a photo that seems to have been set in a trap for wild western tourists, with costumes borrowed from the local high school theater department. In fact, most of the acting seems to be even at the high school level, which might not be so bad if it wasn't so pretentious. <br /> <br /> The name of Ed Wood is invoked too lightly days. I think in this case the comparison is justified. However, I suspect that old Ed would have made a western more enjoyable than this.
