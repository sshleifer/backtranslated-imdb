Lucio Fulci was famous for his Italian splatter films, mostly his undead films like Zombie or The Beyond. Here he directed a sort of black comedy, but there is only one problem: his nauseating. I say this knowing that I like City of the Walking Dead (which is also coarse but not so). A compulsive gambler gets money for his habits by devouring rich and deformed women, then killing them and stealing their money. The film makes this plan so easy. I guess women were too ugly to go to the bank, so they always had their money in person. After the fourteenth murder, I began to suspect what I have always heard of Fulci: he hated women. He must have. In any case, this movie stinks, it's not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with yellows and supernatural zombie movies. Avoid this movie at all costs.
