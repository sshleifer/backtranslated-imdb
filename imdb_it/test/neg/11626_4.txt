Mickey Rourke (who was once a famous movie star) plays Martin Fallon, an IRA terrorist who accidentally detonates a school bus full of children who is so disgusted by his actions that he decides to leave the IRA and flees to London <br /> <br /> !!!! MOON SPOILER !!!! <br /> <br /> The opening of the film is rather disturbing as the lives of young children ended up in a fireball. Things like that happened in the 1970s and 1980s and in the 1990s in Northern Ireland, giving A PRAYER FOR THE DYING a clear realism. However, as soon as Fallon decides to renounce violence (What? He is a terrorist and has never blown up innocent sparrows before now?) Realism disappears and ridiculous clichés and twists occur. Martin is employed by the London underworld (don't have their killers?) To make a shot while wearing an IRA "uniform" (you never know which provos wore uniforms) in a graveyard in broad daylight (it wouldn't be a Does the IRA man use a bomb placed under a car?) Where he is spotted by a priest who recognizes him while he was in the SAS. Hands up who thinks I'm lying? They are not and we are in the middle of running time and there are still many clichés to come <br /> <br /> This sounds very silly and it is, but what do you expect from a Jack Higgins novel? Everything is cliché, artificial and stereotyped and the parts that are not are simply bizarre. Critics massacred this film when it came out, in particular they claimed that it could have a potential if the film had Bob Hoskins who plays gangster Jack Meehan and Alan Bates who plays the SAS soldier turned priest and for once the critics would have been right . They should also note that the film may have been less terrible if Fallon was played by someone who could make an Irish accent. Rourke could be hunky and macho (oh gawd another film with an IRA uberhunk) but the accents are not his strong point any more than the acting of the character is. To give you an idea of ​​how disappointing PRAYER FOR THE DYING was, the director ended up denying it, which is always a bad sign <br /> <br /> As a footnote the original PRAYER FOR THE release DYING in Great Britain has been postponed for several months due to the "bombing of Enniskillen". In November 1987 the provisional IRA set off a bomb in the center of Enniskillen, where a Memorial Day parade was held to commemorate the fallen of the war in Britain. Eleven (11) people were killed and more injured. It was not an accident and no one left the IRA because of it
