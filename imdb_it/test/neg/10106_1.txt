From the terrible special effects on I was literally stunned by how badly anyone can make a movie. Let's put it this way, I have absolutely no directing experience and for the first time ever watching a movie I thought "I can do better than that! While sitting and watching this dad. The acting in this movie was terrible, I suppose the best actor was the guy from Lawnmower Man, but Aliens3's French guy was so wooden I wondered how he got his previous job in the first place.The plot was mediocre and I suppose, like most movies, that if the if it had been done well, he would have stood up. I don't usually write reviews but after seeing a couple of people he gave this film a good grade (must be chosen for the cast / crew) I felt I had to say my piece to save someone from hiring him accidentally or wasting their money to buy this cack.
