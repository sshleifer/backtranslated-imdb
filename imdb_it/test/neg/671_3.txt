I'm surprised that so many comments about this film are positive. After reading the book several times (and all the other historical novels by Mika Waltari) there is no way to say very well in this film. If I forget the origins of the story, I could consider it a pretty good epic. Obviously bringing such a book of a book on the big screen is a task not to be envied, but could be done with the class. I can't understand why even the name of Nefernefernefer should be abbreviated to Nefer. I love Peter Ustinov as Kaptah and Marlon Brando probably would have done a better Sinuhe, but the general attitude is too Hollywood to ever do the book justice. Mind you, Mika Waltari left the Premier of this film in the middle of the screening. This is how he liked it.
