I imagine that the previous "House" movie was a success, prompting Universal to snatch a few more drops from the cash-cow monster. The creative team must have been in a recycling mood, starting with the opening theme raised by "Son of Frankenstein" and some of the sequences distributed in the film, as an unwittingly amusing affair in which the filming of Glenn Strange as the monster is mixed with Karloff's clip of the 1935 Bride, and compared to how Strange robot moved, Karloff seems to move like a cheetah in comparison. <br /> <br /> The continuity of the previous film is thrown at the side of the road, regarding the miraculous death-trick ability of Wolf Man and Dracula, but when Dr. Edelmann and Larry Talbot discover the Frankenstein monster with the skeleton representing Boris Karloff, Edward T. Lowe recognizes at least part of the history of the past film, although Talbot curiously never mentions having met Karloff Dr. Niemann. <br /> <br /> As this would be Universal's last horror cycle, the supernatural elements of The Wolf Man and Drac have become (unconvincing) turned into medical disorders. A Drac is told that he suffers from a blood disease, a very rare disease that allows him to turn into a bat or evaporate if the sunlight touches him. >: -] And Larry Talbot has only a little pressure on the brain. Obviously all this is diligently explained with a "lot" of medical jargon related in many scenes. This proves to be the biggest obstacle, given that somewhere along the way the directors seem to forget about real horror or entertainment in favor of giving monsters conditions that can be treated as an influence. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of the old Universal horrors, it is rare that I feel so bored while watching one. It all looks like a movie that was created just because it could be, but if this mess hadn't been slapped together, the monsters may never have met Abbott and Costello, so I guess something good came out of it.
