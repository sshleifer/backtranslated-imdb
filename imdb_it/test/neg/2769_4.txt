As a young man, the beautiful Joan Woodbury (as Rita Adams) was orphaned, after her "pigeon of stools" was shot dead. As a young woman, Mrs. Woodbury finds herself struggling to keep a job, as the murdered father's ex-convict status makes Woodbury a bad commercial risk. Woodbury's rooms with songmate Linda Ware (like Donna Andrews), who advises Woodbury to get in touch with old friends from the orphanage John Archer (like Bob Elliott) and Jack La Rue (like Mickey Roman). But none of her friends can help when Woodbury is the victim of a scam, which lands her in prison. At the time of release, does Woodbury decide to give male mobsters a run for their money ?? <br /> <br /> Re-titled "Gangs, Inc.", this is a obviously weak and inexpensive mobster melodrama. Still, it's a lot of fun to see Woodbury doing miracles with inferior material. It sounds the most sophisticated innocent growing "Rita" quite convincingly; and, he throws himself into a lot like a blonde prostitute. Woodbury must be added to the list of unfortunate under-used Hollywood actresses of the past. "Paper Bullets" also presents a first Alan Ladd (as Jimmy Kelly aka Bill Dugan). Ms. Ware, who sang the hit "An Apple for the Teacher" with Bing Crosby, sings pleasantly a couple of numbers from the 80s. But above all, it's the Woodbury show. <br /> <br /> **** Paper Bullets (1941) Phil Rosen ~ Joan Woodbury, Linda Ware, Alan Ladd
