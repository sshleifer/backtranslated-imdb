This is the film that somehow relies on Rob Halford's release from "Judas Priest" by British Metal Gods and how the band replaced him with Ripper Owens, who used to perform in a Priest tribute band. Originally titled Metal God, this film could have been something great. Instead, someone in an office that knows little or nothing about metal music has decided to water it. From the change of title of Metal God to the "safe" middle of the "Rock Star" road to the limping soundtrack, this film has a very negative role. Having spent most of my life in a professional metal band, I couldn't wait to see it, I was very disappointed in different parts of the movie. The soundtrack is NOT metal for one, and even the ending of the film is lame. The film has some bright points in writing and acting, but overall it fails at the end because ... 1) A film based on a metal band should have a metal soundtrack. 2) There is NOTHING metal on Marky Mark or Jennifer Aniston. If Bon Jovi, Warrant, Def Leppard and Poison are your idea of ​​'heavy metal' go see this movie. If Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Dio & Black Sabbath are your idea of ​​metal, watch this movie for a good laugh.
