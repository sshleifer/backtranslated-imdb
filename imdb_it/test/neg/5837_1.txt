I like science fiction movies and even low-level movies, made for TV, shops, movies that I find interesting. Well, I found this in a business basket and took it as a selection for a movie night with a group of friends. I was literally * emabassed * that I brought this film. <Br /> <br /> From the beginning, acting is bad, the plot is insipid and the plot is almost non-existent. All this leads directly to what the film really was: a soft core porn movie. <br /> <br /> The film started with a women's prison where prisoners are all sexy women who work in a sort of mine. First clue that this film is NOT serious: attractive women in a prison forced to do physical labor. Yeah, for sure! Everything. : P Once the "plot" continued, it was obscured by useless scenes of people having sex. In the middle of the movie, my friends and I stopped watching, he was so stupid. The next day, I thought I would give the film another chance and look at the rest. I looked around for another 15 minutes and gave up again. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a science fiction, science fiction or even science fiction movie, DO NOT watch Lethal Target! If you want to see low-budget soft core porn that is light on the plot, then see Lethal Target.
