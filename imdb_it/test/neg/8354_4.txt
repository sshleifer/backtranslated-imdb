The daughter of a wealthy businessman, who as a child took rheumatic fever and now suffers from shortness of breath, discovers that her marriage to a charming neeramator was organized by dad (whom she affectionately calls "Darling"); Worse, she may have had a few weeks to live, leaving her husband free to marry his conniving romantic rival. Pure Berth Paul Osborn's script (through the subtle plot of Jerome Weidman) traces the redundant flashbacks in the second half instead of proceeding with the plot, which overwhelms the already soapy scenario in a grim speech. Why go back when we can understand what is happening for ourselves? This is a "crying woman" without trust in her recipients, so simplistic is the setting. Dorothy McGuire, wrapped in furs for most of the film, is by no means an intelligent and cunning heroine; when she is angry, she turns inward and stony. After realizing that her marriage is basically a fiction, she withdraws from her husband like the consummate virgin (well, this is a possibility, she and Van Johnson sleep in separate beds after all!). Ruth Roman has the best moments in the film as a company shark with her trap set for Van, but what exactly do these women do in him? Johnson can be charming when required, but puts him in a melodramatic environment and he too becomes stony. The MGM production values ​​are just so-so, but director Gottfried Reinhardt tries to add a bit of visual flavor to the followers of the flashbacks and try a brisk pace for the film's initial half hour. ** from ****
