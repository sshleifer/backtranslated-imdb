Son of the Mask is a terrible film. I don't like the child and I don't like the dog. Jamie Kennedy and his wife are a cute couple, but they can't redeem themselves sitting in this trash. Even at only 88 minutes (or so he says), the film could not end soon enough for me. The only real laughs come at the beginning with a brief appearance of Ben Stain. That's all. The rest is just a remake of the first film. In reality it is only an insult to alterations. Why was this sequel done ?? This film has cost millions of dollars. Why should I sit in a movie with a child and a dog that intentionally tries to drive his father crazy? Jamie Kennedy is talented but has nothing to do in this movie. I don't care to be nice about this movie. 1/10
