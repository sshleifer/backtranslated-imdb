I'm writing this review simply because I'm a big fan of the book, Prozac Nation, and was shocked by the movie. <br /> <br /> I think if you hadn't read the book, you would have been lost to watch the movie, as it didn't give a true story to Wurtzel's depression. There was no real mention of his childhood (his relationship with his father, his experiences at the summer camp, his first therapists (in fact, the film gives the impression of never having been in therapy until the doctor Sterling) ...). That said, if you had read the book, you would have been confused by the amount of editing that had taken place. <br /> <br /> I found the book as a vivid portrait of depression, highlighting Wurtzel's low points, and the experiences he had along the way. The film, however, started at Harvard and literally threw the audience without a real explanation of what was happening. <br /> <br /> Events that were important in the book (such as Wurtzel's abortion, his summer working in Dallas, his suicide attempt while on Prozac) were omitted from the film. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, this is pedantic, but Wurtzel has not lost his virginity with Noah. The suicide attempt that was shown in Sterling's office was completely different from the book. To begin with, he actually overdubbed Mellaril, in contrast to the para-suicide gesture shown in the film. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would say that if you read the book and enjoyed / identified with it, then don't watch the movie. Instead read "More, Now, Again" (by the same author). Or look at Girl, interrupted. <br /> <br /> The only thing that redeemed was the performance of Anne Heche, which I consider very well represented. Even Christina Ricci was good, even if her performance seemed a little ... made up. Jessica Lange was created for a pleasant view, but it seemed the opposite of how Wurtzel's mother is described in the book. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? Do not worry
