I found this movie as a low POSit, but that's not the problem. The problem is that the film is only lame.it does not make much sense. Yes, he explains why things happened, but that's not what I mean. There was no reason for everything. Even the film moved very slowly. The last ice age was faster than this. I also think they went a bit overboard in the killings. I mean they were too coarse, but the killer seemed to spend too much time destroying his victim over his head or stabbing his victim. maybe I'm petty, but I didn't like the film. The whole thing looked like a lower version of "When a Stranger Calls" and maybe that was the point. But then, for me Stranger Kills "is a 4/10 *
