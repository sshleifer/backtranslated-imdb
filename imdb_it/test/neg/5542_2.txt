The sequel to Michael Hurst's writer / director Sci-Fi Channel to Stan Winston's classic horror story went wrong, has its moments and some good blood, but in the end is not up to the original . <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure the directors weren't trying to make a comedy, but I found myself laughing all the time. A family feud started on a car accident is the basis for this entry into the franchise. The Hatfield and McCoy families live in a country town with dirt roads, drive vans, drink ale and kick each other whenever they get the chance. Just when they thought it was safe to hate each other and live happily ever after, Jodie Hatfield (Amy Manson) and Ricky McCoy (Bradley Taylor) decided to fall in love causing the blow to hit the shan. One night the two lovebirds decide to go into the woods for some time while Ricky's sister plays in search, but it happens that just that night some of the Hatfields accidentally kill Ricky's sister and capture Jodie and him together. You know what happens next. Ricky finds the body of his sisters and decides to pay a visit to Haggis so that he can demand his revenge through the powerful Pumpkinhead. Ye Haw! Furthermore, Harley (Lance Henriksen) is back to warn potential damned souls that they don't use Pumpkinhead to relieve their pain. Which really put a knot in the story because Harley should have called Pumpkinhead years before this story took place, but the setting and characters look like dirty pilgrims who somehow traveled through time to get the pickup back to Plymouth. Then there is the sheriff (Rob Freeman) who has ties to the demon and seems to belong to a revenge movie from the 70s instead of a horror film made for the cable. <br /> <br /> Some of the gores and special effects were fantastic, but instead of sticking to the man-costume thinking Hurst used some terrible 3D shots for certain scenes. A particularly embarrassing shot shows Pumpkinhead leaping from the branches of trees like a poorly rendered 3D monkey. The cinematography has been exceptional and has elevated the quality of the film a little. Even the acting was pretty decent, with the exception of some badly executed accents. <br /> <br /> Family feuds never end well, especially when the families involved in the feud must face Pumpkinhead. I didn't like every minute of this movie, but it was much better than most movies that the Sci-Fi channel spits out. Maybe it's a signal that the Channel is trying to bring the quality of its films up to match the quality of its original series'. I wouldn't waste any money on a rent, but if I had the chance to raise it on the booster tube I'd say give it a try. It's a not-so-killer movie but it rises slightly above the level of junk that makes it a DVD these days.
