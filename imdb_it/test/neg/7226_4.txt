He has really good music and shows; Kid's Creole and the Coconuts, James White and the Blacks, DNA, Tuxedo Moon, the Plastics, Melle Mel, Vincent Gallo, Lydia Lunch ... etc, but apart from that there's not much more. The dialogue, in particular the narration (by Saul Williams), is actually quite good, but the performances are all quite bland or completely negative, regardless of how many hipsters are; Debbie Harry and Jean Micheal Basquit (the latter is the main role) do not yet have enough cultural credentials to keep this film from being a novelty item. It is for the style of Jack Kerouac that moves spontaneously, but does not have the intuition to keep moving, and this is where the band's performances enter. I guess it's pretty balanced in this sense between great music and bad acting, and I liked it, but I expected more. Even if it has a fairy tale ending.
