In my opinion, a good documentary - especially one that deals with controversial political issues - should be informative and as impartial as possible. The point should reveal the truth. This means, in particular, having experts on the subject and representatives of all parties among the interviewees. This film is a failure in this sense. Most of the interviews included in this film consist of "men off the road" exposing the question of peace in the Holy Land. The wall itself, the alleged subject of the film, is not treated seriously at all. For most interviews, the interviewer simply waits to be approached and asks general questions like "what do you think of the wall?" - does not approach random people near the wall and asks them how they were directly affected by it. Outside of an interviewee, the Israeli general responsible for the construction of the wall, we do not have "experts" on the subject to provide us with the context of the wall (eg. How and when the project started, if it was successful, which groups are for and against the project, etc. <br /> <br /> Apart from the interviews, a very large part of the film consists of prolonged shots of uneventful scenes, such as frontal shots of the wall, construction of the wall and people coming down from "A bus. These shots take too long, in my opinion. It is nice to see how the wall looks, but the 20-30 minutes of frontal shooting of the wall (and only the wall) are excessive. Clearly, these shots (accompanied by Arabic music that conveys a sense of mourning) are included for the sole purpose of arousing in viewers feelings of aversion to the wall.
