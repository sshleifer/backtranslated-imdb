Man, this was immensely boring. the protagonist (Christian Schoyen) must be the worst actor I've ever seen. and another thing, if the character in the film moved to America when he was ten or something like that and had lived here for over 20 years, he spoke much better English than he does here. or to say it in my language "Skikkelig gebrokkent". But it's nice to see Norwegian guys in a Hollywood movie. it was just a pity that they were talented hacks. The plot itself is below mediocre. I suspect that Christian Schoyen made this film just to live the dream, as he clearly does in the film, by inserting one beautiful girl after the other.
