...the first? Killjoy 1. But here's Killjoy 2's review: <br /> <br /> (contains spoilers, so watch out for readers) <br /> <br /> Oh my. Oh, my, my, my. I'll start by telling you that I didn't even hope that this movie would be good. Considering that Killjoy (the first film) is undoubtedly the worst film ever made, the sequel didn't have many promises. <br /> <br /> As expected, it has not been published. <br /> <br /> The deaths were even weaker than in the first movie. There was absolutely no kind of eye candy, and every single object seemed so fake that I wouldn't be surprised if they did a kindergarten course. <br /> <br /> Look, I don't even know where to start. Hm, for beginners, the film didn't even have the length of the feature film. It was only an hour and eight minutes (68 min.), But then again, ending early was actually a truce. Indeed, this is the only reason why this film was not as bad as the first, because the first was longer. <br /> <br /> Usually, I don't give spoilers in reviews, but since I don't do it I want some of you to go through the torture of watching this film waste, I'm going to mess up. Not that there is much to ruin. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the ending. KILLJOY IS THE PUSSIEST KILLER EVER. It takes explosions, incendiary bombs, guns, etc. To kill all the normal serial killers in horror movies. Guess what it took to kill Killjoy? A GLASS OF WATER ***. No lie. Finally, a girl took a cup of water and threw water on Killjoy's face. Then Killjoy started screaming, and tried to make it look like his face was melting by putting dried cement on his forehead. Then he lay down there, and people went to sleep. <br /> <br /> Now we hit the acting. VERY TERRIBLE. Not even one person was credible in the slightest. I don't even know what to say, apart from the fact that they have just hired some hobos who live in the streets to perform in this film. <br /> <br /> Seriously, honestly I doubt they spent more than $ 100 in total to make this film. They had nothing. Most took place in the woods, which would have cost him nothing to film. The actors weren't giving any kind of effort, so it's clear that they were probably "working" for free. They had no special effects or props, and probably used ketchup for blood. Hell, who am I kidding? They probably didn't even spend $ 100. They probably spent $ 3.29 on a bottle of ketchup and it did. A f ** kin 'movie with a budget of $ 3.29. <br /> <br /> For Bob's sake, they couldn't even afford to rent a police uniform. Finally, after Killjoy dies, the girl wakes up and says "Where is she?" and the principal woman replies: "He's gone". Then, suddenly, a fat, foolish guy with scars on his face comes out of nowhere with a cell phone that says "You have a call". The girl replies and says "Oh, hello mom!" and smiles. Then the fat man walks to reveal that he is a police officer. However, he wears khaki pants and a green shirt with regular buttons, with a lame badge on his front pocket. Hell, it was probably the badge the director got when he was on security patrol in third grade. Then they all went into a brown blazer and walked away as the credits flipped. They couldn't even get a police cruiser, so they just got a light brown blazer. F ** kin 'lame. Killjoy didn't even have the ice cream van he had in the first movie. <br /> <br /> Killjoy is without doubt the most shamelessly gay EVER slasher. If there was a slasher who wore bright pink spandex and wore a rainbow flag, he would not be as cheerful as Killjoy. Even Killjoy is not funny (and believe me, he tried to be). <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is an extremely lousy threat given by one of the delinquents. Someone makes a comment to a boy who does not pass the third year, to whom the boy replies: "I'll show you the third year!" in a threatening way. This must be the worst threat I've ever heard. "I'll show you the third year!" <br /> <br /> This film does not even work on a "so bad, it's good" level. It's dirty. Unless you have done something bad and feel so guilty about severely punishing yourself, DO NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Remember only; if a flamboyant homosexual clown with a huge black afro tries to bore you to death with gay jokes (and tries to kill you at the same time), throw some water against him. Closed cash desk. <br /> <br /> FINAL EVALUATION: .1 out of 10
