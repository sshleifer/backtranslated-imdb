I love science fiction and I'm willing to put up with a lot. Science fiction movies / TVs are usually under-funded, not appreciated and misunderstood. I tried to appreciate this, I really did, but it's a good science fiction movie since Babylon 5 is for Star Trek (the original). Silly prostheses, cheap cardboard sets, drawn dialogues, CGs that do not match the background, and painfully one-dimensional characters cannot be overcome with a "science fiction" setting. (I'm sure there are those of you out there who think that Babylon 5 is a good TV science fiction. "It's not. It's clich√© and uninteresting.) While American viewers might like the excitement and development of the character, the science fiction is a genre that does not take itself seriously (see Star Trek). It can deal with important issues, but not as a serious philosophy. It is really difficult to take care of the characters here because they are not just crazy, they lack only a spark of life. actions and reactions are wooden and predictable, often painful to look at.The creators of Earth KNOW are rubbish because they always have to say "Gene Roddenberry's Earth ..." otherwise people would not keep watching. like this boring, cheap, poorly modeled (looking at it without commercial breaks it really brings this house) trudging the Trabant of a show that falls into space. Spoiler: So kill a main character. And then bring him back as another actor. Jeeez! Dallas all over again.
