This film has some of the worst acting I've ever seen. Dennis Quaid's performance was at school level. While it is difficult to portray an off-the-wall character like Jerry Lee Lewis, it can be done. Just ask Jamie Foxx (though Ray Charles has had more depth for his personality and his musicality than Lewis ever dreamed of possessing). The portrait of the Phillips brothers belonged to The Dukes of Hazzard, and Alec Baldwin who plays Jimmy Swaggart is a bit like Donald Duck who plays Shakespeare. When Robert Duvall played a country preacher, I bought it. Baldwin never let me believe one word. The part of Wynona Ryder was the best, and it was mediocre. (And can anyone understand how he was 13 when Lewis met her and still 13 more than a year later?) Some Internet checks reveal that the essential facts presented by the film were true, at least no more dirty than most in Hollywood bio photo. This film hurt the box office, and should have.
