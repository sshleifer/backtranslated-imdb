I wouldn't give too much to the film to tell you that there are many, many, many MANY scenes of Lucas (the young protagonist) walking and looking at things! Yes. And you will be happy to know that the first third of the film is useless, meaningless and practically ignored for the rest of the film! <br /> <br /> This film is populated by boring people who do boring things and the most boring person of all is the young Lucas, who is going blind and needs an operation. See, he has disappointments, terrible disappointments! He thinks a murderer is preying on blind women! He walks a lot and behaves like an unbearable jerk! <br /> <br /> Patience DOES NOT pay with this film. In the end, the plot and events are just as confusing and lethargic, and it is very difficult to take care of one way or another of what any of the nightmarish images meant. Nothing has been clarified, the film moves at a snail's pace and left me with the same effects as a hangover. <br /> <br /> Judging from "Afraid of the Dark", the British do not make stupid thrillers like Americans do; make them boring.
