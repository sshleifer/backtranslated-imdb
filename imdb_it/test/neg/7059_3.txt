It didn't take long after Halloween had started the demolition boom for the category that would be cursed by continual mediocrity. Already in 1983 the genre was already struggling to publish more than three decent offers a year and in 1988 the slash stem and film had become almost the scapegoat of horror cinema. At that time the most important studies were all aware that repeating the tired formula was no longer a lucrative direction, which it left to independent directors and mostly inexperienced to continue the legacy that John Carpenter had created. Although there was still an impressive number of features that reached the shelves in 88, most of them were weakly produced and overall were eminently unattractive. With that said there were a couple of gems in the rubble. Scott Spiegel's intruder in his untrimmed form was a superb, coarse classic, while Evil Dead Trap showed that the cycle was not yet entirely lacking in style and panache. William Lustig's Maniac Cop had enough success to launch a franchise and two years later Dead Girls and Mirage turned out to be the last bellows of life in the sick category. <br /> <br /> It was the continuous release of schlocks like Berserker, Blood Lake and Rush Week that cursed the slasher movie at eight years of darkness. In the end he took Wes Craven's big Scream fantasy to provide the necessary resuscitation. Having never heard of the Demon Warrior before I realized it unexpectedly, I immediately thought it was part of the low brow trash that led to the fall of the slasher phase. But with that being said the film has an intriguing premise that sits comfortably alongside Scalps and Camping Del Terrore as a welcome addition to the influenced Native American catalog. <br /> <br /> A truck stops on a wooded road and out of step two dramatically reduced rednecks. The woodcutters are only on the screen for about ten seconds and then killed by an invisible threat. Next we meet a troupe of five young adults who are heading to the same position for a shooting practice spot on some of the local wild animals. The area is owned by Neil Willard and has been passed down through three generations of his family. His grandfather stole the land from an Indian medicine man who was said to have left a curse on the property. According to legend, every ten years a Demon Warrior with extreme hatred for humanity chases the forest collecting revenge on those he considers responsible for the theft of the tribe's home. It wouldn't be much fun if those myths were a lie, so regular as a watch that a manic murderer shows a taste for blood. Will the children be able to stop this ghost killer ??? <br /> <br /> Demon Warrior is best described as a cheaper (but still woefully cheap) re-imaging of Fred Olen Ray's Scalps. The bogeymen of both films are practically identical and the director also throws a scalping sequence to confirm my suspicions. Things start off promising with a crisp friday in the first-person cinematography of the 13th style and a couple of shock-jolts that were composed with finesse by director Frank Patterson. Thomas Callaway did a good job with photography and the tribal soundtrack brought a refreshing change from the more traditional synthesizer trash of the late 1980s. Flourishes of suspense are juxtaposed with a couple of credible directorial embellishments and there are also some attempts at humor. The killer looked frighteningly in a demon outfit and the inclusion of a bow and arrow as the main weapon of the crime was a clever touch to the director. <br /> <br /> Fred Olen Ray's infamous slasher was notable for its strong and credible disquieting atmosphere. Unfortunately, although the budget has been produced twice, Demon Warrior never comes close to the film that emulates so desperately. It is said that most of the actors were drafted by Baylor University of Texas and were not even paid for their inclusion in the feature film, so obviously it is obvious that the scripts are properly abysmal. Did I particularly like the hilarious John Langione ?? an "Italian" native American (don't ask) who portrays emotions as much as the trees in the forest that surrounded him. Warrior started with some believable glimpses of the director who actually led me to believe that this could be a welcome addition to the slasher index. Unfortunately, the poisonous cocktail of atrocious acting and a final ripped directly from stupidsville seriously changed the initial plan I had in mind for an evaluation. It is a pity that the dramas were scraped from the bottom of the Thespian barrel, because sometimes Demon Warrior showed flashes of potential. <br /> <br /> All in all, is Patterson's film a mixture of ideas ?? some of them were good, but mostly they were incredibly mediocre. Because this was released at a time when the slasher genre had been watered down to avoid censorship of happy scissors, there is really nothing worth mentioning. The scalping sequence is also relatively docile compared to the graphical representation of Olen Ray. Demon Warrior has the strange moment of credibility, but not often enough to justify a purchase. Not bad like the aforementioned Berserker, Blood Lake and others, but not really that good nor ?? ..
