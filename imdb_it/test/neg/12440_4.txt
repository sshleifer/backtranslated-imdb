If you liked William Hickey in "The honor of Prizzi", resurrect his character, like Don Anthony in "Mob Boss". This is a very weak satire of the "Godfather" with a few laughs. Does Stuart Whitman seem perplexed about what he is doing at this schlock festival? The performance of Morgan Fairchild is one of the best efforts of the film, and this alone is certainly not a good sign. Eddie Deezen swings between the slapstick of "Three Stooges" and a bad imitation of Woody Allen. "Fat Boss", fatally imperfect, is so derived that boredom quickly overcomes comedy and the film drags itself with car chases, weapons hidden in the bathroom of a restaurant and numerous other nonsense. - MERK
