In the XXII century an architect with the name of Mercante (Bruce Ramsay) takes on a space station, which he personally designed. As can be expected, a special force is sent to recapture the expensive station and place the Merchant in custody. Upon arrival they find him engaged in a strange ritual with the use of a mysterious cube. During the interrogation he reveals that they must let him finish, what he started or what the hell he released will plunge into the blood ... To convince the officers who keep him prisoner, he remembers his legacy, the toy manufacturer who built the box and the reasons why he is here in space ... <br /> <br /> The movie that is basically the same as Hellraiser, which The Quickening was for Highlander. Something to ignore and forget, as it will not greatly affect the Hellraiser tradition. By far the most trash of the franchise with a feeling much lower than its predecessors (which we admit were class B or C films). <br /> <br /> Acting sometimes seems to be influenced by a medium-budget porn movie with incredible wooden performances, which actually make you think: so when do they undress and start the relationship? Surprisingly, there isn't much sex in the film, although the introduction of the demon-seductress Angelique (a totally superfluous character who unnecessarily messes up what we know about Hellraiser's world) offers ample opportunities for creating love. <br /> <br /> Basically the film is composed of three separate short stories (one in the future, one in the present and one in the past) that lack attention and are carried on in an amateur way. The end result is extremely poor, fundamentally emphasized by the fact that you have no interest in what happens to any of the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> A bit of good blood in the film, but apart from that, a total failure.
