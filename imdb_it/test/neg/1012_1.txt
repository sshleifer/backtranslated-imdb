OK, I just flipped the channels and captured DW3. I saw it knowing that it would be garbage ... But like someone who has seen a lot of movies, this stands as one of the most purely ugly movies I've ever seen ... I'm not kidding. It's so bad you have to watch it, like a bad accident you can't get away from. Sometimes this kind of film works, IE, the Troma movies ... but watching Martin Balsam and Charles Bronson is as if it were painful .... What is even more fun is that I pulled up IMDb to see what the others and actually marks a 4.1 / 10 ??? I can't believe it was over 1.5! Equally funny is that it is not even the pinnacle of this series ... somehow this garbage deserved part 4 and 5? And to complete it all, the comments of some guys here have referred to this as the best of the series and his favorite movie of all time ??? Such statements make me afraid of this world!
