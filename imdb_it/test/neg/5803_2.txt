Call me old-fashioned, but I like movies with plots. I thought the "comedy stoner" was just a way to more specifically describe a comedy in which a lot of grass is smoked and the people watching it are more inclined to enjoy it. "Il ragazzo della nonna", however, decided that this is a full-fledged niche and that the stoners represent a piece of the comedy cake that must be reached. Apparently, Allen Covert (star and producer) and the Happy Madison band were right, but that didn't make "Grandma's Boy" less boring and little fun. They could be completely stoned, but the characters are mostly cooked. <br /> <br /> Alex (Covert, a longtime actor for Adam Sandler, star of the first time) is a professional video game tester from the mid-30s whose roommate had them evicted. He could look for a new apartment, but then we don't have a movie. After trying a couple of friends, he ends up living with good ole Nonna Lilly (Doris Roberts of "Everybody Loves Raymond"). She wakes him up at 6 and gets him to do chores and soon falls asleep at work and so the new video game sequel may not be done on time. <br /> <br /> Like most people, Alex takes care of his frustration and eradicates boredom by playing video games or getting up or both. His friends / co-workers all do the same thing. Most of them are virgins who live at home as well as love video games. They are all awkward and all, except for Nick Swardson and Joel Moore (sometimes only) their characters are not funny. Funny if you're on fire ... sure, I suppose, but I can't say from experience. <br /> <br /> Maybe everything we like for losers is getting very high, playing video games and awkwardly looking at women with specific attention to their breasts, but even so, it shouldn't be the driving force of an entire movie. Not even old women go high in the event of an accident (since someone is happening to them) or sex jokes, but that's what happens when a movie doesn't talk about anything. No conflict occurs until the last 20 minutes outside the slight problems of being out of the pot, Alex tries to convince the sexy girl (Linda Cardellini) to like him and the guys who are scrambling to finish their levels for the expiration of the video game. > <br /> The characters may be the saving grace of these winding stoner films, but apart from the amiable Doris Roberts, the aforementioned Swardson as the virgin friend who lives with his parents and calls them roommates and Joel Moore's ability to make robotic noises, there is a bit of ingenuity in the characters. Covert is a main character with no comic dimension, his merchant friend Dante is an inept and wasted time on screen and Jonah Hill and Kevin Nealon are written so far away in the suburbs that it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> If you like movies about nothing and look at them in a mental and physical state that improves that nothing, "Grandma's Boy" will probably be what you are looking for. Those who need a little more talent and wit to join a comedy will be left untouched. The most I can say for "Grandma's boyfriend" is that he is watchable despite his uselessness. You will not feel like a total waste of time but you would like you to do drugs so at least you could have made the most of the hour and a half. <br /> <br /> ~ Steven C <br /> <br /> Visit my website on www.moviemusereviews.com
