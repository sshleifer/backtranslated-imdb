Scary Movie 1-4, Epic Movie, Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, not another movie for boys and another gay movie. Making "Superhero Movie" the eleventh in a series that has easily ruined the genre of parody. Now I admit that I have a soft spot for classics like Airplane and The Naked Gun but you know you've hit a franchise so bad when you can see the gags a mile away. In fact, the only thing that could really make you see this disaster is the incredibly entertaining but massive sale of Leslie Neilson. <br /> <br /> You can say that he needs money, that he is passionate about or that he wants to get off the ship like a good captain would. In no way is he breaking down this genre, but hell is not helping him. But if I'm sorry for someone in this movie, his good actor Drake Bell is immersed in an immense amount of embarrassment. People who have undergone most of the torture by far are still forced to sit for 90 minutes of bile without laughing, no more fun than herpes. <br /> <br /> After spoofing catastrophic films on Airplane !, police shows in The Naked Gun and Hollywood horrors in Scary Movie 3 and 4, producer David Zucker puts his satirical views on the superhero genre with this anarchic comedy that illuminates everything from Spider-Man to X-Men and Superman Returns. <br /> <br /> Shortly after being bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly, the outcast of high school Rick Riker (Drake Bell) begins to experience a surprising transformation. Now Rick's skin is as strong as steel and has the strength of ten men. Determined to use his new powers to fight crime, Rick creates a special costume and assumes the identity of The Dragonfly - a fearless crime fighter, dedicated to keeping roads safe for law-abiding citizens. <br /> <br /> But every superhero needs a nemesis, and after Lou Landers (Christopher McDonald) is captured in the middle of an experiment that went terribly wrong, he develops the power to release life force from anyone he encounters and becomes the evil hourglass. Aiming to achieve immortality, the Hourglass tries to gather as many life forces as possible as the noble Dragonfly intends to take down her archenemy and realize her destiny as a true hero. Craig Mazin writes and directs this low-level parody. <br /> <br /> with Tracy Morgan, Pamela Anderson, Leslie Nielsen, Marion Ross, Jeffrey Tambor and Regina Hall. <br /> <br /> Hell Superhero Movie can earn some merit in the fact that it is much better than Meet the Spartans and Epic Movie. But with great responsibility comes one of the worst releases of 2008 to date. Rassy but a little less annoying than Meet the Spartans. And in the same sense much more forgettable than meeting the Spartans. But maybe that's a good reason. There are still some of us who are trying to scrape off the stain that was the answer to the Spartans from our memory. <br /> <br /> My final verdict? Avoid, unless you are one of those who love car cinema. Bad as Data Movie and Scary Movie 2, but not as bad as Meet the Spartans or Epic Movie. Supervillain.
