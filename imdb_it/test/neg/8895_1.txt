I was a fan of Buffy and I was hoping it would come at the right time when Angel only had another season. But when the end approaches, I went out to see it. And what did we get? This episode entitled "NOT FADE AWAY" was the last. <br /> <br /> I was so disappointed with this episode. This is absolutely the worst way for this series. Why couldn't he have a happy ending? Why did some of the main characters have to die? Why didn't Angel become human and reunite with Buffy again? No. Angel has to sign this bland piece of paper that will never become a human. How stupid. <br /> <br /> And the end is a cliffhanger. <br /> <br /> What could be worse? The Buffyshow began so big, like Angel, but the hole in the Universe ended up so lousy. Someone should cast a spell on the man who wrote the script on this episode and make sure it gets lost in hell. <br /> <br /> So don't worry about watching this, it's so ugly, it hurts! Totally 1 in 10.
