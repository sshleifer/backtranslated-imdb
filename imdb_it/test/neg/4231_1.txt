The main character, Pharaon, suffered a loss of his wife and son in the pre-film's past. It deals only with emotionally turning off. Too long a film, too much time spent on the expressionless face of the pharaoh, too much "street time" (one of the TV bans: fill the time with moving cars, trains, etc.). totally inexplicable, senselessly trivial - actions without reason or emotion. His best friends Joseph and Domino are not much more, their relationship based on sex (this film perhaps gives new meaning to the phrase "free sex"); Domino's mother and Pharaon are the two characters that show some emotion, but not much. It is difficult to say with all the characters in this film: it is an indifferent acting, an indifferent writing or simply indifferent characters interpreted by good writing and good acting. The characters in this film speak very little to anyone; no wonder they are emotionally isolated, which is all the more bizarre because it is clear that they live in a neighborhood where people are friendly and know each other.
