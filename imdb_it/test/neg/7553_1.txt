No wonder so many young people have Attention Deficit Disorder. It seems that theatrical productions (dance) these days are all focused on how many cameras and camera angles a director / editor can squeeze in a 1-hour show. Is there a special Emmy category for this company? Try to count them sometimes for something different to do with this, otherwise, a completely unwatchable show. <br /> <br /> I have tried to distinguish at least some of the faces of some of the other dancers of the production. It was impossible. They didn't seem to have faces, just blurs: it was just Michael Flatley's face, Michael Flatley's bare chest (beautiful shine!), Michael Flatley's feet, and that patented Flatley over the shoulder-come-here seems endlessly repeated squared. Since he was an executive producer of this copy and paste job, I think we could have expected it. It is not too much to ask who its target audience is. <br /> <br /> Riverdance was a much better production, as it tried to present the show more or less as one might see from the public, not from the catwalk, from the side wings or from the perspective of the floor nail. If I'm not mistaken, I think Sir Michael has retired. Thank God for the small blessings.
