Eight teenage inmates are taken to the abandoned Blackwell Hotel to clean it up as a community service. They soon discover that it is the home of a giant psychopath (Kane) who has a weakness to pull out and collect eyeballs. It doesn't help that the guard who watches over them (Steven Vidler) had a previous confrontation with the beast four years earlier. <br /> <br /> My guilty pleasure is the slasher movies. Most of them are misdirected and recited, but still retain a certain amount of attractiveness and entertainment. See No Evil is a good example of this. It is characterized by atrocious writing and acting, but the death scenes are pretty good and the film turns out to be fun. The premise seems to be a mix between Friday 13, Saw 2 and Halloween: Resurrection. I really liked the idea but it didn't work very well. It was really just a bunch of clich√©s and everything was predictable. Screenwriter Dan Madigan focused on the scenes of death and nothing else apparently. The scenes of death are pretty good and gruesome. Director Gregory Dark did a good job with them and invented creative killings. <br /> <br /> The acting is rather insignificant and insignificant. This is because all the characters are one-dimensional and we don't know much about it. It was hard to feel for these people because they were rather unlikely. Kane is surprisingly mediocre. I expected his on-screen presence to be scarier, but he didn't do a good job. A second rate Jason Voorhees, if you want. The rest of the actors are relatively unknown and this film probably won't help or hurt their careers. <br /> <br /> While the scenes of death are bloody, there is no need for fear. There is really no suspense just some bloody death scenes. For this reason, the film no longer has a repeated value. Also, if you don't like slasher movies, then don't waste your time with this. It will do little to change your opinion. In the end, See No Evil is a decent slasher film, but it's generic and forgettable, so it's not worth watching. Rated 6/10
