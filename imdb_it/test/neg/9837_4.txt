This is one of those classic B movies that follow the exploits of 2 hobos. It is done in a very cheerful way and Big Stupid running away from a single line like a cardboard cassanova. But Jack Elam steals every scene in which he finds himself as Jesse (now Jerome!). My favorite scene is the lynching and the voice of the dad who goes up 10 octaves ("Did you love her?"). Big Stupid's protege Danny is surprisingly more stupid, but not as disgusting as our main star. There is also a picturesque scene of a guy working at the restaurant. Joyce Meadows is the sweet, naive girl and probably the least annoying. And those yellow ruches (RAWR!). Oh, and alcohol is evil according to Mr. Stupid. <br /> <br /> This movie is a hoot. Watch the MST cover of this and Crow's fantastic Elam tribute!
