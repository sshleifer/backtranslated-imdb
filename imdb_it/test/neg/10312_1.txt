I found this movie on a DVD shelf for $ 10. It wasn't worth it. Some of the cameras work and converse as if they were made by a film student. Sandra's performance was quite credible, but the film was predictable and the action was questionable and dragged. <br /> <br /> One thing I'll give them, anyway. Unlike most action movies, the people in this movie actually ran out of ammunition and dug dead bodies for new weapons and ammunition.
