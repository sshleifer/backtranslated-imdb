Well, so not all Australian films are so beautiful. Yes, perhaps there have been very few with much merit. Take Away is still an absolute bomb, qualifying as one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I wanted to like it. I thought I'd give it a try. I also met one of the screenwriters Dave O'neil, so I feel like a traitor who gives a bad review of this film, but ... The plot is pretty thin (I won't worry about putting it in relation ... read the synopsis) that I can forgive: there are a lot of movies that can cover it with some decent jokes. Unfortunately, Take Away's lines cover the plot like a $ 2 prostitute skirt. Probably the only laughs that came from the other 6 people in the cinema were poor acting and dialogue. Take Away goes down like a week Dim sim ... You could understand that joke if you see the movie but the joke isn't worth it.
