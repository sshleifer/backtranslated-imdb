Cave Dwellers, or The Blade Mater, or whatever it's called, is in a word: VILE! I saw it on MST and I laughed not only for the great running commentary, but for the inept film making that was shown. Sunglasses, tire tracks and where did Ator take the hang glider? So they raise some shots from another movie, Where Eagles Dare as Tom Servo points out. To show how inexpensive this film is, look at the scene where Ator and Thong have to fight with invisible swordsmen. Or better yet, look for the giant tube dressed like a snake that Ator has to fight! And what do these scenes have to do in the credits with the film?
