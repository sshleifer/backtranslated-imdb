While it would be easy and precise to enter into the reason why "Reba" is the indicative heart of many "family-oriented sitcoms" in the way it rips off from other better sitcoms, the truth is that the show is repetitive, full of stereotypes from the more entertaining and more innovative shows, and the star of the show is completely out of its element. While I'm sure Ms. McIntire can sing and has a fan base that supports it, being in a sitcom shooting at zingers and calling her the next Lucille Ball is very, very far from reality. <br /> <br /> Reba herself does not have a presence that is needed here to establish the fact that she was chosen as a rotten woman whose whole family is centered. Yet, after seeing some episodes, there is no real connection with the character. I could care less about his adventures because his entire character seems to be MIA. Reba McIntire has no film presence and making a show around her seems very short-sighted and indicative of most "family-oriented" programming: pushing a sitcom full of male-stupid / women-doing-all stereotypes that nobody likes. but those who cannot afford the cable. <br /> <br /> The show is a waste of time. The only positive thing is that it has at least better production values ​​than the normal PAX ripoff .... only.
