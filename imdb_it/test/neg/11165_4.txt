I recently found this film on one of my husband's VHS tapes (the white variety he uses to record things from television). The film looks like it was the last time in the eighties and I don't remember seeing it since. It is not (to my knowledge) published on DVD or VHS, although I will look for a copy. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of three young men: two girls, one on the edge of puberty and the other much younger, and a boy who goes to live with his mother's brother and his young woman. silent Irish wife. His wife also has two brothers who live with them. The children's uncle is an unpleasant control freak who forces his young wife to wear a silver collar while watching a puppet show put on by him and his brothers in his toy store. <br /> <br /> The firstborn and one of the Irish (the youngest) develop a love for one another while living in the same house. The girl helps her aunt in the shop while her brother helps her uncle do things in the lab. <br /> <br /> There are many very disturbing elements in the film. There is the uncle who treats his wife as a kind of stupid (literally) possession (illustrated by the collar) while the Irish indulges dance, drink and a somewhat forbidden love. It is interesting to note, however, that I have seen much more explicit themes in other films made in Hollywood today. I wonder if the British film industry and the BBC have some sort of hidden agenda. <br /> <br /> However, although it is not a children's film, there are many playful and magical moments and the Irish make some beautiful paintings.
