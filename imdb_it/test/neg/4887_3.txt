I bought it for a couple of dollars in the local video store, because they took their tapes in favor of DVDs. I doubt they will replace this in any way. <br /> <br /> I couldn't say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's very boring. No real cannibal scene. Me Me Lai is not naked enough of time (only about 4 or 5 times). Nor is it the Thai goddess I expected. So two of my reasons for watching this movie have been eliminated. <br /> <br /> There is severe animal violence here for those who love this kind of thing. A great struggle between a mongoose and a large snake becomes rather bloody. Even the torture of animals, some of which is real and false. Fortunately the fake is a bit strange, but the truth is just a little disgusting. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a film from the 70s - too long, underdeveloped, not as deep as it would have been. But it's something different, right? ONE AND A HALF STARS!
