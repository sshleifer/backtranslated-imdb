I saw this turkey in the theater, but I enjoyed it. The special effects are not worthy of the production of a primary school. A toy boat, which represents a merchant ship, which moves at very fast speed on flat water while the wind-driven fog blows in the opposite direction. Red and blue flood lamps add an extraordinary touch. Any cache that Vincent Price should have brought as a narrator is completely obscured by the terrible production work. Calling this documentary is like calling Britney Spears a musician. About 20 minutes later, something struck me very funny. Perhaps it was Price's overly dramatic tone of the often used line "They vanished in the Devil's Triangle! [Cut to black, later story] Once I started laughing, my friends joined in. Next time Vinny said the crucial line, someone yelled "Good!" After that, he got almost as much laughter from a Marx Brothers movie. No one stayed for the terrible second feature "Chariots of the Gods".
