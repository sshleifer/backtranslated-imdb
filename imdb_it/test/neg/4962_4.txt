I'm a German student so sorry for any mistakes (I'm working on it;)) <br /> <br /> The very interesting stylistic style converted and with accentuated sound effects accentuated the dramatic action of the drama does not deviate in any way from the horrible bad actors insincere and unnatural moves and expressions of feelings) and makes the story relatively strange and meaningless. Only the typical slasher genre with a very strange action in this case. Many subtitles partially destroy the main story and leave viewers until the end in darkness, creating oddities and suggesting that the senses of actions and the point are just dangerous. It's certainly a hit for flash fans, but not for me. But even if the interesting style of cinematography and the appropriate use of light went well. <br /> <br /> So not the best ...
