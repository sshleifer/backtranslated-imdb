The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece. John Garfield, Ann Revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee ... and filmed by one of the greatest directors of photography to ever embellish the screen ... James Wong Howe. This remake is abominable. Despite the presence of Rod Steiger, Joe Mantegna and Jennifer Beals there is nothing of value here and it is a pity that this product bears the same title as the original genius. Only the name of the main character, Charlie Davis, is the same in both films. I don't think there are any salvific qualities in this remake. I am amazed that Rod Steiger participated. This could be the only bad movie I've ever made. Maybe he needed the salary.
