This film has been released in all major Australian cinemas. I watched the movie on the weekend of August 7th and thought it was an absolute nonsense (and I'm using this word in an extremely violent way). As it was released to all the great cinemas with no idea. The plot seemed simple enough as the world was divided into subclasses and people needed ID cards and actor Tim Robbins who was the investigator who goes to Shanghai to investigate an employee who steals ID cards which turns out to be actress Samantha Morton. > <br /> Do you think that from that summary the rest of the story should interact but does not confuse the public even more with a different plot that does not refer. <br /> <br /> If you think of seeing this movie, save me the trouble. DON'T GET THIS MOVIE.
