I happened to see this movie on TV late at night. I saw the credits and thought it was nice. Well, I was very wrong. Although it wasn't terribly ugly (it had some funny and tender moments), it had no sense of cohesion. <br /> <br /> It started quite well with the character of Kathy Bates who has a mid-life crisis when her husband leaves her and her idol singer is murdered. But Kathy has played these disgruntled women so well before - think of fried green tomatoes. The problem wasn't Kathy, it was the clueless script that roamed everywhere. It was as if the writers must have thought about what we will do next. The script also seemed very artificial. <br /> <br /> Some others who have posted comments on this film have wondered why they did not receive a film version. The main reason I think would have been to avoid embarrassment and criticism would have killed her. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I thought that the little woman who played Maudie was fantastic and had stolen the movie, not to mention how beautiful she is.
