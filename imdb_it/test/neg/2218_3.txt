"At the Earth's Core" was on television yesterday. I was working on my computer and I happened to take a look and see what must have been some of the worst action sequences ever made. I was immediately fascinated by the poor production values ​​of the film, by the terrifying acting (including all - even Peter Cushing) and by the horrible, involuntarily hilarious action sequences and puppet monsters. <br /> <br /> The film is about a Victorian scientist taking a stereotypical Buff American Hero on a boring journey into the Welsh countryside. They do not know that a great evil lurks in the center of the earth's core ... Forget the fact that the title makes no sense. (If they were really at the center of the Earth, they would be about 2700 kg / m3 underground and will burn alive in a sea of ​​iron or whatever it is down there.) Forget that the puppets used in the production rival "The Beast Master" to be the most fake look of all time. No, the real genius of "At the Earth's Core" is his stupid naivety: an amazing action show with no real action and no real show. In essence, it's just a stupid and a stupid movie. People who love MST3K-style things will love this: it's terribly bad, and really so ugly it's almost funny in a strange way.
