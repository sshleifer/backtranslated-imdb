First, I don't see how the film is on a "better" list or how it has won any awards. Compared to La Pianiste, which is also on a "better" list, La Pianiste is golden. This film lacked so many things on so many different levels, but I can't explain why I liked it so much. The leading actor was annoying, I felt like I never knew what was going on, and I was WORST !! Although this should have been a change of value that Pierre was starting, I wanted it to end ... as soon as possible. Why did it have to be his sister and cousin? Ugh. And why did Thibault become bad? It has simply turned into bipolar. And besides, was it me or did I miss the whole purpose of what that guy in black was? Who were all those people who played music in the big basement of the department store? Why did they have all those strange equipment, guns and all those extra rooms for people to live in? I mean this in all seriousness, but does incest happen a lot in French culture? European culture? I took 5 years of studying culture and I've never heard of it!
