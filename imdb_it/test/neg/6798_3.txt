Poor Diane Arbus (whoever she was). Not only was she (according to this film) a top brat from eastern Morocco, but she was a bad wife, a bad mother, a terrible business partner; furthermore there is no evidence in this image that he was a sort of artist - except in the bold statement of the prologue. <br /> <br /> Nicole Kidman, who is incredibly attractive today 25 years ago and actually looks younger, really gives an excellent performance; but what can an actress do with a wife and a mother who seeks and falls in love with an incredibly strange werewolf-like boy who lives in the apartment above? Set in the early 1970s, Manhattan was a veritable magnet for freaks and weirs of all sizes and shapes, most of them don't look like human furballs; so why this story worthy of a 122 minute movie? Robert Downey Jr was one of my favorites, but I would say that his well-known and prolonged drug use has taken its toll. One would think that he would not be inclined to act in a film that treats drug use as casually as he smokes cigarettes. <br /> <br /> FUR has already taken a beating at the box office, but in view of those who put a score of 10 for this wrong piece of junk, I'd like to say, 'dirty like that, McGee.
