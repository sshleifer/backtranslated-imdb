OK enough already. this is a terrible piece of television. the camera work is scary (I must remind you of the crunchy gravel so strong that I can hardly hear the actors talking) lady bertram has the most annoying voice in the whole world. anna massey is acting in such an incredible way. and the lack of chemistry between Fanny and Edmund goes further. even the bertram girls are not pretty enough, and the boy who plays Henry Crawford is horrible. to say that camera work is doubtful is an understatement. I witnessed this adaptation over Christmas, and I think that in any other circumstances I would not have been able to stand it, and certainly I would not have been able to justify the lost time. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of faithful to Jane's adaptations. so I couldn't stand the film adaptation or the recent film about pride and prejudice. but see any other adaptation, even Emma is better than this.
