Since then two things have changed. First of all, I'm not a kid anymore, and according to almost all of the new Seagal movies they are terrible. In my opinion this is the worst film ever made with Derailed played by Jean Claude Van Damme. plot in this film, the plot is just an excuse to shoot some terrible action scenes that are painful to watch. I love action movies, but this is not an action movie .... This is not a movie ... this is a bunch of annoying scenes that are annoyingly connected to kill viewers who love movies of 'action. I'm sorry but I have no respect for anyone who liked this movie. It has a serious intelligence problem then. I hope Seagal will make some new good films in the future. Good luck for him!
