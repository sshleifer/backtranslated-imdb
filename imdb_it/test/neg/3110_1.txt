this is the worst movie I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot of movies. My friends and I rented this Wednesday evening. Man, we had a lot of fun. This film is the worst boring quack ever seen. But it makes you laugh! U will lie on the floor rolling around trying to get some air. Wondering why? Just rent it and check the keyboard that plays as a girl in that squalid Russian bar. My mother would have made a 1000 times better movie for her than she was feeding the cats.
