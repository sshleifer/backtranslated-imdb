Obviously with this film that goes straight to the DVD I did not expect much, but this film is so little fun that it's incredible. The only part of the movie that you might find remotely amusing is even before you arrive on the island, where Eddie's son is thrown out of the bathroom by a jet of water and that's all! Why do they care at all? The first Christmas holiday with Chevy Chase was brilliant and exhilarating. This is not. They are based on jokes about a dog with flatulence, and a character called Uncle Nick who is about 80 years old and continues to try to work his way up with beautiful women. When they approach the island on the boat, the island in the background looks so fake and Randy Quaid, although funny in the previous film, simply exaggerates and seems to be trying too much to be funny. You have been warned!
