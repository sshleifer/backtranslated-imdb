A few weeks ago, in a movie theater, I saw a poster of El Padrino (2004) with the label "The Latin Godfather". How lame we have become, I thought, Latin just because it's Mexican? Let me remind you that ANY Latin origin is related to Lazio, Italy, so the original film of the Godfather film is more Latin than the Mexican Godfather and this is why we are called Latin Americans because we speak Spanish, language based Latin that originated in Rome, now in Italy. So, inserting a tag into a movie poster like "The Latin godfather" is not only ignorant, obviously if we are trying to correlate this film with the original Godfather, but a desperate and non-creative attempt to get some credit by copying the title of a classic film. Now about the movie, I just hate it going from 1 to 10, I think it's 3 more.
