Like the beauty of the jungle, Jessica Alba's wonderful smile and sensual looks loom over the film, but unfortunately they are the only two things that make this movie worth watching. When in theory we should be careful about fiction. <br /> <br /> The plot is thin on the ground and hard to believe. As beautiful as Jessica Alba, she adds no spark that she injected into the believable series "Dark Angel". Since Dark Angel seems that Alba has been reduced to a mere pleasure for the eyes (but what a feast for the eyes!), And it is the only reason why it has been included in the films. <br /> <br /> The concept of the sleep dictionary is stupid and implausible, with a small development of the character (or such a character) to make us want to take the 109 minutes of run time with this world. Despite the short films, he still manages to seem long and too tiring. <br /> <br /> It seems a pity that talents like Brenda Blethyn, Emily Mortimer, Bob Hoskins are wasted on a worn-out narrative that just raises a little pulse. This film lacks a trick, an exotic setting, a cast more than capable, with a beautiful cinematography, and the possibility of using the dualistic themes and concepts of "civilization". But there is little narrative to talk about, no drama, no sense we are looking at a love story, plus a story of lust and a woman happy to please men without asking questions. Let's be honest, if Jessica Alba let you sleep with her, do you really think you can concentrate on learning a tribal language? Here lies the great problem, both in the suspension of disbelief and also in what the female characters are limited and reduced. Take for example the fact that the character of Jessica Alba suffers the mental and physical tribulation of pregnancy and birth to her forbidden love, however all we see is her adorable and shapely appearance for a minute, then adorable and curvy, with a child, the next. br /> <br /> It is a sad state of affairs to see a film with promises not up to anything that is close to its potential. I could write endlessly about the flaws in the film, but I feel sorry for it. The film looks nice, the premise could have been turned into a good movie, but unfortunately it wouldn't have been.
