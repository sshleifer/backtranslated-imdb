I've always liked Carry On movies, with their dialogues of double meaning sexual insinuation and moments of slapstick comedy, but I can understand why critics give this two stars. Basically, many Britons are gathering on a bus to go on holiday to Spain to an island called Elsbels at the Palace Hotel. What they didn't know is that it's not completely built, plus they have to share the bathrooms with their neighbors, they have crap, and many other complications and complaints that the owner Pepe (Peter Butterworth, making a rather funny accent, for example peace) looks like the bad word P). Starring Sid James as Vic Flange, Kenneth Williams as Stuart Farquhar, Charles Hawtrey as Eustace Tuttle, Joan Sims as Cora Flange, Barbara Windsor as Sadie Tomkins, Kenneth Connor as Stanley Blunt, apparently lousy (personally I don't remember who he is) Jimmy Logan in the role of Bert Conway, June Whitfield in the role of Evelyn Blunt, Hattie Jacques in the role of Floella (a ridiculous character, not as memorable as his usual matron), Bernard Bresslaw in the role of Brother Bernard, Sally Geeson as Lily, Carol Hawkins as Marge, Jack Douglas as Harry and Patsy Rowlands as Miss Dobbs. I admit it's not great, but there are enough dialogues, and of course Babs in the shower, and going to his ass with that iconic whistle, and then a quick rip-off of his bra. All right!
