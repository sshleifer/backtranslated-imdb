The Tender Hook, or, Who Killed The Australian Film Industry? Case no. 278. Does this sorry excuse for a dramatic period take a cast and an idea with a potential ?? Rose Byrne, Pia Miranda, Hugo Weaving, in a gangster drama of the Jazz era? and transforms it into a soporific with a slow and executed rhythm. McHeath (Weaving) is a functioning boxing and gangster promoter; for no apparent reason he was given to sing songs by Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen before periods. How postmodern. How stupid. Anyway. There is a boxer, Art (Matthew Le Nevez), who becomes McHeath's last protégé, in his hapless Aboriginal stable mate Alby (Luke Carroll). <br /> <br /> McHeath's Irish clothespin, Iris (Byrne) makes the eyes goo-goo him. Sexual tension lurks beneath the surface. Miranda plays Daisy, a friend of Iris (these flower girls stick together) who continues to appear in scenes without warning. They practice dancing together and talk about "hooking up" with boys. In the 1920s. Then I stopped counting anachronisms. There is a subplot involving Japanese beer and a background of Broome pearl fishermen. I don't know what it was. For some reason that isn't exactly (completely) explained, Byrne puts cocaine in Art's lemonade. McHeath thinks he's drunk and fires him. Byrne plot and schemes to help him again. It's a big deal for the plot and the plot. Most of them cause problems. McHeath's two gunslingers, burly Ronnie (John Batchelor) and Russian Donnie (Tyler Coppin), argue against McHeath when he does their part in one of Iris's schemes, but Ronnie is having fun when he sees McHeath crying. A lot of practically incoherent scenes come to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Director Jonathan Ogilvie spends a lot of time working with the director of photography Geoffrey Simpson creating beautiful images, but he can't generate a sense of style, which could have compensated and decorated the thin and pathetic script undersized; unfortunately Ogilvie's sense of film grammar, the lack of structuring of the scenes and exposure, is incredibly incompetent. In an opening scene, Daisy suddenly appears in the car with the protagonists. How she got there, and indeed who she is, seems to have lost her head to Ogilvie. There are many other examples of this sloppiness. Where poetic scarcity follows, it reaches only a faint irritation. He gets awkward shows from normally reliable actors, who seriously mistreat Weaving and rely on Byrne's ability to project a kind of bewitched humanity like a doll while saddling her with an incomprehensible character. <br /> <br /> It may not matter much if the story had more consistent characters and a stronger storyline preferably not stolen from a dozen old noir movies and decked out with witty pop-culture quotes. But is not so. That's boring.
