I was waiting to welcome the action of Arnold Schwarzeneger after the sad films he had made after "Eraser". "End of Days", however, can be added to the gloomy films in which it has had the misfortune to appear. <br /> <br /> "End of Days" starts well with a compelling action sequence, but soon becomes boring, diverting attention from action and suspense and focusing instead on the investigation of demonic events and the millennium which is fast approaching (read "Doomsday"). <br /> <br /> The performances are stale, the special effects so-so and the abundant blood. Considering me a huge Schwarzenegger fan, I couldn't believe I didn't like this movie, but with such a horrible and lame script, what could Arnie have done besides pass this turkey? <br /> <br /> 3 on 10 <br /> <br />
