"Baseball" by Ken Burns is a decent documentary ... presents a clear origin of the game, a great representation of the early years of baseball and heroes. There is a lot in this film for every baseball fan ... that said, the film has several obvious flaws. <br /> <br /> 18 hours is simply too long for human attention. It is clear that Burns has lengthened his film to fit his concept of "nine innings". It's not even 18 hours tight ... the rhythm on each segment is slow, almost dark ... the music is always nostalgic and melancholy. Isn't baseball ever exciting and fun? Why is every player and his achievements presented in the form of a tragedy? Talking head-on after talking, turns every pitch into an emotional heartbreak, joking about baseball as a metaphor, about baseball as an American, about psychology and the theology of baseball ... enough! This is syrupy, idiot. Billy Crystal is here to sell us all the Yankee hokum he sold to us before. Ken Burns uses the national anthem as the theme song of the series, and manages to play "Take Me To To The Ballgame" so many times you could vomit. We understand, man. <br /> <br /> Clearly Burns is a neo-Hollywood faux-liberal, so he probably spends a third of the negro championships ... these segments are spent punishing yesterday's whites for not being as open as Kenny is today. For shame! He blames baseball for being segregated in the thirties and forties, but can't understand that America was segregated in those days! Burns falls madly in love with Buck O'Neil, a former black-league player, and drools over each piece of footage where Elder O'Neil becomes poetic in his playing days. Nonsense ... <br /> <br /> Burns would have been better with an adult to help him change his creation down. "Baseball" develops as a propaganda of soft, fake civilian propaganda disguised as Americana. It is clear that Burns is not a baseball fan ... otherwise he would know that we watch the games laugh and cheer, don't cry and play soliloquies ... are you listening, Mr. Burns? There is no need to cry in baseball.
