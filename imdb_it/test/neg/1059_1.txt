Well, this movie shows us that Mark Griffiths and the producers think we're all idiots. If not how we should understand this: <br /> <br /> American pilots take off on Mig-29. All of the planes suddenly turn into F-16s. Ha, a magic! After an action ... the Migs land. The magic again! <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention that the F-16s had Israeli markings? <br /> <br /> Another magic: obviously the unarmed L-39 instructors bombard enemies. <br /> <br /> And more magic: while all the films are in Europe, we can see a desert in almost every scene flight. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the director has wasted all his magic on the things above, because the action scenes are incredibly chaotic and even the explosions seem terribly as if the pilots were being bombed by Molotov. <br /> <br /> OK, OK, this is a movie. I should write about his story ... wait. A story? Yes, there is some story in this film. And it's also horrible.
