Kubrick may have been the greatest director of all time. He could have done more classics than anyone else. He may have been a perfectionist. But man, it was his first bad attempt! <br /> <br /> Kubrick had good reason to try to get this movie off the map: it looks like an Ed Wood movie. It has a strange narrative, cheap shots, wrong dialogues, threatening music reminiscent of your 1950s science fiction / horror film, and what appears to be a relative of the "Reefer Madness" cast goes crazy for no reason. <br /> <br /> Sure, you can see an undeveloped Kubrick in there. It is a psychological / horror study of war. The characters have become dehumanized and crazy. There are people who play more than one role. There are constant strokes of faces and particular facial expressions of different people. And there are some interesting shots around here. But really, this is a mess. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm not discouraging you from watching it. If you can understand it, you join a select group of myself and a few thousand people around the world who have had access to it.
