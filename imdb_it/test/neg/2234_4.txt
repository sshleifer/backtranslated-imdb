This is the second addition to Frank Baum's Oz film trilogy. It is essentially the same infantility as the other two images, although I consider it preferable to others because it is shorter. As in the other films, there are interpreters in animal costumes, an adult woman pretends to be a boy, and the characters and the plot jump everywhere while the work of the cameras is static. This time, in the center, there is a magical cloak that grants wishes, and the boy played by a woman becomes a king. <br /> <br /> Most special effects are witnessed at the beginning. Fairies are represented by multiple exposure photographs. And there is a man in the moon who resembles those made by Georges Méliès years before, the most famous in "Le Voyage dans la lune" (1902). Méliès's imaginative fantasies and the creative effects of make-up made him the leading pioneer of ancient cinema, and the films he made around the turn of the century were far better and even more technically advanced than this insignificant Oz series.
