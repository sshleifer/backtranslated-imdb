Incredibly, "Vampire Assassin" is significantly worse than such atrocities as "Tequila Body Shots" and "Zombie Nation" - and those films are TERRIBLE. The writer / director / star Ron Hall lacks the charisma and acting ability, and is clearly incapable of the basic concepts of directing. Perhaps the worst job of shooting, editing, lighting, sound, visual effects, music and fighting choreography I've ever seen in a movie. Rarely do they make two shots cut together, nor can you see much in the lighting beyond the light. The terrible dialogue is spoken very slowly by an extremely unpublished cast, extending the film to almost 87 deadly minutes. This is a really ridiculous embarrassment for everyone involved. Obviously, terrible movie fans will want to see it, but it's very difficult to sit down regardless of how experienced a bad viewer is. The fact that Ron Hall thought it was actually releasable is staggering. If you are a director, and you really think it is right for the opening credits of your movie to include some frames of the SLUG words before the title appears, left to your crude montage - and apparently you can't muster the energy to change those frames - so your standards are obviously so low as to be offensive. I am amazed that Lions Gate / Maple has agreed to publish this film on DVD. Despite the very short cameo by Rudy Ray Moore, this film is a work of supreme self-indulgence by Ron Hall - he clearly thinks he is a formidable actor, and must also believe that he possesses superior writing and directing skills - but the film is so incredibly inept that it's hard to believe that he actually wants people to see him for fear of being brutally excoriated like I'm doing now. A stunning, incredibly terrible film. I'm not kidding.
