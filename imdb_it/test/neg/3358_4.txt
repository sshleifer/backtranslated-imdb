Under media action / melodrama of blaxpoitation in which the beautiful Mrs. Grier plays a private eye that comes to the aid of her father (Rudy Challenger) and her partner (Austin Stoker of the original "Assault on Precinct 13") whose loan Ã¨ I am in danger. <br /> <br /> I'll be honest, I agree with the other comments from other users for this movie. "Sheba, Baby" has an unsatisfactory script, a direction that is not particularly distinct, action scenes that are moderately fun at best, and one of Grier's most anonymous supporting descents (although there is an important role support for D'Urville Martin, also a household name in blaxpoitation). I have the feeling that this routine movie could have been put together quickly just to cash in its huge popularity. <br /> <br /> It was good to see Stoker again, even if Mrs. Grier doesn't have the same good a role - or a dialogue - as she has in other films, even if she is doing what she does best , and is playing a sexy and cheeky sister on a mission of revenge. <br /> <br /> Non-stop soul / the funk soundtrack is at least pleasant. <br /> <br /> Recommended especially for those who wish to see everything in Pam Grier's film repertoire. <br /> <br /> 4/10
