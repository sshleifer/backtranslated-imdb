Although it's not really terrible, this film is still largely a waste of time and paints an incredibly inaccurate and revisionist image of the Beach Boys story. <br /> <br /> Basically, this film would have you believe that Mike Love was the brain behind the band and Brian Wilson was just a pathetic psychopath. In fact, none of the characters is developed beyond a one-dimensional parody, but this is a TV movie, so what do you expect? The stench of Mike Love is all this turkey as he tries to rewrite history with himself as a band figurehead and resident genius. Yes, as if ... <br /> <br /> The positive side is that the music is excellent. Unlike the previous Beach Boys made for the bio-photo "Summer Dreams", this film actually presents the true Beach Boys music, rather than the anemic cover covers ... Furthermore, it presents a surprising number of rarities linked to the Beach Boys and rarely -heard tracks - The Sunrays "I Live for the Sun" are just one example. <br /> <br /> This film was originally shown in two parts on the American television network. The first part is the superior of the two and documents the early times of the Boys and rises to the top. When the second part revolves around, the character of Brian Wilson has become a simple cartoon and the actor seems to play for laughter - but how can you take this shit seriously? If you are not a Beach Boys fan you will probably not be able to get much from this film except for an extremely distorted and one-sided view of the band's history. But then again, why should you watch this if you weren't a fan?
