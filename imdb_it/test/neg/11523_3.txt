I really should have known more about this movie before renting it. It was one of those movies where you keep watching it, imagining it has to improve. Then when it ends, you feel stupid for wasting precious time in your life that you can never get back. Ice-T did its bad thing and, well, that was the highlight of the evening. The images of the shuttle appear to have been made with a small toy inside a box and the spatial displacement scenes were fun because you could see the strings attached to the spacesuits. The script was missing and the chase scene in the car with the bleeding and fainting boy was incredible because he drove better than I could have done on one of my best days. All in all, I've seen worse but this is definitely not one I would recommend or would like to remember.
