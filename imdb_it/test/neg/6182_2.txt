Big disappointment. CLASH BY NIGHT is very talkative and unconventional and the dialogue does not resonate as true coming from these characters. This is the melodrama at its peak. The acting is really exaggerated and very unreal. Only MARILYN MONROE and KEITH ANDES as support players give this movie any zip. I wish they had more to do. I'm someone who looks at the details in the movies. Two big questions ... 1 Who's watching the baby all day Stanwyck and Ryan are together and Douglas is working, so breaking up in a bar with father? 2. When Stanwyck is packing to leave the city, why did he see his brothers being packed where he didn't live for at least two years? Also, when everyone goes to the theater screening room, who looks after the child again? These details irritate me a lot and lead me to give films much lower scores. What were the writers, the directors and all the others connected to the thought of the film? Nuf said.
