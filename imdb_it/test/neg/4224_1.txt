A desperate attempt to make a sci-fi thriller "film noir", but the film is not up to it. It has no credible plot, some of the main actors were a joke (NOT Lars Bom, it's cool!). I liked the "restriction of access for bandwidth maximization" though. I finished it on principle, but I came home feeling like I'd lost two hours of my life ...
