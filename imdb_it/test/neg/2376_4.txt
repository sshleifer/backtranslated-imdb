This Asterix is ​​very similar to modern Disney cartoons. Soulless, technically good and the usual jokes on the table for adults. Maybe it's because this is the first cartoon I saw after Laputa: Castle in the Sky, but it was rather disappointing. <br /> <br /> The plot is artificial and forgettable but involves Asterix and Obelix who go to the Viking territory to save a spoiled teenager who then learns humility and also finds love. Oh and initially they don't get along, but after facing adversity they all share a deep bond of friendship ... yadda yadda. <br /> <br /> The best thing is to be careful about the jokes. The Vikings take all the best. Like Vikea (the wife of the leader of the Vikings) who provides a list of furniture and skulls to bring back to the next raid. Or the Vikings not knowing the meaning of mercy (literally). Oh, and Olaf the most stupid Viking is actually hilarious (so much for the voice that acts as a dialogue). <br /> <br /> For example, aboard the Viking ship: (After a speech by the captain's daughter Abba) Olaf: Who is this new guy? Captain: this is my daughter, cod-brain! Olaf: Your ... daughter is ... a man?
