When I found out that there was a Christmas holiday 2, I couldn't wait to buy the DVD. I sent my money and looked at it as soon as it arrived through the mailbox. I love all the national street lamp movies with Chevy chasing, and I bet he was glad he wasn't in this! I could not believe how bad it was, you would think it was impossible not to laugh at a national street lamp movie, but believe me! . Probably this film seemed like a good idea on paper that cousin Eddie was the main character, he started to get nervous in the film right away, and it became totally unattractive in the middle of the film, and by the end of the film I was brain dead and couldn't remember what had happened! .
