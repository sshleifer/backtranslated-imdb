This is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen; I gave him a star simply because it's the lowest possible score. Anyone who thought that Flood would ever be a good movie? The director and the cast should be ashamed and then I realized that all this could be part of a burning scare tactic. Only propaganda could be so bad. <br /> <br /> The saving characteristic of Flood is that it is the horror and the shameless plot of the plot that make it fun. If only the characters had the same depth created by the flood itself, yet they gallop from the sound of the bite to the sound of the bite without any emotional response whatsoever. <br /> <br /> The sad thing about this film is that it could have been much better, informative, imaginative and tense. Flood has the amateur vein of founding in many recent British films where more targeted use of funds would have made for better entertainment. <br /> <br /> Where was Smithee?
