Stay away from this movie. Far. Phil Fondacaro is the crazy boss of a Freakshow. Every show is flat and insensitive, with the exception of Fondacaro. The plot is simple and follows almost all the horror film clich√©s possible. A group of high school children goes to a carnival, watches a side-show and stands between their heads. <br /> <br /> Fred Olen Ray fans should be warned, this is not like one of his other films. This is missing in all departments (humor, sex, horror, etc.) Others F.O. Ray's films also excel in. <br /> <br /> The version I saw also contained a Making-Of documentation, in which the director comments as "We had a limited budget" and "with our limited timeline" that talks about Charles Band cared about this movie. Rent "Droid Runner" (Fred Olen Ray) or "The Dead Hate the Living" (Full Moon) instead. Full Moon should be ashamed of himself (and this is saying a lot after seeing "Killer Eye") <br /> <br /> Vote: D-
