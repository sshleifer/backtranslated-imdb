The representation of Ichabod Crane's character was so terribly unlikely, my wife and I hoped that the knight (or some other character) would not only cut Crane's head, but he would do it slowly and painfully. <br /> <br /> I mean, this Brent Carver guy played at the top --- like he was on Broadway. And he was such a relentless ass that we had no sympathy for him. <br /> <br /> I could go on with specific criticisms about how this film failed, but I prefer not to devote energy. <br /> <br /> Just skip it and go for the Johnny Depp version. Or that, or rent the haunted pumpkin of Sleepy Hollow (animated). It's pretty good - fun for kids and adults. <br /> <br /> Better yet, read the original story by Washington Irving.
