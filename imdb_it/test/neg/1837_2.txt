First, this film works in the fact that it is disturbing. I really didn't like seeing all these scenes where people were reduced to life, etc. The strangely erotic introduction gives a sense of necrophilic wonder. It is somehow ... unpleasant for me personally. But the film really works in that regard, and it's supposed to be scary, so I give it credit. Yes, some points there for those scalpels and .... well, damn scary idea of ​​being discovered alive. <br /> <br /> But what this film lacks is an interesting plot, characterization, or real surprises. The entire horror genre for teen-hitch usually takes place in a very simple and predictable way. A lot of "thesis" moments, creepy guys who are crazy, and everyone's big question: is the boyfriend the murderer? This film fits into the category of "Scream" and countless others that they generated in the 90s. Well, I won't ruin it for you, but it's not exactly interesting who the killer is. Let's find out who's in the middle ... and from then on, the film drags on, trying to fill up some time ... nothing short of annoyingly. I looked at the watch a little in this movie. <br /> <br /> The lead actress is great, as usual, but the acting box in which she is positioned makes herself moan with pain ... the college girl who is a detective who everyone thinks is crazy, but she really knows what's going on. And the cops? Ahhh, they laugh and eat donuts. Very predictable, flat, sometimes disturbing and, above all, boring and boring ... It is as if an American film company took a flight to Germany to shoot a movie to make it foreign ..... hmmm ..... or were they ? <br /> <br />
