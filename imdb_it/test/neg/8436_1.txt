One of the biggest lessons I've ever had on how to watch a movie came about like this: <br /> <br /> I worked in the offices of Roger Corman, like so many other wanabee before and since then, I was interning and trying to understand how everything worked and how to make me indispensable (hah!). One afternoon, Julie Corman, Roger Corman's wife and a producer in turn, asked me to load a tape. I'm not sure why he wanted to see it. I had the impression that it was a student film or a show reel, something like that, a sort of business card. Whatever the reason he saw it, the only free video camera in the office at the time was in the room I was working in, and I was the closest person to the car. I started the tape. <br /> <br /> Fade in opening: on the screen a figure sitting at a desk facing the camera. Behind him, on the screen to the left, was a door that opened into the room. Against the wall was a coat rack. A second character came in the door and started talking. The first character, the boy at the desk, turned to answer, (this is all a shot, a static camera, no pans or dolly shots. The second character turned to hang his coat on the coat rack and deliver his next line Julie Corman said "I've seen enough." and left the room. <br /> <br /> What he had seen in the ten seconds of footage he had seen was that the director was an idiot. Opening with two characters Who immediately turned their backs on the camera by providing the lines? No excuse. Next! This is how much time you have. Ten seconds. Fucking in the opening blow and you're dead. <br /> <br /> I was reminded of that moment as I watched the opening of this piece of shit. After an endless long jungle journey, we see several monkeys apparently throwing themselves into the cages. A man carrying a gun laughs A jet liner lands and we see him by taxi until terminal God is boring! Cutting towards the interior of the airport. Two men meet. Aha! Something is happening! They shake hands. Cut to a different corner of the two men - <br /> <br /> - and the director cuts the line. <br /> <br /> The first two shots of the film that have some kind of spatial relationship with each other and the boy stood up. 'Not Crossing The line' is one of those basic rules of film grammar that prevents characters from jumping from one side to the other on the screen and confusing the audience. The public does not like to be confused. Mystified? Baffled? Puzzled and intrigued? Yes. The public loves all of these. Confused? No. You lose them. They go out. 'Not Crossing The line' is one of those things that strike you at the film school, or should. It's basic stuff. It is not an inviolable rule (there are no inviolable rules) the directors break down continuously - but not on the first real cut in the film. <br /> <br /> I thought, "I've seen enough." It's off.
