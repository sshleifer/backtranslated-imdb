My main criticism of the film is animation. I totally agree with everyone else he was very poor. Some of the characters seemed to have darker skin tones than they did in the first movie, which is much better. Even the colors of the background seemed hasty and a little static. It is also a pity that Michael J. Fox did not voice Milo, did a great job, and James Arnold Taylor was not sure if he should play like Milo or Aladino. I also considered the lack of a good plot. the third story was confused and clumsily told, and the second story suffered from poor scripts. To make matters worse, the first one I can't even remember, apart from a haunted fishing village or something like that. However, there was good music and good vocal talent from John Mahoney, Cree Summer, Clancy Brown and Tom Wilson, who saved the film from total disaster. All in all, a disappointing sequel to a surprisingly good movie. 4/10 Bethany Cox.
