In 1993 Sega published a boring and lackluster video game of one of the greatest films of all time. Quickly making their mistake, they deleted a different version of the game, claiming it would be bigger, harder and better. <br /> <br /> Neither of them. Both were slow and boring games. <br /> <br /> You can choose to be Dr. Alan Grant or ... a Raptor. Both have their problems. Why would Dr. Grant go around killing all those army types (what are they doing in the game)? And why is a Raptor killing other Raptors? Strangely. <br /> <br /> Obviously not learning from their first mistake, Sega dropped the ball on the original version and the so-called Rampage Edition. One of the slowest, lazy and boring platformers I've ever played.
