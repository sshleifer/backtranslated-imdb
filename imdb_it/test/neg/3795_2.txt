I was totally disgusted by this useless sequel to "The Poseidon Adventure", a film that I commented on. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredible from the word GO! I agree, why were there no other boat and helicopter rescue? The one who saved the original survivors had just flown over the boat that houses Michael Caine and Sally Field. WHAT WAS THE ONLY PART OF THE RESCUE? Hard to believe. <br /> <br /> Acting is generally poor and the show seems cheap. I really hated wasting talent from some good actors. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie unless you have to capture Sally and Michael as lovers. <br /> <br />
