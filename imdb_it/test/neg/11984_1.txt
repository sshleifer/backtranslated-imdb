Unfortunately, this film is at about 1% of the hype that the game created in 2004 and leaves a very sour taste in the mouth. For video game enthusiasts, book worms and movie fans, there's nothing more disappointing than a movie based on an original concept (on paper or game console) that it doesn't provide. And not only that, it's great under the brand. Far Cry, the video game released in 2004, created such a cult based on the fact that the making of a film with the content should have been easy and many players would have flocked to watch the film. If you are a player who played Far Cry; Don't watch this movie. Anyone else who hasn't played the game; it will still look like a B-quality recited / B direct movie. Uwe Boll, hang your head in shame ... this should have been easy to turn into a success. The plot of the game was incredible (think that Jurassic Park meets Alien) and yet you still managed to catch it and adapt it to your terrible recreation of an instant classic. Video game companies should be warned: if Uwe Boll knocks on the door, close the door. Oh & Til Schweiger ... I can't wait to see you recover in Inglourious Basterds. What were you thinking of doing this? Sigh.
