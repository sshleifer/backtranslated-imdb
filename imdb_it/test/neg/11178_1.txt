The most disturbing thing about this film is not that it is a load of smoke (CPUSA has never been as much of a spy threat as the film). The disturbing aspect is the way it whitens the totally unpleasant tactics of the FBI and the American Activities Committee. Secret informers, gossip turned into accusations, unsubstantiated research - these are the kind of things that the secret police hooligans like the KGB did, and presumably what the good patriotic Americans were fighting. Yet the FBI made them and did not flinch. This is the only realistic part of this film, and they present it without any sense of shame. Add to this by undermining the same constitution by having only the communists invoke the Bill of Rights. The film also hints at the veiled accusations that the black civil rights movement was inspired by communism, another bunch of lies. It is extremely difficult on this day to excuse such outrageous propaganda, even understanding the paranoia of the times, when one realizes how harmful it was to real people then.
