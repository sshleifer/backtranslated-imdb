'You're in the Navy Now' is painfully bad: most likely the worst Gary Cooper film ever made. It is supposed to be based on a true story, but the incident that inspired this film doesn't seem to have enough plot to support a script. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on local television while I was at home sitting for my mother-in-law on Long Island, New York. Outside there was a rushing snowstorm, and I was literally snowy. If I could get out of the door, I would definitely have stopped watching this movie. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting names in the supporting cast, most notably Charles Bronson (with his original name), Lee Marvin, Harvey Lembeck, Jack Webb and Jack Warden. Forget about it. Everyone stinks in this movie. Even the usual reliable Millard Mitchell is horrible. Lee Marvin and Jack Warden are on the screen so synthetically, there's no reason to watch them. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper plays an obscure naval officer who is assigned to command a ship that is powered by a new experimental turbine steam: in practice, the entire ship is a giant kettle. Cooper realizes that the assignment is not prestigious: if it were, he would have gone to a better officer. <br /> <br /> Cooper was a good actor in dramatic roles, but he simply had no comedy skills. He has made several bad plays, and this is his worst. Jane Greer has always bored me and bored me more than usual here. This ship fell with all hands and sank without a trace. Did I mention that this movie stinks? I will evaluate "You're in the Navy Now" a point on 10. Toot! Toot!
