Even though I was a shock and gore fanatic, I found this film disappointing to say the least. The effects and work of the puppets were impressive, yes, and the humor was perfect, but ... something was missing. See, the first act of the film is dedicated to establishing the nuances of the character of Jack Brooks, despite the fact that everything we need to know about his aggression is delivered within minutes of the first cards of the title. As for the narrative and many of the flashbacks: useless. <br /> <br /> The rhythm during the second act was boring. Most focus on Freddy Krueger who eats, then vomits, then eats another, then flaps his arms and says something snappy or rude. All the while, the schlock is punctuated by short scenes of Jack talking about his anger problems with a therapist. (Definitely the funny scenes from the movie - an excellent dialogue deserves a lot of laughter.) So, without warning, Jack decides to kill some monsters. And then it's over. <br /> <br /> All in all, like a return to the horror movies of the 80s, Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer has a lot of potential but is pointless and moves without conflict or adequate resolution. <br /> <br /> I hope these issues will be addressed before Jack Brooks VII: Jack Goes to Hell or Jack Vs. Ash enter production.
