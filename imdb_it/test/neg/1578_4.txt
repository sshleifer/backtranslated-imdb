After starting to watch filming of old Columbo movies, I thought they would all get the same vote from me (6). But apparently now I'm starting to see the differences in the movies. It happened in some previous episodes, which showed a rather brilliant direction, and manifested itself in this, but in a negative way. <br /> <br /> The film was so boring, that sometimes I found myself taking a peak in the newspaper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo film before!), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to distract the look. The direction seems too pretentious. The scenes with the neighboring girl "oh-so-mature" are a wrong place. And generally the lines and the plot are weaker than the average episode. So the scene in which they discussed whether to fire the trumpet player (who was falsely accused of murder) is pure horror, really stupid. <br /> <br /> Some applause should still be given to the "prelude". In this episode, much importance is given to how the killer tries to protect his alibi and hide the evidence, etc. I really liked it. But alas, we don't focus on how Columbo reveals this. And the "proof" that eventually leaves Columbo victorious is the most foolish ever. <br /> <br /> Evaluation: is between 4 and 5
