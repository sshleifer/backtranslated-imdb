Perhaps, like most of the others who have seen this film long after its premiere on television, I wanted to see many of my favorite actors in old and obscure form, which is exactly what "Slow Burn" is. Except, apart from the nostalgic value, the film itself is not very beautiful. <br /> <br /> Eric Roberts plays the former reporter Jacob Ash, hired by a rich artist Gerald McMurty (Raymond J. Barry), to investigate the whereabouts of his alien son, Brian, who had lived with his mother, Laine (Beverly D'Angelo) in recent years. In a fashion by Phillip Marlowe, Jacob Ash tells what would become more of an investigation into Brian's fate. But, when Jacob tracks down Laine, his findings open up a lot of trouble. Perhaps because the events in the film move too slowly, there is never a lot of suspense for this little thriller, even at the end with the final routine of revealing the culprits and their motivations. <br /> <br /> However, as mentioned before, this film is probably one that will attract attention for its then relatively unknown cast, which includes both a very young Eric Roberts and the adorable Johnny Depp, who plays the stepson by Laine, Donnie. It could be reason enough to prove it ... if you can find it.
