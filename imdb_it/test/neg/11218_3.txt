There are actually some good reasons why a person should take the risk of becoming completely crazy watching this show. The breasts are beautiful, although some are not so real, but they usually come in pairs, which is good. Watching the beach on your screen is also a very relaxing experience, as it is the ideal place to take it easy and not worry too much about being eaten by a rubber shark. It is always good to remember that David Hasselhoff is a god. Not the god, but a god. It's not so much about his acting skills, since there aren't any, but his bib speaks a lot. Also, there are no KITTs in this series, which is good, since Mr. Hasselhoff said in an interview that he always thought KITT was gay. Of course this could make him look like an idiot, but considering the other claims he made lately, it shouldn't surprise anyone. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this is the kind of show, which is totally harmless to people. It gives us a lot to look at and a lot of laughter, which is something that many intentionally humorous shows don't really give us. I have to say, it's no wonder that Borat fell in love with Pamela Anderson. I like watching the show. No, it's not a great show, it's actually pretty horrible, but I like watching it. It's basically like a stretched B movie to last for a decade.
