The one who fights with the monsters could be careful not to become a monster. And if you look long into an abyss, the abyss looks into you. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is Nietzsche's Aphorism 146 of "Beyond Good and Evil". And this is what you find at the beginning of this film. <br /> <br /> If you watch the entire movie, you would doubt it was the message that Ram Gopal Varma Production wanted to convey. While the scenes follow one another at a time, quite violent and sometimes throw up, the viewer should forget Nietzsche's quote and think differently. To deal with a few people you need dedicated people like Sadhu Agashe who will be licensed to kill anyone, not just to write FIRs (something unworthy of the police to do, as we are led to believe). <br /> <br /> When the TADA was repealed and the government wanted to approve newer and even more draconian laws, the RGV Satya performed the necessary brain surgery without blood transfusions for the urban crowd thinking for the growing multiplex whose opinions are important in a democratic country like India. Within a year MCOCA was approved. <br /> <br /> When real life specialist Daya Nayak "became a monster on the path of fighting against them" and was booked by MCOCA, "Aab tak Chhappan" was created to be heard "false impression" "among the people on this. With his "you have to be a monster to save your nation" approach. <br /> <br /> And people consumed it. No questions raised Just praise and hopes that they will get a Sadhu Agashe in their local police station that will solve all the problems and then let only milk and butter flow. Blood? You can ignore it. <br /> <br /> Whenever Israel attacks Palestine or Lebanon, we hear rumors like "India must also attack Pakistan". This film is made for such psychopaths. If you don't give them this, they will probably die from boredom and LSD and for that they don't. <br /> <br /> So this game of the passion of hate.
