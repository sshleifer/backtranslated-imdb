I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty ugly. I'm surprised no one took it seriously. The characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys. The only merit is that he is so lame that it's fun. Actually for me, there is the advantage that was shot in a state park not far from where I live, so seeing a little local stuff on the big screen is a hoot. <br /> <br /> The main character is an off-duty cop, and makes a big point of keeping a good guy vigilant justice is not just a bad idea, it's against the law. Imagine how long it lasts ... <br /> <br /> Most characters in the Northern California movie are dry-blown Hollywood cheese balls, it seems they have never been in a fight. The plot is completely predictable. This film is ripe for a MST-3K raspberry. CAMP value only. I'm rather lenient towards movies in general, but seeing the old positive reviews I had to talk. This is a dog. I give him a 3 out of 10, and then just for the laughs.
