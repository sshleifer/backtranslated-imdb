When this show is aired for the first time, I'll admit I'm intrigued by the premise and the setting. With an open mind I watched the first two episodes and of course I dismissed it as destined to run for half a season at most. I happened to look at A / E recently and saw an ad for this garbage and I could barely contain my surprise. I really hope people look at this for a laugh and don't take it seriously. The characters are really among the most ridiculous and overtly ridiculous on television, scripted or otherwise. Obviously he is generating evaluations, so I have to give credit to the creators to establish and maintain a group of fans, but I seriously hope that nobody is looking at this under any pretense of seriousness.
