In this Silly Symphony, a country mouse visits his cousin in the city. Most of the short are the two mice that explore the table. Animation is fine, where this brief suffers is in the lack of humor. Maybe I just saw this "table adventure" in one of Tom and Jerry's many shorts. Although this came earlier, I didn't find it so pleasant.
