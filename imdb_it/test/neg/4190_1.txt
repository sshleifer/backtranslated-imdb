This film was so bad that I don't know where to start, apparently not even the filmmakers. Start with a boy between thirty-five and forty who watches TV. The news tells of a corn maze open for Halloween. He has a "vision" of God knows what and rushes to save his children who are walking in a maze of the cornfield and are somehow tied to this "vision". How do you ask? I don't know, and as I said before, not even the directors. They are simply visions of people's feet. How did you get these "visions"? It has never been explained, we just have to get along. Enter the maze to find his two daughters who get lost inside, and twice the girls he is looking for walk right next to him, once they really meet him. What does he do? Are you chasing them? No. He stands there like an idiot who calls them when they have just escaped. Do the girls stop? No. They run away and then they ask "Was it Dad?" Then someone dressed as a demon jumps on the "star" (dad's character) beats him in a pathetic struggle only to find out that he is a worker in the haunted maze. The cops are called and after finding the "star" (which is a really bad term to use) they handcuff him. They shake his hands in front of him so he can find something to grab the padlock, which he does. First of all, anyone who has ever been arrested knows that the cops handcuff you your hands behind your back, and secondly why does this "average guy" seem to know how to take the lock on the handcuffs? Well, in the end he manages to escape from the police who give up and leave after the "star's wife" alarms the siren in the police car as a distraction. By the way, now it is night and all the workers who run the maze seem to have moved away once the sun has set. Leaving a man who attacked one of their workers and two missing children in the maze. Considering that it was a slow night that these are their only customers, why not. Except for the cops, apparently, they have better things to do. By the way, the "star" that goes by the name of "Walker", we discover that it is his surname, a name in which his wife even calls him. Somehow he knows that there is something buried in the middle of this maze of cornfields and starts digging. I say "somehow" because I couldn't figure out why he started digging in the first place. Find a medallion, what does it mean? Nothing to anyone who looks at him, but for him it's a kind of evidence of a crime. Someone killed their children in his "vision" and I guess that's what he's doing, real investigative work. And now he knows that there is a free killer in the corn maze, one that somehow knew to be present from the beginning of the film, and that's why he's looking for his girls. Every time we see the killer, or rather the killer's feet, we hear a strange robotic sound, like a science fiction waste toy that turns a person's voice into a mechanical sound. Why do we listen to this sound? Is it somehow connected to ... something? Again, who knows? Certainly not the filmmakers. The peak of all the bad recitations and bad dialogues was when "Walker" shouted "Hey you, Mr. Bad Man ... I'll get you". Another time his wife is attacked by the "Bad Man" at the entrance to the corn maze, which, as I said before, is strangely empty of employees or policemen. The "Bad Man" calls "Walker" on his cell phone to tell him that he plans to kill his wife, his children and him too. "Walker" can only respond with "Hey, HEY!" before dropping the phone and running away. With no one on the other side to talk to, the killer drops his phone too, drags his wife a few paces and then leaves her alone for the rest of the film, losing the first opportunity to remain true to his delicacies. If this script had not been written by a child, I would be surprised. Opps was not. It was written, directed and produced by the same guy. And not only that, he too has done so much of the camera that he works, where we get random shots of feet walking through the muddy maze and the insignificant shots of the cornfield, which waste 90% of the film's time. In the end, "Walker" uses the cuffs to handcuff "Bad Man", which also seems to know how to collect the locks with the same metal object with which "Walker" chose it. Apparently there are many small metal objects that are just hanging around this field of wheat. But after the killer insists he is still going to kill the children "Walker" kills the "Bad Man", and everything is right again in the world. Now actually this makes "Walker" a murderer, he killed a man who "Presumably" killed his daughters and was trying to kill him. He knows, not because of evidence, but because of his visions. He never found a corpse, no one else knows that this guy was even in the maze. And the medallion? He returns it to the ghosts of the two dead girls. No proof. So he kills a man for no tangible reason. I can't imagine what the filmmakers were thinking. It must have been a way to cover up a misappropriation of funds for the production company. I prefer to watch the Blair Witch Project five times rather than see this movie again. Actors should be ashamed. Even the director / producer / writer / cameraman should be ashamed. In fact, the entire production company should be ashamed. If anyone is associated with this movie, please reply. What were you thinking?
