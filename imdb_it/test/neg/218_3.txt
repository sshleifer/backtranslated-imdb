Incredibly disappointed. The pace was slow. The characters are amazing and I feel bored and dissatisfied throughout the film as a whole. There wasn't a real plot that could get you around the movie and it would keep you interested. The robbery itself never offered emotions and doesn't look very good through. <br /> <br /> There was not enough depth or background for any character and the Laurance Fishbourne character was what I was looking forward to, unfortunately Laurance has no idea how to play brut brutal and is very much preferred as a likeable character. Columbus, one of my favorite actors (in trampling the courtyard) disappointed me with his performance, his character was dark and could hardly see what pushed his reasoning. <br /> <br /> The only character that I think has offered anything to the film was Milo Ventimiglia (Peter Petrelli in Heroes). Although his character is rather small and insignificant, I think his touch has been added to a film that is anything but boring. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, buy the DVD if you want to find a new way to waste your time.
