Wow. As soon as I saw the cover of this movie, I immediately wanted to watch it because it looked so bad. Sometimes I watch Bollywood films just because they are so bad that it will be fun (eg Koi Mil Gaya). This film had all the elements of an atrocious film: a completely harmless "band of local thugs", a badly made motorcycle scene, a horrible dialect ("Congratulations son, I'm very proud you're a bad boy"), actors playing basketball as if they were good, atrocious songs ("Me bad, me bad, me bad bad boy"), inexplicable plot lines like why friends Good Boy and Bad Boy ??? And why is the sexy girl in love with the nerd ?? I've never seen such a badly constructed story with such a horrible story. Some scenes actually lasted 30 seconds like the one in which the Good and Bad Boys inexplicably overcame the "gang member" game. Congratulations Ashwini Chaudry, you are a bad director. If you want to see a good movie, look at Guru, if you want to see a movie so bad that it's actually funny, then look at Good Boy, Boy.
