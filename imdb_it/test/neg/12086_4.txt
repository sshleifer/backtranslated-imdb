Despite the strong interpretations of Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson, this film fails to ignite the viewer's imagination. <br /> <br /> By the way, what happened to Mrs Driver? He had such great potential in the film industry. <br /> <br /> For me this was almost like a 1950s version of Yentl without the musical fanfare. With the death of his father, Driver takes a position as ruler of a Christian family, hiding his Jewish identity. <br /> <br /> While I realize that this is a period of peace, it was terribly boring even in the 1850s in England and Scotland. <br /> <br /> The landlady is very irritating with her singing voice. I expected him to refer to Driver as expensive at all times. What kind of name is Mary Blackchurch? I know that Driver is trying to pass himself off as a Christian, but does this name mean everything? <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Mary finds love with the young manager's father (Wilkinson) and her emotional emotional imbalance. <br /> <br /> In the end, the only thing we see done is that Mary has found a profession to provide for her family photography. Did we really have to be subjected to what was happening in the movie? <br /> <br /> The first scenes of Judaism were practiced in 19th-century England and the cholera epidemic could eventually have been reproduced more. There is a definite feeling of anti-Semitism on the part of the Wilkinson family, but this is never allowed to come out.
