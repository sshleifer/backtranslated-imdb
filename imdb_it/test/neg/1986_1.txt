This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> The problem is that he doesn't know if he wants to be an intelligent political film, "artistic" or an exercise is eroticism. As a result it fails on all accounts. <br /> <br /> The acting is atrocious, the off-put narrative and the alleged useless symbolism. <br /> <br /> Klaus Kinski is probably the best thing about this movie but it's not a good thing. Of course, it looks intense and "unique" but in the end it can't really act. Just see how he reacts when his mistress leaves .... <br /> <br /> Really not watching this movie, some say he needs repeated visions, I say one is too many.
