I've been watching this movie a while ago and the only thing I remember about the movie is how incredibly awfully great it was for sure in my 5 worst movies I've ever seen. And to think that I had to convince my friends to get this movie at the video store, my reputation was turned to pieces because of this film, do my friends trust me again? I doubt it, they always say not to judge anything by its cover, they were right when I saw the cover of the skins / boys of the band I thought this sounds fantastic since it had a load of leather heads on the front cover that moved with the bars metallic. Don't watch this movie. I can't think of anything but saying that acting is bad, the story is bad, it's just bad.
