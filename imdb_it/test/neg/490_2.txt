First of all, the genre of this film is not comedy, it's more of a drama. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations on the film, yet they didn't find it. As some of the other reviews point out, there is nice music in the film. But if you want to listen to good music I suggest you spend time watching some recordings of a concert with Bon Jovi, or MÃ¶tley Crue, it will be more quality time. <br /> <br /> Last, if you want to watch a good movie in this rock'n'roll genre, I recommend "Almost Famous".
