I like J-horror, anime and even the fast of the pink movement, of which some have claimed a member, but this did nothing for me. I intend to go a step further and label this one of the greatest deliberations of my film career. <br /> <br /> Three young rockabilly boys go around getting their bones to rape girls. One of the members of the group begins to develop an agreement on the time elapsed when the younger sister surprises them red-handed. Invariably, the group turns on itself as friends once start to fight each other. It concludes with a negative note that fits the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Besides watching friends scream at each other, which they do a lot, there's not much to do here. The film is littered with long continuous shots that do nothing but exacerbate the problem. Moreover, even when the film begins to do something interesting, it suddenly gets bogged down in an ethereal philosophy that never makes sense. For example, after one of his friends has changed his mind about the girls attacking him, he leaves and does it again, but then interrupts his companions from their turn. Eh? Cinematography is slow and lighting is poor. Writing is OK, as is acting, which makes this cinematic effort sub-par from the beginning. Blend the lack of technical skill with fragile content and you have nothing but a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Oh, and another note, at least one of the girls that appears in the buff doesn't look old enough to do that sort of thing. <br /> <br /> 3/10
