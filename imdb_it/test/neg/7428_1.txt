I took this thing from the sci-fi shelf because I remembered seeing the first series when I was a kid. I had rented the second one and it was a decent "B" sci-fi. This was just hateful outside. The "special" effects on cars seemed like something my 4-year-old cousin could have done. The two female cyborg assistants were so terrible that I literally got scared every time they came on the screen. The plot left so much to be desired that it made me sick. I don't know what others thought when they agreed to be part of this film, but I'm sure they would have had better leave it in 2 movies. The films of this series range from good to decent to terrible. I only hope that no terrorist group has access to this film as it makes an excellent instrument of torture.
