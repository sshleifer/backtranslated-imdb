This film was made of cheese and was more than that. It was about this boy who gets cursed and turns into a gorilla. I had to see how bad it was because of the title. Before this boy turns into a gorilla, he gets married. I was a little upset because he was not a gorilla bride: now she is the gorilla's wife. He should have married him when he was a gorilla, so the title would have made more sense. There are also all these people in the middle of the jungle and everyone wants to leave. This is not just a B movie, it's more like a Z movie. I haven't even seen a banana for a wedding present. Oh, he just wasn't damned yet.
