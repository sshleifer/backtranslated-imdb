This is a textbook example of how Hollywood did not (not) trust viewers, and cheers for its big name stars. Christian's character is completely rewritten, the anti-Semitism that Noah faces from his own army unit is practically eliminated, Michael's story has changed significantly, and the end result is to decimate the power and terrible beauty of the book. I would almost like not having even seen it, due to the ability of movies (sounds and images) to resonate so powerfully in your brain; I would have preferred to remain alone with the impression of the book. The book could have been written today, it is so honest and brave. The movie, either. My advice: SKIP the movie; Read the book.
