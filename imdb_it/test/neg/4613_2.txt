Following the classic 70's horror film, Carrie with this offer, it's like the Ford that follows the Mustang with Edsel. This film has been hideous in every detail. It would have been called Beverly Hill 90210 and the Mystery Science Theater 3000, but both shows far outweigh this tripe. This film was not a horror movie. I clocked about 3 minutes of cold blood and 90 minutes of gypsies and high school rituals. Wow, what a surprise, Carrie's bizarre friend commits suicide! Wow, Carrie misunderstands her affections with love interests! Wow, the crowd gathers Carrie! Wow, athletes have a sexual scoring contest! What this film needed was a lot more action and much less tired teenage clich√©s. This film is totally irrelevant.
