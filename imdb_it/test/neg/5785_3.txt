Note to self. Never look at a serious movie with Charlie Sheen again. Great comedian, horrible seal. This film makes the Navy SEALS appear like a reckless ranger group when in fact they are the most military elite form in the world. Charlie Sheen helps destroy the reputation of the Navy SEALs. Thank you for making such an incredibly selected group of people look horrible in one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. This is a great story that could be turned into a fantastic action movie, but why Charlie Sheen? There are possibilities for a very passionate story here, but Sheen decides to destroy them with "funny" comments.
