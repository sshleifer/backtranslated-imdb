Although produced for television, Dying to Love You exudes with low-level melodramatic splendor. <br /> <br /> The film opens to Roger Paulson (Tim Matheson, he looks much older than I remember being), who is a struggling businessman who leads an empty and lonely life after his wife Ruthie (who looks as suspicious as Roseanne Arnold) leaves him with readiness. Now Roger has all his cats ... and his newspaper ad. <br /> <br /> Once your ad is answered, call Johnnie-Elaine-Lisa-oh it doesn't matter who I want you to be-Lawrence. Then ... they have sex on the phone. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure where you're from or when you were born, but I remember that some phone sex was played in the late 1980s. I'm sorry, but it was bad. <br /> <br /> Soon Roger and the general public have fun and have a whirlwind romance. They fall in love, visit the zoo to see the gorillas and then have sex with Roger's son in the other room. She binds him to the bed and seduces him. <br /> <br /> Roger is so stupid that he doesn't realize that Johnnie-Eliane is just a little girl who loves to sleep. God forbid that women sleep only with a man. Soon, strange phone calls start to happen, Johnny Girl wants Roger to marry her with absolute speed, and continues to bawl and talk about her ex-husband who used to beat her. It's fun to see Roger believe him through all these things. That is until a surly colleague tells him to go and browse his stuff like a nosy housewife. He takes his shitty advice and here, find a suitcase that crawls with fake ID cards and wigs and guns and a crossbow. He immediately takes the suitcase to the police and has her arrested. Although all this jazz, he still loves the broad silent. He tells so many lies, it seems that his tongue will catch fire if she tells the truth once. <br /> <br /> Roger continues his life and meets an ugly woman named Angela who looks like something from Gremlins 2. She also has a son and Roger likes her a lot. But something in Roger's subconscious keeps him connected to Lisa Rohn (if he is also his real name) and keeps coming back to see her. <br /> <br /> Now Lisa is the ex who will not go away as she "earns" an exemption card from prison and shows up at Roger's house door and her son Matt is so busy trying to control her , pour the juice on the floor. IL Rog is so stupid, pulls out Lisa and doesn't even change the locks. Boy, if all the people were so stupid, I wouldn't even write this review. The ending of this film is so unbearable, you won't believe it. <br /> <br /> Tim Matheson is a king of films made for TV. it looks like a dawm mummy in this movie. It is a bit of wood and stiff. The dazzling Tracy Pollan works well with her role and her recklessness sounds real. She is extremely beautiful and I see what Michael J. Fox sees in her. <br /> <br /> This movie is nice to watch when you're on a suggestion late at night, but then again, you might fall asleep, considering how boring and bland it is.
