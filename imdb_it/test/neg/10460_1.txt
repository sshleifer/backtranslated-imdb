While trying to build a large mall or complex or something like that, a wealthy landowner ignores the ancient Native American artifacts buried on the earth and unleashes the bone-eater ... a creature that goes around and kills people in search of his fallen friends or something. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film was to be a Sci-Fi Channel original. If it were not, then the director should never again direct it. The effects in the film are at best laughable, and the Bone Eater monster is nothing but a CGI animated character that is added to the frames later. Actors don't seem too scared when they see it (probably because they really don't, and they're just terrible actors). It's a great comedy, although it should be pure horror.
