This overheated southern gothic "mellerdramer" has a few decent moments, but it is too often spoiled by a novice director who piles up a cliché on the cliché, and a star who apparently decided to take it out on himself to turn the photo into his own showcase , rather than allowing the writer / director Gabel to update Inge or Williams as a sort of contemporary "Midnight Cowboy" meets the tear of "Lolita". <br /> <br /> Close your eyes, listen to the exaggerated accents of the south and try to decide if they are witnesses of a feature film or an acting - full of amateur enthusiasts. <br /> <br /> Johansson is for once tolerable (that is, less pompous than usual) - although not at all good, Macht is decent, even if a little too cute to believe, and Travolta chews the scenery like never before from now (with the help of a decent editor and some directorial restraint, his performance could be really touching, as it is, he - and almost all the others - is too unlikely to ever take us beyond the point of boredom or repulsion). Kara Unger is perhaps the best of all; if her role had been developed over a few lines, she might even have been a nomination for Best Supporting Actress. <br /> <br /> Pic is almost saved by Leonard Cohen's snarling theme, decent design and production locations, and continuous reference to literary works (which received reviews of otherwise standard screenplays like "poetic"). some old cast professionals like Sonny Shroyer, and perhaps above all, Soderbergh's cameraman Elliot Davis - whose good work will undoubtedly be credited to the debut director, who in ten or twenty years could actually learn how to direct - are helpful. <br /> <br /> But probably not.
