Stanley Stupid (Tom Arnold) and his wife, Joan, love to sleep in bed with their heads under the covers and their feet on the pillows. They have two equally challenged children, Buster and Petunia. One day, Mr. Stupid notices that their trash has disappeared again ... there must be someone stealing it from the sidewalk. He walks off with the brushes after the garbage truck. When he finally arrives at the dump, he is surprised to learn not only that "other people's wastes" have also been stolen, but that there is a meeting of a secret organization in a landfill. He is determined to defeat the garbage nests of the world, apparently. Meanwhile, Petunia and Buster visit the police station and a Chinese restaurant in search of their parents, because Joan is also missing. Will they make their way through their problems? This is just a stupid and stupid movie, since the culprit is the terrible script. Allard and Marshall's books are hysterical and only a couple of book situations end up in this film. Arnold is actually quite nice, as Mr. Stupid and the other cast members work very hard to make the film work. The production values ​​are very high, with the dog and the cat belonging to the Stupid that add some grit to the film. But it is all useless, since the plot is wandering and weak. Perhaps one day someone will take another stab at translating Allard's fantastic books to the big screen. So, if you like to laugh, rent something else while you wait for a new production and, by all means, go get the books too. But stay away from being stupid alone, since anyone watching this movie to the end could not be called intelligent.
