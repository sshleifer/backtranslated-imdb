Let me tell you that you know a movie is badly managed when extras make the cover. That said, anyone who claims this is the worst film ever is dramatic, and anyone who claims that the film is fantastic is completely illusory. The film "is what it is". And what is ... A modest budget budget ($ 4 million, I stimulate) in the studio. The film is not terrible, but for Road House fans it will be a disappointment. And that brings me to the problem, just as Dirty Dancing wouldn't have been what Swayze was without, Road House is not the same without him. The protagonist lacks depth, character and sympathy to bring the film. I feel that the main role has been discarded and that the producers should have leaned back to convince Patrick to do so if they were going to make a sequel. The other cast was uneven with exceptional actors like Will Patton in side day players who couldn't play in a paper bag. Busey, who saw fantastic characters, looked as if he had just written it. Ellen was played well, except for not being credible as a raised chick. Sherri, the DEA agent at the first bar was sexy and a good actress, but her part was awkwardly small and undeveloped. The writer has totally lost all opportunities to add depth and interest to the story and the characters. Instead opting for a basic one-dimensional film. Which brings me to the biggest problem, the script ... I had a bad feeling when the credits were shot and there were three writers separated by an "e" and a "&". He seemed very amateur. And this is what the writing was. I felt that the original script was better and then a rewrite was made and the awakening started. Some cheeky parts of the movie to watch are ... During the first undercover encounter, the obvious drug deal under the table. "Hey, I'll meet you in a bar crowded with nudists, I'll pull a coke block out of my jacket and take out the cash, then we'll slide them under the cocktail table" WAIT! "Make sure you look cool when you look to the right and left to make sure no one is watching!" Second, I like it when someone gets hit in the chest and then you see him sitting happily like a lark 10 minutes later. There are some ugly assembly cuts towards the end of the film, especially during the fight scenes and when the main character is chasing the doors and running into a client. Which brings me to the realism of DEA training, I won't have to do both ... But jumping through doors is not a standard workout ... Nor the typical female agents, who break their asses to do it in a male field oriented, act like weak characters ... boring! Thank you for the chauvinist vision of the heir. There are other things I could teach in a course at school ... Accelerated combat, brash dialogue, recycled history ... etc ... But apart from all that you just can't love, Mr. Applegate, the totally lacking the humble zen freshness that made Mr. Patrick Swayze such a bad ass. It only strikes me as one of those 5-foot actors who think they are a bad ass, but just like Van Damnit he comes across a real ass (Chuck Zito in Van Do not case) and gives him a lesson on "Badassdom". So, what I feel is the main focus of the movie, if you're a bad ass you're a bad ass, you don't have to try. Example: Swayze! If you are a nice guy who tries to prove that you are a bad ass among other things ... Well then ... You are the reason why your audience, the average Joe ... He will not rent this movie, and if they do will write reviews like this.
