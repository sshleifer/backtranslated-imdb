ASTROESQUE (2 outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> I have no idea what the supposed title is ... and still less an idea of ​​what is supposed to be happening in this film half the time ... yet, kept me a little interested. These are low-cost and low-budget films, along the lines of "El Mariachi", shot in 16mm ... and, for what it's worth, the shots are very well composed and visually elegant. Directed, written and played by comic book writer / writer Michael Allred ... I guess it's no surprise that the film looks good. Unfortunately, some of the recitations go beyond evil ... and the rest is competent at best. Allred himself is the best ... but only because he doesn't really talk much. He simply moves around most of the time ... or fleeing crazy crowds who are trying to kill him. The sound is also pretty ugly ... almost as if it were unfinished in some places ... maybe they couldn't afford to pay for the music they planned to use? A strange, vaguely sci-fi plot ... similar in tone to "The Man Who Fell to Earth" ... but most of the film is reduced to a standard run-from-the-bad-guys and kill-them- before -the plot of you-kill-yourself. After all, too oblique to succeed but not without interest for adventurous movie watchers.
