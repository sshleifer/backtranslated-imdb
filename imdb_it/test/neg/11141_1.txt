This is absolutely drivel, designed to shock and titillate the 60s mentality.

The only exception is the main character "Joe" (played by Joe Dallesandro) who spends most of the film in a naked stupor (or stoned, or the only one in the piece that can act!) Please don't think I didn't "understand "Warhol - this is clearly and simply a Stinker who should never be out of a movie class.
