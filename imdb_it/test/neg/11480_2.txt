This should be renamed "Everybody Loves Sebastian". The junior high school students (or senior?) Of the rural campaign of 1983 seemed to capsize on the one with the strange hair and the "Leo-like" good looks has a big plate full of problems. His stepfather announces final plans for a sex change operation, on which his mother calls marriage; Sebastian is called the word "f" by everyone and their mother, who "all around" kisses around with the girls, stands up in "Ready-Whip" in a supermarket and saves a "strawberry" prostitute from the clutches of his ruthless pimp. <br /> <br /> "friends" of Sebastian make Eddie Haskal look like a choir boy; bad association does not get much worse. Sebastian seems to go for the record of "Harold's" suicide attempts (although he won't admit suicidal tendencies). For no apparent reason the genius level that got the SAT score, Sebastian MUST graduate a year earlier, even if he has no idea of ​​the future, nor does he want to attend college (what does he give with this nonsense?). <br /> <br /> This film is a look in a few weeks into the life of someone who is ENOUGH. The final scene suggests that things will go well, even if the HOW is left entirely to the viewer. <br /> <br /> The creators of this film seem to take only the undisputed appeal of the very attractive male leader. "History" leaves a lot to be desired. Looking for "what will this beautiful guy do next ...?" does not satisfy exactly. The lackluster production values ​​do not match other films, independent or not. A low budget and a weak story require more than a pretty face to carry it forward. The "results" of this project are forgettable and an insult to fans of smart cinema.
