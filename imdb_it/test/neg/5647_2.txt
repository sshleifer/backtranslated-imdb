A rather horrible film, I am amazed how Derek Jacobi and Vanessa Redgrave agreed to be part of it, it's like a prolonged episode of a series of television detectives. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw must be Vinnie Jones, he simply can't act, anyone who has had the brilliant idea to cast him as a leader wants his head to be examined unless he puts his money into the project ? He should just play hooligans, appearing threatening and NOT talking! <br /> <br /> Even central heating was around the time of Dickens because there were three large radiators behind his desk ?? <br /> <br /> It's no wonder they gave it away for free with a newspaper like no one would have paid to see it.
