I had a bit of hope for this one-hour movie made up of old Poverty Row movies. It certainly had the chance to look more like a mass of home video marketed in the world. Unfortunately, while it is fun, this film still looks like a movie of origin, but with archive material inserted. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns the planned reading of a will on a transatlantic at midnight somewhere in the tropics. The ship sinks and well ... this is the film. <br /> <br /> The film promises to Karloff, Lugosi, Chaney and others to be removed from the old films to interact with the new footage. We got it right, but mostly we get a lot of new video footage made to look like a scratchy black and white movie, in which new actors jump up. The old movies are inter-cut mostly to set the scene, but very little of the old and new actually coincides, so it's clearly just a mass. It's not very convincing and it's very disappointing for someone like me looking for a better built movie. <br /> <br /> Still, if you know and love the old Poverty Row movies, (it's very spoofy), this might be worth viewing. I would warn against buying this, but you can have for about five dollars, the price of a rental), so the choice is yours (even if you can get away without paying to do it). <br /> <br /> Disappointing.
