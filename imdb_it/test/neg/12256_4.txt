PREY <br /> <br /> Format: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: Mono <br /> <br /> A lesbian couple (Sally Faulkner and Glory Annan) who lives in a remote country the house is dismantled by the arrival of a young man (Barry Stokes) who turns out to be a carnivorous foreigner, the vanguard of a massive invasion ... <br /> <br /> Despite his low budget and his thoughtful rhythm , The sequel of Norman J. Warren to SATAN'S SLAVE (1976) amounts to much more than the sum of his scarce parts, thanks to a surprisingly complex script by Max Cuff (apparently, his only written credit): Faulkner and Annan indulge an obsessive relationship while we lived in an isolated splendor in the English countryside (alternately made beautiful and disturbing by the captivating cinematography of Derek V. Browne), although Annan's discovery of blood-stained clothes in an upstairs room indicates one (or both) of these eyes with jaws lovelie psicologicamen you are disturbed, which may explain the absence of their respective families, some of whom seem to have lived at home at one time or another and 'left' in mysterious circumstances. Stokes' unexpected arrival throws the relationship into disorder, partly because Faulkner has a pathological hatred for men and partly because Annan is attracted to him, creating tensions that result in a vortex of violence. There is an extraordinary multi-layered sequence in which Faulkner tries to "mask" their clandestine guest by dressing them in feminine clothes, although Stokes' alien mentality allows him to overcome the mocking intention. <br /> <br /> the first scenes, at least, the relationship between Faulkner and Annan is depicted with uncommon grace and dignity, but this sincere sapphic relationship quickly turns into pleasant episodes of sex and pulchritude, culminating in a explosion of horror when Annan is robbed of Stokes following a violent discussion with Faulkner. The closing sequences are (literally) heartbreaking, especially the final scene of Annan, which seems to have been cut for censorship reasons in 1977 and never completely restored (what remains is still vivid, so be prepared!). Excellent performances by the three protagonists, strengthened by the discreet direction of Warren, who fully exploits the splendid wooded towns, thus compensating for the film's budget shortcomings. Originally released in the United States as ALIEN PREY.
