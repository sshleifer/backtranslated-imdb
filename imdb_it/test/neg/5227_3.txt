I'm a fan of Ed Harris's work and I had high expectations on this film. Having such good actors as Harris and Von Sydow is always a great advantage for a director, but if the script is bad what can you do? I really think that Needful Things is the worst film in Harris's filmography and that being involved was a huge mistake. Anyway, I've seen much worse movies in my life, but Needful Things was a disappointment because of the waste of acting talent. The whole story seems too incredible and fake. I don't know if this is due to the book, because I haven't read it. But if the script was so bad, I can't see the reason to film it. Perhaps it was the commercial success of King's books, or the need for low quality films for the VHS era of the 1990s. Whatever the reason, though, this film was a bad choice for anyone involved.
