A man (Goffredo Unger) is found floating in the sea among the wreckage of his wrecked boat, just off the coast of Florida. A helicopter raises it only to reveal that both legs are missing under the knees. Dr. Stella Dickens (Valentine Monnier) and her partner Dr. Bob Hogan (Lawrence Morgant) are marine biologists of some kind and are conducting sea research on dolphins. While at sea, Hogan hears a strange high-pitched noise. Intrigued, he and Stella hire Peter (Michael Sopkiw) and his assistant Sandra (Iris Peynado) to create a device to locate and trace the source, or something like that anyway, since it's not made particularly clear. Meanwhile, a scientist named Florinda (Cinzia De Ponti in the role of Cinthia Stewart) who works in a rival organization called "West Ocean International" is brutally murdered when she threatens to expose someone within the organization. More people are being attacked and Sheriff Gordon (Gianni Garko as John Garko) is on the case. Peter, Stella, Hogan and Sandra all leave for the sea. They soon find evidence that something monstrous and very hostile could be lurking beneath the surface. Together with the rival scientist, Professor Donald West (William Berger), Sheriff Gordon and the US Army, they decided to destroy the monster, but there are other sinister forces at work while someone does not want the genetically modified creature to be exposed cost! Directed by Lamberto Bava as John Old Jr., this is very different from the classic Italian horror and splatter films of the 70s and early 80s. The screenplay by Gianfranco Clerici, Herve Piccini and Dardando Sacchetti is very slow and will put most people to sleep well before the odd 90 minutes have elapsed. The monster is barely used, large parts of this film consist of shots of boats and helicopters. Big pieces of the first half focus on the non-mysterious part of "who's behind" the story. There's really nothing to talk about, a guy with both legs bitten and someone with one arm is about it. The special effects on the monster itself are generally scarce and are shown in very fast, disappointing flashes. The virtual cast of no one doesn't help make it easier to sit. There's really not much to recommend this movie, so I won't. Don't worry, you can do much better.
