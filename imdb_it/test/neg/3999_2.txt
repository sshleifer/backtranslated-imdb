Tom Russo (Happiness of asbestos) emotionally insecure reads the secret diary of his sexy wife Leeza (Courtney Lercara) and is dismayed to discover that the love of his life seems to have slept with every boy he meets; this shocking revelation sends poor Tom away from his rocking chair, and proceeds to revenge bloodily on the men he thinks his old lady is rogating. <br /> <br /> In my experience, really bad movies can often be as much fun as good ones, and no ceiling fan-machined movie with machete should ever be considered completely worthless; but even though Killing Spree occasionally manages to entertain with his inventiveness and his cheap and cheerful gore, I found that the terrible direction, the terrible values ​​of production, the bad cinematography, the muffled sound, the terrible illumination, the murky mind and boring narrative (which really includes twist of the stupid plot that is wired from the beginning, in addition to a useless zombie end), bad score for the synthesizer, senseless dialogues and completely amateur acting, all served to make this effort of the writer / director Tom Ritter a virtually joyless experience.
