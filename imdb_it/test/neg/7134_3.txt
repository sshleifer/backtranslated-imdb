I liked the first The Grudge. He really scared me and he had something that made me want to see him twice. That something missing from this sequel. There was no creativity, nothing new or original, nothing that really remained in your mind. People die because a scary ghost comes out of the shadows and says whistles. And most of the time, it wasn't even that scary. <br /> <br /> This film is a dead end. Amber Tamblyn is a good actress, but she was given nothing to do, and Karen's death seemed really unsatisfactory because she came so quickly. I was also disappointed by the subplot of Kayako's mother. I was thinking that it could provide a way to fight Rancore, but it dies in the hands - hair? - of Kayako. It was such a stupid blow. All in all, it's difficult to feel feelings for characters that you know from the first moment that they will die. All the same way. And there's nothing they can do. It does not seem a cruel fate awaiting them. It's just boring, because you know what's going to happen. If they had something to fight it, it would have added suspense, even if they failed. If there were any hope, it would have made the fears more justified. Now you're just waiting for them to die. <br /> <br /> Kayako was really scary in the first movie, but this time we saw it too many times and it took a while. I was still scared during some scenes, but actually I got used to the huge eye and the blue face. The producers obviously understood that this would happen while adding more scary ghosts. Yes, I was afraid of the school psychologist scene - even if I knew where she would go as soon as she said "I was home". A nice touch. Toshio, however, was not at all scary in this film. I was much more scared of the non-blue Toshio with black eyes and an empty look that sometimes appeared in the first movie. A blue boy sitting in the corner does nothing for me. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters seemed really superfluous - the infamous milk scene with the girl I can't remember the name I don't remember. I wasn't afraid, it was just "Huh?" I'm not sure that the students were really necessary. Karen could have borne resentment in the United States with her. He could have killed people related to his life, everyone at the funeral or something. Even so, it would have been boring to see them all die, but being introduced to so many unrelated people was really annoying. Hated the scene "I will not call you mother". Aubrey's mother's problems were equally boring. The boy was a moving character, though. The sequel to Ju-On was much scarier than this. He had some new twists and turns - dreams and reality that become much more blurred, for example - and even though he left me quite down, I was also somewhat satisfied. I have to think a little and leave me speechless. This film provided only economic scares.
