This strangeness contains touches similar to those of Bunuel, but does not support one's own interest. At 10 he wanders through a bizarre America in a stolen Mustang, while the usual suspects in the cult film (Dick Miller, Mary Woronov, Susie Tyrell) commit evil deeds in the name of the play. Like his AFTER HOURS and VAMPIRE'S KISS, the screenwriter delights in making you wiggle. I was unaffected, due to general acting. You know you're in it when Meat Loaf and Flea are the most attractive. (And what did this child's screen test look like? Is unbearable.) Recommended for a dozen SONNY BOY fans ('87).
