A group of spelunkers with a sad story takes an author on a "hairy" adventure through an unexplored cave in Kazakhstan. In these times of remakes and sequels and film companies seeking to cash in on any winning combination of cinematic components, The Cavern has only a relatively different twist in the previous eight cave films in recent years, and that turn seems to have been taken by an File. I like to give each film the benefit of the doubt, but here there were too many small annoyances. Working with the camera can give you a headache because they seem to constantly confuse the way it is. Not being a speleologist, I don't really care if the shots were realistic. There is too much PANNICK too useless by supposedly expert spelunkers, from the last half are you saying one of two things out loud ?? oh, shut up and concentrate on saving yourself, or I hope you'll all die eventually. It must have been very tiring for these decent actors to make this film. A moderate amount of blood and nothing special in the dialog box or characters. While you're pretty sure you know what's going on at the end, the last five minutes explain all the details. But I would have had a better opinion of the movie if they had left the last minute on the floor of the editing room. It simply wasn't necessary. I suggest you hit the deportation immediately after your suspicions have been confirmed and save yourself the setup for the sequel. I have long thought that the film industry should share a modified restaurant cash scheme. You pay for the materials to make the film before entering, but the film's profits come from the advice you give when you leave the cinema. I can't blame what I don't like about this film about its low budget.
