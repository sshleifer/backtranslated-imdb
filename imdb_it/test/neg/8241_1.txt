Sorry I could not disagree with the latest comments. frankly I thought it was worse than Carry on Columbus, said enough. The last film by Charles Hartrey, usually brilliant, which seemed out of place when the humor had shifted to the high level of buses, whose films were being made at the same time, was frankly more fun. Barbara Windsor was embarrassing, a character like one of your mommy friends in love who still thinks she is eighteen, on vacation with some non-Scottish entity, Rab c Nesbit is not. The series miraculously went around with duffers like Carry on Behind and Carry on England. Carrying on Dick was not bad, but in reality with this film the end of the series was near, too bad because until this film I can't think of a bad movie before this?
