I don't know what the Chasidik movement about this movie is about? I saw this movie a year ago. Am I an Orthodox woman, living in an Orthodox Chasidic? community And I can tell you that I was offended by this movie! It's so far from reality, it's scary! The director could at least hire a Rabbi Chasidik for a brief consultation, before making a "Realistic" film about the ultra-Orthodox! For example Meir's Davening (Morning Prayers)! Or a Jewish wedding or a Mikveh bathing suit. <br /> <br /> The film is full of technical inaccuracies ... but they didn't bother me. It is the spiritual side. The Orthodox are portrayed next to the Taliban. The woman is powerless, while men are the supreme rulers! Please! No one can force a Jewish girl at the Chuppa against her will! We Orthodox also live according to the law (Halacha) which clearly indicates the responsibilities of man towards his wife. No beat and no rape, and no man (not even the rabbi) can reach the woman in the Mikveh. And Balanit is not putting a hand on the woman's head, while she is taking a ritual bath, the idea is to immerse her whole body at once! The director was clearly trying to hit the ultra orthodox! But could he do it at least in a nice and more polite way? <br /> <br /> Love story? Nice ! But not credible. The diaries are long and boring. The finish was totally sucked. For all that drama, at least I was hoping for a good ending, for all I sat I felt I deserved it! Obviously someone was trying to make a nice relaxing movie for the less observant Jews, or for the non-Jews, maybe ... (look at those fundamentalists, they are so bad and bad ...) and they succeed! To make it short: I was hoping for a nice Europien film (Kane level), but instead I got a lousy, unrealistic tradition that wrongly spoiled the guide. I mean, today we live in an era of free will like never before. Everyone has the right to choose. Malka chose a rock singer. Rivka made her choice. Miair did his. Many people from non-observer backgrounds are choosing Orthodox Judaism today. Because in this crazy world religion could be a beautiful front door!
