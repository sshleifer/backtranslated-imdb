This fantasy was garbage. I thought Michael Moore had his back to the market on ridiculous anti-government films, but this was much worse than anything he'd ever done. It is no wonder that critics of the British media complain that they are guided by tabloid journalism. This film is the greatest fantasy of a madman on the left who comes to life on the big screen. Anyone who is even slightly to the right of these rabid Bush balls should be shocked that he has ever been funded. I am sure that it will also be good in Syria, Iran, Pakistan and North Korea. It is hard to believe that in these days of crazy Muslims who blow up innocent commuters there is someone in the UK who thinks that Britain should surrender in the war on terror. I guess it's no longer the country that I admired to be alone against the Nazis almost 70 years ago. Everyone greets Neville Chamberlain and the pathetic pacification policy!
