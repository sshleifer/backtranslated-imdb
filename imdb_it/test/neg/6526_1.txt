OK, first there could be a SPOILER because I don't know what constitutes giving too much information. My theme line says it all but surely people will want to know WHY it's so stupid. <br /> <br /> First of all, this film follows a group of Yuppies as they go to a sports game in Chicago but end up taking the wrong exit and winding up in the ghetto. Scary, eh? Well, first of all, Emilio is driving everyone in the most exaggerated RV / Winnebago in the world, tricked with satellite dishes and crap like the one above. So these guys are going to a sports game (I don't remember which ones, though probably the Bulls or the White Sox since they are so scary near the ghetto), yet they can't even get off the highway without having a command center of onboard vision that would shame ESPN. Yet they are smart enough to make a living that they would pay for the stuff, but such are sports fans who don't even know which way to go down to go to the game they love so much. <br /> <br /> I gave up the movie within half an hour, but the reasons were plentiful. They are found in the GHETTO, but their main danger to their existence is DENIS LEARY. A WHITE GUY. I'm not a racist, but COME. In anything that RESEMBLING reality - and this movie was trying to be an urban nightmare - Denis Leary would not be trying to kill Emilio Estevez, he would do a tour to get Dodge's cock himself !!! <br /> <br /> This is easily one of the most stupid films ever created, although I am not familiar with much of the rest of world cinema. If MST3K were still active, surely they would have dedicated an episode to this.
