Congo is another multi-million dollar adaptation of Crichton's works. Like Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Sphere, etc., the film has raped the book of its true meaning and essence. I'll do this short and to the point. The scenery is beautiful. Actors, well, it's the best they can do. The script? Try to congest hundreds of pages in an hour and a half movie. In the end you have a mess, but how good it is to make a mess is what matters and Congo falls somewhere below that. There were some stupid moments, like why did the gorillas assassins decide to jump into the lava? And Amy, raised by humans, surrounded by humans, can still intimidate dozens of monkey killers around her? What kind of savvy is this? Which brings me to this. If there was one annoying character in each film, Amy was one of the two. See Amy is this naive little female monkey who can talk with a special backpack and the harness tied to her. A nice idea, but it becomes annoying after a while to hear her talk. The Congo deserves to be seen, and not regrettable, but certainly not even a memorable film.
