I saw the Halloween episode ... oh my god, I wanted to die. The acting was simply horrible. The lines were uttered without any conviction. It's a bad idea for a show, I mean, who would watch a web show like that in real life? Miranda Cosgrove has been great in a supporting role in Drake and Josh but does not have the strength of character to anchor her show. I'm even more angry because his departure is one of the main reasons why Drake and Josh are finished. She was approached with her show ... she made a ship jump on Drake and Josh. They then decided that maybe they would do something with Drake and Josh that they would move to college, thus explaining the loss of Meagan as a character but Drake had already thought of moving to bigger and better things and thought that if Miranda had done because he couldn't. The best part of the show was the theme song ... a catchy and good melody in a quagmire of mediocrity. Obviously Drake Bell was dubbing Miranda's voice for the whole thing and he wrote the melody ...
