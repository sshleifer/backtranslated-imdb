The best thing about this movie is that it looks like they used a lot of things left by the attack on Pearl Harbor to Tora Tora Tora. My favorite was the shot of the P-40 crashing into the row of parked P-40s but shot from a hangar or crane. Unfortunately it only gets worse from there. <br /> <br /> There are two blacks and two whites like American prisoners of war, as well as some Filipino prisoners of war and Japanese guards. The POW ranking of Americans is a white naval lieutenant, who is obviously an O-3 in the navy. In any case, he needs a haircut, badly, absent-mindedly. Hockey hair does not belong to a WWII movie. Oh, and he's a racist. He doesn't want to share the quarters with the "niggers". Of course, in real life, he wouldn't even want to share the neighborhoods with the white boy. I think the Geneva Convention has a clause on officers quarters and enlisted, but that was not the point here. Oh well, I think the plot is secondary to other problems in this movie. It is put in its place and practically spends the rest of the film looking out and operating the air pump for divers. <br /> <br /> But once you get started, it's not a bad story. The japs ​​want the divers to lift the silver thrown out by the Americans before Cadigador fell. The Filipino resistance wants them to take their time. And the prisoners of war do their best to help. A potentially good story and not the badly done story I believe. A bit unbelievable when prisoners of war use the re-breathers camp to swim between the prison camp and the Filipino village, every night. Maybe I'm not so picky when I know this isn't a hit movie. I think that's why it comes on a war movie collection of 20 DVD packs for five dollars. <br /> <br /> The music of the 70s did not belong to this film or to any film of the Second World War. It's rather annoying to say the least. The acting was not so bad. Probably better than I could do. <br /> <br /> Not being a fan of football, at least I found out that Jim Brown is a real person and not someone Richard Pryor invented. This in itself was the 25th I paid for this movie. <br /> <br /> It's worth looking at TCM or paying a quarter for. <br /> <br /> A star to be a war movie, another for the Second World War and another because I feel generous.
