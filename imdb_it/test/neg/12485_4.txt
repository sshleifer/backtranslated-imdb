Face! Antoine Monot, in an imitation imitation of Kevin Smith's silent Bob, continues to ask, but writer / director Christian Zübert never listens. Zübert cannot say no to a joke, no matter how cheap it is. The best thing about this film is its soundtrack. Of course, Joey Burns of Calexico and the divine Jonathan Richman, sober bard of the old school of "There's something about Mary", would honor any story of abandonment in a small town. In visual appeal, Stefan (Lukas Gregorowicz) looks quite smart while driving his six-door BMW six-series brown, wearing aviator glasses, going nowhere. True, he * accidentally * sleeps with his wild-eyed bohemian sister (Marie Zielcke), but then, who doesn't? Congratulations also to how it goes in black and white with a liberal dose of that mysterious substance they call zero-zero, but if you're looking for a slightly more serious yield than what intoxication can do to you, I suggest you check "Fear and hate in Las Vegas ".
