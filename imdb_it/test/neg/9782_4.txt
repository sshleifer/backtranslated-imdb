This horror movie starts out quite promising and there's a moment when I thought to myself "this will be really good". However, it gets pretty boring rather fast at the end. The acting is pretty good, as is the position and the story starts pretty well. The problem, not enough screen kills and an ending in which you have the monster practically turning in the queue and running. I wanted to see more, especially after a very good sleeping bag scene where I thought the movie was taking and becoming a winner. Unfortunately after the film showed the monster very little and the back of the DVD lied as he told me that the desert under the people became literally alive and was able to devour their flesh ... now that it would be a movie, a near situation unavoidable. Of course, this would have made viewers uncomfortable and could have increased tension, but that's what horror movies should do! Instead we have very few shots of the creature or creatures so to speak and when we see it, it is mainly defensive. However it was not bad at all, he just needed more horror, less hunting and more chewing.
