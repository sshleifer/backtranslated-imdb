How does something like this come into my home DVD player in the world? How can it also be packaged and distributed? Are there absolutely zero screenings of a film (and I use it improperly) that have to pass before it is put on a video store shelf? I'm all for making DIY movies but come on! This does not allow me to put together a group of my friends and relatives, a shoddy video camera, a horrible story and put it all together to create a pile of shit and call it a movie. And I would like people to stop using the words "Indie" and "Campy" to describe these types of films. Not even them. In no other profession should such a thing be considered acceptable. If someone tried to sell you a car as bad as this movie, you picked it up and said it was a lemon. If it was a surgical procedure, you would sue the doctor for negligence. I wish I could get my time and money back after seeing this. Too bad for video stores that sell movies like these. I'm a rip-off for the public. Do you want "campy"? Go get any of the Friday 13 movies (even the most recent ones) or Dead-Alive. At least those don't make you want to kill you. It is because of films like this that make people automatically equal regardless of garbage.
