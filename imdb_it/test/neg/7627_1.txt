Forgive me, but this work by director Peter Hall is horrendous. If you can't reach us with the plot, why not kill someone's cat or dog. This certainly reaches the public. This viewer is tired of seeing animals sacrificed for a movie plot. And believe me, I saw him arrive before he opened the package. How predictable can you be? Grab a cute animal and kill it in a creepy way. I've never been a fan of De Mornay and this performance tells me why. As interpreted, somewhat stagnant and somewhat stagnant, I found it rather stupid and decidedly boring. I liked Banderas, but I felt bad that he had to act alongside De Mornay. He did much better in other films, "Philadelphia", where he had some honesty in his dialogue. In this chestnut he did his best to keep his real character. But the writers, Green & Rush, have done a good job in preventing this with their trivial plot and their tasteless dialogue. Please do not be subject to this type of entertainment. Some of us are not deceived by banal plots, stray animals and generally long and sinuous dialogues. Seeing her get away, it infuriated me.
