A low-cost and inexpensive police detective, which is kept bearable by some humorous voices, the pleasant harmony between the two protagonists and, above all, the satisfaction of James Remar as a narcissistic, psychopathic (and, of course, indestructible) enemy. Obviously a low quality image, both visually and dramatically, with a rather resigned but not unwatchable Burt. (**)
