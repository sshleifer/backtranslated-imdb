Before discovering whether this film is worth your time or not, I should inform you that I have never seen another adaptation of Carmen, so if you are looking for a review on how it fits among others, this may not be of much use. > <br /> The only time I met Carmen was on the car radio when I was driving around Spain during a family vacation when I was a teenager. I didn't pay much attention because at the time I didn't like the work and I didn't know anything better. The story has been around for 150 years or so. I feel like I'm lost after watching this movie? Yes, mainly because of the plot, but also because if all the actresses who played Carmen looked like Paz Vega, I would have all the adaptations happily sitting in my DVD collection. <br /> <br /> Directed by Vicente Aranda (who also rewrote the story with Joaquim Jordà), the story is told through the eyes of the original author Prosper Mérimée, a French writer who makes his way into nineteenth-century Spain . He runs into José (Leonardo Sbaraglia), a delinquent soldier and one of the many men who fall in love with Carmen (Paz Vega), a sensual, sexy and captivating gypsy, who has the mouth of the devil, the character of a 'bull' and who carelessly leads men to their destiny. The moment he meets José, he is attracted by his stand-off behavior. But she hooks him, attracts him and lets him go, many-once. Until one day, José is wanted for murder. Carmen convinces him to join her band of smuggling gypsies. They seem to settle down, she fell in love with him, but meets the charming Escamillo, the bullfighter. Can José keep his jealousy under control or destroy it? <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful and seductive story, something that resembles, almost, a Shakespearean or oval plot, with portraits of immense passion and emotion that can make us or destroy us and transform us into doing things outside the character. He is poetic, fiery and, above all, slutty. I remained suspended, I didn't know which way it turned. I always hoped that José could change Carmen's dirty little ways. I will not tell you if he succeeded or not. <br /> <br /> The synopsis above is what I removed from the film, but I was not impressed by the film itself. It was only after I saw it that I dug a little deeper into the story and realized how much of a lost opportunity Aranda had made to revisit the Mérimée classic. It was a shallow, dramatic and dramatic blitz, which saw that Paz Vega passed the time partially or completely naked (not that I'm complaining about this in particular!). <br /> <br /> First of all, the acting was poor. I was not hit by Sbaraglia like José. I'm still not sure he was a weak actor or that José should have been a weak character, I didn't read the book. He should be a man who has a burning desire for Carmen, but spends most of his time looking confused, jealous and a little weak. Paz Vega was slightly better than Carmen. I was convinced by his hardened and wicked character, even though I saw more convincing performances from him in other films, like Zapping and Lucia y El Sexo. She looks too cute to play a gypsy (not that I happened to meet a lot of Andalusian gypsies), so in a sense, the role didn't suit her very well. The other actors in the film weren't great either. They seemed to do everything reluctantly. Is the story passionate, emotional ?? they looked half burned, as if they could not wait to get out of the tight 19th century costumes they wore. <br /> <br /> However, the costumes, I was struck by, one of the positive factors of the film. I like Spanish culture, I liked the uniforms of soldiers, hats and women's flamenco dresses. They have adapted the time well. This is all I can really say about it. Sorry, let's get back to the criticism. <br /> <br /> The script, as mentioned above, was co-rewritten by Vicente Aranda and Joaquim Jordà, and done so badly, so much that it would have left Mérimée to turn in the grave. It was boring. He did not make good use of José's intense passion for Carmen (or maybe it was just acting). There were lines of cheese piled up on one and the other, satanic and diabolical connotation everywhere, among millions of swear words. I know the Spaniards are partial to the strange word, but the film was full of "whore", "whore", literally in every line. Maybe he was realistic in poor nineteenth-century Seville, but the story itself didn't need it. <br /> <br /> The editing and shooting work was boring and ordinary. There was only a little that I really liked, and it was then that the camera followed a fly close in mid-air, landing on Carmen's face. That was good. But the rest? Boring. <br /> <br /> To conclude, it is sad to see a great story wasted with unconvincing acting and directing. If you are a literature teacher, let your class look at this adaptation to get an idea of ​​the story. However, only the male half of the class will be interested in the film, thanks to Paz Vega. Otherwise, stick to the version of the work (even if I hate musicals). I give this movie 4, just because I love the plot! And Paz Vega!
