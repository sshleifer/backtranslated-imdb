I don't want to spoil your surprise by mentioning any of the horrible plots, I'll just tell you that this film suffers from bad animation, beyond acting, obvious tag lines ?? these are some of his good qualities. if you are deserted on an isolated island and the only link with the civilization you have obtained is this film that throws it on the fish. I can't tell you how sorry I was to see this horrible horrible movie. By the way, this film apparently a horror film cannot be classified as such because of the simple fact that the only horror in the film is the ability of some actors to perform. <br /> <br /> Take care.
