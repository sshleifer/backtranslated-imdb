I completely disagree with the previous review: this film has funny moments but hardly a riot of laughter. (unless you really think you can sip from a septic tank and the heads that explode in a vice are a laugh of laughter) In fact, the only reasons I gave this 2 instead of 1 are because a.) two actors they are decent b.) the soundtrack is above average with some melodramatic pop tunes thrown by contrast and c.) the monster truck is quite terrifying. <br /> <br /> Besides this, this is a film with some intermittent, gruesome or interesting ideas that are overwhelmed by inexorable crassity, harshness and cowardice. The former best friend character is one of the most annoying I've ever seen and the small grace that the hitchhiker character has disappeared in yet another forced ending that makes absolutely no sense. <br /> <br /> To the waste of the main actor who shows a certain nervous charm and the aforementioned actress who portrays the hitchhiker character ...
