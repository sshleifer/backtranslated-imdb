The credits come from Sandy Frank's sewing work that was made to turn this movie into Cave Dwellers for re-release. Now that's clear ... oh! Throbbing and excruciating pain. Blade Master shamelessly jumps on the sword and on the sorcery started by Conan's coups ... except that the bandwagon never left the garage. As such, this Italian film is a real disaster that tries to wrest a barrel at the box office, with predictable results. However, this would give too little credit to the director and writers, who make no effort to maintain a coherent plot, continuity, any semblance of accurate continuity of the era. Miles O'Keefe is not a protagonist, now or forever (Tarzan The Ape Man proved it, if Ator hadn't). Only an unlikely photo and a fatigue to watch.
