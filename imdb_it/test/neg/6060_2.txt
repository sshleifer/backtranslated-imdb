I thought there might be some level of value for this movie, and I spent all my time. I can summarize by saying that it left a bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> The film started OK, I think Herc's initial characterization was true for myths. Both as a child and as a young man he started a rather strong but not the brightest bulb. But later it somehow turns into a charismatic speaker loved by all. Eh? <br /> <br /> Another problem: terrible CGI. The satyr looked OK, but the rest of the creatures had a terrible appearance, especially the arch, the most disturbing aspect of the film. And why was Leelee Sobieski's skin sometimes golden, sometimes normal? The worst part for me - and everyone should shudder at this - was the twelve labors of Hercules. Because the producers obviously didn't want to cover them all; maybe they thought primitive screw heads that looked at this garbage couldn't count so high. Instead of the Twelve Labors of Hercules, we had the five labors of Hercules. Yes, the five labors! WTF?!? He didn't even finish the last one, so it was really the 4 1/2 fatigues! Simply terrible I'll take Hercules: The Legendary Journeys on this piece of shit any day of the week.
