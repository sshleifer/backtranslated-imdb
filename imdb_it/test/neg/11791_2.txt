I suppose by 1961 this film should have been "cool", but looking back now (45 years) its charm was as stupid as its entertainment value! Of course, the special effects are good on T.V. with the series started in 1964, but for the BIG screen ?? I once had an aquarium that was just as exciting! I have to agree on the Octopus scene near the end where it attached itself to the Seaview. Obviously not well staged ... or trained! Overall, it's a pretty nasty acting with poor special effects and I still recommend it - for a fun laugh. This was probably one of Irwin Allen's biggest films and I think he thought a lot about it. Barabara Eden continued to play "Genie" at the T.V. Micheal Ansara was her husband. This is an interesting part of this movie! I've always liked to see real life. The Marito and Moglie teams are the protagonists of the same film. Clean!
