I only saw this movie once, when I was about 14, but I was thrilled to have made a film about the 45th division. Being from Oklahoma and especially now that both my children are members of the 45th, I would like to see it published on a DVD. It may seem like a small prejudice, but the 45th division sometimes doesn't get the recognition it deserves today. The History channel always talks about the other infantry divisions when it talks about the Second World War and Korea, but the 45th is rarely mentioned. One of the scenes that really struck me was when Indian codivists worked in the workplace and the perplexed expression about German soldiers appears when they can't understand this language. I'm glad that all the communicators of the Native American code get the recognition they deserve.
