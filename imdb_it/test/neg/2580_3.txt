The patriot (nothing to do with the Mel Gibson film of the same name) came out Steven Seagal was still doing that 'saving the environment' thing in his films. Which is fine But it's not a good deed. <br /> <br /> When the plot (?) of this film has finally come to life, I saw the shot (?) Get a mile away. Seagal's anti-war attitude and caring for mother nature are not very subtle. For a film that was to make its debut in theaters, it was shot much like a TV movie, despite some wonderful shots of Dean Semler, the photographer of Dances with Wolves. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal does it as a fighting scene throughout the movie and is totally boring. As an action film it fails, like a drama stinks, like an environmental message is obvious. Avoid as Ebola crossed with the plague.
