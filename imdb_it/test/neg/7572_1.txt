and abysmal, exaggerated acting, you could enjoy this junk movie. Apart from atomic bombs, life changes in about a day or two (or according to other spectators, wake up). Or so it seems. And the seemingly massive atomic explosions off the Spanish coast don't make anyone ask questions. Coming to think of it, the plot doesn't make sense in any way (why the evil puppets attack the headlights?), So nuclear weapons that go out for no reason don't stand out too much. <br /> <br /> Ok, overcoming this, and the fact that the "monster" is a glorified thing that you wear kindergarten socks, you might be able to stand it. But for once the complete lack of blood does not help, leaving the attacks of monsters in all their "glory" of the budget absolutely below budget. <br /> <br /> I doubt you will be able to see it, but therefore better to stay away.
