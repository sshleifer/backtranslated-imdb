The film is beautiful Ben figurative, but without originality ... <br /> <br /> this film is copied directly from "The Hitch" where Salman plays as a Dr. Date as Will Smith, and Govinda as a jerk, who desperately wants to fall in love with his boss at the end of the film he comes in an old Indian style Flimi, the bride's father doesn't love the bride's lover and gets another groom, and Govinda the bride lover comes to the end and saves her from the new groom and a dance and fantasy stuff. <br /> <br /> the play was really good, no doubt when hitch meets Hindi would be more fun .... <br /> <br /> Ultimately deserves a watch but when it arrives on TV after a few months ...
