In a sense, you have to respect Arachnia. It is clearly intended as a tribute to the great films on the bugs of the fifties, and while the special effects seem terrible; at least the film does not present CGI. However, on the other hand; you can't respect the movie too much because it's a bunch of garbage. The acting is terrible, the special effects (as mentioned) are impossible to take seriously, and once you've seen a giant spider blow up; you've seen them all, so it gets boring pretty quickly. The plot follows a group of people who are unfortunate enough to find themselves in a plane crash after a meteor shower. They go to the only house in the area; which seems to be a house where a man has a huge spider he used as a circus attraction. At the same time, at the same time, the meteor shower caused the birth of other giant underground spiders. All the characters in this film are poor caricatures; none of them has anything like a third dimension and they will soon begin to get completely bored. You have to hear director Brett Piper because he clearly doesn't have much work for this film; but this absolutely does not make the Arachnia go crazy, and overall there are giant bug films better than this, and therefore the Arachnia does not get the seal of approval from me.
