When I first saw it I thought it was a joke. All I could think was "Get the 8MM camera, I'll take the toys of my little brother's monsters, we'll make a movie!" Because anyone in a modern period like 2001 made a science fiction film like this, it seems to have been created in the early 1980s. With actors who are wooden like an Indian cigar shop, a script written by the director's four-year-old son, a camera that was stolen from a burning pawn shop, special effects of poverty and to complete the work, a director who thought he was doing this shit would make them famous. The end result was not spectacular, complete with scrappy dialogues and continuity. At Venus it must have been fun to make and I'm sure everyone involved had fun with their stupid movie. <br /> <br /> A 2 out of 10 for a valiant and hopeless effort. <br /> <br />
