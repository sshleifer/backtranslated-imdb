When this film was made in 1980, I was a teenager in the stalls that played as part of the audience. This was done in Mooseheart, Illinois. The big letters that explained "MOOSEHEART" at the top of the stands were covered with a banner in the film. The director would have told us to cheer up loud in some places, as if a landing had been made. The St. Charles Youth Correction Center is a real place less than 30 miles from Mooseheart, although I think it may have closed recently. During a scene, they show a black woman and a white man in the audience watching the game. Right below them, you can see my sister Noel's head (she was 11 at the time). In the VHS version, I can only see the top of his head, but when I saw it on TV in 1981 I could also see his whole head and my sister Jacqui. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie itself was OK for a TV movie. Since there is already a description of the film here, I don't need to repeat it. It is worth seeing it at least once.
