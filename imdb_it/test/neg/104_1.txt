This film had a very special effect on me: it blocked my realization that this movie is REALLY lousy! It is disguised as a "thinker film" like Memento and other jewels like this, but in the end, and even after a few minutes, you realize that this is nothing but a pretentious cr4p. Probably written by some collage students with compassionate friends to tell him that his writing sucks. Is the idea? I don't even know if he tried to scratch the supernatural, or they want us to believe it because someone fills your mind (a very weak one, btw) with stupid "enigmas", the type you learn in elementary school recess, suddenly come to " unique truth "about everything, then you have to kill someone and confess ??. !!! What? How, what, why, WHY? Is it like saying that to make a cake, just throw some ingredients and add water ?? forgot to cook it? I imagine these guys forgot to explain, not to explain, but to present the WHY mechanism happened? You have to do it when you present a story that normal, everyday actions (lying to solve enigmatic rhymes) begin to have an abnormal effect on people. Acting was horrible, with that girl always trying to look nice to the camera, and the Highlanders guy, the series, who acted like the heavy metal record store (yes, they're all real even if they are s-o-b). The "threatening" atmosphere, with the "oh-so-intelligent" riddles (enters the 60s series by Batman and Robin, with the appearance of The Riddle) and the madmen who claim to have "the knowledge" behind that smirk on their faces ?? just awful, HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> I'm usually very partial to low budget films and I tend to root the loser by giving them more praise than they deserve instead of their constraints, you know, but this is just a bad excuse for a movie that will keep you wanting to be good for an hour and a half, and in the end you'll only complain that you've fallen for it.
