I've always been a fan of Chuck Norris for what he did and for his films. For when I was going to watch this movie, but for some reason I had no chance. Apparently I didn't miss much. This must be one of Chuck's worst films. So this truck driver, Billy Dawes (Augenstein) is given the opportunity to make his delivery, but in the street he is diverted and forced into a jerkwater city where a mad local judge Trimmings (Murdock) who runs the entire city, has him arrested and false accusations about him. He denies the allegations and makes a run for it. The local policemen beat him and he disappears. But now his brother JD John Dawes (Norris) another truck driver goes looking for him. He soon discovers that the city is run buys the losing judge and that his brother is nowhere to be found. Not long after, he started beating almost everyone in the city. Meanwhile, the female of the film calls local truck drivers on a CB radio, and everyone rushes into town demolishing it. LOL with large plants. Eventually Norris finds his brother and defeats other thugs. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty bad. Actually it starts OK and you feel good when Norris starts to destroy some of these corrupt local policemen, because there are losers. But there's practically no story, the acting is bad, and the ending ?? .. well, actually it doesn't have it. The judge has his house rammed by a large plant and you never know what happens. Lives? Norris never gets to trash it. Meanwhile, Norris makes fun of an evil cop. Who cares? Norris also manages to conquer everyone in the city, takes his broken hand and shoots him to the side and continues to fight on. Come on! This film was apparently made to cash in on the CB madness of the time, because there was one is beyond me. Barley even uses CBs in the film. In addition to this, the movie near the end seems to drag on and you wonder why it's not over yet. This movie is ugly, but if you are bored and you need something to watch, time will pass. As for Norris, he made much better films than this. 3 out of 10.
