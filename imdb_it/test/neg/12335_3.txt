This film had the potential to be a decent thriller, but was hindered by having only twenty minutes of good script, which was mostly used at the beginning. After the holes began to appear in the story you could drive a truck. The film followed a curve descending from the good to the ordinary to the bad to the ridiculous at the time of the conclusion. It is not recommended
