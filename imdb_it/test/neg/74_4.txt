The talented writer Alvin Sargent fails to elicit engaging ideas in this artificial joke about a rebellious mother and a mature teenage daughter who tries to make her life work in Los Angeles despite her mother's fickle behavior. Apart from several good sequences, I didn't buy Susan Sarandon as a scale (she's too intrinsically intelligent and focused to be passed off as this lady who takes care of the devil), and her natural personality is unsuitable for the role of an irresponsible parent. Natalie Portman is much better as her daughter, yet there is a strange indifference to her work (and some of her scenes, like the one in which she asks a boy to undress, are misguided and uncomfortable to watch). Certainly not an incompetent piece, "Anywhere But Here" has moments that work, but it is not a captivating film, nor has it proved to be an important film. ** from ****
