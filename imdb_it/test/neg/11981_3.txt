I was quite surprised to find that a movie based on the game of Far Cry had been created. History here is not something I would consider a strength in the game universe. No worries though, as in the typical Boll fashion, the film's plot has little to do with the game it is based on. Now I understand that certain freedoms must be taken to make a transfer from one form of media to another, but it seems that he is not even trying to establish a connection. Not only that, but the acting and action sequences are so trivial that it almost makes you feel like the whole project is a big joke. It has been said a million times before, but why couldn't anyone have more talent in taking video game rights to create a movie ????
