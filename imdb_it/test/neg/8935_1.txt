At the Beaverview Cheerleading Camp, the beloved two show off the Lucky Ducks cheerleading team to enter the league with The Demons' tough "cheerleader girl to defeat the crazy Falcon team that always seems to win in this field. Is this a typical 80s sexual comedy (zoppina) that you think will win? But what the film lacks in originality is more than compensating for its pure wickedness. Oh, crazy dancing numbers and obligatory Japenese businessmen who want to buy the field (so long as the male cheerleader, Tommy Hamilton, stays with the course course). Simply horrible, forgettable, and unfortunately it has a surprising lack of nudity. <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: HBO Comedy <br /> <br /> My Grade: F (yes, I really gave it to them)
