In the end I got a copy on DVD of this production and I was curious, because I had read so many people praising it in the skies, in particular the representation of Angela Lansbury by Mrs Lovett. I saw Tim Burton's film a few months ago and I thought it over and too bloody; fortunately this version is not so horrible, but it suffers dramatically in too many ways to be at least satisfying to me. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the casting. George Hearn is adequate and shows at least some expression (as opposed to the endless wooden face of Johnny Depp in the film). Angela Lansbury is, quite simply, boring. At least she has enough power in her voice to get the opposite point of view to the voice of Helena Bonham Carter and the child's inexpressive voice, but the subtlety seems to be just a word in the dictionary to Mrs. Lansbury. You can't be attracted to history when one of the main characters spends all his time moaning and winking in a "look, Ma, I'm acting!" fashion and being too aware of the public. This is not something that is typical of theatrical productions, heaven knows - I have been a regular participant of many productions at the Stratford Festial for many years and theater actors do NOT behave normally in that fashion (at least those who want to continue to find employment regular no!) ... <br /> <br /> Betsy Joslyn. Oh my God, oh my God. Has anyone outside of me noticed that he can't sing this role even vaguely appropriately? And she who plays George Hearn's daughter is simply terrifying, considering she was married to him at the time. Shouldn't he be a sweet sixteen year old? Yes, I realize that this is what acting means, but not once did it convince me that it was about thirty-five younger, and the phrase "lamb dressed as lamb" seems to have been minted only for her. His "Green Finch and Linnet Bird" slaughter made me grit your teeth and ready to turn off the DVD player at once. That song was done so well in the Tim Burton movie, and this was a sad shock. The song requires the vocal range of Julie Andrews in the 1960s and a purity of voice that is comparable only to that of a soprano boy. Any vibrato kills everything and Mrs. Joslyn spent all her time gurgling so hard that I thought she was going to fall off her ladder because she was shaking so much from the effort to hold the notes of coloratura with a voice that is a medium at best. Let's move on to her show vibrating at least a fourth tone on at least three of the highest notes ... This is not simply a coloratura role and perhaps a careful director should have told her this - but the fact that she was married to the star perhaps he would have tied the director's hands. <br /> <br /> Cris Groenendaal was adequate, but obviously obviously too old for the role and there is no chemistry between him and Mrs. Joslyn, which makes the entire subplot falls completely flat. I am reminded of some of the past theatrical productions of the Wagner's Ring cycle, where, due to the vocal power required of the singers to scream at the sound of a full Wagner orchestra, they had to merge based on the ability to penetrate vocally in opposition to any aspect or ability to act or even a good voice, that's why you have the caricature of the Brunehilde mountain massif with Viking horns with a triple chin and a beard, when the libretto requires an ethereal beauty that is eternally young and bewitching. The casting of "youth" leads is exactly like that - if you close your eyes you can almost believe in Anthony of Mr. Groenendaal, but as soon as you look at the screen the illusion is destroyed. (And at no time will you ever believe in Mrs. Joslyn's Johanna ...) For me, the rest of the production was completely lost because three of the four main characters were so clearly misplaced. I can't give a proper review of anything else because they were so distracted as to ruin the rest of the production. I really can't understand why people are excited about these poorly interpreted and awkward footage of a theatrical performance. Surely there is more to work with the camera in the theater than to throw down a front-row camera? If I want it, I'll go to a decent play, preferably at the Stratford Festival, where at least they work together for production and aren't constantly looking for the camera. I give him three stars just because the quality of the production apart from the antics of Lansbury and Joslyn seems adequate if not spectacular. <br /> <br /> Probably the best thing you can do is buy the soundtrack of the film and a Transmit the recording of this game, then combine the two to make a whole bearable. This is what I will do, and I will try to forget that I have never bothered to rent this completely insignificant production.
