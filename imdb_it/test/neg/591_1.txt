I did it and I lost two and a half hours of my life that I will never regain. <br /> <br /> I honestly have no idea what the critics and fans see in this movie. And this is not because I cannot appreciate "art". I love a good movie with deep messages, brilliant cinematography and exceptional direction. <br /> <br /> This film is not one of these. <br /> <br /> My main problem with this film is that it is so horribly slow, to the point of boring its audience to death. On the other hand, the dialogue sequences pass too quickly and there is not enough exposure to allow people who have not read the book to know what is happening (My mother took pity on me and explained everything before looking at it) . Would he kill them to hire a storyteller? At least for the beginning and the end? <br /> <br /> Let me break it down for you: (Spoiler in all) <br /> <br /> For the first two minutes you are treated with a black screen without music, waiting for the film to start. <br /> <br /> For the next and one-half minute, see several images of sunrises and savannah landscapes. As if the public couldn't figure out how to set the scene unless they saw the twist three or four times. <br /> <br /> The following eleven minutes are filled with grunting monkeys. They fight, they see the monolith, they fight again, they do things with the bone. Presumably they are prehistoric men whose evolution was influenced by the singing of the monolith. Not that you could say if I hadn't read the book. <br /> <br /> * Finally * we enter the space. Just to be subjected to twelve minutes of ships slowly turning towards the Blue Danube Waltz (a waltz fast enough as I understood it, yet here it seems absolutely dying). In the end we get some harmless dialogue and a rather cryptic exposition on the government that does not allow people to land on the moon. We have to ask ourselves this for another fourteen minutes of Blue Danube and spinning ships and anti-gravity precision tricks. <br /> <br /> Then four minutes arrive to watch a ship travel on the surface of the moon and dock at a space station. It follows a little more exposure in a meeting room scene. Then we went back out to travel at a snail's pace over the moon. A second monolith is revealed, which still fills our ears with that horrible sound (I had no idea it was a real piece of music!). The monolith makes its small light show and then the plot jumps forward. <br /> <br /> * Seven * minutes of observation of the ship on Jupiter. At this point in time my brain had turned to mush. Could it be slower? Perhaps it is "realistic" to portray it as such, but we do not yet need to see five or six different shots of the same thing to grasp the concept of its "realism". Let me tell you about this "realism" thing; I rejoiced when the character of the secondary astronaut died. Not because I'm a sadist and how to watch people die, but because after five minutes I was so annoyed by the sound of his rattle! I should worry about this character, hear when he dies! Instead I found myself waiting for the blissful silence in every way. <br /> <br /> However, now we come to the most interesting part of the film, the part with HAL. Forget Dave the protagonist of the wooden stick. The real star of the show is that ruthlessly impersonal, chilling, merciless and implacable computer. He is a great man. And the "Open the message boards" sequence is wonderful. But it's too short. And it doesn't take long before the director falls too often again. <br /> <br /> Four minutes for HAL's death. And he dies, he does it. Slowly, painfully, losing intelligence at every minute, the voice becomes lower and slower, singing "Daisy, Daisy", all with a low and constant hiss that becomes just as annoying as heavy breathing. <br /> <br /> Seven minutes of flying colors as Dave enters the monolith. Seven. I could feel my brain melt and drip from my ears! Seven minutes full of absolutely nothing but a guy who beat the psychedelic version of space travel, again with that three times damn chorus! We got the idea at the beginning of the sequence! Why drag it so long? Unless he wanted to make LSD users psychotic and have flashbacks. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to try to explain the ending, especially since I don't understand it myself. Apparently he is in an alien research laboratory and is teaching him deep and profound things as he observes himself as he ages and then send him back to earth as a sort of cosmic child in the celestial space. None of this appears in the film. As far as you know, it's just a sequence of images with no purpose or plot whatsoever. Much of the film looked like this. <br /> <br /> The first time I tried watching this movie I gave up halfway. The second time I suffered from this painful excuse for a movie, was to help my sister scan the sequences to see how long they lasted. That's boring. <br /> <br /> Call this "poor" art film if you wish. I wouldn't do it. I saw more interesting "art" in the local museum. And I'm never subjecting myself to this kind of suffering again.
