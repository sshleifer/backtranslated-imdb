Although I found the acting excellent and the cinematography beautiful, I was extremely disappointed with the adaptation. <br /> <br /> One of the significant parts of the novel is the fact that Ethan and Mattie decide to kill themselves rather than go ahead. This is never presented in the film, they show it as if it were a sleigh accident. <br /> <br /> The character changes in Mattie and Zenna are almost non-existent. While they almost change place in the novice, at the end of this adaptation they seem to be both disabled. <br /> <br /> Finally, Mattie and Ethan completely consume their relationship almost destroying the power and intensity of the finale. <br /> <br /> Changing the narrator as a preacher was an effective change. <br /> <br /> Neeson and Arquette are exceptional in their portraits. Joan Allen was also wonderful, but her character was very watered down by the Whartons novel. <br /> <br /> I don't expect the films to faithfully portray the novels, but this has gone a long way and has almost destroyed the story in the process. <br /> <br /> In general, I would not recommend watching this movie unless you have read the book, as you will be confused and disappointed.
