I saw the first show of each series just to see and waste of time. The Emmerdale girl was fat so yes, she should be in a fat friend but nobody lost any weight. <br /> <br /> As Itv made a big mistake with this. <br /> <br /> Bad Girls is 100 times better. <br /> <br /> I have the impression that the whole show only concerned large people trying to lose weight, but they never experienced a love story, oh my god, what a waste of time and also flight time. This show was not repeated on ITV2 / 3/4 yes, it's beautiful. <br /> <br /> I would say that not just a set of boxes is just a waste of money. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION
