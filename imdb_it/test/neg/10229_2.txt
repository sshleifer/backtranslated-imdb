Also titled -> The Magical Castle -> This is a trait. Why worry? Why create another rockbart and then add another plot that has almost nothing to do with the game or swan lake. Only a girl from the rockbart, the stolen book of forbidden arts and the original characters (no voices left). Stripped to its its bares this is a continuation of a thread. Next thing you will know that some birds will have memorized the "forbidden arts" and Swan Princess 4: the magic bird will be born. Fortunately, even if the chapters are presumably closed and this will begin but the trilogy will end badly it will end.
