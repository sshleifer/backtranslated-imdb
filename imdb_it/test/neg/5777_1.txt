A group of teenagers with the bitch goes to an old mining town in the hope of finding gold nuggets. The only snag in the three hundred and sixty degree scheme is that the ancient supernatural miner that the gold belongs to does not want to be so easily separated from his treasure and so begins to send intruders accordingly. <br /> <br /> Dialogue of budding literally clich√©s, horrible recitation, a terrible terrible southern dialect and a lame and insignificant murderer who resembles Jeepers Creepers (without the predilection of which the young boys naturally) come together to this almost unwateable smelly. Even the actress legend of the sect Karen Black in a small role cannot save this aberration. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Elina Madison shows (badly lit) T & A <br /> <br /> My Grade: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: TMCX
