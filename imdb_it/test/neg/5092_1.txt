Wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ..... WHAT!? This film is terrible, absolutely terrible. 1. The only reason Kiefer Sutherland is on the cover is to sell it to Kiefer fans, just to have his heart broken. He kills a boy, is shot and dies before half of the film is finished, not to mention that it was only in the first 10 minutes and then disappeared to the point where he died ... WHY put it on the cover if his character BLOCK . 2. Where are the EPIC battle scenes promised in the preview on the back cover? 3. He was too confused, I mean what happens with the girl? He had to tell the movie to TRY to get our attention, he failed! 4. If Kiefer dies in a movie ..... fails. Now I'm going to look 24 ..... THIS FILM DOES NOT MEET!
