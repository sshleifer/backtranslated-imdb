OK, I could only find three reasons to consider this film useful considering the extremely low budget. First there were Linnea Quigley and Rachel Carter. In fact, the two gave me four good reasons to look and I saw that I did it. <br /> <br /> The only other reason to look is that many were shot right along the road. Now, I didn't know before, but I saw an Orange County tag and I said, wow! this was shot in Florida. <br /> <br /> I was impressed by the flashback of the boy's past and ancestors, but it really was. The killings by pumpkin men were rather boring, with the exception of the motorcyclist. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Quigley and Carter, OK, but Return of the Living Dead will give you more excitement.
