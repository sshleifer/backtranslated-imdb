Following the film that represents the pinnacle of the Ninja genre of the eighties and that is "The Revenge Of The Ninja", the captivating fans were "treated" to this bizarre offer that mixes ninja shenanigans with spiritual possession .... the final result is not unlike in nature a somewhat horrible experience when you see a nugget of human poop floating threateningly towards you in a public pool. <br /> <br /> Let's take for example the alleged "action packed" introduction that is set in all the golf places Obviously (!) Here we see a ninja dressed in evil green who kills a group of golfers for apparently without no visible reason (although I must admit that the superficial elitist attitude adopted by many participants of this particular sport bothers me a bit even though ... hmmmm maybe that's why he murdered them? ..... yes, I can talk about it after all). Actually, later in the film, we are told that one of the golfers was a high-level scientist, but this plot is never elaborated and never even mentioned !!! <br /> <br /> However, returning to the introduction, the police proceed to surround the golf course and basically shoot the hell out of the killer ... and they have to keep shooting him because he doesn't want to stay down !!! Yes, literally hundreds of shots are pumped into him and STILL gets up to kill more and more law enforcement numbers. <br /> <br /> Finally (after what seems like an eternity) our unbeliever blows up a smoke bomb and disappears ... or so it seems, because in reality it is simply hiding under the ground and when our decidedly uncouth agents leave the scene to find his body, crawl out of hiding and stagger away. <br /> <br /> Then we see the beautiful Lucinda Dickey, a really beautiful actress and in superb physical condition, here she plays a telephone repairman. From his privileged point of view it is possible to identify the dying ninja (LAST !!!!!). However, after a closer investigation, the man, presumably on his last legs, suddenly jumps on her and grabs her on the ground. After some struggle, our exuberant heroine manages to free herself by luck, but does not count on the fact that the ninjas possess hypnotic powers and she inevitably succumbs to them. It is at this point that the dying ninja projects his soul into our heroine! His intention is to use his bodily form to kill those officers who killed him (the few who actually failed to wipe out initially!) <br /> <br /> From this point on, throughout the film, every time our heroine sees one of the aforementioned officers being subjected to film scenes of flashing lights, smoke effects and the sword that the ninja has let her levitate towards her in a shaky way! <br /> <br /> To make the issue more complex, a particularly irritating policeman (who has enough hair and shoulders to put a shameful yak to shame!) persists in trying to win his affections (in a very annoying way! !!) ...... well of course it does not take the gift of preconception to understand that, in a rather weak turnaround (less) towards the end of the film, HE turns out to be one of the officers he must kill! <br /> <br /> But wait there is still some hope! <br /> <br /> Run the only Sho Kosugi! <br /> <br /> Yes, the same ninja and look here more beautiful than ever! The news about golf clubs obviously travels fast and, after learning about the aforementioned events, flew from Japan to resolve the situation (suspecting the worst!) In a short subplot (which is equivalent to a few seconds! Sho's interest in this particular ninja proves personal after the aforementioned villain murdered the father / teacher of Sho (?) and blinded one of Sho's eyes (thus making it necessary to wear a really decorative looking eye bandage!) <br / > <br /> After stealing the body of his dead nemesis from the morgue and tracking down our heroine who provides an unaware dwelling for the evil soul, it is the culmination of an oriental temple (apparently in the middle of nowhere) where our Sho man manages to unite the two disjointed aspects. <br /> <br /> Now revived by the dead, evil ninja and Sho fight in the traditional ninja style with swords with the winner ........ well yes, you can probably in dovinare. <br /> <br /> Really this movie has Only two things going for him, namely the always excellent Kosugi (which looks absolutely fantastic in his usual role) and the adorable Miss Dickey. Too bad the material they found here is a rancid pile of excrement. Well, to be honest, I've seen a lot worse than this in my day, although I certainly can't recommend this apart to those desperately trying to complete their Sho Kosugi / Ninja movie collections.
