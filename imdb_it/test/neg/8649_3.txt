If this is film noir, then noir must be French for glacial slowness. Take a cast of completely unlikely characters, give them nothing to say, punctuate the whole thing with free ultraviolet violence and have the formula for an aggravated Dash. It could be subtitled "Sleazy's Hollywood types try to make money with the Chinatown scam". The one-minute part of Bruce Dern is of orders of magnitude better than anything else in this film. I didn't like the film, by the way.
