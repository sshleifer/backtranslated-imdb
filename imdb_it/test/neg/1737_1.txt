Worst. But there's no need to say more. Aaron Carter is absolutely repulsive and the rest of the cast should fire their agents immediately. It's really a terrible terrible film from start to finish. I wish I could be more eloquent in describing movies (oh so many) flaws, but I can't be too bothered / angry to form appropriate sentences. <br /> <br /> In short, I absolutely hated everything about this movie and not in "so bad it's good" in a sense ... <br /> <br /> It was drek unadulterated. <br /> <br /> Gavin
