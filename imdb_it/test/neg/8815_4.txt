I really tried "Saw". The story was good, and I admire the fast pace of the way the film was shot. However, there were too many clich√©s and elements that, although they might seem "cool", made absolutely no sense. <br /> <br /> First of all, what I liked about the film was the general tone of the story, and I thought the premise was fantastic. The character of The Jigsaw Killer was intriguing and reminded me of the vintage Dario Argento. Danny Glover was excellent in his role as an obsessed detective, and Monica Potter was good at an ungrateful role as the wife of a kidnapped doctor. Shawnee Smith's scene was incredible and both Wan and Whannell should be praised for using that scene as a demo to get the film's support. The idea that Jigsaw's murderer finds a way to kill his victims is an excellent concept, but once the film began, the logic began to escape. <br /> <br /> Once they proved that Zap was the only one holding Dr. Gordon's wife and daughter hostage, it was clear that he was not the killer of Jigsaw, and part of it. The scene where he puts a stethoscope on the heart of the terrified Diana while Allison yells at him through her gag was one of the most free scenes I've ever seen. It had to be chilling, but not to establish anything. Also, since the Jigsaw killer finds a way to kill victims, it has no problem cutting a police officer's throat. I guess it's a way to show that it doesn't want to be discovered and it will go in any way necessary to ensure that it doesn't happen, but for me it didn't make any logic, especially when it doesn't show remorse the death of another detective (which I liked that configuration, it would have been better if it had been given to someone who really deserved it). I felt that Leigh Whannell was as good as Adam. It was not a very flashy role and has great potential as an actor. However, I didn't really like the direction of James Wan. The story may have been original, but the management was not. I imagine being tired of fast MTV-style cuts in favor of the old directing approach, but many scenes involving the Jigsaw killer reminded me too much of "Se7en", too much of it. As the movie progressed, for me it was starting to become a series of demo reels like "Hey, look what I can do". Instead of being intriguing, he became very distracting. But hey, it worked. Now he directs "Final Destination 3", so he's on his way to a successful career, and I think he'll become a first-rate horror director for years to come. <br /> <br /> What really happened to me was the ending. As I said, I knew Jigsaw wasn't Zap, and I liked how Adam discovered the mini tape player after he killed it. He would have had a terrifying end, except for a fatal flaw: I felt they should leave him where you didn't know who the murderer was. The way it was done was done only for one reason: boy, are we smart? Uh, no. For me, it didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Some of the best horror films are made for a reason, where there is a reason for the violence we see in history. While "Saw" started very well, it began to be canceled by the insatiable need of the filmmakers to be "cool" and downplay the winning story they had. Perhaps if they weren't too insistent on making the films themselves, and relied on a more experienced horror director to guide it, I think it would have been the horror classic that has been undeserved over the past four months. If this and "Cabin Fever" are the future of horror, I'm very scared.
