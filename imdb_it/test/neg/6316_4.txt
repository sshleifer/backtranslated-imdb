Being a big fan of street fighter and fully enjoying the previous movie, Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, I couldn't wait to see it! <br /> <br /> However, it seemed that the film had no real sense of direction or purpose. Most of the characters I could not associate with and only lacked the intense action that made the other mentioned street fighter film so superior. <br /> <br /> There are some positive aspects, however, the animation is superb !!!
