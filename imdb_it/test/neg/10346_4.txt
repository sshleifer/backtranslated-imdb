I watched this movie mistakenly thinking it was that other zombie movie from the radio station. The shonky values ​​of the production and the low-rent cast soon revealed that it was another of the cheap knock-out style of science fiction channels. <br /> <br /> The central performance of Bill Moseley is initially quite as engaging as the doubtful radio shock jock but as the film continues it becomes less and less convincing as it is actually required to act. The rest of the cast has little else to do but look worried and has no depth. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is boring, flat and completely uninspired, like many of these films. He doesn't handle a whole lot of convincing gore, the zombie trick is literally pathetic except for one notable exception towards the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The film seeks to inject originality and a message is a mixture of half-baked and somehow torn ideas equating this epidemic with intolerance towards Islam and the war on terror. This is sadly managed with all the intellectual influence of a 6-year-old child. Like the characters and apparently writers are unable to distinguish the difference between race and religion - they describe all people of a certain skin color as "Muslims". In particular, a character is revealed to be Muslim only by skin color. At the same time the "Muslim" terrorists who cause the outbreak are the usual psychopathic stereotype. <br /> <br /> Supposedly the far superior Pontypool had a budget similar to Dead Air, but it shines everywhere where this film fails miserably.
