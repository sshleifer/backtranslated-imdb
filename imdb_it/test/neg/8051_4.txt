The Brother opens to the blows of a Porsche that runs along a highway, reaches an old pick-up and is restrained. While passing the pick-up, the driver (Benjamin J. Perry in the role of Ben Perry) screams obscenities and sounds the horn. Distracted, he doesn't notice an obstacle and crashes into his Porsche. He is quickly released from the wreck and taken to the hospital. While the Paramedic (Randy Harrington) tries to save him, he suggests that he probably won't make it. Then the ambulance is attacked and forced to leave the road by a van. The van driver, Jackson (Jim Boeke as James F. Boeke) beats the Paramedic and steals the patient. The ambulance driver, Harry (Charles Grueber) does not try to stop him. Once the injured man was put in the van, Jackson turns his attention to Harry who seems to know each other. Harry asks Jackson not to hit him because he broke his jaw "last time". Jackson hits Harry on the ground and throws him a bundle of money. The film therefore makes it perfectly clear that we are in San Francisco showing a shot of the Golden Gate Bridge. Sharon Raymond is woken up by a phone call to her boyfriend Dr. John Hollins (David Allen Brooks) to inform him that her mother, Amanda (Kim Hunter) who recently had a heart attack, has regained consciousness. Hollins works for a company called the "Geneticell Corporation" and is delighted by the news and starts to see it. Once there, she asks him to return to his old childhood home in a small town called Shelter Cove and destroy all his notes and experiments, especially "Anthony's magazines" which Hollins never heard of, she states also to have a brother called Anthony. Back at Geneticell, Hollins talks to Dr. Phillip Lloyd (Rod Steiger) about his mother, since both had worked together before they clashed with each other, and questioned him about his research and if he knew anyone called Anthony. He claims to know nothing. When Amanda dies after a visit from the sinister Dr. Lloyd, Hollins decides to pursue Mothers' request and try to find out who Anthony is. While paying the last tributes at the funeral, a woman named Melissa Leftridge (Amanda Pays) shows up at Hollins and claims to have been a great admirer of her mother's work and research after she helped her. Since Melissa seems to know a lot about her work with Madri, she invites her home because she might be able to find some answers to the various questions she has. Hollins, Sharon, Melissa and three laboratory assistants, Brad Baxter (Peter Frechette), Hart Phillips (Timothy Gibbs) and Cindy Russell (Julia Montgomery) plus a girl with a watermelon (!) Named Nell Valentine (Bunki Z, big name what were his parents thinking!?). They immediately get to work, but find no interest. For some reason no one at this point thinks of looking in the basement, which is just as good as there is something down there, something big, slimy and with many tentacles. First he kills Duke, the dog. Then switch to bigger preys. When Hart is attacked by something in a barn, Hollins decides to destroy all the traces of his work as Mothers and whatever Anthony is. Jointly co-scripted and directed by Stepehn Carpenter and Jeffery Obrow, Carpenter also worked as a director of photography and Obrow as a producer. This is a rather poor film in my opinion. The script is attributed to five (!) Writers, Carpenter, Obrow, Earl Ghaffari, John Penny and Joseph Stefano and with five people working there I would like to think that they could come up with something a little better and more coherent than This. Nothing is explained well, why did Amanda create these monstrous marine / human hybrid creatures? What is Dr. Lloyd's interest and motivation? Why does he steal the bodies from the back of the ambulance? Why does he have a cellar full of mutants? Why do none of these so-called genetic scientists think of controlling the basement? Could Melissa behave more suspiciously, even if she tried? Why does none of the characters have a background? Why do people continue to mention a substance found in sea creatures called Hemocynine when 99.9% of the public has no intention of guessing what it is? There is also a serious lack of blood and blood, only one person dies on the screen, only one! And all the scientists survive in a "happy ending" vomited and inducing. This is a horror film kids, all we want to see is that the slimy monsters kill and eat people in various gory ways. The death on the screen is actually quite beautiful, someone has slimy tentacles inserted under the skin, in the ear and on the nose in the movies only a decent horror sequence. To attempt the dimensioning of the gore there is a scene in which Dr. Lloyd is experimenting with an animal from the skin but lasts only a few seconds, and in the context of the rest of the film it means nothing. Even Melissa turns into a fish, don't ask. Not even nakedness, which is not a surprise. The film looks quite professional with decent production values, but it's so boring and trudging at snail's pace, we don't even see the giant monster in the basement until odd 15 minutes before the end which is too little too far late when it makes the appearance the effects are OK and this makes it even more a pity that it hasn't been used more. Overall I was very disappointed and expected much better. A horror film with only one death on the screen and only three in total, what will become of the world?
