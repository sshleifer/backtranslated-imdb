I won't ruin it for you. Although you probably could care less if it was ruined (you'll understand what I mean after looking at it) Poor story. Quality of the film with classification B. Typical horror - stupid situations - rare timing. I should know when they try to push a lot of publicity into their advertising or even add "quotes". He just tells me that the film has bombed big time. And they're trying to get everyone involved just so they can break even with the cost of doing this bomb. I wish I could take the time to watch this. I was stupid and thought that there had to be something big around the corner. But I continued to disappoint. Usually don't waste time adding comments to any movie. In fact, this is my second post. I just thought that maybe I would have saved some of you wasting money on something that had a lot of publicity.
