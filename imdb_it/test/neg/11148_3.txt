I felt the film was rushed and the acting was full of holes. Arnold was good, but the main girl was stupid and the guy who played the devil was horrible. The story was confused and idiotic. The film made no sense and it was incredible. The film is not the worst film, but it is not too far from it. Overall I was terribly disappointed, it could have been a lot better. My score is a 3 out of 10
