1st watched June 21st 2001 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Emmanuel Itier): presumably useless thriller that spends more time dragging us into sexual encounters with and without the star "Amber Smith". Try to wrap a story around sex scenes, but as usual with these types of movies it's not done very well. I was so bored with this movie that I actually did the fast forward through the ending to make it. The video version I saw was called "Tell Me No Lies".
