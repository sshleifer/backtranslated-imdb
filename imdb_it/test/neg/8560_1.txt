I can't even describe it. it's the worst movie I've ever seen (I'm a good guy when I call it a movie). Just another big budget destined for someone who doesn't want to think much. It's not even scary. It's disgusting when there are great movies that never reach the big screen and then this ... "thing" to fool movie fans. I imagine that the big producers will do whatever they want. <br /> <br /> It is enough to have a great producer, hot chicks (even if horrible actresses) and a ton of horror film clich√©s and cook it for a week or so, and you take "The Nun". <br /> <br /> And I thought Bad Boys 2 was horrible !!!!
