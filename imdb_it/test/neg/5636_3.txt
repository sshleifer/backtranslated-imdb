I didn't hear anything about this DVD when I hired it. I took a quick look at the comments but decided to keep an open mind. Obviously an independent film and a low budget, but that didn't bother me. I'll watch anything with Derick Jacobi and as always he played his part well. Too bad nobody else did it. I saw "Atonement" a few weeks ago with Vanessa Redgrave and she was sublime. In this he seemed to get up just to read the lines. In my opinion, the main mistake was in the casting of Vinnie Jones. To be honest I saw his picture on the cover of the DVD, but I didn't notice that he got top billing. A sticker was strategically placed on his name! It was watchable and I liked Dickens's story pretty much today. Perhaps with a more capable actor playing the main role it could have worked better. However it was weak.
