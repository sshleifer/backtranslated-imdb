The skilled merchant is that it is so, Jess Franco has also received the enormous temporary success of psychedelic espionage films such as "Danger: Diabolik!" By Mario Bava. Franco is the ideal man to shoot a similar film, since he was able to freely insert so many scenes, kitschy landscapes and absurdly grotesque curves as he wanted. And he understood it in part very well, as "The Rio Girl" revolves around an organization of hating men, led by a funky lesbian, who plots to turn all men into obedient slaves! Unfortunately (at least for them) the diabolical plans are in conflict with the daily affairs of a feared criminal union boss, played by George Sanders. All the right ingredients are well presented, however this is a surprisingly weak and unsatisfactory adventure film. The plot is rich in imagination, but apparently only on paper, since the action is rather quiet. The film is also very colorful ... but not too bright and above all shocking was the total lack of vicious sex. There is a bit of nudity, of course, but too few according to Franco's normal standards. All the characters are sick in the head, so the least I expected (or hoped) were perverted subtitles or frantic themes. Franco obviously had a higher budget as usual to work with, and I must say that he spends that money well on more convincing sets and talented cast members. In particular, veteran actor George Sanders ("Village of the Damned", "Psychomania") is one of the best players ever to appear in a Franco production. Too bad I can't save "The Girl from Rio" from the huge disappointment. A legendary director like the Eurodict like Jess Franco could and should have done more with this concept. Shame, shame, shame ...
