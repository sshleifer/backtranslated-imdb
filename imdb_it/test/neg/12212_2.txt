The King by James Marsh is a film that confuses me. I can't think of what it means to be. It is the story of a young man named Elvis played by Gael Garcia Bernal, who gets an honorable leave after 3 years of service in the Navy and then goes to visit his biological father and behaves dishonestly with him and his family. It's all pretty sick indeed. Elvis turns to his family by seducing his 16-year-old sister Malerie (Pell James). It is rather impossible to identify with anyone in this film from here in the Middle England. Father Preacher and lively joyful Christian congregation; I couldn't tell if the film was meant to mock them for their senseless beliefs. Or is the goal the happy family and we are thought to think that it is enviable. Or is he just saying that some people are lost and just pushed themselves to destruction. It's superficial We all know bad things happen; the interesting thing is to learn why, but this film simply describes a violence without ever getting rid of the thought that brought it. "The king" is a lost opportunity. There are some really interesting questions about honor; the code of the warrior; the changing concepts of value; honor killings in Indian families and so on. Honor is a very diverse concept. But this film adds nothing to the idea. However, Paul the Projectionist has done more than his lackluster role suggests. The DVD projector showed all the films in a green tone and the only way to fix them was to send it to Belgium. He did it until Christmas. I think those postal workers, repairers and Paul went far beyond the call of duty and our reward was this sad film. But could you see it differently?
