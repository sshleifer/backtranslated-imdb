I think he's saying something that the Bollywood "Bride and Prejudice" remained more faithful to the original material than it was the 2005 Hollywood version. I also laughed more in the Bollywood version. (Mr. Kholi? Priceless!) If you read the book or saw the 1995 BBC version (and enjoyed them), then you will get a nasty surprise for this movie. My friend, however, who had not seen either, was slightly amused by the film. If you are a JAne Austen purist, or even a film goer who does not like historical inaccuracies, it will be painful to sit at it. <br /> <br /> Ugh, the script. The script was the biggest problem. I guess the actors wouldn't have done so badly if they had a decent script, maybe written by someone who really loved Austen's work. <br /> <br /> What disguises have been committed? Well, you'll be forced to endure such incredulous phrases like "Don't you dare judge me, Lizzy!" and "Leave me alone for once in your lives!" Not only are the lines far from anything that can come from Jane Austen's eloquent pen, but can anyone honestly believe words like those that come from the mouth of a lady of the Regency era? The use of modern colloquialisms is one of the many irritating ways that the writer cuts the book. The writer also decided to give lines of characters that, in the book, were pronounced by completely different characters and all without an apparent purpose. Worse, when they try to get a little closer to writing the book, the writer has a bad and useless habit of reorganizing Austen's phrases and replacing embarrassing synonyms for his already perfect words. It was as if the writer sat with the book in one hand and a thesaurus in the other when he wrote the script. Stick to the words of Austen; she did it better than you! I assume this was done in a "revisionist" spirit and in an attempt to distance this film from the iconic BBC version of 1995. However, for me, it also made a parody of the true spirit of Austen's most beloved work. <br /> <br /> The casting had potential, although it was quickly swept away once the script started. But Keira, chuckling excessively and exposing your crooked teeth is not the same as charm and vivacity! And I think Mr. McFayden, even if I find him handsome enough enough, misread the script and he got the impression that he played Heathcliff and not the formidable Mr. Darcy. I really liked Brenda Blethyn, Kelly Reilly and the actor who played Mr. Collins. Their interpretations were indeed quite refreshing. <br /> <br /> Oh, but Donald Sutherland! Someone described his performance as if he were a tramp who accidentally wandered over the set of the film and I must say that it is an appropriate description. And can anyone tell me why they modeled Wickham after Legolas? Although he was in the film for less than two minutes, I dare say, and without his archery skills to revive the film. <br /> <br /> In a dress note, I would kill for Miss Bingley's clothes because they were sumptuous and would fit more with the modern century. (A sleeveless Regency evening dress? Please! More Versace than Austen, that's for sure) And poor Keira, the whole budget went to his salary and not to his wardrobe! Oh, and I'm sure they eventually caught the bastard who stole the hairbrush from the movie set. Unfortunately, they didn't catch him early enough to comb the actresses' braids before the shots rolled. <br /> <br /> In short, with this new version of Hollywood, you propose the eloquence, subtlety and wit of Austen because you are becoming the exact opposite.
