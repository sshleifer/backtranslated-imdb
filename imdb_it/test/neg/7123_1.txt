The Grudge 2 is one of the films that makes me wish there were more synonyms of "terrible" in the English language. With a plot full of holes more than a trawl, this film fails to make the compulsive vision for a fan even of the stupidest films I am. I felt obliged to stay in the cinema until I had extracted Â£ 5.70 of entertainment, although I was afraid that I would be there for a few years. A better film could be taken from the first releases of the first episode of The Grudge, although it is not entirely certain that this is not the result of such an exercise. As expected, what passes for a plot in this terrible example of wasted celluloid, ends without any resolution, leaving producers the chance to inflict "The Grudge 3" on the public when the time comes when they still feel another twinge true hatred for civilization.
