An epic story of hope limited by budget and limited artistic ambition. Since Terrence Malick produced this, I expected something obsessive and lyrical. Instead, we get a typical Norwegian co-production ("Revolution" with Al Pacino, anyone?), Where - most likely - good intentions are fucked up by a terrible script, and where many of the characters are reduced to stereotypes. Is the English dialogue "me-Tarzan-you-Jane" among the non-English-speaking protagonists particularly fascinating? we could hypothesize if Nick Nolte and Tim Roth have advertised their own, as they seem almost real people. The story is full of implausibility: it is expected that he believes that Binh can speak a smattering of English after having spent his whole life living as a peasant slave (his vocabulary, but unfortunately not the grammatical command, increases dramatically in Malay refugee camp, without the benefit of night lessons). The coincidence is widespread; I wonder if an hour or two has been changed since the first third: he traces his mother back to Ho Chi Minh City almost immediately - after having run into the younger thirty-year-old half brother, who recognizes him nonchalantly! The mother gives him a gold medallion (or something of great value) as they separate, but this is never referred to again. His relationship with "Me Dead Inside" Ling should provide the obligatory "love interest", but he feels artificial like Leonardo and Cameron in "Gangs Of New York". <br /> <br /> The journey in the rust bucket of a boat conveys a sense of the appalling conditions that human trafficking entails. In fact, the only time the film is remotely exciting and unpredictable, is the freehand movie taken from the bridge in rough wind conditions. (Incidentally, a boat cruise from Malaysia to New York passing through the Cape of Good Hope and the African coast, without stopping for supplies or fuel, is certainly an epic journey). The beautiful shot of the New York skyline echoes the use of Malick's magic hour, but I want to know why the Coast Guard didn't show up. Maybe they were watching the Super Bowl, or something. Of course, Binh manages to track down his old blind dad on a remote Texas farm, in the same navigation style he showed in Ho Chi Minh City. I was impressed with how Nick Nolte could wander to dig fields and feed horses on a large ranch without the help of a guide dog or white cane. To show how a story about the troubles that are going to happen to refugees can be structured and filmed on a limited budget, take a look at Michael Winterbottom's "In This World".
