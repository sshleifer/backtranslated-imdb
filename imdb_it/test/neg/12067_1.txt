The cover case and the premise that they write there is so promising. As a slasher freak, I expect a lot from this. But what the hell is going on. The film is terrible. The direction, the plot, the suspense and the act of throwing are so amateurish. I even thought they were using a home camera to shoot it. Lucky that he can still give me some good moments that make me happy. Thank you for the terrible "Blood Blood" package. <br /> <br /> 1/10
