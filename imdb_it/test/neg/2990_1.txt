Bad environmental sound. A lot of shuffling. Soooo useless scenes. For example: the boy sees an interesting woman in the lobby. He manages to stay there and look at it under the pretext of waiting for the building supervisor to take a package. It doesn't say anything. Look in a disturbing way. More mixing and other irritating environmental noises. Wait. Wait. Wait. Guy doesn't say anything. The woman looks scared or at least slightly disturbed and rightly so. Manager returns with the package. Guy approaches the apartment with the package. <br /> <br /> Another example: the boy and his guest sit and watch the bad TV. More environmental noise and melee. Wait wait wait wait. The boy wanders in bed. If you can handle more than this movie, you can watch them watch TV later. <br /> <br /> If you want a story, a dialogue, an entertainment or a well-made film, look elsewhere.
