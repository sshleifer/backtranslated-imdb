This representation of the history of popular children on the film is rather pathetic to watch. I know it's one of the first attempts to make films, but this 15-minute picture is not imaginative and poorly filmed. "The Great Train Robbery" (1903), which I also commented on, is much more creative and exciting to watch. <br /> <br /> We see the little long-haired Jack mistaking a cow (2 men in a cow-seed) for a sack of beans from a merchant and later a bean grows from where his mother throws them into the yard ( I guess poor Jack got the wrong kind.) Jack dreams of the goose (actually it seems to be a chicken) and the golden egg and the next day the stem goes up to the sky. <br /> <br /> There is no effort to be creative in this film. The stem looks like a rope with leaves, the giant is just a guy with a tall beard in a house with nothing abnormally big compared to Jack and the apex of the movie in which Jack makes his escape with goose chicken and his golden egg is miserable when a padded puppet falls off the screen in place of the giant and then the actor takes his place - he stands up in an exasperated dance of death as in the oldest films. The magic bean (the rope covered with leaves) descends from above and wraps itself neatly on the front of the giants. <br /> <br /> Look at something else.
