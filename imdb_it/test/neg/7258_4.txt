DEADLY MORTALS will certainly not scare anyone, but as science fiction programmers it is better than most. A volcanic eruption at the south pole thaws out a giant prehistoric mantis at the north pole. The military is missing. Dr. Ned (William Hopper - the son of Hedda Hopper and better known as Paul Drake in television's PERRY MASON) is called in i.d. the creature - but at this point the creature has devoured several Eskimos and is en route to the Washington Monument. <br /> <br /> About a third or more of the film consists of archive material: old government educational films, military radar cameras, airplanes - and would you believe that the Eskimos launch into the sea? Which explains, of course, why an Eskimo tribe is attacked in the film. ("Hey, Guys, do you think we can work on this?") Mix some negligible special effects, some clumsy dialogues and some sexist attitudes and you're okay. Not as original as THE MONSTER THAT CHALLENGED THE WORLD, but fans of the '50s "schlock" will appreciate it - and children will enjoy throwing popcorn on the screen. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
