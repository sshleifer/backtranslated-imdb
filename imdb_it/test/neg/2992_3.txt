There seem to be many fans of this movie here, but I found it boring, slow, tortuous and useless. And I watch and enjoy a lot of auteur films, so I didn't expect an action movie. I didn't sympathize with either of the two characters. The country boy was a bad host and didn't seem to have a lot of trouble finding a job, and his relative in Istanbul had no sense of humor and was emotionally closed. <br /> <br /> In a DVD interview, the director says the film is about a common situation in Turkey: the person who leaves the campaign because there are no jobs and comes to Istanbul to be with the relatives while trying to find work This in itself is interesting, but the film is not.
