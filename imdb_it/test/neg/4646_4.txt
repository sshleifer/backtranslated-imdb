Well, I read the book first and thought: wow it would be nice to see a movie, then I started searching and found out that there was already a movie made ... I bought the movie a week ago on DVD and the I looked ... they did it terribly wrong! at the beginning this boy Hapi, who is not a character of the book, therefore the mix between the two books ("the god of the river" and "the seventh roll") of Nicolas who needs funds while in the book he himself is in actually the lender, even the whole thing of the Hyksos is wrong .. Taila should have invented the light wagon ... the rest of the tomb is also very wrong ... there should be a channel that has a kind of void around it to it .. the tomb itself was made in a maze with only a chance to pass if you know the rules of the ancient boa-game. There was nothing in the film about Nicolas that was English and Royan was a Christian Copt in the book, not a Muslim ... This list is endless .. There were only a few good things in the film, the actors who played Royan, Nahood, Taita, Boris, Mick and Tessay were well chosen, the rest were only parodies of the characters in the book, Rasfer was the worst, he did not approach the character I had in mind while I was writing the book .. It is a pity that such a book big be mutilated in such an ugly reproduction ... I wonder why Wilbur Smith ever gave his permission for this ..
