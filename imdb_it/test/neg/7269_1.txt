This movie is terrible. At first I thought that children could enjoy the fury of Stars Wars children because of the cuddly Ewok. After having experienced this monstrosity of a film, I am sure that not even a 4-year-old child would have found this film interesting. The special effects are by far the best in this film and compare well with other TV movies from the 1980s. The script is ugly, the actors, especially Aubree Miller and incredibly bad, and the film is so predictable that I still can't believe I'm able to not touch the front of my video recorder. However, I approached changing this mess more than once.
