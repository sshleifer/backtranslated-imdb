While I'm usually a big fan of John Turturro's work as an actor and director, ILLUMINATA is a huge disappointment. Although the film has some fascinating moments, overall it falls to the ground. Worse, the film is confusing. Where is the movie set? Italy or an Italian company in New York? Why bother making a historical film if it fails to convey a setting? If you want to see a well-made and stimulating historical film on the theater, check out Tim Robbins's THE CRADLE WILL ROCK. This film has many advantages, including a beautiful performance by John Turturro.
