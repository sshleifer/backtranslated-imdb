This film is about a grieving wife who lost her husband by suicide. She is tormented by her son who refused to talk later. <br /> <br /> Child pain is rarely explored in a film, so it is refreshing to see a film like Addison's Wall. However, due to the nature of the film itself, there is no tension or drama. Apart from a few key emotional moments, everything in the film is very simple. The abrupt ending that solves no mystery certainly does not help the film to be more watchable. Addison's Wall could have been much better, like exploring the contents of the wall, an intensive therapy program to help Addison overcome her trauma. Instead, the film looks very unfinished and uninvolving.
