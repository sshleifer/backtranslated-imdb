I saw it as part of the DC Reel Affirmations Film Festival. I hope they have better films than this, because this film failed to satisfy the hopes that the public could have entertained, from the fantasy of seeing James Franco without his shirt, to simpler desires, like decent acting, consistent direction, development of the character or actual production values. Plagued by film school effects like the still image to show moments of emotional distress and obvious influences ranging from My Own Private Idaho to Terminator 2, this film has failed almost at all levels to engage the public. After the first twenty minutes of courageous attempt to take him seriously, the audience collectively raised his hands and started enjoying the involuntary crap of the film. I could be angry because I paid nine dollars to see it, and it's been two hours since I will never go back, but on the other hand, it's been two hours of fun that I never go back to. This would have been a classic Mystery Science 3000 episode.
