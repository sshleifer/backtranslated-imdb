The year still has three weeks to go, but unless a really hideous turkey shows up before then, Passion Of the Mind could be the winner of my most entertaining movie of the year. An interesting idea poorly executed. And, besides, he acted badly. Demi Moore is very good at bending her lips and smoking cigarettes, but is that all she does? And why so many cigarettes. Ligitt and Myers or one of the other nicotine boys have invested part of their illicit profits in this production. He is confused, foolish and moves into the frenetic past of an arthritic earthworm. I gave a 3. It should be a 2! <br /> <br />
