It's a shame that it takes a lot of effort to make a bad movie - this is no exception. <br /> <br /> I am not a yanke lover but their incredibly simplistic vision of the world and their ability to reduce everything to black and white and create events (even fictionalized fiction in novels) that fit into agenda that has little or no relationship with complexity of any kind is extremely irritating. <br /> <br /> Wilbur Smith is descriptively verbose but weaves intricate stories that deserve more than was delivered by this horrible mixture of a film. <br /> <br /> Really sad for those who will never read Smith. They will be left with a less than dignified portrait of his Egyptian series, which must be said is gigantic in his exposition. <br /> <br /> Indiana Jones movies were snappy. To attempt to replicate this by manipulating Smith's novels in this production misses a mile of campaign. <br /> <br /> Pathetic except for photography and Art Malik.
