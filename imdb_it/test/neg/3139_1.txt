This film must be one of the most boring movies ever made. The only thing I liked was using the silver-required lighting in most scenes. The music is horrible and the rhythm is so slow that you can see it at a speed of 2x, and even then it would be slow. History does not exist He does not even have shocking scenes. <br /> <br /> It is classified (at least on this site) as a horror, but it is not. It is a sort of art film that explores the dark side of human nature. If you like this kind of thing and you can keep up the pace, then watch it, but I'd rather recommend you something Japanese (eg Ichi the Killer). I think the only reason this film has never been in theaters is the public fear of committing collective suicide caused by the enormous amount of boredom generated by this film. This 80 minutes of its length would have been better spent looking at the dry paint. <br /> <br /> I gave it 1/10 simply because there is no 0 in the drop-down menu
