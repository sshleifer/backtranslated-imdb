I have no idea how accurate Flynn's portrait is in this film, but also how fiction is one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is everywhere and part of you are wondering how it came from one scene to another - you are not given the minimum information necessary to maintain a certain continuity and understand your current situation, and it is difficult understand the motives of Flynn and the other characters behind some of their behavior. <Add a series of silly and implausible situations and you have a movie that looks like one of your dreams that seems to make sense while you sleep, but when you wake up and try to remember it, it's just weird, bumpy and totally unrealistic. <br /> <br /> There are many long and boring musical sections of the film which for me are bad direction or bad directors who try and cannot be artistic. /> <br /> None of the characters is even nice and the character Flynn finds him as a liar, thief, thief, thief, murderer, fist bear fighter, gigolo and impostor who will do anything and trample on anyone to promote their own dreams, and somehow, in spite of everything, great opportunities seem miraculously to fall back into his lap. <br /> <br /> This film is not fun or satisfying in any way and by all accounts it is not even historically accurate, so why look at it too? To put the salt in the wound, the DVD had one of the worst transfers I've ever seen, it wasn't even in wide-screen or Dolby 5.1, it had a tremendous telecine swing and many, many artifacts from what looked like a film reel that he had collected dust and scratches somewhere.
