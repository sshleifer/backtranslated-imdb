This film was played so badly. What was with Jeff Bridges' accent, horrible and incredible. Should he be French, Scandinavian? The script was lame. Having the heroine stumble over her boyfriend's grave while escaping from the Jeff Bridges character ... are you kidding me? How convenient it is for Jeff to bring his dirty shovel into the house after he has laid bodies in his lawn. Don't these people just believe in calling the police? Ok ... I'll get in the car with you, why not? DUH! Why was Bridge's daughter obsessed by the fact that her father had an affair, was her mother evil or simply dull? I didn't see the original, it would have been hard to make myself after seeing this movie.
