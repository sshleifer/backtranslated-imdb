A couple moves into their dream home, unaware that it was built from a graveyard or from its neighbors. It is said that the film was based on a true story, even if how much of it should be true is not revealed. The plot is not at all unique - see Spielberg's "Poltergeist" (1982). In a short time, they experience various supernatural phenomena: these range from the disturbing - mysterious shadows, to the serious illness of the daughter - frankly ridiculous - toilets that constantly rinse and the garage doors escape control. There is little depth in the story: once we have established that the earth was used as a cemetery, we do not learn anything anymore. The plot does not seem to develop. The characters are not particularly well designed or memorable, and the atmosphere is not particularly special. The film could be disturbing to some viewers. There is no sense of catharsis or any kind of positive message from it.
