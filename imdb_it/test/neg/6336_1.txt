This film must be one of the all-time minimums of Michael J. Fox's generally respectable career. I should have known how awful this film was when I rented it and found the film only halfway through and not rewired by the previous tenant. Never a good sign! Fox plays an adult child who is now an agent for other children in the show. His character is delirious because he still believes that everyone should love him to be Mikey. His big break comes when he meets Angie Vega, a talented girl. Vega is abrasive and not at all nice. In fact, the only nice character in the entire film is Cyndi Lauper as an accented Brooklyn receptionist for the agency. One of those movies that makes me want to stick a post-it note to the box to warn others not to waste their time!
