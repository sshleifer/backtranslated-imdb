Seriously, this film is not. Steve Guttenburg is constantly forcing his dialogue to be tough and then giving everyone the evil eye all the time. He wasn't credible, he seems to be trying to be a stingy guy and he sucks. I only remember him as the millionaire dad with the Olsen twins in It Takes Two ... so this is a BIG change. I rented this movie for Sean Bean and he dies (as usual). Only this time it was not impaled on an anchor (Patriot Games), destroyed by a giant satellite dish (Goldeneye), or hit by cows (The Field). He's just been shot, really fast and civil, and that's all I got from this movie that didn't kill him in an extremely grotesque and morbid way. How sad is it? I was only watching him for 3 seconds when Sean was there, and then the rest was rubbish. Actually I tried to look and understand the plot, but there wasn't really one. It looked a bit like Mission Impossible with the hole, "Oooooo! There is a mole! He is the leader of the group, and NO ONE INTENDED it! Let's trap him! We frame the loser good boy so we can get away!" Cliched and tired, this film was a waste of time.
