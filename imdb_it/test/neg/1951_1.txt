Talk about garbage! I can't think of a good thing in this movie. The script was poor, the acting was terrible and the effects, although there were no effects. I can't believe that the writer of this film made Identity, everything in this film made me sick from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The cover of the videotape shows a showman with shark teeth and scary eyes. It sounds like a scary villain, but like the old saying "never judge a book by its cover", the whole criminal looked like a cardboard cut out. A part in the film a girl is killed by a salad caliper, terrible. The setting was bad enough, as if they could set it all in Lapland but no, a tropical island. <br /> <br /> I took this film as a parody, which I think they wanted it to be, but the only thing that made me laugh so bad was the sticky effects. You can argue that I didn't see the first one, but seeing this I would be safe if I didn't try it. <br /> <br /> The biggest joke of this film is the effects, the snowballs looked like they were homemade and that carrot was a complete embarrassment. If I imagine that the budget of this film is probably between 8 and 9 pounds and fifty. The last-minute panicked producer must have grabbed the actors on the street, given them the script, told them that they have 6 minutes to practice on these lines and run on an island. <br /> <br /> Finally the acting in the film was painful, it was as if the actors had forgotten their ordinary lines and having resolved them. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I give this film: 0 stars out of 5
