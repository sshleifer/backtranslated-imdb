This film was a complete disaster for me. There is one thing that movies must have to be watchable, which is * some * psychological credibility of the characters ... unfortunately, here, this is not the case. The main characters behave irrationally most of the time, and even if they have some reason for such behavior, this is not revealed by the director. The character of Sophie Marceau is particularly irritating, creating images of the whole film, when one can expect something more rational (for example, meeting the mother in the hospital) ... and why exactly did she marry this boy? (no, this is not a spoiler) The plot sometimes seems to be ripped off some soap operas, and while the actors' performance is not bad, this doesn't help much. All in all, I couldn't find a way to connect with this movie. Not that I tried too much after the first hour, though. I never came out of the cinema during a movie, but this time it was the closest in my life so far.
