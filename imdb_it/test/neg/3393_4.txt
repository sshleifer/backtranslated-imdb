That's why this film fell very short of its potential (I don't read much, so I don't care how the novel was). 1. I think Brendan Frasier copied his man Encino from Lambert's Tarzan. He was rigid, and while his Tarzan call was a little more realistic, he had no humanity. 2. They screwed the story. Maybe this is how the book goes, but for as long as I can remember, Tarzan's first statements were "Me tarzan, you Jane". Jane is tarzan's first human encounter. I liked the natives a little more than the pigmys shoepolished dwarfs in Weismuller's version, but those bows and arrows were a bit rough. 3. Tarzan is primarily a love story. I'm sorry, but love interest enters more than an hour in the picture. This qualifies her for a supporting role at best. Support roles and leads don't fall for each other, there's not enough time on the screen, I'm sorry. Not only was Andie McDowell's wakefulness pathetic (probably because her strong southern accent could not be masked) the chemical scale between Tarzan and Jane was enormous. I never believed that they loved each other, which meant that the Belgian guys closed their voices, frankly, silly. When Tarzan sees Jane for the first time in the jungle, he feels an impulse, if you will, a feeling he never felt before. Jane brings out humanity in him, and brings out the wild side of her. It is this chemistry that compels Tarzan's story. Not that the dying desire of Lord Greystoke is to keep his land and that johnny boy will do it for him. Even a good facelift cannot help this movie. It needs massive internal reconstruction. Oh, and maybe we could shoot more in the jungle, or at least use the camera's corners that don't show the sound stage as a quality of place. Final judgment, 4 out of 10. Sorry Tin-man, and anyway, if you want to see the real acting, leave Lambert and take a look at Leonardo Dicaprio.
