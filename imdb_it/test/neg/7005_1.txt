I had heard of this film through a friend, it was supposed to be a thriller, but what I saw was not a "thriller". It was more like a weak attempt at one. Amber Smith was a bright spot, which was perhaps giving her too much credit. The scenes were she was in bed with the actress Erika Michels they were also lame. The two actresses seemed not to shoot at all. Amber Smith was definitely out of this girl's league and she definitely showed it to the camera. It didn't look like that at all. I was disappointed because a friend of mine had obviously helped make this film "something exceptional", but in reality it was more like watching a halved porn movie.
