Koyaanisquatsi is simply the best film I've ever seen. It is a masterpiece in which everything is in the right place. Some scenes are not "beautiful" or "beautiful", but the camera never peeks or intrudes. This is exactly what is happening here. The camera is used to intrude, to dishonor and to ridicule. There is no magic flow here, no sense of greatness or respect. Instead some scenes are cobbled together without a purpose or a greater plan. The music is disturbing. Just like I rated Koyaanisquatsi the best film ever made, this is the worst. It is also a "pure" film, but this is the negative form, exactly what should * not * be done.
