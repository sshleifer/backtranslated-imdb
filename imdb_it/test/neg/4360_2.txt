This is not saying much. This Killjoy movie has better cinematography and is more professional than the last. This does not mean that it is more professional. That horrible last movie was about gangsters who killed a child and were persecuted by a voodoo clown. I thought the guy who played Killjoy in the last episode was a bad actor, but wow !!! This Killjoy is honestly the worst actor I've ever seen in a movie, and I've seen many movies. Thed's last film arrived in about 15 minutes, this one is shorter and the clown doesn't even get up to 40 minutes and lasts only 65 minutes !!! I give him a 2 because the acting of some characters is OK.
