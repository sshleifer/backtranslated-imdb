Would you be surprised if I told you that this film is a conspiracy? No? What do you say if I told you that the ringleader was a shadow puppet. What? You do not believe me? ... OK. Yes, I invented it. Too bad, this film could have used a sense of humor. I understand that Charlie Sheen did it at that time - another movie equaled more money - like for Donald Sutherland and Linda Hamilton ... why? Don't even get me started on Stephen Lang. He was as funny as the Party Crasher on 'The Hard Way' and now this junk. <br /> <br /> Ah it doesn't matter. All those involved should be ashamed. If you aim to make a bad film and succeed - it's convoluted - but I seriously doubt that what they were trying to achieve was here. Plan out, the story stinks and we really should take this yak seriously. You wonder if this movie even had a glimmer of hope. Seriously, I doubt it and in a sector so close to the ropes of the bag, the way it turned green is beyond me. Perhaps even more frightening is how this pile of dogs has become a way for theaters! <br /> <br /> Oh ... Sam Waterson, how good you are on Law & Order. Why are you here? Forget about the role of the President of the United States, which I might add, he is hit by a remote-controlled biplane controlled by the gonzo killer. Once again this is a masterpiece of the work of George P. Cosmatos, who directed "directors" including Rambo: First Blood Part II among other gems. Hmm .... case in question?
