I mean, come on! This film has such a beautiful potential, but it's like they ran out of money to finish the script and just to wire the whole damned rest of the movie to about 2/3 of a half. The characters begin to spit this film for reasons of existence for other characters who have not requested information on extremely fragile premises. They also fall into stereotypical behavior because it must be what is expected of this kind of film. It's really quite sad because this movie could have been so much more. <br /> <br /> I really hoped it would be a good movie. There was good acting. Mark Hamill does an excellent job until the film falls apart, so does Sally Struthers. It was fun to see them work and succeed in their trade. Majandra Delfino was quite good for a while until her lines became unsustainable. I felt sad for her that she had to say these jokes that have just turned the credibility of the entire film for all movie-goers. Brad Hunt does an excellent job. He really has a surprising array of talents judging from another of his films I've seen recently, Lucky 13. (which was a piece of shit). This guy could be a star if he could choose the right scripts and get lucky with the right director. <br /> <br /> Almost forgotten! The music was so heavy that you might think that this project was delivered to a minor film school. I call this kind of music "Teller Music" because you can simply say what will happen next based on the music. Less is more sometimes. <br /> <br /> Cut half of the music in this movie, get a good movie editor, a little rewrite or two and this would be a great movie.
