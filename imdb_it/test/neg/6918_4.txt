"A scientist has developed a serum that grotesquely distorts the victim's hands and heads: the scientist decides to use the serum on a concert pianist to extort money from him for treatment and take the man's daughter for a wife", according to the synopsis of the DVD cover. J. Carrol Naish (as Dr. Igor Markoff) plays "The Monster Maker" in the low-budget Bela Lugosi mode. <br /> <br /> Mr. The Naish serum causes a true disorder, "acromegaly", which American Heritage defines as "a chronic adult disease characterized by the enlargement of the limb bones, face and jaw caused by 'hyperactivity of the pituitary gland'. Ralph Morgan (as Anthony Lawrence) plays the afflicted man with a certain dignity. The beautiful blonde Wanda McKay (like Patricia "Pat" Lawrence) is the daughter wanted by the mad scientist Naish; in the first scenes, Mrs McKay and Naish's hematony exhilarate. <br /> <br /> Watch for Tala Birell (like Maxine) in a surprisingly good support performance; she interprets the somewhat graceful and long-suffering Naish's assistant. Mrs Birell definitely steals the film; and you have to question the sanity of dr. Markoff in putting it aside. Glenn Strange (like Steve) and a crazy gorilla (Ray Corrigan) join the fun. The monster's make-up (Maurice Seiderman) is very good. <br /> <br /> **** The Monster Maker (1944) Sam Newfield ~ J. Carrol Naish, Ralph Morgan, Tala Birell
