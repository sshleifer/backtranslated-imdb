"Wagons East" is widely known as John Candy's latest film, while he died on the set. This is precisely what makes it so sad: not simply that Candy had a fatal heart attack, but that it was on the set of such a bad movie. Seriously, I don't know what they were thinking when they invented this piece of shit, but the movie has NO ransom. It's like they take all the unused scripts for stupid westerns and mix them and film them. No wonder John Candy didn't want to make the film; perhaps his contractual participation was what brought him in. <br /> <br /> However, the point is that Candy has done much better than that during his career. To be sure, he had already completed "Canadian Bacon" by Michael Moore, in which the United States declared war on Canada. Stay true to that and you can say that Candy ended her career with honor. As for Richard Lewis - who previously starred with Candy in Eugene Levy's absurd but hilarious "Once Upon a Crime" - he compensated for this piece of shit by frequently appearing in "Countdown with Keith Olbermann" in later years.
