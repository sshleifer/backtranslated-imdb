Funny!! I could have sworn Ed Wood had written it. Terrible. I loved every frame. Bad movie aficionado, this is your trophy! I'll watch it again. Words can't explain how fun this movie is. Pare's career must have diminished, but I really think he is heading in the direction of Leslie Nielson. It was perfect for this. Terrible, just terrible !! You will like it!! Take some friends, lots of beer and you will have the time of your life. It's an MST3000 party, waiting to happen. To enjoy!! It is worth the rental !! You like the cop "Colombo" and the coroner. The villain will make you laugh on the floor. It's also in another movie Pare, Komodo vs Cobra, and he's just as good there. I don't know what the budget was, but they will recover it because this film is destined to become the best unwanted comedy of the year.
