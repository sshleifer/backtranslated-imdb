Most of the positive comments posted here are as verbose as the movie! It takes a long-winded boredom to appreciate a long-winded and boring film, we suppose. Some have simply called the film "contemplative", which means slow and lacking in plot, however, a Dutch critic has hit the head: this is an important event turned into a boring film whose tone is set in the first scene. Here a young couple is shown in an apartment by a real estate agent who, predictably, talks nonstop and regardless of what is happening. This is what almost all the other characters do! <br /> <br /> The only silences in this image are the dream sequences - fragments of 1930s Soviet propaganda - and they are also its most interesting parts. This tells you something about how watchable the rest of the movie is. <br /> <br /> The device of filming most of the extreme close-up scenes - as if you were looking through a crack in the blinds - gets old fast.
