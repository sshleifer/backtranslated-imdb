After watching the Blues Brothers release on DVD and mentioning "Wired" in Belushi's biography, my boyfriend and I were hungry for more information on John Belushi. I had heard of "Wired" but didn't know much about it and found it in the back of the local rental store. I understand that Dan Akroyd was really crazy about this movie and I thought it was because he didn't portray them in a good light. But this had nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> The film starts right, until they bring John's body to the morgue. When he wakes up on the autopsy table and decides to run for it, the absolute blandness of this film begins. John is subjected to seeing his life and all the disorders he created with "Angel", a Puerto Rican taxi driver with an evil sense of humor - subjecting him to criticism and trying to get him to cross. <Br /> <br /> The two actors portraying John and Dan do not seem close to the real actors (let alone anyone else involved in that case, ie Lorne Michaels), making it difficult to really try to focus on them and how they were in real life ... but this is the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> I think this should have been an "artistic" film - John constantly tormented by drugs (ie, soap in the bathroom being cocaine,) in such a way that it was also difficult to follow. Flashbacks are mixed, which also makes it difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> Probably the most insipid scene was when John is (literally) forced to undergo his autopsy and is suffering while removing his heart to weigh it, saying it was abnormally large due to drug use , of obesity, yes, we get the result without the grotesque portrait. <br /> <br /> There are very few other actors we know in the film, (where Carrie Fisher is. For example, they were incredibly close and Jim Belushi would have been a fantastic person to show,) he seems VERY done cheaply, (we have felt that it looked like the graphics were from the early 1980s or late 1970s). it was shot in about a week and, after all, it didn't show John's side. I felt I knew more about him from watching Saturday Night Live episodes. <br /> <br /> In a last note, Bob Woodward runs into narcissism by putting himself in the film, discussing with John about how he writes his life story. For someone who had to be very intellectual about the bust of Nixon, his calibur in person could match any writer in the National Enquirer, and thus lose my interest in all his work from this point forward. <br /> <br /> SKIP THIS FILM. If you want to see more about John, watch his movies, watch the clips of Dan Akroyd talking about him or hope someone has a taste for making another film about John that goes along the lines of "Man on the Moon", which it is ultimately what we expected. I guess this was a "moral" film - you know, don't do drugs, but I guess the creators of this film didn't realize that his death caused a number of people (like Carrie Fisher) to stop making drugs entirely for that reason.
