Now this is a bad movie if I've ever seen one. In one of the greatest film years, in 1999, Detroit Rock City confronts Runaway Bride and Wild Wild West for the lowest point in a barrel of junkies. The plot is masterful. Four young high school students finally have the chance to see the KISS hard rock scene for the third consecutive year. So when their tickets are beaten by an ultra religious mother who smokes the chain, friends hurry to reach Detroit, and I'm sure you can understand the rest. <br /> <br /> Well, not exactly; the film takes extreme measures to explain how the four members of the band (no, not Gene, Paul, Ace and Peter) go and get these tickets: lose their virginity in a confessional; to save a smoked child and your mother's Volvo (from Soprano Steve Schirripa, nonetheless); prevent a robbery in the middle of a 12-year debt failure; and, of course, strip yourself to your essential for MC Ron Jeremy after pushing a full blender with bourbon leftovers. Sounds like fun, right? Maybe Detroit Rock City has a point with all these antics as sometimes these fans can go extreme. And we understand that this film is a comedy; it should be filled with slapstick. But Detroit Rock City points to the right audience? It is rated R, which means the only way prepubescent adolescents - the public as I see it, to which many will eventually classify this classic - will be voyeur through illegal terms. <br /> <br /> Even Detroit Rock City fails. in giving the touch of the late 70s. The texture quality of the camera is too light and too bright, lacking the necessary charm of films like This is Spinal Tap and Sid & Nancy. This would have allowed the public to feel "more comfortable" with the times. Simply decorating children with the grunge wear of the 90s and placing others in "disco infernos" doesn't do the trick. Environment means something you know; I doubt that Detroit seemed so fascinating in '78. If there is something positive that comes from this film it is the soundtrack of the rock of the late 70s and early 80s. Call it Van Halen, AC / DC, that's all. Of course we cannot forget the KISS, the band rightly subjected to everything. <br /> <br /> What the film fails to clearly manage are the questions about why the Knights of Satin's Service (it's just KISS) were so wicked about moms around the nation. Of course, the noisy rock and diabolical make-up could be part of it; encouraging young people to explore themselves and have fun could also be a good reason. But what is KISS saying in the music we hear during the film about this highly rebellious group? What separates these hymns of "rock [ing] and roll [ing] all night and parties every day" from the rest of the music? Most likely, these questions will remain in a musical communication class and not in the movies that should be answered, simply because it's KISS and rock and we have to do everything in our forgiven God power to see them. <br /> 1.5 star 5/5
