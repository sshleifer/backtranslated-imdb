This film was horrible and the only reason it was made was because the story attracted the extreme left. I consider myself a moderate, so I was able to see this film like the pile of garbage it was. Even if I'm not a fan of Bush, your dislike for GW is not enough reason to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> To start, the film was shot on a low-level film that comes out as cheap, rather than artistic. Furthermore, the characters are seriously lacking in depth. Chris Cooper's character was a poor parody of George Bush; more suitable for Saturday Night Live then a dramatic film. The rest of the characters are walking on clich√©s and are scarce facsimiles of other characters from much better movies. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs!
