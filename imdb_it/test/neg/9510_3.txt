The third stab at Shakespeare's transfer to the screen by Franco Zeffirelli ("The Taming of the Shrew", "Romeo and Juliet", "Jesus of Nazareth", "Othello") works very well, with the casting of Mel Gibson ("Mad Max, "" Lethal weapon "and the notoriety of" The Passion Of The Christ "in the role of Sir Laurence Olivier (and rightly, see my review on his" Hamlet ", probably the best interpretation of one of the timeless Bard's (and more quoted) tragedies) and rebuilt 5 years later by Kenneth Branagh as a full-blood treatment, explaining his execution time of 3 hours and 22 minutes, combined with a cast of dreams (and many small additions, which were well chosen and expertly performed from the contemporary master of William Shakespeare, Kenneth Branagh, the director of "Henry V" and "Dead Again." Joining the star of "Lethal Weapon" are Glenn Close ("The Big Chill"), Paul Scofield ("A Man For All Seasons "), Alan Bates, Ian Holm, Michael Maloney (who would be chosen as Ro I derive alongside Kenneth Branag and Laurence Fishburne in Oliver Parker's "Othello" (see my review of Olivier's "scenic" version of the tragedy, even though he only starred there) and that Branagh would cast Laertes in his version of 3 hours of "Hamlet" (a true tribute to Sir Laurence Olivier and his classic version of comedy; see my review also on that) 5 years later), Nathaniel Parker (who would be chosen as Cassio in his brother's version of "Othello" 4 years later) and Helena Bonham-Carter, who would be chosen for "Frankenstein by Mary Shelley" "4 years later. <br /> <br /> Zeffirelli intended this film as a tribute to Sir Laurence Olivier (who had died 2 years before this film) and works pretty well, for the most part. a bit uncomfortable was the fact that Zeffirelli made a mistake in many lines and in a scene, he gives one of the lines of Hamlet to the Phantom.In addition, Helena Bonham-Carter did NOT convince me as Ofelia.It was too boring and unreal, while Jean Simmons (who had immortalized the role in Olivier's version) and Kate Winslet (who did acceptable work in Kenneth Branagh's animated revisionist epic revision of "Hamlet") were good at the role, with Jean Simmons being the BEST Ophelia ever , that's why she was named Best Att rice in 1948 (did not win, what a shame). Ian Holm said his lines too quickly, not as slowly as I expected, in a scene with him, Laertes and Ophelia. But then again, I'm more used to the roles of Felix Aylmer and Richard Briers and I think they did better works than Holm in their respective versions of "Hamlet" (both made by great directors, actors, writers, producers, and protagonists of all their versions of the Bard's work as Polonius. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, however, was excellent. The scene in which Hamlet confronts his mother was done very well, but Olivier and Branagh intensified the scene to longer lengths to create an even greater emotional intensity and the suspense that the scene required. <br /> <br /> I recommend this version only to pass the time, but it is ideal as a teaching tool for 12th grade English teachers (I recommend showing Olivier's version first, then Branagh and finally this version). Despite the "PG" vote of the film, there was nothing questionable in the film. Just what the game required. <br /> <br /> The best versions of "Hamlet" are: <br /> <br /> # 1 Sir Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh. Both were so good that I can't decide which one was the best. See my reviews on these versions for more information. <br /> <br /> # 2 Franco Zeffirelli. This was fine. It all started well with a scene not present in the game, but should have progressed until the beginning of the drama, where a guard shouts "Who's there?" "No, answer me, stop and explain !!" That scene scares you to death because you're sitting quietly and then-bam !!, almost jumping out of your skin. In short, that scene sets the tone for the rest of the game. HUGE error by Zeffirelli to omit that scene. He also lost many lines (and he cut others that I think should be inserted), like the line in which Hamlet tells Ofelia "Keep in a convent, why would you want to be a breeder of sinners?"; that line must have occurred in THAT scene, NOT where it was included in the film (after the monologue "To Be Or Not To Be." This version struggles between cutting too much or too little from an excellent piece of literature. Kenneth Branagh would have remedied 5 years later with his full version of the tragedy, making his version a more appropriate tribute to Sir Laurence Olivier, as many of the actors (apart from him) had performed "Hamlet" on stage / or on the movie Many, however Zeffirelli's interpretation of "Hamlet" is faithful to the comedy and is what I was looking for. The setup for the duel of the final act was the same as that of the versions of Olivier and Branagh, only the ending in Branagh's version was more violent of the final of the two previous faithful versions (more in line with the game, Olivier attenuated everything ... and it worked very well) and he approached more closely to the comedy, with Branagh who launched some touches harmless of his ... to very good effect <br /> <br /> This version is not evaluated.
