... but I had to see how bad it would be. The plot was thin to begin with, but it kept getting worse. A female genetic engineering student uses her research on accelerated mitosis to artificially create a male, because a biological weapon used in World War I killed 97% of the world male population. The surviving men are either gigolos of high prices in alley clubs, or crazy lunatics in run-down football stadiums that plot to overthrow the "lesbian conspiracy". The whole process resembled the microwave of a large bowl of jelly. Press a few buttons and keep a small child. Not only that, but it will grow old until the mid-20s in a month, and then it will begin to age normally (how cheap it is). In the end, poor Adam is bored with the isolated cabin in the woods where his creator raised it and steals his car to 'see the city'. <br /> <br /> Start 90 minutes of unlikely chases, convenient twists, and several subplots that we never see solved. As Adam quickly learns, what men survived are treated as outcasts / criminals, because they are dangerous animals that cannot help the genetic predisposition to violence. The propaganda machines are in full swing, scaring women to believe that all men are rapists and murderers. This led to the fact that lesbianism is the norm, the fall of Christianity, exclusively female reproduction through cloning, and oh yes, peace in the world, among other implicit results. All this seems unlikely as only 30 years have passed since the war. Adam stumbles from one bad situation to the next, despite being genetically programmed to be non-violent and unable to do much on his own. With the FBI on its trail, mothers looking for fresh meat and its creator trying to win it back (it seems to itself), learns that violence is not limited to male species after all. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> I still liked the portrait of Veronica Cartwrights of the "love of hating her", director of the FBI, and Julie Bowen didn't hurt like Hope the wardrobe geneticist
