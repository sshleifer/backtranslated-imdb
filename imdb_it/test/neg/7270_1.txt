I officially vomited in my own mouth, thanks to this movie. <br /> <br /> I expected the absolute worst with this film, but I expected a worse absolute, moving and pleasant. This is simply terrible. Absolutely terrible. Terrible like the Nazis spreading the black plague. Let me explain: the Ewoks speak English. It's horrible. <br /> <br /> The bad girl seems to have traveled from the future Power Rangers set. I really want her to get up from the ground and say "Finally! After ten thousand years I'm free! It's time to conquer the Earth!" The mastics ... um, I mean the big bad guys, whatever their appearance ... they growl a lot. Many of them look like an even slower version of Cryptkeeper. The Cryptkeeper was nice, but these guys weren't. <br /> <br /> The only merit of this film was Paul Gleason. This film could have been better if he had gone to the bad guys and said "If I were to come back here, I got my skulls". It would have been even better if one of the Ewoks was played by Judd Nelson, who put his words in his mouth as he said it. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, that fast little creature is pretty tough. Let's talk about this. <br /> <br /> No word on the film, however. I want to give this movie a two. I want it so bad. There is a passage that I have memorized: the path of this film is besieged on all sides by the iniquities of terrifying and by the tyranny of spin-off horror. Blessed is nothing for the shots of this film.
