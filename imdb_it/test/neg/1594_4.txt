I've seen most of John Waters' films. With the exception of many of his very first ones that are not available, I've seen pretty much everyone, so it's obvious that I'm a big fan and it's certain that I have a great tolerance for the gross and irreverent in his films. While I was above and disgusting, I loved FEMALE TROUBLE and POLYESTER - two monumental tributes to bad taste and excess that are really fun movies. So I'm certainly not picky and can take most of what Waters has to offer. However, in FLAMINGOS ROSA created a film so repellent, so little fun and so offensive that I couldn't even stand it. In his other films that he made before becoming more mainstream, they were funny. Yet here, humor is not there as it seems the intent is to shock viewers and not entertain them in any way. I'm glad that after making this film, Waters' sense of humor has improved, since the faeces of divine devouring dogs (like in this film) are shocking but no less amusing. My advice is to skip this movie and pretend it never happened and then watch his infinitely better films of the 70s and 80s.
