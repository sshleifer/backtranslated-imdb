I just caught "The Rain People" on Turner Classic Movies late at night. The film was released in 1969. Shirley Knight plays Natalie, a Long Island housewife who - for unknown reasons - leaves her husband and embarks on a journey, not knowing exactly where she is going. Natalie is also recently pregnant, which complicates things. Along the way, he picks up a former football player "Jimmy" (James Caan), who was thrown out of his college and is hitchhiking. There are many twists and turns along the way between these two, while Natalie struggles to take care of Jimmy and she begins to realize that he is mentally limited and cannot take care of himself. He is facing his own struggles, needless to say, and is unable to take care of him. Sometimes Natalie seems to be a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown; makes some strange phone calls to her husband, who begs you to go home. Natalie tries to download Jimmy several times, just to get him back into his life through the circumstances. A young Robert Duvall plays a strange policeman who befriends Natalie. You always have the feeling that this movie will end badly, and it does. Sometimes the film is not uniform, and the script is rather lacking. Francis Ford Coppola directed this, and of course he would soon become immensely famous in the coming years to direct "The Godfather". The actors are good, needless to say, since they would all have a future ahead of them in the cinema. Shirley Knight is the least known of the three, although she is also underestimated as an actor. James Caan is particularly effective here and seems to inhabit this character. This film remains little more than a curiosity now, no doubt because it is a film from the early years of Coppola, and I confess I have never heard of it. So God bless Turner Classic Movies to bring it to a new audience.
