Well, it's a Monogram quickie from the dreaded 1940s when poverty studies put on a good number of "horror" films that are almost unsatisfactory ... So I was expecting the worst. <br /> <br /> The story concerns a doctor who has worked on a way to restore life to the dead through the use of a room full of non-utilitarian electrical devices that sparkled well. There is a dog's heart hanging from a bell and shaking in an agitated manner, which is informed is proof that its method is perfect. <br /> <br /> A brief discussion of the metaphysical implications and the mention of an important plot point precede the inevitable death of a young man who is resumed in a rather dramatic sequence - not dramatic even with sparks. The important point of the plot is that a convicted murderer is executed at midnight, which turns out to be exactly when the young man is brought back to life. Not surprisingly, the young man is very different after his experience; apparently amnesic and with a strange desire to visit the hangouts of the underworld and meet certain gangsters ... <br /> <br /> It is difficult to explain why all this is not completely unwatchable, but perhaps it is enough to say that it is slightly interesting and contains several murders and a couple of interesting characters. Towards the end he also begins to move with some real tension and a confrontation that is decidedly Hitchcockian. SPOILER <br /> <br /> I must warn of a bad ending. A tagged on useless, painful asses that end. After the plot resolves quite effectively ... <br /> <br /> You know the kind of thing ... It's all a dream. Never happened.
