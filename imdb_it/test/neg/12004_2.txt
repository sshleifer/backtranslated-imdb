As a children's movie it is fantastic. It sucks for the family. I was really hoping for something like the Goonies, which is a great movie for all ages. This film has been adapted too much to children with the silly script and characters who call each other small names like the booger breath. ??? Alan Cummings was still a pleasure. And because people compare Willy Wonka to this movie ... just because there's a theme song that is very reminiscent of Willy Wonka's song, it doesn't make this movie something like Willy Wonka.
