This could have been a good biographical film, but what a mess! I had this film when I was a theater director. When I edited the film and saw it, I thought I had some rollers out of order. As it turned out, I didn't, and if I did, nobody would notice. I could not understand what is happening! Everyone who came out more or less looked the same way!
