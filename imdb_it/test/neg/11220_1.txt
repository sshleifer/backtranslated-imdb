This movie is so ugly that they wouldn't buy it in my used CD / DVD store. I only own it because it came in a box that I bought for the masterpiece "Deadfall". The store bought back the other two films I was selling from the set of the four discs, but they wouldn't buy Underworld, and those other two films redefined the rank, so what do you think of this movie? So I tried selling it at another store, which also bought me budget DVDs that you could buy for a dollar at a local store, but they wouldn't even buy Underworld again. This film is bad at all levels, and is one of those that came out in the post-Tarantino-clone glory of the mid-90s. The only slightly redeemable item is Dennis Leary who tells Joe Montegna, who is a "stinky friend" and calls him "Mister Stinky Friend". That sentence is so deliciously horrible, that I can't help but mention it at least once a week when I describe a stinking friend. But now that I've enlightened you with that quote, you don't have to go through the pain of watching this movie.
