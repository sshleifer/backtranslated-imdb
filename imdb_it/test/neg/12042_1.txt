I thought this movie could be a good parody, or at least a good independent comedy like Friday. Instead it was more like something someone in high school would do with their parents' camcorders. It wasn't just the low budget that made this film negative (many great films were made on a limited budget), it's just a bad movie and it wasn't bad enough to be a good field. Case in point: nothing happens for the first ten minutes of the film, except that the 3 main characters sit in their room smoking drugs, make up and then answer a phone call. You keep waiting for something to move the story, but it never comes. The sound was so bad that I had to turn on the TV almost to understand what they were saying (which wasn't interesting anyway). If I pay to rent a movie, I usually suffer even when it's bad, but that was all I could do to sit for 20 minutes. It seems that the person before me felt the same way, because they didn't rewind the tape and left the same place I was. The only reason I gave this score of 1 is because the rating system has no negative numbers.
