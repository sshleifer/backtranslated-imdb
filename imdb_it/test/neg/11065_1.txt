There seems to have been some money behind this film, but it would be impossible to imagine a poorly planned and executed movie if I hadn't started watching it. <br /> <br /> To begin with, once we are in the cave with the characters (the usual stereotypes of young adults we have encountered in horror films since the early 1980s), the film is shot almost entirely in first floor. Since the actors wear helmet lights, this means that all we see are dazzling lights that alternate with total darkness: we never see what the characters see; so when they shout "Look there!" we remained to ask "What?! Where?!". Ultimately, the film has a stroboscopic and confusing effect, meaningless until we reach the end. <br /> <br /> And I'm not going to tell you what "the end" means - but you will recognize it if you've ever seen the old 60's laugh in the "Eegah!" with Richard Kiel. <br /> <br /> But what madman would ever like to make a variation on a theme like "Eegah!", long remembered as one of the worst movies ever made?! But this is what we have here, folks. Except that, unlike "Eegah!", "The Cavern" is not the idea of ​​anyone of funny goofy. It is unwatchable. (I ran it at x2 at normal speed, just to get it over with, hoping to be able to see something at the end of the film, but when I did it was just stupid.) However; since it cost only a couple of dollars, after extracting it from the DVD player, I was able to break it with my own hands - what a relief!
