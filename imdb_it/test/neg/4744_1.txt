Turd Pie: <br /> <br /> * Take the franchises x2 * Boil for 5 minutes * Mix the characters in mixed cardboard (the actors don't work better) * Add 2 tons of clich√©, then bake in the Microwave Plot-Hole until he gets bored. * Serve with a sprinkling of Dawson's Crack (not a typo) <br /> <br /> Voila! - Brain Rot brain rotation for the Emo / World of Warcraft generation <br /> <br /> Looking for the keys in the drain was the best (?) <br /> <br /> Apart from the first 5 minutes, its one of the worst movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Utter, Utter, Nonsense.
