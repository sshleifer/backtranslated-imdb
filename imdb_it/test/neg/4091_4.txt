I really enjoyed Bruce Almighty but the moment I found out that there would be a sequel WITHOUT Jim Carey, I knew it was bad. Although Steve Carell was hysterical in the first film (the stuttering scene is one of my favorites), and, in my opinion, he deserves an Emmy for his role in The Office, he's rather weak in this boring comedy. I'm curious to know how much work the writers have put in place, because we could have done without history. But even if we discard the huge potholes of the plot (because elephants and lions came to help Evan when the flood was only in that particular area of ​​Washington) the film is simply ... not funny. I didn't laugh once and as far as I remember, a comedy should make you laugh. Or at least giggle. Not this one. <br /> <br /> There is however a little hope. Evan Almighty has a "family" written everywhere and maybe a familiar view might be pleasant, (children could be entertained by the variety of animals and silly jokes), but, for me, Evan Almighty simply doesn't cut it. <br /> <br /> I give him a 4/10 and I hope Carell will be more careful when he chooses his roles in the function.
