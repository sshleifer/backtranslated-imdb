Blame Guy Ritchie. The success of Ritchie's Locke and Two Smoking Barrels in the late 1990s triggered a series of pitiful gangster movies that the genre never really recovered from. Sadly Rise of The Footsoldier - the true story of Essex, the chestnut of Carlton Leach - is unable to reverse this trend. Despite a fairly good starring interpretation of Hartnett, the film is the victim of all too well known East End stereotypes. Or they are busy blowing up somebody's brain or fucking a little dressed blonde. <br /> <br /> From a terrible football hooligan in the 1980s to a key figure in the criminal world of the 1990s, Footsoldier classifies Leach's rise through crime. Leaving the terraces for nightclubs, Leach becomes a bouncer in which he gave carte blanche to get rid of anyone. Here he comes into contact with the notorious gangland leaders Pat Tate (Fairbrass) and Tony Tucker (Stone), and begins to realize that group wars are not what is broken to be. <br /> <br /> Is there fun to be had he deconstructed the ridiculous point of view of a writer and director, Julian Gilbey, patois, as every sentence seems to start with a, 'I'm going to fuck' ?? or "are you fucking?" or, on occasion, 'So then I only did a' fuck '', typically concluded with a 'caaaant' mandatory 'The direction, moreover, smacks of sadism, especially the obvious joy that Gilbey derives from the shooting of violent scenes in foreground and, in the case of the bloody epilogue shotgun-to-the-face, in triplicate. <br /> <br /> Director Gilbey's use of the classic rise and fall gangster narrative is not what will condemn Footsoldier to the darkness of the big screen. Nor is the fact that halfway, the film annoyingly drives Leach away in favor of the events that culminate with the notorious shootings of Tate and Tucker. It's Gilbey's tantalizing appetite for the shooting violence that ruins the film; whether it's a brick in the face or an ax in the head during a brutal attack on a train, it's all unnecessarily prolonged. The Footsoldier doesn't punch you as much as it makes you feel raped and, above all, it robs you of two hours of your life that you won't come back ...
