* some possible spoilers * <br /> <br /> Of course this film could not live up to the original, rarely are the remakes. But this remake of one of Hitchcock's greatest films, Psycho, could have been much better. <br /> <br /> First of all, whoever launched the film must have been psychopathic. I mean, Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates! What are they thinking ?! Unlike the "harmless", almost childlike Bates that Anthony Perkins was able to interpret, Vaughn looks like he could be a murderer. In an attempt to make his Bates look innocent, Vaughn ends up acting gay. Even many of the other actors didn't seem to fit into their parts, including Julianne Moore who didn't seem to fit into the film. <br /> <br /> In addition to the atrocious casting, the cinematography is notably shabby, despite the fact that they have redone the scene of the film by scene. The only thing they added were random shots of objects like clouds or a naked woman, among the shots of the killed characters. In any case these shots seemed irrelevant to the plot, and in turn made no sense. <br /> <br /> Overall, this remake of Psycho, which could have been a decent image, turned out to be a complete waste of time.
