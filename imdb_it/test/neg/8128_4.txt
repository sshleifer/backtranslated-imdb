Sebastian Cabot is a rich fool who wants to buy all the land because there is oil, even though none of the locals know about the oil. With the help of an evil gunslinger in black, they kill and terrorize everyone. When the son of a murdered man arrives, he refuses to give up and resists these dark forces. <br /> <br /> Wow. As I watched TERROR IN A CITY OF Texas, I felt like I had seen this movie many times before and probably would have seen something like that. This is because, apart from some news (like Sterling Hayden using a harpoon on the bad), it has a plot that is too familiar. Once again, we have a rich boyfriend who is trying to drive out all the farmers to gain control of the whole earth. And to do so, he brought hired weapons to force people to sell them or kill them. I've been there, I've done it in too many movies. <br /> <br /> I love Sterling Hayden in the movies, but I couldn't recommend it as anything other than a poor passerby.
