I was really hoping for the best with this, but it didn't happen. Funded in a non-Dutch and still beautiful way, with a style and rhythm that looks a lot like Hollywood. What I don't understand is how - with all these great benefits - the director, the writer, the producer, however, managed to make this film an absolutely horrible image to watch. Full of bad jokes, economic nudity and actors who just can't speak [play] in English. Kudo is for doing it, but what was he thinking about that guy?
