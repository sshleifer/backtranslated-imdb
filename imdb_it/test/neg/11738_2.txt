This is one of the stupidest ideas for a movie. Remake a classic movie shot after another. I hope no one tries this technique again. In 1998, the director of "Good Will Hunting" Gus Van Sant tried reworking the classic "Psycho" by Hitchcock in 1960 and failed miserably. What was Van Sant thinking of? This remake doesn't even come close to completing the original. The few changes made here were not helpful. If you want to see "Psycho", the choice is obvious. See the original. <br /> <br /> * (out of four)
