I remember when "The Love Machine" was first released in theaters. I was only 13 years old, too young to see the film version very amused, but not too old to bring my mother's paperback of Jacqueline Susann's novel to school and study the "bad parts" with my schoolmates. br /> <br /> Although I'm not sure what my problem was at such a young age, but I was very involved in the book. I bought and wore an "ankh" ring just like on the pocket cover, and I remember the ads for the perfume, "Xanadu" which was promoted several times and presented awkwardly in the film. Despite this interest, I actually didn't see the film until several years later. I should have left things for what they were. <br /> <br /> "The Love Machine" is without doubt the worst of the many bad films adapted from Susann's novels ... which of course makes it the most fun to watch. His faults are many: from his writing in jumps that jumps in a way that is broken up from one accident to another without a connecting wire; his dated, horny (brass, I mean) musical score of surrogate Bacharach; flat and first impact executions; boring sexuality - I've never seen bathrobes in the spotlight in a movie. It's like a fetish! Whenever sex, nudity or something sleazy is required, someone shoots in a blue robe! Very strange, that; and certainly, the train circuses terrible fashions from the 70s that are on endless display. Poor Dyan Cannon's performance (which is not a big shake anyway, but heads towards the rest of the cast) is constantly undermined by the amazing performances he is called to wear. However, the main responsibility of the film is the stoic and ironic John Philip Law as (appropriately) Robin Stone, the object of the affection of every girl (and of another flamboyant male photographer). <br /> <br /> Law is simply horrible and behaves as if he were pulled off the street, delivered the pages of the script quickly and said to give a cold reading on the spot. Only without life! Not only that, but it seems in desperate need of a blood transfusion or something. He looks pale and sickly everywhere and is a little smaller than most of his costar women. Robin Stone should be a stem, not a handkerchief. <br /> <br /> For anyone who finds the film difficult (it's rather slow by today's standards), I beg you to stay for the "fight scene". Here Mrs. Cannon (who balances 23 kilos of teased hair) finally abandons her starchy acting style and lets out that contagious laugh of hers, setting in motion a truly memorable film for everything that should have become a highlight of the cinema. Trying to compete with the infamous "Valley of the Dolls" Wig-down-the-toilet scene, "The Love Machine" finally does something right. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Susann's exclusive garbage brand has really missed. Maybe someone out there owns the rights to "The Lovomaniacs" by Rona Barrett and will revive the genre.
