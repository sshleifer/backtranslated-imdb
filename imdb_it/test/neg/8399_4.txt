... now please go ahead because it's getting on my nerves. <br /> <br /> Seriously, the man behind brilliant pieces like "My Own Private Idaho" and "To Die For" (and other films not so brilliant, namely the useless remake "Psycho") has began an experimental phase with "Gerry", which reached its peak with the stimulant "Elephant". "Last Days" had some interesting aspects but it was very irregular, while "Paranoid Park", his new movie, also has good 15s around ... and not much else. Some fantastic references to Fellini (the soundtrack reuses some beautiful pieces by Nino Rota) and the elegant cinematography of the legendary Christopher Doyle ("In the Mood for Love") are the highlights, but the film is too artistic, farcical and lacking of significance for his destiny. We have had more successful stories and "Paranoid Park" brings nothing new. I see nothing artistic in seeing Gabe Nevins's excessive shots in his underwear or shower. Or when Nevins and 13-year-old Taylor Momsen (the girl from "How the Grinch stole Christmas"), who plays her cheerleader girlfriend, have sex for the first time, just because she felt they had to do it and after them she finished, he calls his friend to say how incredible it has been (and it can be said from Nevin's face how traumatic it was). Everyone knows they are starting earlier and earlier, nowadays, films like "Thirteen" and even "Elephant" (which shows how lost their thoughts in general, not just when it comes to sexuality) have made a better picture of it. Gus tries to be minimalist and artistic, but the end result is just boring and uninteresting. His next project, "Milk", a biographical film on Harvey Milk with Sean Penn, will hopefully bring back good old Gus, because, frankly, this obsession with underage kids is almost ... disturbing. 4.5 / 10.
