I saw this movie only recently, and I said to myself: "This movie is bad!" William Shatner is a great actor, but he is not a director! <br /> <br /> It's not just that acting is bad, it's terrible. And instead of a plot, we have a very ugly plot called plot! What I really thought was bad at the beginning was where Kirk and McCoy were teaching Spock to sing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat!" <br /> <br /> Do I have something against William Shatner? I do not. But when it comes to being a director, it sucks! This film is not one of the worst movies I've ever seen. But it's the worst in the Star Trek series! <br /> <br /> I noticed that after this Shatner did not return to direct another film in the series. Apparently they didn't want him to direct another film after it happened! <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie sucks! <br /> <br /> 2/10
