STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Old Detroit is back, with the giant Omni Consumer Corporation continuing to swallow everything in its path while the construction of the new Delta City continues and a new threat to be faced in the form of Cain, a cruel drug lord with delusions of similarity to Christ, who peddles on the streets a new deadly addiction called "nuke". As he continues to struggle with memories of his previous life that haunts him, the plated hero sets out to bring down this wicked man - only to end up being torn to pieces by scrap metal. With Robocop out of action, a ruthless OCP businesswoman proposes plans for her new android, a beastly and snarling beast of a car that needs an equally bad test to boost it, which Cain fits perfectly. After a brief error in his system, Robo returns to bring justice to the streets and settle the score with Cain. <br /> <br /> The original Robocop is a film that always manages to amaze you every time you look at it, no matter how many times you've seen it, one of those movies that can't be made again. That being said, it's no surprise that a sequel was made - it's even less surprising that that sequel is really pale compared to the original. Empire Strikes Back director Irvin Kirschner has made an unpleasant, slightly incoherent and too long film that fails to capture the magic of the first film, no matter how difficult it is. And it certainly is this, the funny advertisements of the first film that never stop, the corporate satire that aims to be more acute and the roaring action faster and more furious than before, but with blood / blood even more evil than the first film. The first film has earned a name for some violent and bloody violence (including the genitals of a man being blown up and a man being torn to pieces) but while that was more memorable the violence / blood on display here is more sadistic and gratuitous nature, with a very unpleasant and petty tone. <br /> <br /> But overall, the film leaves you with a feeling of general apathy - why are you looking at this when you could look at the original again? **
