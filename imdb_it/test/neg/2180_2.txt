This should be Charlie's masterpiece, but I will argue that it is actually one of his weakest films. First of all, it's not fun. Nothing in this film made me laugh. Okay, there's a quick jump in a box that was a laugh, but it was one of despair. The first - and only - Tramp talkie where he speaks (sings in a previous film), but his flat dialogue shows us exactly why he was so happy to watch in "Modern Times" and "Gold Rush" - two films that are at least ten times better than this movie. There is literally only one good scene in this film, one in which Hitler plays with the world like a beach ball. That's all. <br /> <br /> Ok, so get a lot of praise for being the first movie to make war, even long before we went to war. No. Not true. Simply not true, so that the praise can be lowered a little. The Three Stooges did it on January 19, 1940 with "You Natzy Spy" - ten months before the October release of Chaplin's film - and that movie was actually fun! If you want to see Chaplin's biggest film, look at this just for reference. And then pop in "Modern Times", "Gold Rush", "City Lights", "Limelight", "The Kid", or even "Tillie's Punctured Romance".
