There is something intriguing about disaster films. The simple and primitive premise can lead to many great stories. Of course, most catastrophic films tend to explore familiar territories, but I can usually live with them. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Flood probably marks the lowest point in the history of this subgenus. Robert Carlyle is undoubtedly the star of the film, even if the screen is divided between different places and characters. It gives a barely decent performance. Furthermore, Joanne Whalley is very irregular. Veteran actor Tom Courtenay (starred in Doctor Zhivago for heaven's sake) is particularly bad. I mean, his timing is completely out of most of the time and his characterization is extremely poor. What an embarrassing sight for that man. The rest of the cast varies from decent to bad, with one exception: Jessalyn Gilsig, who I thought could be there as a graphic / eye candy device, offers by far the most convincing performance. It doesn't mean much considering how bad everyone else is, but it's still nice to see that she cared. <br /> <br /> The script is really bad, confusing and clich√©. Some of the worst lines I have been listening to for some time are delivered by the actors one after the other. You've seen this story a thousand times. Use every dramatic puzzle you've seen in "Outbreak", "Armageddon", the Poseidon movies (original and remake) and many others. <br /> <br /> The management is terrible. No sense of time, nothing inspired. The shots are bland, dialogue and action fail to flow. Editing is wrong, but how does such a mess change? Without a doubt, this film has tried to rely too much on the (rather poor) CGI. The human factor, the drama and the struggles of the characters are ignored. The scenes in which the characters actually face the deluge are rare and poorly made. The sensation created for TV gives nausea. Should someone drop a rope from a helicopter? No problem, let's show it inside a helicopter and do a really poor assembly / cutting job and bring the next frame to safety on the ground, in the most obvious way possible. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the film is rather poor. All over, no timing. <br /> <br /> The ending is probably the worst I've seen in a long time. Very like they were running out of ideas. Discard that, you can't exhaust something if you've never had it in the first place. Must have run out of budget. <br /> <br /> This is a really amateur job. I give a 2 for the use of London as a location, which is a nice change, because Gilsig is actually decent in a key supporting role and for the few CGI shots that were decent (those of the water that closed in London and the gates). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and check out Day After Tomorrow or any disaster film before it. This includes older classics like The Towering Inferno.
