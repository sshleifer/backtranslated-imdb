This movie is just smelly. I know some people will say that anyone who thinks he is not "just doesn't understand". I like Wenders in American Friend and Wings of Desire. But this is a real disaster. The main character is so annoying that I don't care about what he does. He is, as has been said in another review that bounces like an annoying little monkey. I couldn't stand it or force myself to worry. This is the case of most characters who seem to be trying to be awkward or weird. I liked the character of Mel Gibson and the characters of Milla Jovovich and I wish they would have focused more on them. Milla is obviously beautiful, pitiful and you really feel for her and for what she was and why she is as she is. I see the character of Gibson as almost like Frankenstien. I only wish that he would have saved Milla and ruined the hotel with all the worthless boring characters that lived in it. Milla Classification 10 Film Rating 0
