Well, don't worry. This film looks so tired, the acting is so antiquated, and the plot and the characters so squalid, that it should be studied instead of watched. It is really a waste of horrible film; Stereotypes, clich√©s, nonsense and amateur film production. I looked at him with incredible admiration with his mouth wide open. How can you make a film like that and, more interestingly, how could someone find it funny or watchable? Old, tired, sloppy ... a little boyish scene, at best. There is nothing watchable there, except for a study of a very old film. Not good movie, just old. This is not Abbott and Costello or Laurel and Hardy. That does not make sense. The acting is so bad that maybe it is worth looking only for laughter. Some movies are so bad that they are good. But this continues all around the corner and back to bad again.
