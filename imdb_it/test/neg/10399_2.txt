I was surprised to find that Michael Moore or Bill Maher were not involved in this "movie". A list of lists of leftist American aces to be flattened, with a clear distortion of Democrats in Hell. Mao Zedong and Karl Marx did not make their appearance in Hell, but is Ronald Reagan in the same room with Hitler? Perhaps we will have to wait until these spin doctors from California will slaughter Paradiso to show them all their ideological political figures. <br /> <br /> Economic shots against religion, right-wing politicians, corporations and their lobbyists, Fox News, even SUVs. All the radical left-wing discussion points were too completely covered - while blatantly omitting the references to transgression on the other side of the nave - for not having been a conscious effort. The singular exception that I noticed, in the hour and a half, is that JFK must have sex with Marilyn Monroe for eternity: the symbolic inclusion in these propaganda pieces in a pathetic attempt to appear non-partisan.
