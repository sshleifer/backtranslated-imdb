This is a doozy. Dating from 1949, Scene of the Crime is often more like a Coen Bros. film set in the 1940s and shot in black and white, except that the writer's ear for pastiche is not so well tuned here - perhaps this can be seen instead as the forerunner of an Oscar from schlock like Road to Perdition. Frankly, it is a wonder that this film is not considered a classic by film professors and film critics around the world, considering how much it offers in terms of overly articulate mannerist thrills cloaked in false meaning (just like the grandfather of all these "fake" films, Citizen Kane, or anything else from Murnau.) <br /> <br /> MGM is usually a studio that can't be wrong in my eyes, and I think any story, atmosphere, even "gritty realism" can only draw from it benefit from the grotesque aestheticist. You could say that I am a disciple of the Minnelli school. But it takes a certain light touch to write a robust boyish dialect of Dashiell Hammett's stripe, a willingness, perhaps, to let one or two scenes pass without a line like "Watch out, Mr. Wiggly, or you'll be thirteen." fish to fry and no small worm to catch it with. "I did most of this -" Mr. Wiggly, "unfortunately, I made the cut - but believe me, the dialogue is only inflated and inflated by non-sequitudics. Even the cop's wife played by Arlene Dahl talks as if she had a moon-shaped scar under one eye and the Christian name Rocco: As Van Johnson spins his badge with the phrase, "I am sick to death and murder", you will wonder why the writer's fixation with decorated literary devices - in this case, zeugma - could never have been wrongly interpreted as "street". <br /> <br /> For those who have passed the series The Naked Gun, this is the funniest movie of cops and thieves.
