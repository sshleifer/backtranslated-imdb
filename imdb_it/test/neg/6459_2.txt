I was recommended this movie by one of my film friends, so I was expecting something good. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the first half - ah, a film about a whining that takes its boss out of a ** hole, how original - and I looked at the second part fast forward hoping to find something that could justify the 45 - A few minutes I had already wasted. But all I got was the final 'shock' ... <br /> <br /> The basic problem is that this is a film that seems unable to decide what it means and says what it says (difficult to say what it is) bad. The acting doesn't save a bad script full of characters that I don't care about. <br /> <br /> Now perhaps if I had not made the moonlight in the film industry I would have been shocked to discover the stupid politics and exploitation by going behind the screen, but as they are my feelings are summarized above: ' Ho Hum '. <br /> <br /> 2/10 ... would have been 1/10 if it hadn't been for the acting and paper-cutting scene.
