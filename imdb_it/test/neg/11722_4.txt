I saw this movie for a reason: the slogan is "Upset the head ?? and you are dead!" Cracking. Not surprisingly, this stupid horror comedy runs out before the tape is out of the box, but it creates some laughter from its premises and its cast of characters: a human eagle-eyed radar, a huge strong man and a big The chest sexual magnet is controlled by a huge head on a chair, which is not happy for his family being blackmailed by a murderous criminal. It looks like a promising mixture of ham and cheese before it becomes clear that the characters are a marvel and the plot is quite ordinary if you, erm, ignore the giant head.
