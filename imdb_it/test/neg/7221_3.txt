Spoilers !! <br /> <br /> I hate this, but it's better than the others after this, they keep getting worse. I hope Gibson has the intelligence to stay out of the next one. Very much the same with humor, that is, the bathroom, the children, etc. The further we can look at their relationship evolving. Drugs, bad boys, why South Africa! I discovered that it is incredible, perhaps South American, that a country in the Golden Triangle would have improved the script. It seems that in the late 80s of the early 90s there were blond villains, like Die Hard, the powerful Ducks who played Ice Land Gary Busey in the last weapon, etc. Hollywood repeats itself. This with a similar story must go beyond the lines. The attack on the police, the beach condo scene, and the fight at the end, and the way Gibson's girl killed by the copper attack was too many. Like many parts 2, they get worse and 3 or 4 in this series increase downhill speed. 3/10
