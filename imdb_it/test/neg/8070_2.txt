Roller Skating Vampires?! I'm sorry, but even in the 80s it's too trivial to be remotely scary ... You can excuse the original moment of kitsch as it parodied old movies and TV shows, but it was done once, so the following was necessary be a little less camp, no more bizarre! In addition, the first film had Chris Sarandon in attendance - a man who could even make casual stalking nightclubs seductive! - that this is definitely missing, so there was no "danger" in everything that happened, it just seemed stupid. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I only saw him once when I was 7, but by then I was already a huge fan of the original memory of being disgusted. For me, there is no sequel to Fright Night, just a nasty parody that deserves no evaluation whatsoever.
