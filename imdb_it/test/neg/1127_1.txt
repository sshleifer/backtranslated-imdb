To quote Clark Griswold (on the original Christmas holiday): "WORST? How could things get worse? Take a look here, Ellen. We're on the threshold of hell." Little Chevy Chase knows he was describing the "sequel" of one of his best films. Christmas Vacation II sets a new high (or maybe should be LOW) in bad movies. My wife bought this DVD thinking it would be a sequel to the original, but we were deeply disappointed. This film is LAME. It bears no resemblance to the original, it is an absolute waste of films and embarrassment for otherwise good actors who have had the misfortune to be part of it. He must have set a record on IMDb for the most negative reviews. I really think we have a good case for winning a class action lawsuit to recover the money consumers wasted on this movie.
