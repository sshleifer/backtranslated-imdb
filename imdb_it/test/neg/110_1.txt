I just finished watching this movie and I'm disappointed to say that I didn't like it a bit. It's so slow slow and uninteresting. This little boy from Harry Potter plays a shy teenager with a rude mother, and one day the rude mother tells the boy to find a job so he can accommodate an old man who apparently has no place to live he started living with his family and so the child goes to work for an old lady. And this old lady who is living alone teaches him girls, drives the car and life! I couldn't understand how an 18-year-old boy enjoys spending time with an awful 80-year-old lady. Sorry if my comments on this film bothered people who might have appreciated it, I could be wrong because I'm not British and maybe I don't understand the social and family structure and the way of life. Mostly the film is made for the British public.
