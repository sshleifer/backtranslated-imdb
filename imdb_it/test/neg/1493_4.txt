I was very disappointed with this series. It had a lot of fantastic graphics and that's it. The level of detail was minimal, and I always had the feeling that the audience was frequented - there was a lot of what seemed to me "This is extremely interesting but we won't explain it in further detail because you won't understand it anyway. some good photos to entertain you. "The host would abandon interesting-sounding words like" sparticelle "and" super-symmetry "without any attempt to explain what it was. We had to look for it on Wikipedia. <br /> <br /> Also, I know a lot of superstrings (for a layman) and found that their explanations were twisted and could have been much better. They could have chosen MUCH better examples to explain concepts, but instead, the examples they used were confused and further obscured the topic. <br /> <br /> Also, I felt so bad about repetitiveness. They could easily have condensed the series into an episode if they had cut off the whole repetition. They must have shown the Quantum Café clips about 8 times. The host kept repeating the same things over and over again. I can't remember how many times he said "The universe is made of small vibrant strings". It is as if they were trying to brainwash us by simply accepting that "superstrings are the best thing after sliced ​​bread". <br /> <br /> Finally, the show ended with an unpleasant sense of "competition" between Fermilab and CERN, clearly biased towards Fermilab. This should be an educational program on quantum physics, not the fact that the United States is better than Europe or vice versa! I also felt that he was part of the condescending: "The public needs to see some conflict to remain interested". Please. Give me a little more credit. <br /> <br /> In general, 2 inches down :-(
