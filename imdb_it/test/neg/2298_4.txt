You know, I really have a problem with movie lists. I was reading Maxim magazine a while ago and they had a list of the 50 greatest B-Movies of all time, and, knowing me, of course I have to go and see all of them and write reviews on all of them. This is why you see reviews of films like Gator Bait and Barb Wire and Coffy on my list. So I noticed H.O.T.S. at the video store the other day and I recognized it from Maxim's list of the 50 best B-movies, and I decided to rent it and take a look. My only consolation is that I rented it because I recognized it from a list of B-movies, so I already knew it would be a suck. <br /> <br /> Given the type of film that it is, I can't say that H.O.T.S. it is a total failure, since it is nothing but a T & A movie of the 70s, and never pretends to be anything else. The only place he strays far from his goal is in a jagged subplot involving a couple of former inmates who have hidden a lot of stolen money in that house, the so-called H.O.T.S. enter, because this subplot has absolutely no place in the film. Although the rest of the film is also, this subplot is completely superfluous and useless. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a couple of rival brotherhoods of the beloved FU, which exists as one of those universities that contains a grand total of a sisterhood until the discards are formed to return to the snob of the other. This new sisterhood, Help Out The Seals (HOTS), is a sorority that is supposedly based on helping seals (the seal subplot is another one that doesn't really belong to the film, and little attention is paid to the meaning of that name besides having a seal that runs here and there throughout the film). <br /> <br /> This will seem strange, but in reality there was a scene of which I was very impressed in this film. One shot that struck me, I'd say. In the middle of the film, one of Pi's girls, the rival sisterhood, pours alcohol into the punch, and pours it a little by herself into a glass and drinks it. Strangely, what he does while drinking that alcohol reminds me of something that Charlie Chaplin would have done, which really lit up the film. Obviously, nothing in this film comes close to anything Chaplin has ever done, but that shot alone has raised my score for the film from 2 to 4. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, the film that's exactly what you'd expect it to be, a lot of people going around looking for excuses to take their clothes off (I liked how in the end the removable piece of clothing for the football game was one of the GIRLS ideas in the end. Riiiiiiiiight ??), and not much is thought of in many other things. There is, for example, a scene at the beginning of the film when a pair of Pi girls pour hot sauce in the refreshments of an H.O.T.S. party, accidentally trapped in an incriminating photograph (the girl who took the photo did not notice that he photographed them at that time), even if the photo never appears for any reason later in the film. <br /> <br /> I've seen movies like this before, it's a bit like Gator Bait but without the violence and the rednecks and Coffy wasn't far away. Even the Barb Wire is more or less the same, only with a bigger budget and more silicon. Fortunately, Maxim's 50 B-movie list contains only a few comedies, because while these teenage T&A movies are fun from time to time like ugly movies with the occasional semi-nude scene, having seen H.O.T.S. I think I decided that I like bad horror movies better than bad comedies. I'd rather watch a lot of terrible actors pretend to be scared than pretend to be funny.
