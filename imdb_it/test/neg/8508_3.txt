First of all, I'm a big fan of Tolkien, and as a base I will base most of my critics on his books. <br /> <br /> The film is a standard adventure film, well crafted with elegant special effects, pleasant track sound and acting. Now if this film was called something other than the lord of the rings, the reviews would not be as good as they are here. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is that it takes the Tolkiens baseline books but then it goes and "hollywood" all it can, numerous scenes from the book are missing or changed by another, the characters are also changed from the book, something I think should be punishable! What the film lacks is a deep understanding of the characters, I know it's almost impossible to make a good movie out of a good book, and it didn't work here, and mostly the characters' motivation is best confused. <br /> <br /> As an adventure film it will evaluate 7+ / 10 As an adaptation by Tolkien, evaluates 2/10 <br /> <br /> I mean honestly, what the heck was Arwen doing for making the game? And as for the comments that this film "is the best ever" I can only say that you are very young, or you have not seen good films ... <br /> <br /> Peter Jackson should have called this movie film adventure based on the lord of the rings.
