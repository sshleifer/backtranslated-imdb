I understand the drawing and I appeal to such a different kind of film and I am a great admirer of films with a little dialogue, but at the same time this is absolutely terrible. I was in the Scottish highlands and found the lack of Scottish accents in the disappointing characters. This plot was pretty strong in theory, but the cheap sets and the lack of a single realistic character kept this movie from taking off. I feel that the use of silence to create an atmosphere works only when you have actors who can exude a sort of presence without speaking and these actors certainly can't give up. If you want a silent film that captures that test presence (Le Dernier Combat). There were very few films that I couldn't even finish and this was one of them. Absolute dribbling!
