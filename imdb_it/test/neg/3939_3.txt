Seriously, if you want to see a clich√© horror movie, you have to see this, I think. It contains all the "scary parts where nothing happens", "the nerd type who is not actually killed", "boy and girl who unite and survive", "face an old child-fear" etc. . I wanted to see this movie because I was thinking about a video game mix and a movie would work. Guess I'm wrong. What makes the film more bearable? It's only 1 hour and 17 minutes, so if you're bored it might be a good idea, even if I prefer to stay bored. Why absolutely do not see it? Frankie Munitz aka Malcolm is just as irritating as the nerd guy. I could slap the boy and he is so sad that he didn't die before and he even came back in the end. See something else!
