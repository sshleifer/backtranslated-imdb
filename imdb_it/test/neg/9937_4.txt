The first thing you should know about "Zipperface" is that it was shot on video, so it has that peculiar aspect of "home-video-ish" that is terribly distracted and makes it hard to take it seriously as a "real" movie. And "Zipperface" really looks like a group of amateurs gathering for an attempt at a "real" serial-killer thriller. It's not quite like that, but it's not as bad as it seems. Having a woman as one of the two detectives on the case gives a twist to the genre of exploitation. Dona Adams gives a captivating amateur performance in the role - her obvious inexperience in front of the camera somehow works for her. Also, she puts a big fight against the killer in the end. The red herring looks ridiculous in the beginning, but in the end it works - I guessed the murderer incorrectly. And you wonder if perhaps Tarantino had seen the character of Zipperface when he got the idea of ​​"The Gimp" for "Pulp Fiction". (* 1/2)
