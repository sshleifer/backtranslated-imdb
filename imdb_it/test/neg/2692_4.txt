Last week I saw a production of the Royal Shakespeare Company of Macbeth. He was 25, filmed without props except swords, no furniture except chairs. It was RIVETING. The acting was super - all the actors trained the English. Contrast to that performance for this yawn yawn yawn. Al Pacino, like Shylock, was tragic, heavy, and he couldn't lose the New York accent, despite the long .... pauses .... between the lines .... The whole thing was soporific also the "comic" scenes were hardly worth a smile, a solitary laugh. This should be fun. They tried to make it tragic. It was neither boring. I give him four points for costumes, set design and Jeremy Irons, who is good at playing a boring, depressed, deep voice (can it be anything else ??)
