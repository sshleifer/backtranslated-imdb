I remember having a vacation in Florida when this movie was broadcast. I had set up my video recorder to record it. The wait was killing me. I had heard about the film since it was announced about six months ago. We returned from Florida 4 days after the film was aired, and I immediately looked at it. I tried the maximum possible, but I didn't. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of HUGE 3. And as such I know enough about them. So it wasn't like I expected to learn something from the movie, and I didn't. I was more interested in portraits and saw how accurate their information was. There were many things wrong with this film. The actors, the script, the re-enactments, ALL could have been much better. <br /> <br /> Paul Ben-Victor is an extraordinarily talented actor. But let's face it, Moe Howard was WAY out of his reach. He doesn't look like him, he doesn't sound like him, and therefore, he can't behave like him. Even Michael Chiklis is very talented, but his portrait of Curly didn't score enough with me, although when Curly fell ill he did very well. The portrait of Shemp by John Kassir could have been better proved. It was more of a bad impression than a portrait. The worst of all was Joe Besser. They made him lean, and more annoying than he really was. It was simply laziness. I don't like Joe's shorts, because, as the film illustrates, he has NEVER ever been impressed. But it wasn't that annoying, and it wasn't really that thin. The best performance belongs to Evan Handler. He had the most accurate puppet portrait. The problem with Larry's character, his hair is too frizzy WAYS and WAYS too red. I know it's too technical, so I didn't count it on my list of why I didn't like this movie. <br /> <br /> Go back to Shemp, which by chance is my favorite puppet. It is written like a whining, trembling chicken. Sure, he had a lot of phobias, but it wasn't so bad. He didn't leave the group initially because he was afraid of Ted Healy, although he didn't like it, Shemp left because he received an offer from another studio that he simply couldn't refuse. Instead of the truth, this film chooses to make him bed-wetting, on Larry no less, running into a closet and shamefully abandoning the group. Another problem is that Shemp has made nearly as many Columbia short films as Curly did as a puppet, but only one, Fright Night, which was his first short film, is shown. His career has been almost completely ignored. Furthermore, the bad editing caused a terrible and unforgivable mistake. Hemp was born in the first months of 1895 and died at the end of 1955. Would this make him grow old at death? Well, here's a suggestion, it's not like the movie claims. <br /> <br /> Now for writing, which I think was flawed just because this film was rushed. Some lines are stupid and could be developed and / or introduced much better than them. The only joke that really struck me was right at the end of the film, when Moe is showing the promoter how eyepoke is made. <br /> <br /> "That's how we do it, we make contact with the bone of the forehead, not the eyes, but it seems true on the film." It is meant to be one of those lines that make the public say OH! With amazement and I'm sure he did it with some people, but the end of the film was not the right place for this line. A better place than you ask? How about when they show up at Columbia for the first time and are introduced to the sound effects machine. I know that initially there was no sound for eyepoke, but for example Moe could have said, "And this?" and eyepokes Curly or Larry. Jules White then says "Are you okay?" or "How did you do it?" There were many misplaced lines in this film which is a clear sign that the script was downloaded. Another concerns the origin of the name Shemp, even if it is not so bad, and therefore I will let you make a slide. <br /> <br /> What does this film do well? Illustrates how the henchmen were cheated by Columbia, who they were. I'm not sure Moe was a messenger, but that was the kind of dramatization material that aims to make the viewer understand about them. I know this film was a dramatization. I know that not everything will be clear and clean and absolutely perfect. However some of the things they invented and the real things they ignored were in serious conflict with each other. For example, Curly's stroke is not even close to the way it happened in real life. I know, I know, dramatization, but the purpose of dramatizations is to make real events more dramatic. Curly's stroke in real life is more dramatic than what they showed in the film. Here's what really happened. Curly was sitting in a chair off the screen while a scene was being shot, calling him for the final scene of the pie fight, but there was no answer. Moe went to fetch him and uncovered the head of his slumped brother, half paralyzed, unable to speak and the tears running down his face. Moe then said "Babe?" and I tried to help him get out of his chair. Poor hedgehog falls to his knees. Then the ambulance was called. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film wasn't terrible, but it certainly wasn't good, or even OK. This film portrays the stooges in a helpless and imprecise manner and sometimes exaggerates with dramatizations. There is a long list of inaccuracies in this film. If you don't believe me, take a look at a sprite named Stooge's list on the threestooges.com news forum. It's about a page and a half long. Some things in the film I can let slide. But the others were unforgivable. The Three Stooges were geniuses, and much of today's comedy is based on what they did. You do not believe me? Watch the Simpsons, and even more Ren & Stimpy. But this film fails to capture their genius. Even more unacceptably captures their difficulties, which is important, but if the title of the film is Three Stooges, it will have to represent their naivety and originality more than anything else.
