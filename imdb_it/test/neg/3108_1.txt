Crazy director .... Yes, you must be crazy to make a film nearby. Rob Lowe was bad in his character, Ice-t is always bad and Burt Reynolds had nothing to do in the movie. Crazy Six is ​​an unknown film, with some known actors ... this is rather strange. A bad movie with some good actors. It looks like the bad movie influenced their performance ... He did it! Crazy people ..... I give it * and a half of *****
