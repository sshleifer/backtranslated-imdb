We have already seen a story like this: a wife in marital difficulty (played by Nastassja Kinski) engages in sex with a stranger (William Baldwin) and then wants to return to her life with husband and girl. When he returns home, he discovers that her husband has finally found a job. Everything looks bright. However, Kinski discovers that her husband's new boss is actually the stranger who still shows interest in her and seems to do anything to get what he wants. What to do? Say nothing? <br /> <br /> I didn't really like the movie. While it was not only bad, clearly "that something" was missing. Maybe he should have focused more on what was happening in Kinski's head. Nothing to say about the actors themselves (I imagine Baldwin was a good choice for the role of the haunted boss) but the characters seemed somewhat stereotyped, behaving in the way you would see the characters acting in your everyday TV movies. Finally, the ending completely ruined what could have been an interesting plot. <br /> <br /> In my opinion the film has tried to look cool, it has had some wobbly little machine here and there, some stills, shortcuts and glamor, but in the end I think it adapts much better to the productions of spelling. The same goes for music. Otherwise it didn't seem so bad. <br /> <br /> Some might like it, but it certainly wasn't my cup of tea. To be honest, I don't usually watch this kind of thriller very much. This seemed too long, even though it was only an hour and a half, I think it could have worked better as a one-hour episode on some TV series. There was absolutely no need for some scenes, especially the shower scene. <br /> <br /> My advice: Try before you buy!
