I understand that Roger Corman loves doing things cheaply, but this is just sad. I purchased this film from the dollar basket in my local video store not a month after seeing the original Carnosaur. I was amazed; It was the same damn movie, with only a few of the Corbin Bernesens! It reminded me of all those ninja movies from the 80s that wore old Kung Fu movies and put a bunch of white ninjas running around making cardboard wheels with the word "ninja" written on their circles (if you didn't see them, give look at "Ninja" Terminator "," The Thundering Ninja "," Black Dragon "and" Ninja Warriors ". Thanks Roger Corman; you made me lose a dollar.
