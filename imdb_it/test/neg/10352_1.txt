The best thing I can say about the American version is that Jane Turner and Gina Reilly have to rake in the money for this shit. Yes, the American rip-off was shown for about two episodes in Australia, but did not evaluate; probably from curious spectators who wondered how bad it would be. Answer: DEPLORABLE, a complete waste of time. The actors are relatively unknown and do not readily take the nuances of the script written in Australia. Bad luck for them since they are condemned to fall with this turkey. My advice to US viewers is NOT. <br /> <br /> Americans should be better informed to find DVDs of the ORIGINAL VERSION on eBay, but be aware that some DVDs are in a "zone format" different from those issued in the USA. Otherwise, some DVD players will work on disks from / to all zones.
