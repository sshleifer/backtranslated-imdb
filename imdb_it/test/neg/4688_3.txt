For the uninitiated, almost all of Andy Milligan's films are shocking, but despite having seen many of his films, this continues to take the cake out of sheer sloppiness. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Milligan's take on the Sweeney Todd fable, made with period costumes (but not necessarily vintage haircuts, in some cases) and the usual machine that induces headaches and quality grainy. As for the blood, well, the version I saw may have been cut, because there isn't much for a "bloodthirsty" movie in the title. The best indication of subversive films here is a meat pie made up of only a poor victim. <br /> <br /> So, as I continue to treasure this piece of work on my video shelf, it's definitely a bit of a disappointment with regards to content though. Recommended only for the adventurous and morbidly curious. 3 out of 10.
