As one who loves films that attract intellectual sorties and those who simply tell stories, this film should have been attractive. But as written and directed by Catherine Breillat who seems to interpret his riddles in cinematic experiences, this boring and talking film fails to arouse interest. <br /> <br /> The main character Jeanne (Anne Parillaud) is the screen form of Breillat, a director frustrated in his attempts to film a convincing sex scene with two difficult actors (Gr√©goire Colin is The Actor and Roxane Mesquida is the actress). The only "comic" element is that of Jeanne who requires the use of a dildo tied to the actress to make the sex scene work, but even this gag view is consumed quickly and there remains a film within a film which feels more like a 'Deleted Scenes' featurette on a DVD of a solid French comedy with class.
