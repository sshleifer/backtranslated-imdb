Jane Eyre with full frontal nudity! I wasn't surprised to see that a woman had had a hand in this terrible "picture of a woman" and I mean that in the worst possible way. The problem is that it could have been so beautiful if they had left out the Jane Eyre stuff and blocked the much more interesting scenes involving Spanish / Portuguese Jews in 19th century London. When the soundtrack is better than the movie, you know you're in trouble. When you fast forward the video because you can't stand the movie, just to make sure you don't miss anything, you're in even worse trouble. This film will end on the romantic TV channel in which it rightly belongs.
