I can't believe I actually sat in this whole movie. A friend rented it because the jacket made it look good. In his defense, the jacket was correct; there was an alleged haunted room that someone slept overnight. From the jacket, it looked like he was on par with Freddy, Jason, or maybe "The Shining". It could not be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of minimalist and / or surreal movies, you can have fun. If you are looking for a scary movie, or a few chills, go rent Jason vs. Freddy IV: you will have a much better night.
