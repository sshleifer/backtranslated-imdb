This movie smells more like limburger cheese! If you find this in a garage sale, leave it there! I love Sandra Bullock and yet I hate THIS FILM ... Although I am ashamed, I own a copy, and the studio changed the cover to play on the fact that Sandra Bullock is in this. They play it to be "A Sandra Bullock movie". He has only a small part in the whole film and does his best, but he is young and has not yet learned his talent. Well, everyone has to start somewhere ...
