I like the B movies. I think Bruce Campbell is a very watchable actor. I love how he offers his lines. 'Evil Dead 2 and' Army of Darkness' were great movies. I liked "Running Time". However, I don't know if I'll ever watch this movie again ... and I bought it. Now, after saying so, I bet that the traces of comments and special features will be worth watching! This movie has too many holes to really enjoy, even as a cheapo movie. First of all, Ted Raimi was annoying, just flat out annoying. There was nothing for his badly recited / written character that hasn't been done better a thousand times before. The director was sadly sub par and the choice of some shots ... yikes. I don't expect Woody Allen or James Cameron here, but Campbell didn't deliver. <br /> <br /> I didn't buy it thinking it would be an Oscar movie like "Annie Hall", but I'm still disappointed. I would have been happy with "Mallrats" or "The Rhino Brothers". I got a lot less. At the end of the film there were no scenes that jumped out at me, no dialogue resonating inside me. Even 'Hostel' had a classic line for the sake of petals! I don't recommend this movie.
