1) Bad acting. <br /> <br /> 2) For a group of shipwrecked people on an alien planet, it certainly looked like home, especially with the houses and streets that can be seen in the background. <br /> <br /> 3) A terrifying story with stupid characters who make idiotic decisions and cheerfully lose precious survival gear and left-to-right clothes in the middle and right. <br /> <br /> 4) Cool scifi suits from the 70s (maybe the only good thing about this movie) <br /> <br /> 5) Interesting ship at the beginning (this crew must have watched a lot Space 1999). Too bad it explodes so soon. Even the escape ship sank too fast. * sigh * <br /> <br /> 6) Anthropologists may find some aspects of the film interesting in terms of group behavior of primates.
