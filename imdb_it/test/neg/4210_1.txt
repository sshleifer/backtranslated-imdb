Save some of the early Norris, "Breaker, Breaker" has nothing to offer that cannot be found ten times better on any transmission channel. A pathetic attempt to make films, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Nevertheless, I looked at it, touching the fast forward button, because the acting was so terrible that it was comical. Of course, the film should be an action movie, but it turned out to be a treatise on how NOT to make a film. All that could be wrong with the film is on the screen in this "dog". If you happen to cross it, take a look. It's so ugly, it's fun.
