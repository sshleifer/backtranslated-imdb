Decent but overrated dramatic thriller, the film attempts to portray inner demons spiraling out of control of a tormented artist. The problem is that a single report shown on the screen is not credible and the plausibility seems to have been thrown out the window. The title character is so difficult to relate to making it quite impossible to imagine any of the characters on the screen emotionally invested in him. The conclusion is also quite predictable; there are certainly enough clues provided by the go-go to indicate exactly where the story is headed. By choosing to completely suspend their belief in situations or relationships, the film itself is well interpreted (especially by the protagonists) and manages to create a certain tension while the plot unfolds. As a metaphorical element there is some food for thought, and if the script had been stronger, here there is certainly a potential that could have been exploited to the fullest.
