I disagree with Dante portraying the Democrats' zombie supporters as creatures with an average IQ of 23. I think their behavior should reflect a lower IQ than that, something in the order of a Pelosi IQ ... A figure one-digit, please. <br /> <br /> The MOH series is quite irregular, and this is the worst episode. Dante, yet another liberal disrespectful of Hollywood (or an apolitical nerd who sucks at the building on the left to rekindle his pitiful career?), Must have finally realized that his activities as a director had been blocked for almost two decades. now, therefore, this left-wing cruel and indignant "satire" of the Bush administration, the Republicans and capitalism has come up. Perhaps he felt he had not been openly political before. It would not be exactly the first non-talent to use Asinine political propaganda to promote his career when all else fails. The creator of turds such as "Piranha", "The Howling" and "Matinee", Dante was a useful contribution to the horror genre as Adolf Hitler had been for world peace. <br /> <br /> TH uses humor with the lowest common denominator, cheap and predictable gags that even the bluest members of the unions would have no difficulty understanding. Or have you ever seen an intelligent, subtle, intelligent liberal satire? The populist manure has the lowest of all messages, so the language and the ways in which this message is communicated must be as simple and basic as the name of Sean Penn. And what better people to send this message to the sheep eating popcorn than a couple of losers from Tinseltown sniffing cocaine that fell so low as to be forced to write for TV ... <br /> <br /> I do not want political propaganda, either left or right, in any type of film. But to put him in horror - of all kinds - is a testament to the infinite stupidity that reigns so supreme among the anti-intelligentsia of Hollywood. Dap was so insignificant that he hadn't even noticed the hilarious suggestion that the zombies would vote democratic ... (This is what you get to finish a film school: not a source of wisdom or useful knowledge from any effort of the 'imagination).
