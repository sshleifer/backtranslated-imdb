A big disappointment for what was advertised as an incredible film. Incredibly bad. Very pretentious. It would be nice if only once could someone create a high profile role for a young woman who was not a prostitute. <br /> <br /> Actually we do not learn anything about this character, except that he seems a hopeless alcoholic. We don't know why. Nicholas Cage behaves as usual in an excellent manner, but I feel that this role and this script have disappointed him. And how, after not being able to perform throughout the film, can he get an erection on his deathbed? Really terrible and I felt like I needed a bathroom.
