How many versions of the 1984 English student have to endure America? "Damn, this is a great book, but a little downer, I know, I'll write one just like the one where everything works ok, I'll also replace Orwell's old political insights of the thirties with my insightful and informed opinions of the years '70 Think, think, political intuition ... Bad politicians, I'm a genius! And there will be clones who make themselves for some diabolical reason ... I'll work on it. It'll work. "No, he won't, Bob Sullivan, writer of this story. This is really all your fault. You could have stopped them first and said: "Guys, with our budget and my acting skills, I was thinking of a more romantic comedy, or we could move away from the form by taking ourselves so seriously and take a walk around this kind of tired movie and familiar ". Did you do it even if bob? No, you didn't, and you had 28 years to think about it. <br /> <br /> I don't mean to be so spiteful. I'm sorry I yelled at you Bob. Obviously you had to live with this mistake much longer than I have. Some blame should go to Ron Smith, who helped you adapt the script. He could have stopped you at any time. You were young and naive and took advantage of it. Now he fights the plots for video games and you, Bob, well, who knows what you do. I'm sorry if it sounds harsh Bob, but it's true. You were sold upstream by Hollywood hotshots. As if Ron was not enough, even Michael Bay saw your movie, and without even asking for rights or anything, he added some explosions to your concept and turned it into "The Island". I think it's the most disgusting part of everything, that with a bit of eye candy, your script could easily be good enough for a big Hollywood production, that I would have hated as much as this movie and I didn't mind for you at all. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry that things work this way for you. Ron and Michael walked on you, leaving you a wizened shell of a man, which is the height of the film that writes that greatness will be a joke on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Don't focus on this, even though Bob, because Karma works in mysterious ways, and one day they will pay for what they did to poor little Bob Sullivan.
