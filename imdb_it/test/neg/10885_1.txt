The only positive thing about this film is that I now have a film on the worst list ever. Rest Stop being at the end of the spectrum where I can compare all the terrible movies to. Really, this movie is the worst plot, the worst live, in the whole movie all I wanted to do is pull out my hair and kick the writer and whoever fucked this movie. I'm a deployed soldier and when I spend my precious dead times watching movies like this. These people had to feel terrible, they had to watch it before it came out, and they had to be crazy to be lazy to do again, after noticing that it sucked. I am so amazed that this great country of ours is doing them another. Honestly, this is the first time I've ever commented on a movie, I've had to let the world know, don't waste their time. Eliminate this film from the face of this planet. It makes us delay humans.
