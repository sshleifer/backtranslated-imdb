I would give this movie a zero if I could. How anyone could value it higher is beyond me. Until I saw Rollerball, this was my choice for the worst movie ever from a large studio with a real budget (claiming Mangler 2 or Leprechaun in the Hood as the worst ever is not saying much, those should be bad ) /> <br /> Tim Curry's mother must have needed surgery or something for him to accept this senseless garbage. I'm not really sure what happened here. The novel was great, director Frank Marshall had a solid track record with Alive and Arachnophobia (maybe they should have changed the title to "Africa"), the cast was good and the budget was there. You'd think someone would bother reading the script. <br /> <br /> You'd better watch Battlefield: Earth again than waste your time with. The Congo makes you want the return of MST3K
