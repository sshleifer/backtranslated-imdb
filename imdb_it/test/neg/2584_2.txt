This is clearly a French film. It is a young group of idealists / revolutionaries / anarchists. It moves very slowly. Long grips. Close-ups. A minute or more devoted to an attempt to illuminate a pipe full of hash / opium. A long reflection on how a group turns a car upside down and burns it. It is a black and white film. The subtitles were white, so about a third of the time they were illegible. (Why do they do it?) I left after about an hour and three quarters when it became clear that this photo was going nowhere, slowly. I wasn't the first to go out. It was the first time I came out of a photo in my long life. (Well, maybe the second one.)
