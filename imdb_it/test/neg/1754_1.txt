Another boring nuisance of Anthony Minghella, who seems to thrive on these gigantic super-productions that take more than two and a half hours to do what any reasonable director would do in about ninety minutes. <br /> <br /> The history centers on Inman (a sleepwalker Jude Law), who leaves for the Civil War and has just started a kind of love story with Nicole Kidman, a Preacher's Daughter who recently arrived in pretty town of photographed portraits. The story goes back and forth between the trials and tribulations of Inman in the war (which is, guess what boys and girls? HELL !!) and Kidman's trials and tribulations at home (which are, very predictably, incredibly boring). Renee Zellwegger appears on Kidman's farm to help Kidman get him back in shape after Kidman's holy father dies of an uncomfortable illness. Zellwegger behaves in a gritty and domineering manner in that of Granny Clampett, dispensing enough Tough Love and Homespun Wisdom to turn the stomach of even the most difficult observer of Touched By An Angel. <br /> <br /> This film is, quite simply, atrocious. Avoid it as the great exaggerated nonsense of Bogus Pretentious Literate Adaptation that is.
