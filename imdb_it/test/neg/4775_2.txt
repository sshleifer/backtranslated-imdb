I was really disappointed with this movie. I had heard good reviews and unfortunately I missed seeing it in theaters. As a result, I was really excited to see it when it came to DVDs. I thought it would be a high-paced horror movie with many scary surprises but instead it was a predictable snail-like movie. Dragged and dragged without a climax and after all the difficulties that those people went through trying to escape, the ending was completely frustrating. I gave this movie two stars for a reason. This is not the typical horror movie with a bad central guy killing a group of people to death. History makes this film unique and offers a change for people who watch many horror movies. Although I don't like this movie, I recommend all horror fans to see it at least once. Maybe you'll like it surprisingly. As for this horror fan, all I can say is that I hope there isn't a sequel to this forgettable movie.
