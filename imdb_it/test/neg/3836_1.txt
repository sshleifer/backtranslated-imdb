The worst movie I've ever seen. I still don't understand what Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen intend to do. Maybe they had bills to pay ... The best part of worship happens during a flashback that takes us during the Second World War when a Nazi officer hides his Jewish wife. This is the beginning of a typical serial killer life! It seems to be headed during the early 80s, but then it looks like a new Beattle ... Incredible! This film was directed in 2001 ... I'm sure it took less than two weeks to make that movie. I heard that Dennis Hopper's wife filed for divorce after seeing that picture and Michael Madsen's mother had a heart attack when the actor admitted to being the man under the yellow baseball cap. Pathetic!
