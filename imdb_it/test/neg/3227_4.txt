Savage Steve Holland wrote and directed his second film, One Crazy Summer, with John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong back in a secondary role. Cusack and Bobcat Goldthwait are new graduates headed to Cape Cod to stay at Goldthwait's grandmother for the summer. Along the way, they meet Demi Moore chased by John Matuszak and a band of motorcyclists. Soon the three are united in an attempt to save a house from being turned into another lobster restaurant by a conniving and flawed family that considers a bad word "work". The film contains several funny cartoons such as the dollar millionaire competition gag and the Godzilla script. <br /> <br /> Like the first Dutch film, Better Off Dead, John Cusack immeasurably adds to the film. Otherwise, this is a real disaster of a film full of invented situations and idiotic characters (as opposed to eccentrics). Moore also sings some bars in a nightclub with some horrible synthesizers. Goldthwait's gags fade after a while, and Armstrong has never been an actor of any caliber to appear in anything other than first-rate stuff. The tow truck twins are extremely annoying and obnoxious instead of the captivating outsiders who are obviously meant to be. This is more of a success or a kitchen comedy that could have used a better script and direction. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
