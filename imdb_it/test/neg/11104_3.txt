It's all my fault. They told me I had to avoid seeing this movie because I'm a big fan of old TV series. They were right. While the production values ​​are good and the actors themselves (including "don't look now") Julie Christie are not so bad, the whole movie shows a cheeky and self-conscious which is clearly without any justification. I am reminded of a comparison between Karloff's "mummy" and "The Mummy Returns 2000". In fact, Belphegore 2000 owes much more to the new Mummy films than to the old series. But then, the scripting is terrible, there is no speed and sometimes the film is full of unintentional jokes (the first scene in the tomb seems simply stupid), with the cats clearly thrown when they are supposed to jump (landing first with the their back feet)). Belphegore moves like a statue on wheels neither impressive nor frightening and the psychological drama that developed in the old television series when the heroine had to learn that he is a villain is completely overlooked. This film is so wasted (wasted money, wasted actors, wasted project) that it hurts. It is a submission of the mummy below, which is good only for a few laughs, but has nothing to do with the Greek classic (It also has a small role in this film - in the cemetery).
