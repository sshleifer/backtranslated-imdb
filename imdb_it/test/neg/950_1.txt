I saw this movie a while ago and couldn't wait. My biggest problem was having seen the trailer that I was expecting a very elegant marshals movie with a lot of action and maybe some plot to think about along the way. I was very disappointed as it would seem that once you see the trailer there is nothing else worth looking at (if what you expect is as described above). My girlfriend at the time gave up halfway and while I kept looking in the hope that something interesting might happen ... nothing happened. I found no attachment or real interest in any of the characters. I would just say don't worry if you don't have some time in your life that you don't really care about losing.
