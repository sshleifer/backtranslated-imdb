Critters 3 part on the open road while Clifford (John Calvin), his teenage daughter Annie (Aimee Brooks) and his young son Johnny (the IMDb list two actors Christian & Josephh Cousins, maybe identical twins?) Are coming home from a holiday. Suddenly the tire on their van blows and they have to stop in a public parking area to repair it. While there Annie and Johnny meet a boy named Josh (Leonardo DiCaprio, yes that) who in turn comes across Charlie McFadden (co-film producer Don Keith Opper) of the previous two Critter films. Charlie tells them the story of the Critters and the city of Grovers Bend, but they don't believe him. Meanwhile at the van a Critter lays some eggs on the lower part, far from everyone's sight. Once Clifford repaired the tire, the trio left for their home, an urban apartment block in Los Angeles somewhere with lots of Critter eggs for the trip. Upon arrival the eggs hatch and the Critters head straight into the building quickly arranging Frank (Geoffrey Blake), the caretaker. As the night draws in the few remaining residents, a fat woman named Rosalie (Diana Bellamy), a telephone repair woman Marsha (Katherine Cortez), an elderly couple Mr. (Bill Zuckert) and Mrs. Menges (Frances Bay) must come together with Clifford and his sons to fight the Critters. Josh also makes an appearance while his stepfather (William Dennis Hunt) is the owner of the building. But will the group be able to defeat the Critters and prevent themselves from dining? <br /> <br /> Directed Kristine Peterson I thought that Critters 3 was an incredibly indistinct film, but at least she can say that she made a film staring at Leonardo DiCaprio and not many people can say it! The budget for Critters 3 probably wasn't exactly a fortune since the entire production seems cheap, there are very few characters, very few Critters and I think that only 3 appear in the same shot at once and get rid of any kind of angle of space so there are no expensive spaceships or special effects on the distant alien planet to pay. David J. Schow's screenplay is strictly by numbers and very predictable. A group of humans is stuck in an isolated situation with Critters and has no means of contacting the outside world for help, that plot scenario seems very familiar, right? Well it is the same as the previous Critters (1986) & Critters 2: The Main Course (1988) and many other horror films, so it should. Critters 3 does nothing with the premise, it never tries to add anything to a plot that is already old, tired and well used. Critters 3 is also very domesticated for a horror movie with only two people killed, comical elements are seriously lacking and with the best joke Critters 3 can be a Critter who eats some beans and then farts, very funny if your 5 Years . The characters are mostly clichés of standard horror movies and have quickly become annoying. There is practically no blood or blood in Critters 3, only a few spurts of blood and disappointingly Critters 3 in fact seems to come out of it in order not to show any violence. The special effects on the Critters are OK but they still look like static and simplistic puppets that have very few movements. The acting is not so beautiful and Critters 3 seems to be the first feature film by a certain Leonardo DiCaprio, to be honest with the boy everything is fine and I wonder if any of the other actors or crew had an idea of ​​what it will become. Why the hell does he want that Charlie guy to keep popping up in these Critter movies? To give Critters 3 a little credit moves at a good pace and is not boring, it is generally well done with fairly good production values ​​and is a bit harmless if you are in the right kind of mood and fortunately only lasts for 80 odd minutes. Overall Critters 3 is a waste of time OK, but don't expect anything profound or meaningful. There is nothing really wrong with this economic horror movie, but I couldn't help but think I saw it before. An average waste of time that is not as good as that of the previous two Critter films. Critters 3 ends with 'being continued ...' as this was shot from behind with Critters 4 (1991) which, of course, went straight to the video, probably to save even more money. Critters 3 is a decent enough way to waste 80 odd minutes if you can watch it on T.V. for free otherwise don't worry.
