I'm a real sucker for those Ghost Hunter shows. From Cheesy's mockumentaries as Discovery Channel "The Haunting" to Scooby Doo Reality looks like "Ghost Hunters". When I saw the "Paranormal State" promos of A & E I knew I was going to see. Especially when "Paranormal State" was juxtaposed against a weak Monday Night Football game. <br /> <br /> By the end of the "Paranormal State" pilot when the main "character" in this macabre reality dance gives a Creepy Kid a bottle of Max Von Sydow Holy Water and reassures him by telling this guy that he had a bad experience unspecified as a child with things that "came out of the closet" and the Church (catholic) gave him a Holy Water to reject the things that come out of the closet I knew I should have given another shot on Monday Night Football. <br /> <br /> The shtick behind "Paranormal State" is a group of Penn State students who got together and started their Ghost Hunting Club. Or company. Or Super Adventure Club. And they run around Pennsylvania in search of the most terrible ghosts and the lost plot of a M. Night Shymalan film. <br /> <br /> The "They" are a misnomer. The truly paranormal state revolves around a lion named Ryan Buell who will probably run Penn State's annual annual convention if it were not for this show. It is often accompanied by co-ed hot "inquiries" and other people seen in the credits, but rarely captured by the camera. Hey, are they ghosts too? <br /> <br /> This is Ryan Buell's show. Paranormal State is his "vehicle" as we like to say in Biz. And, oh, what a boring ride in a vehicle can be. <br /> <br /> Did I mention Ryan who tells the whole episode of Paranormal State in a starless voice with "director's voice"? Almost immediately this becomes annoying because the obvious intention is to give the ghost of Ryan the hunt of a certain gravity, but its filtered monotone does nothing but provoke grunts and laughter. Seriously, any serious intonation seems to be the chatter of a Call of Duty video game. <br /> <br /> The "investigations" - the plot on which each episode revolves around - are interesting on the surface. There are no inns or restaurants infested in "Paranormal State". This is a show about fearing the unknown as a good Catholic boy and for God they give you something to fear. <br /> <br /> Small children are harassed, things loom over darkness, voices encourage the living to kill, and the Aleister Crowely in me rubs my hands. Of the two episodes I watched, each one revolved around violent and evil ghosts linked to violent and evil deaths. <br /> <br /> Maybe. <br /> <br /> Maybe not. <br /> <br /> Everything in "Paranormal State" is reduced to half an hour, blocks "Dog the Bounty - er, Ghost Hunter". Whenever there is an interesting and verifiable amount of evidence - the murder of a family in a farmhouse in the 1800s - the demonstration is waved in front of the viewer like a crook trying to convince you of a stack of cards currently under the your nose is the demonstration of those ten million coming from Nigeria and then tearing it off before you can have a good look. <br /> <br /> At least with the Sci-Fi Channel's "Ghost Hunters" there is a somewhat excessive need to trace every possible bit of evidence and present it to the viewer. EVPs that could be a mouse buzz, cold spots in a house full of drafts and "spheres" that even Ghost Hunters themselves consider to be dust. It's a sort of Scooby Doo approach that makes "Ghost Hunters" ... almost believable. <br /> <br /> Considering that "Paranormal State" claims to have EVP but gives the viewer a ten-second video clip of a wave file in Garage Band with no sound. Yes, see, an EVP, right? People are claiming to see dark figures in the basement ... Well, we'll go and see about it ... as we leave the night vision camera on a fascinating stationary shot of the living room. Ryan, the intrepid leader of this Penn State Graduates pack, is claiming to see "visions" of the name of a demon he knows and could be involved in a disturbing paranormal ... But he can't tell us, the public, or the his team of students out of goth, because ... He can't. You never say the name of a demon out loud, Ryan informs the big-eyed co-ed who dare to investigate. <br /> <br /> Well, how convenient it is for you. Especially since this is a TV show where the audience can't read your mind. <br /> <br /> "Paranormal State" is all Turn and no Prestige. The public is told what's going on, but you never see an ounce of proof that the creepy kid is seeing Dead People. Not even the grainy video of a moving chair, or a black blob running between the prison cells. Anything. You have just been told what happened to Ryan in another mechanical voice. <br /> <br /> If you're going to try to scare me, dress it up a little. If you're trying to influence me, show me a globe or blob and let the fat chick who works for days on Hot Topic tell me why that black sphere really is the spirit of a murderer. And if you want me to witness a ghost hunting show, give me something besides trotting Lorraine Warren from the second episode. <br /> <br /> "Paranormal State" is weak sauce. It's not really worth looking at if you're not hard on TV time, or you simply have that slim DVD collection. Or if you don't want to know what really happened in that closet with Acqua Santa.
