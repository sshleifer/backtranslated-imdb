I was pretty disappointed. The first Tetsuo made me a fan of INSTANTY Tsukamoto, from the first 5 minutes of the film. It was fresh, innovative and just ... different. I really like having a movie on my face and pushing all the "suck" buttons. Tetsuo did just that, for me, a few films can. <br /> <br /> For those of us who like to take a breath of fresh air, those who appreciate those unusual used styles that make indie films so useful, Testuo II will probably be a disagreement. If you're looking for that "HYPER-KINETIC" gut feeling of the first movie, skip this one, since everything was taken away. Tetsuo II is for some strange reason, just a typical Hollywood-style action movie. I was pretty confused. However, in my opinion it is still worthwhile for any keen Tsukamoto fan.
