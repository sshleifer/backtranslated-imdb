This is one of the most pathetic, predictable and misinterpreted movies I've ever seen. Clint Eastwood has never been worse, I've never seen anyone less convincing on the screen. I was laughing at him all the way. Then there is this love story between him and the beautiful Rene Russo, who was even more pathetic than that between Mr. Connery and Ms.Zeta-Jones in Entrapment. <br /> <br /> A IMDb user asked the question: What do you dislike about this movie? I'm asking: what would you like? And the answer is: John Malkovich. He is an absolute genius and probably the best villain ever (he even saved Con Air, you know). But it is so. <br /> <br /> This film is called In the line of fire, but 'Bodyguard 2: the rip-off' seems to be a more appropriate title. Look only if you are a huge fan of John Malkovich. Otherwise, avoid at all costs. * 1/2 (out of five)
