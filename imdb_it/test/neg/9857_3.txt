Kasparov vs Deep Blue is undoubtedly a fascinating story, but I don't think you would know by watching this movie. I think it focuses too much on the conspiracy theory that IBM has cheated ... and what does this theory depend on? The idea that at some point the computer made a move that "looked human". I'm not a chess master or a computer scientist. And while I don't doubt the move seemed human, to me it doesn't seem beyond the realm of possibilities that the most powerful chess computer ever created could make a surprising move ... or that such a machine could beat even a genius like Kasparov. The film takes too much distance from this theory, and not enough from the personalities of the people involved ... it could have made the story much more interesting. The direction is also based too much on the concept of a uselessly whispered narrative, and on the imagery of an eighteenth-century chess machine that resembles one of those animatronic gypsies seen at the carnival. The story was also slowed by many empty shots by Kasparov who revisited "the crime scene". I don't doubt that Kasparov and the chess community found IBM's behavior annoying, but I don't think it's different from what you would find in any other big company. At the end of the film, you get the feeling that Kasparov is a huge whiner and that Deep Blue programmers are victims or cheaters. I think that if the director wanted the viewer to believe in the conspiracy theory (which he almost certainly did), he would have to present a lot more evidence. In fact, more tests would have been a good idea in the first place. Everything left a sour taste in my mouth.
