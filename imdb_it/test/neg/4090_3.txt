This film was a failure like a comedy and a film in general. It was a very slow film that seemed to want to convey a message, but the message was a clich√©, a hopeless disaster to begin with. This film falls on a shameless view of the environment, even making a hypocritical point to destroy an SUV and promote Animal Planet. <br /> <br /> In sitting in front of this, I couldn't help but notice that Steve Carell has not achieved a single really funny line. The only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the painful attempt to give comic relief lines to Wanda Sykes. His character fills with jokes, where they don't fit at all. <br /> <br /> Far from the splendor of Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty blasts his entire record budget on special effects devices that turn out to be just advancing the plot. The film spends the first time until the construction of Evan's ark, but in the end we learn that the ark was completely meaningless, and the whole plot was just a ship for stupid gags and even the most stupid messages. The film ends when we learn that the entire ark, flood and gathering of animals was only a weak political affirmation of none other than God. Yes, God was trying to influence politics.
