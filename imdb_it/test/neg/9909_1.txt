It contains the Major Spoilers, in the remote possibility that you would really care about the plot. <br /> <br /> OK, we have storms that destroy a city and a hacker who clubs the power grid. <br /> <br /> Predictable Schlock from the start, and if that wasn't enough, the 5 action shots between the film and the commercials kill the little suspense that could have been there. For example: will they arrive at the airport on time? Things look bleak as we go to an advertisement and the action taken before the announcement shows they bounce inside the plane! Well, I guess they will, after all? but then again, because they had to be good guys. <br /> <br /> The acting was not too impressive (exception and welcome relief: Randy Quaid in the role of Tornado Tommy), the effects were a bit boring, the bad guys understood it, and the good guys came . The real disaster of this film was the script, in particular the ending. Not only did they wrap things around happily as a soap opera gave 24 hours notice of a cancellation, but they also glorified the hacker intentionally. So he caused a death of billions of dollars ... he meant well. And, of course, a final edifying TV report on the people you meet. Barf. It was all I expected from the commercials and I'm glad I wasted time looking at it. He'll have a great conversation at the table tomorrow. <br /> <br /> Is CBS insulting us by making this? Sure ?? but we watched it, didn't we? Have you counted many announcements that there were for home backup generators during this pig? <br /> <br /> Here is hoping for the next Plan 9 from Outer Space (which improves with each display). This is not it. <br /> <br /> 1 star.
