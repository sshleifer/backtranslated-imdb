After putting a mummy in a local museum it goes through the cat scan, a metal object in its brain reacts negatively to the procedure, thus freeing the spirit, or ghost if you want, of the mummy, Belphegor. Due to convenient circumstances, Lisa, who lives near the museum, finds herself possessed by the evil spirit. In a short time he is stealing the museum's Egyptian treasures from under their nose. Detective Verlac leaves the pension to capture the supernatural thief. <br /> <br /> This is quite useful if you have never seen other incarnations of "Belph√©gor". If you have it, I advise you to skip this particular version as it cannot help but become paler than the others, despite the friendly locals and landscapes. It plays like a science fiction movie (slightly higher), and I don't really mean this as a compliment. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sophie Marceau shows ass and side tits <br /> <br /> My Grade: C- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: none
