I have humm - - - More than nothing. If you are a longtime Rush fan, you know what this video contains: disgusting songs from the past, the "BIG 3" hits of the 80s and their "last desperation" effort to remain contemporary. They manage to make fun of themselves by hitting critics with their fists, portraying themselves as "dinosaurs". Unfortunately, they FAIL to protect themselves from embarrassment. Close-ups of their faces only add to the fact that these guys HAVE BEEN. <br /> <br /> If you followed (as much as you can bear) the band for a couple of decades since the 1970s, then you know there is no new material here. The same old, the same OLD: 1) Neil avoids the press, 2) no real behind the scenes (Geddy loses his SHOES? Give me a break! Even HE thinks it's absurd!) 3) no new intuition. <Br /> <br /> A better video would have been to show the setting CREW for 3 or 4 hours ?? let the camera work. And stop changing the camera angle every 2 seconds! I understand that the director wants to try to do something artistic. But then you offer a complete version of the concert of 2 or 3 shots that the VIEWER can choose. Do we know what the band is like? Let's see what we REALLY wish to see. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a BIG favor: rent this movie first.
