I checked carefully if there's another movie called like this, and it's not there! But I really don't think we've all seen the same movie! There's no way ! How can you rate more than "1" for this movie?! The idea for this film is that it is acceptable. Oh, and the acting of Dan Gordon (Chris) is pretty good. But those are the only two acceptable things in this project. The others are ... horrible? It's a very delicate word to describe the acting of the other actors, the direction, the "special" effects (so called), even the way the crew was shooting! I don't even like the way the camera operators moved to record the scenes! This could be the most miserable movie I've ever seen. I really don't remember a movie lower than this ... Maybe it's there, but ... I don't think ... Ehh, what's done, it's done ... This is the movie and it's too late for anyone to change something. I voted "1", but my realistic vote starts with a "-" (minus) in front ....
