I can't understand it, the planet's fanatics are talking about this as a must see, they even dare to call it an (s) exploitation because the possessed girl is seducing the priests and is always masturbating. Do not make me laugh. I saw the film, seduction is only at the end of the film and I don't call it seductive, it's just a bad language that is talking. And even masturbation is a big laugh, trying to seduce his father while masturbating, let me be clear, with his clothes on perverts out there. It's not bloody or bloody at all, everyone is throwing up on Beyond The Door, well, let me tell you, that's better for me than this movie. Only in the last 5 minutes the possessed is vomiting and has strange eyes. If I had known that this is so bad, I would never have taken a copy. If you really don't want to see an (s) exploitation on the exorcism look at Angel Above, The Devil Below or other cheesy. this is a time.
