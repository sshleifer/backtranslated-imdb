My mother and I rented this gem a few years ago while visiting Thanksgiving here. I rarely laughed so hard. This is a typical low-budget horror movie with stupid special effects, worse plot and even worse acting. But are you really expecting a classic when Linnea Quigley gets the best billing? I did not think. <br /> <br /> As this film has some entertainment value, I give it a 3 out of 10.
