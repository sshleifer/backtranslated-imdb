I happened to see a promo for this movie on the Spike channel last night, it was grouped with a replica of another Patrick movie that I did and I thought Swazy was in this sequel ..... boy was I wrong. .. I see the writer also acted, and I think the budget was a bit tight. I'm surprised to see Will Patton in the film that has much better credits with his name to play in a "c" movie like this. Bussey jr was trying so hard to portray the image of his father (one of the best bad boy actors ever) that he failed miserably the only rescued qualities in the film were the girls ,,,,, beautiful and with a lot of T & A just isn't worth the time or your hard-earned dollar to rent it
