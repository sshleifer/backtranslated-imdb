Yes, of course, this is a Friday 13th rip-off, but I have no problem. It's a nice attempt, the killings aren't so bloody, but a girl's acting brings the movie, as the scream queen, Jennifer Ritchkoff. For a low budget movie the effects are well done, okay, sometimes you can guess how it's done. Some people have problems with using the camera, I can't see what's wrong with that. It's so strange that so many people don't like this movie, I really liked it. Obviously the script is not original but it gives me one that is, I mean, so many woodcutters are made in the woods. maybe it's all predictable, but it's worth seeing, I've seen a lot more hurt, I can tell you
