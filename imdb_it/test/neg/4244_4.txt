In the 1950s and the 1960s, and even in the 1980s, a large number of war films were produced in the former Yugoslavia, glorifying the heroism of the "partisans" ?? civilians who fought a guerrilla war against the invading German forces. Hajrudin Krvavac, who is generally known only in Eastern Europe, has directed some of these "partisan" stories; unfortunately, only a handful of them have ever been exported to the rest of Europe and the United States. "Battle of the Eagles" is a rare, low budget, look at the formation and exploits of the Partisan Air Force. <br /> <br /> Marshal Tito decrees that a Partisan Air Force must be formed to fight the German Luftwaffe in the skies over Yugoslavia. A group of former pilots join forces with two small biplanes and begin to raid enemy bases and convoys; over several months, more pilots and planes join the ranks, eventually forming a formidable air force. Maybe it's history, or maybe it's a fairy tale? whatever it is, it's certainly not convincing, but a cast of great actors definitely tries to make it work. <br /> <br /> The film opens strongly with a well-traveled German air raid on defenseless partisans. The pieces of the plot come together almost immediately, and for a short time the audience is treated to a series of rather patriotic scenes. So the action starts and this title quickly becomes another low-budget adventure, by numbers. All the characters are familiar clich√©s: Major Dragan (played by well-intentioned Bekim Fehmiu) is our typical patriotic and heroic protagonist. He hurls machine guns with a machine gun and even has an aerial duel with the evil Klauberg (Radko Polic), a complete and predictable climax with an equally predictable result. The rest of the partisans are familiar: Ljubisa Samardzic ("The Battle of Neretva") is a Zare, a playboy hotshot; Bata Zivojinovic ("Hell River") is Voss, a veteran who comes out of the carpentry shop now that his country needs him; and Rados Bajic ("The day that made the world tremble") is Dalibor, a young messenger who moves among the ranks, eventually becoming an expert combat pilot. The characters and their stories are familiar to all fans of the war and Krvavac does not try to rely on these stereotypes. The cast does a good job and, despite the two-dimensional script, each player is engaging and fun to watch. Bajic, in particular, has some good moments ?? when he takes his first flight as a gunner, and later, when he is forced to land a plane after the pilot has been killed. The plot simply consists of a series of air strikes against the Germans and subsequent retaliatory actions. <br /> <br /> Krvavac handles action sequences competently with a mix of real-world footage and miniature effects. Unfortunately, miniatures are so cheap and fake that transitions between real aerial photography and toy planes are puzzling and laughable. Some of the bombing and bombing scenes seem really surprising, while dog-fights with scale models, complete with action figure pilots, are simply pathetic. Sometimes the fumes of the "machine guns" are so great that the smoke envelops the entire plane of the model. Worse yet, editors often overlap fighter blows on real footage. Although the planes are usually in the right perspective, they are surrounded by a distracting light that hinders any attempt at realism. All this action is set to an incredibly familiar and annoying Bojan Adamic score. <br /> <br /> Also "Battle of the Eagles" suffers from a very badly modified English version. To begin with, 28 minutes of video are missing ?? cut the film from 130 minutes to just 102. The missing segments have been carelessly cut, and the cut looks very sloppy. The musical signals are interrupted abruptly and the scenes are abandoned before being resolved. In the last third of the film, the story falls apart and only some absolutely necessary action scenes can try to save it from total incomprehensibility. So, is there dubbing ?? all the scenes that revolve around the Partisans are dubbed in English (however rather scarce, however), but several long scenes remain in German, without the benefit of the subtitles. The film could have made a lot more sense if the sequences in German language had been excised instead of crucial scenes shot around the partisans. <br /> <br /> The upside is that Krvavac handles outdoor shots quite well. There is never a moment when the audience feels like in a sound stage. In particular, the German bases of the Luftwaffe are expansive, complete with dozens of Messerschmitt fighter planes and extras in costumes with leather jackets. The scenery is fresh and green and Krvavac is not afraid to shoot scenes with extremely wide angles or from a distance simply to convey the purpose of a battle or a long journey. A German ambush of a partisan unit at the beginning of the picture stands out, as well as a sequence in which Zare and Dalibor escape from an enemy base. <br /> <br /> As it exists in home video, "Battle of the Eagles" is just another of the many stories about the Yugoslav partisan movement. There is nothing that sets it apart from the rest of the crop, and the terrible special effects and drastic editing make it a notch below acceptable. Try to avoid it, unless you find a full copy.
