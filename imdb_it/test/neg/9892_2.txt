I should have realized that any set of two videos sold for only $ 6 would be negative. I even read the reviews before watching this movie, and that hasn't influenced me yet. I loved the book and knew it couldn't be as bad as people said. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is. <br /> <br /> A mosaic of films, videos and what appears to be a repertoire combine to take a three-hour tour of a chapter of James A. Michener's epic novel. Well, the period of time covered was a chapter, but I don't remember many of the situations that actually happened in the book. The package on my copy of the film gives the maximum billing to Maria Conchita Alonso, even if it turns out that it is only in a spoken scene. In the second tape. <br /> <br /> Actors must be commended for playing their roles well, despite a sloppy and flustered script. They must be insulted, however, for having accepted the roles in the first place.
