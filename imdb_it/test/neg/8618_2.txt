This "Vampires: The Turning" movie is not even worth the 2 out of 10 I'm giving. The film is very predictable from the beginning, until the end, when our hero kills the leader of the Vampire Slayers. The use of music in this film was also bad, it continued to sound like you should expect something meaningful to happen at any time, even if it never happened. Acting, it was B-Rank at the most ... And the movie was lonely, boring. The only reason I gave this film 2 out of 10 is because the story had potential even if it wasn't able to deliver. Oh, and did I mention the wardrobe? The wardrobe of this film was obviously cheap for "non-existent" because our hero and his girlfriend (who is trying to save during the whole movie) are wearing the same clothes for the whole movie. I would suggest this film only if you are really bored and you don't have a good wall with fresh paint to look dry. ~ Dave, the horror cowboy
