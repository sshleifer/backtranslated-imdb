For those of you who don't remember the movies - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080120/ - this came out in '79 (I think it's been enough time so naturally that Nunzio thought he could just do it again this and says he wrote it - yes, right!). <br /> <br /> The acting in this is exaggerated - the "tosti" turn with curved shoulders to give the impression of being bigger than they really are, even the "hero" seems to have the passion for snorting and rolling eyes in a way of lying eyes to express anguish / anger to the celluloid eye. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of racial message here, from the Sicilian point of view (mind you it is 3rd generation down the line ... the original "wogs" arrived in OZ after the war and during my childhood - yes, I'm an Australian. -iness "was very diluted - they sound like real blue Aussies - it's not a glimpse of" dago accent "anywhere (there, there's another jargon for you, Nun!) <br /> <br /> Maori's with sunnies (sunglasses s) at 4 am - it must be nice to be blinded by the sun in the middle of the night and it looks like Redfern ... that's the boring end of this film. "Nunzio tried to copy the taste of the Warriors but left too many holes in the story. How about the coincidences? <br /> <br /> The warriors had a gang of baseball boys who wielded bats, with the trick of the white face chasing the heroes towards a train station and fighting them - the band of Nunzios is chased into a station by a stick band wielding guys wearing whitish facial masks. The warriors were wrongly accused of having shot / murdered another gang member - Nunzios' gang is wrongly accused of raping the sister of the great Maori gang leader. Warriors are lured into a room by a gang of girls who attack them - the Nunzios crowd wants to fall into a house of friends, which is populated by, yes, a gang of girls - there are almost too many copies of the Warriors to keep from here. <br /> <br /> I am saddened by the fact that people don't want to see other OZ moves because of this tripe - how about Mad Max - Commander and Master of the World? Not all films are made by actors who are so bad, they have to finance their own films. <br /> <br /> As for the other actors on this show, it looks like they were inspired by "The Nun" as they are all bad at each other - don't worry about this movie! I can't get my money back, so save yours!
