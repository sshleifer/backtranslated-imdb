The dott. Steven Segal saves the world from a deadly virus epidemic. This film strikes me as a serious madness that has turned into a classic of an unintended field (the best kind). The memorable lines include "Knowledge is like a deer, chase it and you will run away" and "Drink this, it will make you feel better". It's so sublimely negative - they couldn't have made it any worse if they tried. <br /> <br /> Segal tries to convince you that he is 1. sensitive - saving an affected pony; 2. a good father - with a corny cooking scene for his daughter; 3. a man of science - looking at a false spectrum; 4. in harmony with nature - using homeopathic remedies; 5. politically correct and multicultural - having Indian friends; 6. an iconoclast - opening a rural practice after a previous life in a national research laboratory; and 7. an action hero - being really fat but still capable of fighting. ROTFL. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see it as a film late Saturday night, with friends, preferably (but not necessarily!) drunk.
