This film tells the true story of the escaped black slaves who found their mountain community as free men in the 17th century in Brazil. The story is interesting and uplifting. However, this film - as a film - is terrible. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is not vintage music or tribal music. It is Afro-Brazilian pop music of the early 1980s. The battle scenes are fought to the beat of the most beautiful pop rhythms left at the disco or the movies of bad cops. Of course, the texts are popular stories about the heroism of slaves. The special effects are absurd. Rather than invoking the mysticism of the African religion and atavistic beliefs, they simply make the film look cheap. They are absolutely incredible, and I don't mean only in a sense of verisimilitude. <br /> <br /> Life in the municipality of Palmares could not have been the way it is represented in the film. For this company, as shown in the film, there is a kibbutz in one part, a one-part afro-pop festival. Furthermore, it is almost embarrassing to see the director playing on the clichés of blacks as talented singers and dancers who simply want to be happy. He portrays everyday life as a series of dance parties in which freed slaves are colored in bright colors and turn to pop music from the 1980s. On the other hand, they have an abundance of wonderful food, but the viewer barely sees that any work is done. The king railed against private property in a banal and banal way. When a man complains that people are taking vegetables that has grown for many months, the king says, "What comes from the earth belongs to everyone, since the land belongs to no one. If they need food, they have the right of take yours. "<br /> <br /> I am happy to have heard about this episode of the story, but I am relieved that a film with such low production values ​​that trades on such consummate stereotypes probably won't be realized today.
