I tried to watch this movie 3 or 4 times, but I can't get over the fact that everything about it is just awful. I'm sure it was a brave move on the part of someone who chose Jack Palance as the protagonist, but there is not a single fiber of my being who believes he can act at all, and much less act against the type. <br /> <br /> Yes, I understand that Clifford Odets was a brilliant author, but it is not obvious here. This strange and forced mix of 1950s hipster pants seems to blur any authentic meaning, which explains why none of the actors, not even the good ones (Steiger, Ida Lupino, Shelly Winters, Everett Sloane) seem to know how deliver their lines - it is as if they did not understand the meaning of what they are saying. And meanwhile, Wendell Corey and Palance stage a fantastic race to see who can be smarter. <br /> <br /> The management is amateur and completely overwhelmed. The physical interaction between the characters is drawn as much as the dialogue. <br /> <br /> And can we discuss that horrible set? It's so busy, ugly and artificial that it adds characters, dialogue and portraits to the robotic and disconnected quality. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to suck the energy directly from me. Everybody seems to have taken an overdose of Valium every morning when they arrived on the set. It takes a pretty nasty movie to make Rod Steiger and Shelly Winters look bad, but that happens. <br /> <br /> I can see that it could have been as effective as a game on Broadway, where intellectuals and beats could have congratulated myself for appreciating the power of the plot and the artistic developments of the pseudo-hip dialogue.
