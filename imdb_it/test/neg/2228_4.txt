All those who criticize the Sopranos for his stereotypical portraits of Italians have not seen anything until they have taken a good look at this gangster gangster film that focuses on such an irritating family, that you will almost want them to be deleted. <Br /> <br /> The parents of this clan are not so bad, but their two little boys - one a total brat, a sickly dog ​​- are unbearable, while their oldest son, good for nothing and the daughter of Pollyanna skillfully compete for public disdain. But everyone's grandfather is, well, grandfather. As interpreted by Chic Sale (in full "Dag-nabbit!" Mode), He acts as the moral compass of the film, throwing many diatribes on "dang, dirty foreigners" for good measure. If these are the good guys, it's no wonder that the actors of that time who played the villains became the big stars. <br /> <br /> Not that there are stellar performances among the criminal actors, but at least they perform themselves better than the grateful family of Leeds. The incompetent police officers do not even have enough time to shield things further. Only Walter Huston, as district attorney, elevates the material riddled with clichés in its useless attempts to give some leveling to these sweets. <br /> <br /> The film deserves to be included in a first phase in what would have proved to be a very popular silencing-witness formula, and does not hesitate in its description of the criminal lifestyle, but there are examples simply better - and less xenophobic - in the genre.
