This film was a total yawn that lasted forever, but it never happened. It was simply boring to watch, so much so that in reality I could never really get into it. This film is not a horror film with a touch of imagination, the cover of the videotape made it a movie. Instead it is a thriller type film with some horror elements thrown in to make the film more interesting. Of course, this film doesn't help at all. Mostly all I remember is that this film was a bit like a movie from the 70s called "The Deep". Bunch of treasure hunts, rival groups that kind of things. There are also supernatural twists, but to tell you the truth I was so bored when I watched this movie that I split up into zones so I can't really tell you what the supernatural elements were. I remember the footprints on the bottom of the sea, so maybe it was a kind of living dead, or I could be thinking of the movie "Zombie" by Lucio Fulcio, instead that that was a horror film set in a tropical island and as far as bizarre it was, it was a lot more fun than this movie. That day we learned a valuable lesson, never rent a movie based on its cover.
