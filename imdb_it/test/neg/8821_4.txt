I had heard a lot of bad things about this movie before seeing it, but I thought that all the negative comments were probably related to the film's low budget and poor acting - both of which I can deal with when it comes to zombie movies. However, what I didn't count on is that this movie is really, really boring; if there is one thing you can count on low budget zombies, its coolness and entertainment - but unfortunately, this movie has neither. I'm quite surprised, because the two previous horror films I saw from director Bob Clark - Deathdream and Black Christmas - were both very imaginative and funny movies, but kids shouldn't play Dead Things don't cut it. The plot follows a group of young adults traveling to a funeral island to joke with rituals to bring the dead back to life. However, they soon learn that playing with things they don't understand is a really stupid idea when their rituals bring the dead back to life and the corpses of the island come back to feast on their blood! <br /> <br /> The plots sound like it could lead to a decent movie, but what I didn't say is that the interesting parts don't start until the last twenty minutes; and since this is a ninety minute movie, I'm sure you can guess that this is not a good thing. The opening hours and the ten minutes are completed with poor acting and even worse characters. I can understand creating a situation so that horror is more powerful once it arrives; but please, if you're going to spend so much time on it, you really have to make it interesting. All the characters in the film are exaggerated and boring and personally I just wanted the zombies to hurry to eat them. The film is not without merits, however, as the atmosphere is prominent. Lucio Fulci would have shown seven years later how an isolated island and the meat that the zombies eat can merge well; but Bob Clark has already done it with this film. Even directing is not bad, but it is caused by poor make-up effects and a distinct lack of blood, something that fans of zombie movies will probably not like. Overall, I can't really recommend this movie; but if you are an avid zombie fanatic, you may enjoy yourself.
