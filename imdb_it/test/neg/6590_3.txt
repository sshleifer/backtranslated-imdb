Yes, it may not be historically accurate (in reality only 6 soldiers of the 9th rotation were killed there), and yes, it has some errors and exaggerations (machine gun bent? Come on! Or that "history lesson" on how Afghanistan does not has never been conquered by anyone - an educated Russian officer would know the story much better than this - take for example the British campaign in Afghanistan). And yes, it doesn't have many-million-dollar Hollywood-style special effects, but it's the strongest point in showing the soldier's life there, their relationships and their feelings when best friends are killed before their eyes. In my opinion, 9ya rota really does a good job showing all these things. <br /> <br /> Once again, the film has weaknesses, but, in my opinion, it seems to be one of the strongest Russian films of recent years. <br /> <br /> 8/10
