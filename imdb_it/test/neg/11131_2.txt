This film was not very funny. Not much else to say, apart from that it was a bit awkward for Laurence Fishburne and David Hyde Pierce, both of whom deserve much better than this. Also, I don't understand why, after this film was completely and completely bombed, WB insisted on turning it into a TV show.
