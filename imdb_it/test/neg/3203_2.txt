trying to fit into the scary space comedy genre, this movie falls into two of these. It actually takes place in space, but it is neither fun nor scary. The plot is dismal and the only joke, relative to computer intelligence, is exaggerated. Saying that Paul Whitthorne in the role of Ethan, Angela Bassett in the role of Fran and Brad Dourif as Al Bert, make the best of their ham script. The homosexual relationship between Ethan and Al Bert is hinted but never explored while the attempt at sexual tension between francs and rick is so crude as to be ridiculous. All in all this is a turkey that is best suited for late night TV, preferably while doing the ironing.
