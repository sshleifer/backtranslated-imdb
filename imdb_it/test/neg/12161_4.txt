I went to see this movie because it was recommended to my wife and wanted to go. <br /> <br /> We were both trying to watch our watches long before the movie ended, to see how much more he had to endure. Two hours and six minutes, it is. It is divided equally between the battle scenes (about a dozen, all more or less interchangeable) and the development of the plot. <br /> <br /> It would have been thought that the subject was the son of a minor tribal leader who conquers half the world, plotting would have been relatively easy. There is a lot of raw material from which to make a good story. However the writers have completely suffocated him. We don't have a real story. Instead we get a Hollywood version of the story. <br /> <br /> What supports the young Temudjin in his long - almost infinite, actually, or so it seems to the viewer - tribulations? Because, the love of a good woman, of course. <br /> <br /> How does he get out of prison? Well, an old monk, who recognizes his innate goodness and greatness, goes across the continent to bring to this good woman a talisman that symbolizes Temudjin's love for her, leaving him dead close enough to her to find him there , talisman in his hand. And of course she then goes and, having (inexplicably) become rich and powerful, she saves him. <br /> <br /> How do you flee from the chains? Well, go to the sanctuary of the great wolf god Tengri (or a similar name) and Tengri frees him from magic. Yes, right. <br /> <br /> Why do you want to become the Mongol governor? The wolf-god again, apparently. Out goes Temudjin to ask for advice, and - surprise! surprise! - understands it. "Read", he says to himself. "What the Mongols need are laws, good and simple". Golly, it was awesome. <br /> <br /> And finally, how did he win the decisive battle against his rival's most powerful forces? Better tactics, of course, but also thanks to the help of the good old wolf god, who sends a storm at the height of the battle. All the troops are lowered as the thunder rolls and the lightning flashes (the Mongols are afraid of thunder, see) - but not our Temudjin. The troops, completely amazed by his courage, hail him king! <br /> <br /> I don't know what causes people to continue producing this type of garbage. The funny thing is that it is interspersed with all sorts of gritty realism: lots of milk, dirt and violence. It's as if the producers of this film wanted to get the most banal things so that viewers wouldn't notice how childlike some of the great things are. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of violence in the foreground graphic: cuts, impalements, jets of blood, splashes of blood, clouds of blood - the blood kids really had a great time. Despite the realism, it is impossible to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> I have to mention the ridiculous final battle scene in CGI. How anyone can think that these things are realistic is beyond me. They don't. Oh, and everything is shot in the standard Hollywood style: breathtaking views for spectacular landscapes and super-close-up Stedicam for battle scenes. And the standard Dolby super-sound effects of swelling and thuds and the constant low-frequency hum to sustain the tension. <br /> <br /> Tedious. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
