Jack Frost 2 is out of the question, I'm really surprised that people are allowed to make this kind of film. <br /> <br /> While Sam and his wife go to the Tropicana for a relaxing Christmas, Jack returns to kill off the fun and take revenge with inbreeding ... <br /> <br /> Don't take this movie at all , most people say it's a laugh with your friends, but frankly it's a waste of time. If the people who made this film can get a job doing what they do, they can at least take the time and effort to write a better story, especially the names of the character characters.
