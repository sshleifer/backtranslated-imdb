This may not be the worst movie to win the best image, but it's up there. Well, in retrospect, this is probably the worst film that ever won the best image. Even if you'd expect a movie to be worth it. This, in fact, even if it is questionable. The film contains almost no depth and is only "funny" after "funny" if you want to call it that. At the beginning it is very interesting but it seems as if everything was exaggerated on so many levels. <br /> <br /> The acting was not spectacular to see, but it was rather interesting to see Charlton Heston in his first starring role. I found many of the characters as the annoying movie tone after a while. I really liked James Stewart as the philosophical clown. He saved the film for me because he gave him an extra layer that was so necessary. Unfortunately there was not much else after Stewart. <br /> <br /> The direction of the much respected Cecil DeMille was non-existent for me. I found the film rather trivial and its use of Betty Hutton was a mistake. The appearance of the film has been very good at times, but it has not generated the magical feeling that the classics need to have. The script was actually pretty good considering how superficial most of the film was. <br /> <br /> From the movies like this the term "Hollywood Trash" was born. There is no depth, no valid attempt to draw emotions from the public and simply no artistic value for the film. Then, of course, the many holes in the plot throughout. This film has been constantly annoying and frustrating. I even made sense through this film that much of what I was looking at was not just an imprecise representation of circus life, but rather the opposite of what it really is. Because this has won the best image is beyond me but it is not like the first or the last time that the Oscars will have made a mistake.
