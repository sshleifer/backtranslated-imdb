Have you ever seen one of those shows that have become so popular that in the end managed to get away with mindless nonsense and half reps that the creators can get away with? If you didn't, you never saw Family Guy. <br /> <br /> Fans of the show seem to think it witty, edgy and moving. It's none of these, it's still boring, repetitive, offensive and uninspired. <br /> <br /> The humor of the show comes from two sources. <br /> <br /> 1) Irrelevant language. The show often has flashbacks of things that have nothing to do with the plot and are mostly just absurd and useless. And then there are the references to the film in which the characters show the scene of a popular film without parodying it effectively. . . or parodying (which IS NOT FUNNY !!!!!). <br /> <br /> 2) the same shit that is in every episode of the show. The only guy is a sexual deviant with STD, AHA HA! It's not funny ?! Hey, do you know what's even more fun? Do the same joke about him anywhere between one and fifteen times in a single episode. And don't just tell it over and over again in a single episode, be sure to drag it out so that an entire scene is dedicated only to telling the joke. Now imagine also that this same routine is used over and over again for practically all the characters in the entire series. <br /> <br /> "Non-PC" humor is not as "non-PC" as it would be believed, mostly just saying that morons think about the latest headlines, politicians and casual celebrities . <br /> <br /> The series has its moments, but now I think it's time to take the show out of the air and be done with it. <br /> <br /> Do you know what's funny? I like it even more than Nausicaa from the valley of the wind.
