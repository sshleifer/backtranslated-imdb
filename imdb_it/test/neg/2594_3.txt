The Griffins. When the show first aired, it was cool, original and actually quite fun. Now, I've stopped watching it. It has become one of the worst shows on television, combining funny little jokes, repetitive jokes and the hope that every joke can become fun by inserting the word "bitch". Seth Macfarlane clearly has problems with himself, and is obviously pandering to 13-year-olds. <br /> <br /> I simply don't understand how something that started so funny, so different from everything else, can devolve into this horrible mess of a "comedy" show. I seriously felt better than a liners from a pud comic. <br /> <br /> It's really sad to see the big shows fail, and watch drivel as this continues. Or Seth Macfarlane has stopped trying, or believes this show is hilarious as it is. <br /> <br /> Anyway, God help us. <br /> <br /> I hate this show, and dance an Irish jig when it's finally erased.
