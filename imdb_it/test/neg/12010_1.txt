Did the first parody really make money? This is another sequel (along the lines of ANOTHER STAKEOUT) that nobody asked. But we received it anyway. The sequel is like his predecessor, completely brain dead. It's also pretty disgusting (do you remember the dinner scene?). To think that I almost felt sorry for Ritter, Yasbeck and Warden. Did they need so much money?
