Great music, but isn't this people PATHETIC?!? A real vintage piece of The Trippy Sixties, and left me depressed. The director paints the wrong side of the life of the jetset and stings like a hornet's nest. If the culture of the time has led people to do these things, it seems to me that it was all a journey without discovery, only despair. I tried, really tried, to appreciate this movie, but these people are nowhere on my page. Yes, it would be nice to see the world, go away for a while, but I always intend to come back. Drugs are not the cause of the fall of these characters, are their disgusting attitudes ?? these guys passionately drink their cup of poison. They reduce their lives and ultimately reduce the cost of the journey that is life. Has the love story ever been so obscure? <br /> <br /> Cheers: interesting scenarios. Wonderful Pink Floyd soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Caveats: Dated. Drug. Depressing. Completely unlikely characters; they are not flower children. <br /> <br /> Only for the curious, since most packages vanish the Pink Floyd connection. (Rare Floyd keeps track of many who never heard it before, since FM is not what it was.) <br /> <br /> Rating: Two Stars.
