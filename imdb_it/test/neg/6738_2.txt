This must be the worst Steven Segal movie I've ever seen (even worse than eco-piffle like On Deadly Ground and Fire Down Below). I'll start with the positive points ..., It has an elegant direction for a DTV movie and it has a wonderful scenery ... That's it! The story doesn't really go anywhere, it's just a series of well-set pieces, so that Seagal can shoot the bad guys (the number of corpses can easily equal Tarantino to his bloodiest!). The plot is unnecessarily complicated and confusing you forget who the good and the bad are. Acting (I use the term freely) is mediocre at best, the usual constipated expression of Seagal ONE and the wooden acting I can do, but the others, especially the English, were really terrible. <br /> <br /> What's in the package? Why do the bad guys follow him? Has Seagal been created? <br /> <br /> GIVING LIKE ***! <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie to my local Blockbuster (Once paid), the assistant laughed at me and said it was the worst movie in the store that I could have chosen! (I wanted to punch him until my arm went numb) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I haven't seen Half Past Dead or Out yet for a kill and I'm not looking for other humiliations in my shop, but they can't be worse than this turkey <br /> <br /> The soundtrack should be young and fashionable - It has just given me a strong impetus for half a dozen kids. <br /> <br /> All in all this is Seagal to his WORST! The guy who earned about 100Ibs and looks far beyond, is a guy who just doesn't have time to stop, he should retire gracefully NOW! and go behind the camera or become a martial arts teacher or something. <br /> <br /> My assessment 2/10 (1 point for the scenario)
