I like this movie and I've seen my copy twice since I acquired it a few weeks ago. But you have to see it in the right context. <br /> <br /> I didn't check the dates, but I bet this film came out later and certainly in the same period as Collier and Walt Disney's publications on the vision of space flight promoted by W.Von Braun. This is reflected in the attempt to actually look correct and scientific. However, while certain ideas are roughly put (step upgrades, for example) approximately correctly, other things are hilarious. <br /> <br /> For example, we are told that a rocket rises to an altitude and then turns ninety degrees to enter the space ... like reaching the top of a flight of stairs and turning on the landing! Then we are told that by turning in the direction of the Earth's rotation the total speed of the ship is increased accordingly. <br /> <br /> This is an exhilarating misunderstanding about what really happens. Most space launch centers are as close as possible to the equator, where the Earth and anything on its surface rotates at about a thousand miles per hour, including any rocket that heads into space, to the east ( the same as the planet's rotation). Of course, if the ship wanted to travel west once in space, its speed in relation to the surface of the Earth would be greater, but it would add nothing to the actual speed of the vehicle. Described in this film as "air speed"! <br /> <br /> Similarly, we are told that travelers feel free to fall or "weightless" when they reach a few thousand miles from Earth, outside the gravitational field of planets. Again, comically incorrect. Most crewed spaceships travel no more than a couple of hundred miles up, but as long as they (and their contents, including the crew) travel at an adequate speed that their momentum in an external direction balances the strength of gravity towards the inside, orbit in free fall. Of course, it travels far enough from the Earth and even a slow object will go outside the Earth's gravitational well, but to leave the Earth's orbit, outward (towards the Moon for example) requires the achievement of "escape velocity", about twenty thousand miles an hour. Thus the vehicle will have already reached the "orbital speed" (and "weightlessness") by definition. <br /> <br /> But the movie has a lot more fun than this. Someone decided that it would be more fun if he lost the moon due to a technical problem, fell asleep for a few days and then woke up to find that they had accidentally gone to Mars! The captain then broods on the fact that this must have been a divine intervention! At that point, every claim to be scientific is divided into small pieces like confetti and thrown into the wind amidst the merry dance of an increasingly blunt conspiracy. <br /> <br /> The strength of a film like this, in fact, is in illustrating "how far we have come". Not least the attitude towards women. The patronizing mess has filled the female crew member at the same time exhilarating and even shocking. I think these attitudes were so "normal". <br /> <br /> As I said at the beginning, I find this film very funny, like late at night, the lights stand out the journey into the romance of space travel, from the point of view of the days before it happened. An antidote to the cold routine of space flight as it has become in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the ending. He is brave and shocking for a film of this vintage and character.
