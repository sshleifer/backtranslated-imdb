... because this is still another death. Dubbing without life, second-level animation, artificial and little amusing songs (although the little sung by the devil would have been worthy of Tim Curry), and a weaker plot by Land Before Time 99: Fossils On Parade. <br /> <br /> I have to admit I didn't see the first movie. I'm not a big fan of movies involving Paradise or dogs, especially not in combination. Anyway, I hope to see the first one soon, since there had to be a reason why someone would have created such a horrible sequel. <br /> <br /> If I hadn't taken this movie for free, I wouldn't do it at all. For a 'paradise' film, the only good thing about this was the Devil. 2/10.
