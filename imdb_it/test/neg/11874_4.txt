Since the Wesley Snipes came down (or ascended) into the world of DTV action movies, the result was Miss, so-so, and Miss. Unstoppable was weak. 7 seconds were fun. The shooter chosen was the proverbial scraping of the septic tank. /> <br /> And what about The Detonator? We will be above the suffering of the Marksman again. But the Detonator has a small amount of merit that is hampered by a lazy star and low budget. <br /> <br /> Sonny Griffith is a Covert op not-so-from-book that carries illegal arms dealers in Poland. When his last job ends a bullet buffet that leaves a pile of corpses, Sonny comes then ordered to escort a witness; Nadia (the always hot Silvia Colloca) in the United States. The problem is; Sonny is tricked by a traitor from his own organization who is following up on Gangster with Nuclier Ambitions. <br /> <br /> Snipes delivery in the action department. He's in half blade mode here. well in the first 15 minutes of the Detonator, before descending into the pure sleepwalking mode that ruined the Marksman. It does more than look nice. There is a certain conviction in his scenes. Many actors seem familiar and have been in the last 3 or 4 Seagal / Snipes films. It's always nice to see Michael Brandon again. <br /> <br /> The action is wired here. But it's never boring. Running, car chases, Fights. Director Po-Chih Leong seems to have improved after the farce of Seagal, Out of Reach. It does a credible job. But it is constantly hampered by the low budget. Enough with the Euro's positions abroad. Its cheapness is the look of the film. Can the future not be so expensive? <br /> <br /> The Detonator ends only in the media. It doesn't have the ugly funny aspect of Seag at the Mercenary for Justice. But it's not nearly as funny as the Second in command of Van Damme. As exciting as Dolph's Mechanik is. Maybe Dolph should direct Wesley to the next eh? <br /> <br /> The best time Producers pump a little more money and think of these DTV titles with the kind of money they're making from them. Its result is right. The result could be a big seller, maybe? <br /> <br /> The Snipes should try to make this their last action movie DTV. It is sad to see it yet another waste of talents of this talented actor.
