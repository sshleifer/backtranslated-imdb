This is a film with a lot of potential, well done and played, with a rather inconsistent one-week script. A young woman with two children moves into her mother's cramped apartment, because her husbands resting on the stolen car lab is exacerbating her son's asthma. The husband ends up in jail when a stolen car of a former pat is tracked down in his shop, ex pat ends up being kind, generous and naive of shmoe (and rather cardboard and we learn almost nothing about him), but ends up girl, who "trades" despite being sexually satisfied only by her husband. I expect this film to be successful in the Czech Republic, where it will be welcome thanks to its obvious premise: "The ex-pat who have money can also have our women, but they are old, soft and our women want to be satisfied, we could be poor, but ... Now, if only it were possible, Evzen would have kept Marcela satisfied, so she wouldn't have needed to play with herself, or if she already had an existing family in Italy ... but this would have complicated things.
