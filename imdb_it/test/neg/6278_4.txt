I'm not a big fan of the Spielberg / Cruise version of this movie. And so I have to enter with the humblest version of Latt / Howel. C Thomas Howel had more heart and more sympathy for Cruise in the lead role (at least in my opinion). Now it's hard to imagine it until you remove everything that in Spielberg's version costs more than a thousand dollars. There would be nothing left, no special effects, no sets, no Cruise. Because I doubt that something cost much more than a beautiful in the version of David Michael Latt. So, comparing apples with turnips, I think I have to go with turnips. At least it gives an independent film to the epic market for science fiction disaster.
