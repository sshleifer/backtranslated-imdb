I'm evaluating 'The Decline of the American Empire' almost below average as it wasn't terrible, but also not great. I liked very open conversations from such incredibly selfish and ugly people inside and out. That was probably the most original aspect ?? a small sexual film connected to dialogue with people extremely distant from the models. Apart from that, it seems ironic that these French-speaking Canadians have a film about a nearby company that, well, is in "Decline" when their own actions are their own end. A group of women friends and male friends spend half of the movie laughing about their infidelity and acceptance of that behavior and the other half "intellectually" talking about how powerful they are for their words and actions. These are the normal targets of the typical sitcoms that the main characters make fun of at parties mainly occupied by university professors. Unfortunately, it is not their "intelligence" or mastery of "history" that disturbs me. It is their pedestal made of ego and a stronger attitude than the one that pushes me away and not a character I can refer to, nor do I like. When you cry, can't you care less ?? it's your bed When one complains, I just startled. What made me skirmish was a character, uh, who was peeing in red. (Another example of playing with fire.) Of course, I understand that it happens to someone, but it was difficult to watch. And I sincerely hoped that he washed his hands because he had no trouble getting back to cooking for everyone. At the opposite end of the nose educators, they introduce a stereotypical nomad. This made me shiver because nobody seemed real; everyone was as low as their laughter about society. Unfortunately, with no one left to cheer on, you were as empty as the souls of these characters.
