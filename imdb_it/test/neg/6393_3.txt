Yes, I know the girls are hot and the scenery is lovely, but for someone who knows the place, it's fun. <br /> <br /> If you want some precision, this is not a film you can rely on. It starts with the flight from SÃ£o Paulo to Rio aboard a 747. This will never happen on the 400 km flight. Smaller planes like the 737 or A-320 shuttle passengers between the two cities every half hour. The journey by car from the airport, if shown on a map, would reveal an intricate zig zag back and forth. Perhaps the producers have tried to emulate one of the most well-known taxi driver routes in front of tourists. Not that it would be a local habit, since I myself have been robbed in very serious places like Switzerland. The girls, yes. All topless. It is something that a stranger will never understand. The Brazilian chicks will be happy to exhibit 100% of their incredible bodies at Samba school shows and wear bikinis that are almost non-existent on the beach, but never go topless. A handful of beaches throughout the country will allow it. All carefully secluded and out of town. Oh, the interior decoration; the incredible background ... maybe at Disneyworld ... Other than that, it's very funny and yes, Demi Moore is absolutely gorgeous.
