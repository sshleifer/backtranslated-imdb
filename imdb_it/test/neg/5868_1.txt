This abomination and the sequel ONE MORE TIME (no thanks) and the horrible disasters of Jerry Lewis such as Do not RAISE THE BRIDGE LOWER THE WATER (why not just flush) have prompted cinema owners to close their doors rather than be forced to manage these films. It's true: in the 1960s the blocking of movie bookings was still applied to the unfortunate suburban and country cinemas ... this means that to get a good movie the cinema was forced to run shy like this: I remember well in the 1974 FIDDLER ON THE ROOF screen lover or something so good, I was locked in the United Artists booking office by a busy clerk who waved me in front of a sheet and squinted, shouting: "Now, before we arrive to that, let me see a date these earlier ". which basically means: "book this money and we'll give you a tired shot". Here's how and why so many closed cinemas, forced to shield and annoy their waning audience with these assembly-line failures with lame comedians and bored talents. The owners of the cinema, exhausted by the discussion simply shut down, sold to a gas station and saw the demolished cinema. These days the same type of film (for example: I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK AND LARRY) has been banned in 20-seat cinema in a mega google plex. Not much has changed. FREDDY GOT FINGERED ... someone?
