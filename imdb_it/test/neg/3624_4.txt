This was another one of those shows I've seen to eradicate the positive elements, and because I've been a Nick fan for years. Some of these would be scene sets, B-plots, guest stars and some of the main actors who were good. I dabbled in the show during high school, while I quickly fell in love with despising Jamie Spears, along with the other chicks in the show who can't act. The only characters I liked were Dustin, Quinn, Stacey, Michael and Logan. Quinn is a perfect outcast who eventually started to adapt; Stacey is a strange suit; Dustin suffers a lot of strange random situations; and Michael is kind of a comical man with Logan's right hand. There is a noticeable difference between the performance and the acting quality of the B-plots that involve them, and the A plots that showed a group of shrill girls and an iconic "perfect Miss", which repeated the wrong lines and obsessed the guys. This show would have been great if the main plots contained the quality of the side graphs, but the main graphs would deliver nothing. When he recently returned to reruns, and tried to watch him again, I was more calloused towards the abyssal acting of the girls and had to change channels. However, I will credit the characters listed above because they made the show more or less worthy of my time.
