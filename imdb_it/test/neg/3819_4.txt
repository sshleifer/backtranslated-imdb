It is important to check your expectations when you see Hatchet. The buzz that was generated on this site far exceeds the actual impact of the film. What can help someone see the film is to realize that it is - it shouldn't be scary--. It is a pure field and an attempt at fun. It's not --funny--, just campy. Don't expect something like SHAUN OF THE DEAD; nor something like Friday THE 13TH (Part II through the infinite). <br /> <br /> HATCHET has passable actors. The cinematography is straight Ed Wood. The creatures' effects and makeup are foolish, probably on purpose. Gore and blood are something between Romero and LIVE DEAD. Hatchet is a film of intimacy. It is between SHAUN OF THE DEAD and LESLIE VERNON. It's between campy and comedy (there's a difference). It is among the ultra violent and violent comic. <br /> <br /> Instead of "capturing the essence of American Horror" or any other silly jargon that was used to describe the film, try to capture something between the seminal - American - Horror as Friday THE 13TH and new Horror as SHAUN. Fortunately, he stays away from Torture Horror. <br /> <br /> In the end, HATCHET is between a bad movie and a decent movie. <br /> <br /> * I think it's happening more and more that the people involved in the movies are flocking to sites like IMDb to vote and comment on the movies they're involved with. At the very least, a campaign is underway for people associated with associates to leave positive feedbacks and ratings. There is no other reason why this movie was seen on high 7 with 600 votes and immediately after the wide release. This movie is barely better than the HorrorFest versions and shouldn't be so bloated.
