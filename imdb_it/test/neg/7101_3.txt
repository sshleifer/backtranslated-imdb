"Tank Girl" was, I suppose, thought to be the "Buckaroo Banzai" of the 90s and was marketed as such. The comparison is, of course, appropriate; both films have so many things in every frame that, though history is impossible, it is certainly not boring. <br /> <br /> "Tank Girl" is a pretty fun ride if you turn off your brain before the movie starts. Otherwise you'll end up with a headache that breaks your skull like me.
