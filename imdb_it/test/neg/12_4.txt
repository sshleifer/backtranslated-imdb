Blake Edwards tried very hard to change the image of Julie Andrews in this film. He tried to make her sexy by not realizing that he already was. I think they were both still a bit upset that Julie hadn't been chosen to film her success on Camelot's Broadway and that she had been passed off as not sexy enough. Unfortunately, they chose this vehicle to try to appease this belief. It gets to the point where it's almost fun to see Rock Hudson, whom we all know was gay now, kissing Julie every 2 minutes for the whole movie. Now it seems they weren't just trying to make you believe that Julie was a femme fatale but that Rock was straight. Unfortunately, they have absolutely no chemistry together and the endless kissing scenes begin to cash in. The other mistake they made with this picture was not knowing what kind of movies they were doing. They are almost three separate films. There is Julie's drama as the German spy trying to get military secrets from Rock. There is an aerial war movie with lots of footage of World War I vintage planes and there are the stupid attempts at humor that Blake Edwards seems to think he should include in each of his photos, whether it is appropriate or not, in this case, it was not. The only truly saving qualities in this film are watching the always adorable Dame Julie and hearing her sing in that very light soprano like a bell. Of course if you love her, you could overlook the weaknesses of this film only because of her. You can always tell yourself, later on, that it was much better than staying with STAR!
