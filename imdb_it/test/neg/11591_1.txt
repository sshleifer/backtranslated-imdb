Komodo vs. Cobra starts as "One Planet" environmentalist Jerry Ryan (Ryan McTavish) and his girlfriend Carrie (Renee Talbert) takes on captain Michael Stoddard (executive producer Michael Paré) to take them to an island in the South Pacific at the beginning Stoddard is reluctant as the island is a top secret military research base but soon changes its mind when a load of money is offered. Together with the television journalist Sandra Crescent (Jeri Manthey) they set sail for the island and upon landing they discover that the military are funding illegal DNA genetic experiments that led to the huge Komodo Dragon's & King Cobra's that ate almost every other living thing there & Stoddard & co are the next in the menu ... <br /> <br /> Co-written and directed by the ever terrible Jim Wynorski under his pseudonym Jay Andrews this is simply horrible, this is simply hard to sit through & is even worse than the usual 'Creature Features' of garbage, the Sci-Fi channel has the courage to breathe if it's possible. The script is terrible, predictable and absolutely boring, some giant monsters of some kind are created by scientists who mess around with DNA, a group of people is trapped with monsters and must try to avoid being eaten. Here, this is the whole plot of Komodo vs Cobra, maybe this was trying to rip AVP: Alien vs. Predator (2004) with the title but all "against" the figure amounts to thirty-five seconds of distance between the two titers at the end, boring to death and certainly a great disappointment for anyone hoping to have a monster full of monsters. The characters are poor, the dialogues are horrible, the pace is slow, the plot is predictable and cliché and the whole film is just crap with a lazy script that mistakenly states that both the Komodo Dragons and Cobras are amphibians that don't I'm. Hell, Komodo versus Cobra is not worth watching for any involuntary laughter as it is so boring and almost never happens, even if the sight of a woman hiding behind the smallest rock on the beach from the Cobra is pretty funny for the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> How does Wynorski continue to direct jobs? It is probably the worst director currently working, how can he continue to have fun playing movies set in beautiful places with decent media launches and turning out such a terrible movie? I think this was cut to get a PG or TV because every time someone swears he is masked by a Parrot squeak! There is zero gore or violence and the monster scenes are limping, people just stop there, the monsters are just somehow hissing or roaring and that's it. The computerized effects of CGI are terrible, this is a really bad stuff that looks horrible. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of around $ 450,000 it seems so cheap, the Hawaiian resorts are beautiful to look at but that's by the way. The acting is poor from an uninteresting-looking cast. <br /> <br /> Komodo vs. Cobra is an absolutely awful Sci-Fi Channel Sci-Fi by Jim Wynorski, the films are not much worse than that.
