I just don't understand. Why call this sequel to the movie "American Werewolf" when it has absolutely no connection with it? The first film was fun * and * scary with revolutionary special effects. (If the memory is needed, the Oscar category for special effects for makeup has been * created * for this film). "Paris" is none of these things. Terrible effects and not much else. Don't see this movie. Instead, rent the original "Werewolf in London". You will be much happier.
