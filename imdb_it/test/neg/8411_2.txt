Sam O'Steen, the film editor of the superlative suspense film "Rosemary's Baby" from 1968, directs a TV sequel here, one in which Rosemary Woodhouse (Patty Duke Astin, in for Mia Farrow) is interrupted soon ... and inexplicably - presumably to help flesh out the more gruesome aspects of this flabby story about Satan's son on Earth. The most interesting is the return of Ruth Gordon to her role as an Oscar winner like Minnie Castevet (with Ray Milland well portrayed as her husband, Roman), but she is not given much to do - and seems terribly uncomfortable about being involve anyway. This script is strictly low-cost rental and must have shamed the original author Ira Levin (who continued to write his sequel). Fairly dim and pale, with poor photography and no suspense or fear.
