This is more than just a Bond adaptation: it's a simple rip-off! With sketches of mediocre characters that Ian Fleming would not have approved, this film is considered the worst 007 movie. An older Connery (also sparse) tries to relive his past 12 years later. The result is a version of the classic hero without humor. Give me Roger Moore every day!
