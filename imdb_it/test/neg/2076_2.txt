When I saw him at the cinema, I remember starting with bad acting for about a minute or two in the first scene, then I immediately said "no, this must improve". It was not so. The performances are fairly evenly in teak 'n pine and no, there is NO sexual chemistry in this film, only the awkward postures of a fairly discreet and discreet actress who seems born to honor the cover of "Interviú" and not much other . If the writer thought that making Mérimée a character was an extraordinarily original creative stratagem, perhaps he should have known more. And Aranda, if he had reflected a little on the matter, would have realized that Carmen's story is only PIANGENTE PER a decisive, iconoclast, parodic deconstruction, not for this business of your brains to the turnstile of surrogate passion and comic dialogue. This is contemporary Spanish cinema at its worst. <br /> <br />
