Wow, what exciting visual effects. I also loved the costumes and works of art, the circus and the ethereal atmosphere of the film were sublime. It only required the need for the viewer to worry about the fate of our protagonist. Because she is trapped in her imagination, there is never a sense of danger unlike, for example, David Lynch's films that haunt each time. This also draws attention to what age group this film is destined for. Who would engage in this? <br /> <br /> Mirrormask is obviously drawing comparisons with Labyrinth with the teen-angst / fantasy theme, but unfortunately does not come very close to the realization of the same Henson essence. The theme of the sick mother is never completely explained and certainly is not something you care about while enjoying candy. <br /> <br /> Not distressingly terrible at La Cella, nor as fascinating as the Labyrinth - a forgettable thing but good Fantastic vision.
