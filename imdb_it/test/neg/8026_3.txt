Being a movie buff completely broken with a home to furnish, I'm a big fan of IKEA. My entire home is practically chock-full of economic stuff. And you know how all those elegant IKEA household items have those funny names - a bookcase called "Holika" and a bathroom mirror called "Grundtal" - well, it just adds the whole European charm. <br /> <br /> Like those articles with interesting (but horribly translated) names on IKEA's shelves, I'd like to provide some translation of some of the reviews I read about the Swedish product "Kraftverk 3714." <br /> <br /> Original comment: "For a low-budget film, it's really interesting, it would be nice to see what these guys could do on a Hollywood budget!" <br /> <br /> Translation: The film is disgusting, the lighting is pedestrian, the cinematography is not interesting, the sound recording is empty. <br /> <br /> Original comment: "David Lynchesque's sci-fi drama set in a strange forest city with equally strange characters!" <br /> <br /> Translation: These "actors" act free, the plot is circular and tiring, the ideas underlying the film are desperately trying to be existential but are simply trivial, and the settings (especially the interiors) are boring and full of ugly backgrounds. <br /> <br /> Original comment: "The editing is well done and the conservative use of computer graphics shows that the convincing CGI effects must not come from a Hollywood studio!" <br /> <br /> Translation : When you started with the sketched cinematography, hide the imperfections by digitizing everything on a Mac and stirring vigorously for three minutes. Brilliant! <br /> <br /> I took a chance on this DVD because I'm a fan of independent films, especially those that try to tackle the often expensive and inspirational science fiction genre. I mean, some of the best science fiction films of all time have been made with little or no budgets, spfx and specious actors. For example, Peter Fonda's film on the eco-warning-time-travel "Idaho Transfer"! A classic. <br /> <br /> But "Kraftverk 3714" does not fit into the "carefully designed, low-key, idea-dependent" science fiction category. It relentlessly focuses on characters who don't do much and don't say interesting things. It goes round and round. It's too long (this comes from a big Tarkovskij fan). Worse still, his "reality shifting aliens" concept is the Twilight Zone forage 40 years ago. It's not a well-made film - and I really wanted it to be, dammit! <br /> <br /> However, being the IKEA fan that I am, I made a shocking remark. First of all, anyone who has made purchases at IKEA knows how their deceptive shopping carts work: all four wheels are multidirectional. The carts can turn 360 degrees and it takes some familiarity to manage them like a professional, as any passionate buyer of IKEA knows. Well, I'll be damned, but one of the leading actresses of "Kraftverk 3714" goes to an inky-dinky grocery store in the middle of nowhere and what is it pushing around? A multidirectional shopping cart! So it's not an IKEA invention after all, but it's still another wonderful invention (let's call it a "Tacklebee" for hell) from the land of hei-doo!
