This film had potential. The script was not bad, and presented an interesting dark atmosphere with themes of suicide, patricide, regrets and - as Chris says - "10 years of going nowhere". It's a stark contrast to the original MAG7 which was brilliant, fun, and even the villain was adorable. <br /> <br /> It's a very interesting change of tone, and if they had developed the extra characters, maybe I'd do it. <br /> <br /> But instead they waste too much time on free (and ridiculous) battle scenes, badly assembled together. At some point you see a horse fall and 5 seconds later you see the same scene again. But not many people would notice it, since there are already 2 dozen horse trips (I don't exaggerate), and since then we've already fallen asleep. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the title of my review. This film has been largely cut due to animal cruelty, so it's likely (if you decide to watch it) you'll get the downed version, kiddie. There is a bullfight in which the matador stabs the bull, and suddenly while the crowd explodes, there is no bull, only the matador in an empty arena. As wow, maybe the bull was a Jedi, I don't know. More likely, the scene has been cut. <br /> <br /> Further on there is a rooster scene where, in the original version, one of the birds gets horribly crushed in front of a crowd of encouraging Mexicans. This has been cut. But we still see enough to be quite annoyed. <br /> <br /> But by far the worst scenes are horse throws. One by one, you see the horses' legs tearing, sending thousands of pounds of horse on his head. In one scene, a horse is thrown, and while he is writhing on the ground in paralytic convulsions, an explosive is fired right under his neck. <br /> <br /> This film was made in 1966 when Hollywood was just beginning to regulate animal brutality on the film. This is probably one of the last movies where you can watch it happen. So if this kind of thing floats your boat, take a look and you'll get a slight shiver. But if not, you'll be irritated or bored.
