... and this is a damn shame! Please raise the sun and incinerate all copies of Dracula 3000. This must be the WORST vampire blow of the new millennium so far (I have not seen REIGN IN DARKNESS yet, but they are not much worse than that). Don't be fooled by the cold cover by H. Gigeresque in the film. This is so ugly, it's almost funny. I cannot describe all the emotions that this film has evoked. I laughed, screamed at the screen, sat there numbly, nodded in disbelief with my head, ... This movie wrote 'cheap & cheese' on it. The best thing about this film is the opening titles and opening images that present CGI more or less well than two spaceships. But when the voiceover of Casper Van Dien arrives, you start to feel something suspicious. And, indeed, everything is reduced quickly after that. <br /> <br /> The crew of a rescue spaceship finds an abandoned ship, the Demeter, which seems to be heading towards the earth. They enter, thus sealing their destiny. This film is, above all, a shameless low-budget ALIEN-rip-off, mixed with vampires. Right in the plot, the character of Erika Eleniak, Aurora, reveals that she is a robot. Coolio goes very badly like cigarette smoke, a bloodsucker 187 (pffff, hooded code like a name?!?!). The character of Casper Van Dien is called Capt. Van Helsing (hahaha!) And it seems ..., um, Casper Van Dien. Udo Kier as Capt. Varna, former commander of Demeter, is shown only on a monitor screen and really seems to have trouble reading his lines from a self-signal (poor Udo, what are you doing in this movie?). And then we have Langley Kirkwood as Count Orlock, one of the most pathetic and laughable Dracula who ever managed to (dis) embellish the big screen. Look at her dress. Instead of a futuristic looking black dress or something like that, wear a cheap old-fashioned Halloween fringed suit. Did you think that Richard Roxburgh was not as convincing as Dracula in VAN HELSING? So wait till you see Langley's performance! <br /> <br /> Set designers went overboard on this. The interior of the Demeter looks like a cross between an oil tanker and an old steel factory, which decorate with horrible lights and colors such as green, pink, blue and yellow. The helicopter owner must have forgotten that this film takes place in the year 3000, because the characters use guns that look like today's forty.45 and "Prof" uses a non-motorized, non-floating wheelchair. It must be pushed around to be able to move. <br /> <br /> Apart from a parched corpse, some impalements and a dismemberment there is absolutely no blood. And the vampire fangs and contact lenses look like fakes to die for. Add to this even the most lame, stupid and abrupt ending of all time: Humvee and Aurora are the only survivors. Instead of having a final (bloody) showdown with the Orlock count, they close up in the control room. Then Aurora explains that before her program was updated and joined the narcotics, she was a "Protheus 3.2 PB", in other words: a pleasure-bot. So she says "Well then, what are you waiting for". Humvee replies "I don't have to tell me twice. Come, girl", he picks her up and ... "BOOOOOOM !!!" the ship explodes and the credits roll. No sex scene, no Erika shows her tits, no bloody orgasm, ... Just another shot by Udo Kier reading a line on the monitor and it's over. <br /> <br /> So this film is a must-see for any lover of bad movies, but I have to warn them: sometimes it gets really painful. And everyone says that VAN HELSING, UNDERWORLD or even QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is the worst vampire movie of the new millennium, clearly it's crazy, or hasn't seen Dracula 3000 yet.
