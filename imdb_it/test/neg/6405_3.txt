One would make you believe that this game is about a man obsessed with a number. And of course, it's an interesting topic - can a person become so obsessed with something as marginal as a simple number that he completely loses touch with reality and becomes hopelessly delusional and paranoid? <br /> <br /> Well, maybe someone will make a movie about this sometimes. This unfortunately has nothing to do with the above, no matter what the trailers (or even the movie itself) would like you to believe. I would like to say that this number is just a MacGuffin, but it's not even that. It's useless. A gimmick. A hook for the unsuspecting public. <br /> <br /> What is the film about? A dog-catcher (Carrey) who becomes obsessed with a noir cheese crime book because he feels it somehow reflects his own life. There. Of course, the character of the book - detective Fingerling (sigh) - is (for some reason) obsessed with the number 23, and Carrey himself becomes obsessed and starts to see the number everywhere ... but it's just a fill and totally irrelevant to the history. In fact, you can cut out all 23 references and have the protagonist (or characters) obsessed with cheese or something and you'll have exactly the same story. It is painfully obvious that all the "23" were written in waay after the story was already finished, rejected and sent for "rewriting". <br /> <br /> That would be OK .. I guess .. if the the film was not boring, boring, boring. Half of the film is narrated, for the chrissakes. You're not watching the movie, you're listening to Jim Carrey telling the movie. About a quarter of a second, Carrey starts reading the book, and from then until the horrendous final clich√© we are forced to watch scenes of "real" life from the life of the little dog (where nothing happens) interspersed with a fiction film "noir -ish "" scenes that will let you chuckle or simply depressed. It's like the "Sin City" of a poor man with all the violence cut, narrated by Carrey and shown in slow motion. Ugh. <br /> <br /> This is a simple case in which a C-movie script is somehow filmed with an A-movie cast .. probably because of the "number 23" which I think is intriguing enough on paper to guarantee the premium treatment of Hollywood. - as I said - the film talks about both the number 23 and the cheese production in Switzerland, you can't hear anything but cheat. <br /> <br /> Give "Fingerling - the movie" 3 out of 10, because I suppose that did not insult my intelligence as much as "Forsaken" made or made me a real suicide as "Battlefield Earth" did and the bottom of the ladder must be reserved for abominations like those. But fear not, this is still a pretty bad film.
