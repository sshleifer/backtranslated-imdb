The color filmmaking of CinemaScope by Leon Shamroy is quite remarkable here, including its use of colored filters for <br /> various scenes. The Alfred Newmann score must be the most sensual and seductive soundtrack that Hollywood has ever produced. It is a pity not to be available on CD anymore. The actors, however, are never up to the occasion. The accents are so varied, from the subdued British of Ustinov and Purdom to the Hollywood of Baxter and Mature that it seems a real mixture without a central vision. Tommy Rettig is stridently American. Acting styles range from zombies to stilts. Only Ustinov as a servant with half-closed eyes steals the show - what is there to steal. The premise - the story of a young Egyptian doctor, seduced and abandoned by the rich - and the parallel theme of the worship of the one God, Ra - haunted by the authorities, has its interesting points. But when the film's plot fades, it's the music and graphics that remain.
