I happened to take this alleged "horror film" late Friday night, I wish I had gone to bed! Tell me .. is a twerp covered with a 3-foot raincoat on a gum bike that should convey a kind of fear? Not here, still Mi-low is still able to beat the goalkeeper (Antonio Fargas) who is three times his size (?) Uh-huh. And the ending is so painful ... it leaves you alone with nothing to continue doing so! I found myself asking, "Is that so ???" <br /> <br /> Acting is as good as it will be in a low budget movie. The aforementioned Fargas offers a decent performance; but it's my conclusion that Jennifer Jostyn could be one of the worst actresses in acting in Tinsel Town! Sure, pretty face, but of bad acting. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1
