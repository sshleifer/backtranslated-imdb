Detective Dave Robicheaux is trying to link the murder of a local prostitute to the New Orleans mafioso, Julie Balboni. But during his investigation Robicheaux was conducted in a series of surreal encounters with a troop of Confederate soldiers ??, what a horrible plot and it was worse than I expected. he was very slow and had minimal skill in acting, I couldn't look at him, it was a waste of time. Another FLOP, I'd give it less than 1 if you could, please, people don't waste your time in 1: 42m full time. Actor Elrod Sykes and his girlfriend drive under the influence. While Dave takes Elod to the station, the actor tells Dave he has found some skeletal remains while he is filming on a movie set
