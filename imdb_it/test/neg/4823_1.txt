If this is classified as "real life" in London, the producers must be on another planet. <br /> <br /> It is the most depressing, suicidal, dark, dreary, drooling on TV. <br /> <br /> Everyone is fighting, everything has bad tones that cross it, nothing is done for genuine reasons. <br /> <br /> If you want a real-life image of people in London or the UK, then this program is from the furthest from reality. <br /> <br /> There is not a good word I can say about this program. The only certainty is that it will be a big battle for Christmas dinner. <br /> <br /> Even the characters are absolutely incredible!
