"Clubbed" is yet another "do-it-to-do?" enter the genre of English punches and it's safe to keep bettors who don't expect too moderately entertained for ninety minutes after a few beers. However, for all those seeking intelligent and quality entertainment, it is best to avoid it. <br /> <br /> There are so many approaches in the terrifying script that even an actor of the caliber of Colin Salmon is left to watch. The action is set in the 1980s, but it's never clear why, especially when they haven't been able to give a convincing touch for that decade, it takes more than 80 years of soul recording on the soundtrack , the occasional zoot suit and a handful of 30-year-old cars. Then we see central characters who study texts like "The Art Of War" by Sun Tzu and talk about how violence should be the last resort, while the same characters seem eager to start punching with all the testosterone-driven . of a group of fighters fighting for a lot of chips. <br /> <br /> The character development does not exist in "Clubbed". Neither irony, subtlety or pathos. This is a film based on fond memories of Guy Richie's early gangster films, which despite their flaws certainly had much more spirit, better editing, faster dialogue and a more emotional punch than this little saga. Now they are ten years old - isn't it time to move from trying to emulate them?
