This is one of the worst movies ever made. I can't believe how bad it was. I was shocked by the horror of the "ghoulies" masks. They are OBVIOUSLY Halloween masks! The mouths don't even move when they talk !!!!! Why did they feel the need to make ghoulies comical and stupid? Every time they do something it seems that there is this circus music and abused BONK and BOING noises when they hit people. The dominatrix slave is one of the worst actresses I've ever seen. This movie is just bad. The plot is non-existent. The mother of ONE TREE HILL is in this though and has obviously had a nose job since it was made. Why did the main character of the first film return to doing this garbage? BAD BAD BAD movie.
