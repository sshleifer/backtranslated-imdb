The success of Anna Kokkinos with "Head On" now begins to seem completely dependent on the script and by Alex Dimitriades, great protagonist. The degree to which the latter, "The Book of the Apocalypse" is both derivative, pretentious and utterly non-original (except the refined cinematography of Tristan Milani) seems to confirm this. . <br /> <br /> Alas, there have already been several Australian films dealing with these issues, some insulted for "sexism" (and / or explicit sex scenes) in the 70s and 80s and beyond and maybe they are worth looking at again after this piece of hair. Certainly, setting everything in the world of ballet and making it all very slow (and in his choreography, like an experimental number of Dutch Ballet of the '60s) suggest the Great Art if you haven't traveled much, and only if you've ever progressed beyond Art Theory 101. <br /> <br /> Add to fiction, a terribly arched dialogue ("you will do as we command ...") and the whole shebang falls on her well-financed face. Then there are the "sexy" pieces: directly from Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> Given the beautiful but truncated performance of Colin Friels - how about a real primordial thriller? <br /> <br /> All in, everything, with 'The Book of Revelation', the feminist project has been set back by another decade - and with the willing and deeply imitative (of male writers like Henry Miller, William Burroughs, also Bukowski) of some collectives in Melbourne, Oz, who suffers from a form of educational and ideological amnesia! No revelation awaits us here.
