The fact that this film was distributed for free with a certain national newspaper that I didn't care about, to a certain extent, prevented me from watching it, but as I had seen a copy that a local charity shop was giving away for nothing I felt I could see with a clear conscience. <br /> <br /> The film has its moments, the evocation of the position of the Thames is well done, but it suffers, I believe, from some too many defects. First, Vinnie Jones is not simply convincing as a journalist. While Vinnie himself is an interesting character, the truth is that he simply doesn't have the ability to act in a role like this. <br /> <br /> Secondly, who would carry a lost manuscript that they have been informed of is "priceless"? It seemed that wherever Mr Jones went this manuscript went with him! Third, the whole aspect of Dickens's story, while seeming important, intrudes on what could have been an interesting film of corruption at the top. Maybe I'm just a little thick, but I really couldn't see the point of Dickens's style in history. This did not add anything to the film, and only served to confuse things when things started to get interesting in the plot of modern days. <br /> <br /> The only thing I will praise the directors is that at least they have tried something slightly different. I'm all for independent British films trying to be "off-screen", but this is not a "red road" or "this is England". What it is is a bit of a mess, and one too long for that. Yes, he has fun in part, but in the end it seemed that two films merged together to create a whole, and both failed. (Also, I can't help but think I saw something similar recently done on TV by Ian Banks, set in Edinburgh with a story about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes).
