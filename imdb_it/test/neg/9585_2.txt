This is the worst exercise of middle-class pretentiousness that hasn't hit our TV screens yet. Unfortunately I didn't see it when it was first shown, but I paid the joy of seeing six hours of excruciating madness - and I'm still waiting for laughter to come. I love Tasmin Greig who was a big fan of both Black Books and Green Wing so I know he is capable of making the best of the comic parts. However, he interpreted this part as he was able to consider the lack of any decent comedy material provided. Broadcasters must keep in mind that the Law on Trade Descriptions can be invoked if you continue to pay as comic material that is at most pseudo-psychological romanticism and at worst a drama that stands as a bizarre comedy to hide the fact that it is neither fish or poultry.
