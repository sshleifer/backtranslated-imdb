Being a big fan of horror movies and always finding something good in a photo, but this film didn't get my attention or attention. This story revolves around a father, his daughter and a girl, since his wife died a few years ago. These people encounter a horrible situation in a city where they stop and visit and all the elders of this city clash with these people and almost kill them. This film reminded me of a film called "Children of the Corn" because it really involves children who are introduced to Satan and are his instruments of terror. There are a lot of songs, mambo jumble and a toy tank that completely destroys an entire family in its station wagon and dolls that kill husband and wife.
