I'm 35. Bruce was the Evil Dead Man, and I still love seeing ED1 and ED2. It was also nice to see him as The King two or three years ago in Bubba Ho Tep where he showed versatility and great acting talent. But this adventure of Screaming Brain is certainly not for the first Bruce fans. I'm either getting too old for this sh17, or I'm not part of Bruce's target audience anymore. I'm a positive guy, from 9 to 13 years old he'll love this movie. But this extended matinee science fiction comedy contains about 5 minutes in total of interesting moments, and the rest is slapstick humor for low-cost children. Campbell talks seriously with Sam Raimi and starts yelling his brain for a final Evil Dead Meeting photo to regain my interest. At least there would be a good director behind the camera ... Sorry Bruce, this doesn't do it for me. Watch out.
