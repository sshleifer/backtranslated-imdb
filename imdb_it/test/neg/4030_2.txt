Oh my God, it's not worse than that !!! I always like the silly little science fiction movies that are so stupid to be funny and I thought it would be one of them, but it was so stupid that it seemed absolutely deplorable that it was released. What were these people thinking? Obviously they are not real filmmakers and I really hope they have returned to their jobs day after realizing that this is the best they could do! Special and not so special acting effects were nowhere near up to the standards of economic B-movies. And what's with men dressed as women, they couldn't find women who wanted to appear in this crappy thing. No, probably not. <br /> <br /> I would give this a "0" if possible, it doesn't even deserve a "1" for terrible. Don't waste time (and especially not your money) on this horrible loser of a non-movie!
