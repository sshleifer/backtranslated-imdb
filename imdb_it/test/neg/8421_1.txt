One of the worst gay related movies I've ever seen. As these are not characters in this story, it is difficult to comment on the actual film. Therefore, since Colton Ford (also called Glen) has set his life open to everyone, I think it is a fair game to criticize. And it's not hard to do. Here it is. 50 something Glen is a great pornstar who wants fame and fortune as a very successful singer. (I guess the movies make him a "star") Being gay and forty, I saw porn and I didn't recognize him or his lover. Personally they are all the same for me with different hairstyles. Admit it, guys, it's not Jeff Stryker, Jim Bently or Casey Donovon. Okay, though. The purpose of these films is about 6.5 minutes, so everyone has pretty much the same requirements, if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> So Glen wants to be a serious (legitimate) singer after he dumps the porn industry but can't convince anyone to take it seriously. I wonder why? He was so stupid to think he could paint his clothes and have sex on the film. And according to the film, it's not just about porn movies in which he indulges, he lives in a house with other "stars" where people can connect to their bedroom, bathroom and anywhere via webcam. It's $ 500 an hour to entertain at a private party. Strip concerts at optional "hotels" for clothing. Do something called meth that I assume is a drug. And then you have the balls to get angry when someone at a club concert tries to touch you ---- because it's "legitimate" now. Oy! <br /> <br /> The only interesting character, not in cardboard, is the gay writer who won the Oscar and who did not want to give his name. And considering this is a documentary, well, porn is like porn. You can say that he is more amused by the stupid porn star pornography. <br /> <br /> Glen has a hip-nellie (Kyle) manager who wants to "sell" him as a porn participant hoping to make him gay gigs, try to do Svengalli's routine. "Wear this" "Don't smile" "say this" as it's equivalent to control problems, but our anti-hero won't be controlled or told what to do. the first mistake: I'm not saying that Kyle was right, but if some budding singer starts questioning the manager, he won't go far, like, who's his lawyer has a fool for a client. /> <br /> All this would not have been bad if it hadn't been for a small little piece of information. The drum roll, please. hard to root for someone who - while trying to make his dream come true --- at 50! --- does not work like a normal person. No work. Can you say lazy? And the yelp and "Why don't they accept me?" Sings and dances and after a few months of scraping the surface of the music industry, he shoots, "Because I don't have a recording contract now." Thing? The actors are the waiters. Writers work in low-level newspapers or magazines - whatever. This guy is above that. It's true. He wants his success now only because he has decided to want it. Groan. Whine Whine. His lover leaves him to breastfeed again but I tell you that I wouldn't want that moron to give me medical treatment. Both were useless. Airheads. The film is useless. Unless you like people Whine and Cheeesy stay away. Don't waste your money on the disgusting life of useless people, there are much more interesting things attached to the bottom of your shoe.
