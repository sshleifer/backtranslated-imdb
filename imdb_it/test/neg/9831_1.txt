I don't know if I hate this movie like I did when I saw it two weeks ago, but if you expect the events described on the box, forget it ... it would have been a good movie. The big descent described on the box is nothing compared to the total disparity I saw during this film. If you've seen the HBO Taxi Cab confessions, this is the same thing, just imaginary, and nowhere near interesting. If you really want to see something interesting about a taxi driver, check out the 20 minutes they run on Encore from time to time ... actually it's worth watching. I never, ever asked for my money back for a movie until I saw this ... thing. Boring, boring, boring. It offers a unique trait, which is this: it lets you decide what happens to each of the passengers, letting your imagination fill in the gaps. It would be great, if you really care about any of these people. Instead I found myself shouting at the screen, crying like a baby, praying for the end of the film or my death. The taxi driver himself (even if well interpreted, considering) runs through seemingly random emotions, from sarcastic to sympathetic to lunatic madman to apathetic. Sometimes it's appropriate, most of the time it's just a display for your own interest. "Damn, I learned all these emotions during the acting class, and I'll use them!" Now that I've thought about it, I hate this movie as much as I do!
