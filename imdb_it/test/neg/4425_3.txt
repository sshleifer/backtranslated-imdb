As many have described here with a level of seriousness that I find amusing, this is * not *: <br /> <br /> A FILM. (cue dramatic music) <br /> <br /> It's just such a bad-it's good, totally surreal, Jackie Chan stunt-for-all. The women fighters are totally kicked and Jackie is definitely put in his place. <br /> <br /> This is the movie you want to see with some good friends on a Sunday afternoon - surrounded by munchies, ready to burst out laughing, cheer up good guys, whistle the bad guys, and continually scream, "WHAT ? " when something completely bizarre happens. Great fun !!
