Is this a pile of garbage badly interpreted by clich√©s? Obviously. Anyone who does not realize that when they collect the box in the video store probably has no right to judge the films in the first place. So, I will now consider the aspects of the film that interest us on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /> <br /> Violence and gore: 4 - For this genre, there are very few deaths, and the blood is almost non-existent. Anyone looking for some blood should probably look elsewhere. The only thing that redeems is the fact that children are doing these horrible things, which raises the bar a little. <br /> <br /> Suspense: 1 - Ok, I feel bad for anyone who gets scared by this trio of crazy <br /> <br /> Nudity / sex: 7 - A lot of boobage by three different women, one of which is the vv Julie Brown of MTV. There are two sex scenes, but little is shown in them. <br /> <br /> Involuntary humor - 4 - There are some good laughs with children trying to behave in a scary way, but all in all, it's just bad, not badly bad. <br /> <br /> Total - 4 - Not unwatchable. There are some funny moments and enough nudity to keep your attention for the whole movie. However, watch this movie only if you are a big fan of 80s slasher movies. This certainly falls at the bottom of the ladder, but is not completely at the bottom. The real downside is the disappointing ending. It almost ruined the film for me.
