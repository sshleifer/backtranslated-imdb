pity this film is not. While "Nemesis Game" is pleasantly fun, I found it difficult to suspend disbelief for the entire duration of the film, especially the situations in which Sara was putting herself. Should we believe that: <br /> <br /> 1) will this hot chick skid unarmed around abandoned buildings and dark underground tunnels in the middle of the night just to solve some puzzles? <br /> <br /> 2) the protagonists are presumably such experts who play puzzle games for fun, but don't put all the "I Never Sinned" riddle together until the end ... and then ... and then ... take this ... must do the whole thing in the mirror to finally put the pieces together ?? I know it was the director's device that showed the public what was going on, but they really think we're so stupid? <br /> <br /> 3) when Vern and Sara go to Chez M to interrogate the blonde, there is no topless chick in the whole building. Nada. Come on, come on. I know it's Canada, but I would expect more from a country that gave us Shannon Tweed. <br /> <br /> And everyone else noticed that when Vern was surfing the web and discovered that riddlezone site, that when he hovered over the cursor, an arrow remained, and it didn't turn into a small hand (HOW ALL THE CURSORS MAKE WHEN CLICKING ON A HYPERLINK)?!? I mean, if you want the internet to play such an important role in your film, at least take the right little things. Damn.
