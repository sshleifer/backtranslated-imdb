Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance are legendary actors, and director Kostas Karagiannis was the man behind the yellow-and-thriller thriller Death Kiss in 1974; yet when you combine the three talents, all you get is this full drivel load! God knows what prompted Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance to act in this devil cult movie, but I really hope they were well paid because neither of them deserve something as amateurish as this in their resumes. The story focuses on a group of devil worshipers who kidnap some children, leading another group to follow them. The rhythm of the plot is very slow and this ensures that the film is very boring. The plot is also far from being original and anyone who also has a passing interest in the horror genre will have seen something like this, and no doubt has done much better. The obvious lack of budget is felt everywhere and the film fails to overcome this at any time. This is really a depressing and miserable watch and not even a decent end can lift the mail enough to lift this film from the bottom of the barrel. Extremely poor things and definitely not recommended!
