It was only the second year of the Academy, but they were already voting politically - the brilliant performance of Jeanne Eagels in this talkative had to settle for an Oscar and the statuette went to the worst performance ever won - Mary Pickford's in COQUETTE. The only existing print was a working print without music or final editing, but wherever it is shown, Eagels stuns and fascinates with its captivating and powerful performance. She is so convincing on the witness stand that while we know that she is lying between her teeth (after all we saw her kill the man), we in the audience find ourselves, like the jurors, believing in her innocence, before we suddenly take ourselves. THAT IS GREAT TO ACT. The film must be made available on video so that the world can once again enjoy this formidable performance.

Run to see it (when it came out of the archives that will be shown in New York in the early 1970s, Village Voice printed a full page review, adoring the Eagles performance.
