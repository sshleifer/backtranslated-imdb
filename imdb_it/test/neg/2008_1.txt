Well, there are about 1,000 years in the future and we have finally violated the journey for the great distance between the galaxies !! Unfortunately, we still use the guns that shoot bullets, the black men are still called the brothers, they are unleashing, fighting, arguing and so on. The common stereotypical urban black men are still getting the shorter part of the stick! Girls with tight black rubber pants that seem to belong to Baywatch closely share the captain and crew. Paralyzed people still need wheelchairs to get around, beauty treatments, prosthetics or robotic legs. Dracula still looks and acts gay. I have to move on ... In short, this move was shot on a typical low-budget science fiction set, actors, and no real special effects to talk about. The beginning, the center and the ending were pathetic. I have to go shoot myself and now there's nothing left to live for.
