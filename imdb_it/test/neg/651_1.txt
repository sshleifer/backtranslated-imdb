I didn't know that when I signed the "all pay channel" package with Direct TV I would have faced a film like this. He came right after another movie we were watching ... and I was a teenager in 1981 so I'm not sure where I was then ... but I lost this movie. <br /> <br /> I too can't believe we left it. It's pretty funny because it takes you back in time to the early 80s ... but I think even then it would have been a painful movie. It was just ... well ... "too cute"! ET was "cute" in a sense ... but not hideously cute ... and stupid. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie like this ... I come to IMDb to see what others are saying. I'm amazed that this thing has been named! Wow ... the movie industry has come a long way since the 1980s! Oh well ... it showed some old actors ... well, that's the other thing that surprised me ... the lineup ... not a bunch of no-names ... but some real actors / actresses. It must have been on their drug days! Anyway ... weird, interesting, bizarre, and it makes everyone happy they've grown up!
