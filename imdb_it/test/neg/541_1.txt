This astounding budget sink is the kind of film that can only be made in the UK because, anywhere in the world, the fact that a market needs to exist before a green light is given. Most likely self-financed, this is clearly an attempt to correct important issues, but ultimately undermines its point of existence as demand must be begging, who would ever put money to distribute this and second if a market audience does not exist for watch, buy or rent this movie, why would anyone care in the first place? My opinions may seem unfairly harsh to a first time director, but this is the kind of film that only goes to undermine the commercial viability and quality standards that have just maintained a British film industry.
