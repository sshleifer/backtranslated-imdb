If you think it's nice to be obsessive about who you are in love with, then I can imagine giving it a good grade ... but I can't imagine this issue of obsession and little respect for others (like the way Paulie treats teachers trying to help her) is all you would like to teach your children. Yes, it's also negative how Victoria treated Paulie, but guess what. That's life. Isn't it a more important lesson to learn how to overcome these disappointments and make the most of your life? Or is a better lesson to teach our children falling off the roof? Secondly, when Mary's father didn't show up for dinner, and Paulie helped Mary release her anger, that Mary even said she wanted to be dead ... Somehow I don't think this is a good message or that you are dealing with your disappointments through anger.
