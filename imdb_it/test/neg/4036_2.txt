I had the terrible misfortune of having to see this "b-movie" in its entirety. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is --- save time and money !!! This must be the worst b-movie of all time, it shouldn't even be called a b-movie, more like an f-movie! Because it fails in all the aspects that make a good film: the story is not at all interesting, all the actors are very thin and not at all credible, it has bad direction and the action sequences are so fake that it's almost funny .. .. ... almost. <br /> <br /> The movie is crammed with horrible one-liners that no respectable person could find funny at least. <br /> <br /> This film is supposed to be geared towards men, but all the women in it are so absolutely unattractive, especially that old wrinkled thing that comes towards the end. They try to look sexy in those strange and horrible costumes and fail miserably !!! <br /> <br /> Even some of the most ridiculous b-movies will still give you laughter, but this is too painful to watch !!
