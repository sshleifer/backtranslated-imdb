My boyfriend and I decided to go see this movie after hearing on the radio that it was a good movie to watch, even up there with "Cars". Within the first ten minutes of the film, I was horrified. For beginners, cows, which should be females, had male voices. Then I realized that they should really be boys. I put the transvestite cows aside for a while and tried to keep watching the movie with an open mind, but it was so trivial that I couldn't help but shake my head. I probably checked my phone about ten times to see if it was almost over. The plot was decent, if not predictable, but it took a long time to reach his point. I had difficulty sitting and I am 19 years old. The children in the theater were rising and running up and down the corridors. I seemed to be joining them. But my biggest problem with the film was that it was full of references to drinking, not to mention the fact that cows / bulls actually connected and stole a car, then drank and drove, burst into a boy's house to push it out of bed (he deserved it though), then he ran away from the police, which the film's authors made look like terrible people. This is not the kind of thing I want my child to be exposed to. There is a lot of this in the real world, if I wanted my son to look at the boys while they drink and drive and lead the policemen in a chase, I would deploy them in front of the 10 o'clock news. Movies for children should be an escape from reality, not an escape into ridicule. What happened to good morals and the happy ending that children's films used to boast about? That's why the old Disney movies, like Beauty and the Beast, Lady and the Tramp, The Little Mermaid, etc. They are classic. If you want your children to see a big cartoon with the same plot as "Barnyard", rent "The Lion King". You can get a great story without the terrible drinking and driving and the big car theft references. The screenwriters of "Barnyard" were obviously trying to continue the great tendency to make a film for children that even a parent could like, but they did it with bad taste. I would never take my children to see it, and I suggest you save your money and look at something else.
