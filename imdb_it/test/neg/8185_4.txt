On the opening night of the San Francisco Silent film festival I was pretty excited to see historical and uncommon films. The guest speaker who opened this film created a sense of hype towards darkness, and how this film is undervalued. The science fiction part of the film was very interesting and fantastic for its time, but I'm not sure it was due to the fact that it was shown directly after the Brilliant 1928 "The Wind" or if it seemed like the Russian directors took after that for which Russian novels (hundreds of characters, intricate plots) are famous but I know for sure that the dramatic parts, as in the parts of the Earth, made absolutely no sense, they were boring and I lost myself in about twenty minutes. Maybe it was acting, but I found myself convinced of why this film is "unknown and undervalued": it's boring, there is no basic plot or plot and the acting is horrible. This certainly is not a "battleship Potemkin", however I will say that Russian films are not a real effort to illuminate life in Russia.
