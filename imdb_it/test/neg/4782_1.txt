God! Where do I start? From start to finish, I couldn't help but hate this movie. Vines? Screws that make cell phone noises?! Oh yes, I'm so scared - I'm going to free the weeds of the earth! Come on people! The plot didn't go anywhere, when the group discovered the ruin, and the people of the village (no pun) came to warn them and wielded their weapons in front of their faces, don't worry, Amy (Jena Malone) was there for take pictures! That whole scene really asked me why he didn't photograph his boyfriend, Jeff (Johnathon Tucker), by cutting Mathias's legs (Joe Anderson). When the idiots first threw the rope after Mathias, how the rope was at least ten feet from the ground, but how he finally managed to find himself only two or four feet from the ground. I can't start covering up everything that's wrong with this movie, there's just too much to cover. I will say that the graphics up to the gore was fantastic, but it was nothing since the acting and the script were so terribly bad.
