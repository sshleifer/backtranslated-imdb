I couldn't wait to see a continuation of Lonesome Dove, but this was total rubbish. The cinematography was terrible. Shot too tight. He was almost looking at the Grand Canyon through a stationary telescope. The modification was cut, cut, cut. Not even smooth. More like a bad student editor. I don't know if McMurtry ran the screen but the dialogue was terrible. I really like Val Kilmer's portrait of Doc Holiday to Wyatt Earp, but what on earth was he doing with this character in Comanche Moon ??? I have no idea. It even looked like it was shot on a sound stage using the old Bonanza sets. How can the director of the original Lonesome Where to have gone so badly in this? Where was his head .............. I can't say too much for acting. It is a pity to have messed up a western so beautiful that it could have been but more as if he had hurried to do it just to let him in. I read other reviews and saw that others felt the same way. Not even curious to see the next few nights because it would only be a waste of time as the first night was. <br /> <br /> (2nd post) .............. .... OK, since nothing else was on TV, I have to be honest and admit that I saw the last 2 nights of Comanche Moon. And I will be honest to tell you that I have not arrived at the end of any of the last 2 episodes because I fell asleep! I can only admit that I was looking at the two main characters very closely and that I could catch some of the mannerisms that Steve Zahn did while portraying the character with whom Duval did an excellent job. So I have to give Zahn credit for this. As for the portrait of Karl Urban ... simple dead meat. I can only say again that I was very disappointed just because I worried so much about the original LD ​​and like the others ....... I defended my feelings for a truly exceptional western.
