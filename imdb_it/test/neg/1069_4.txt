I'm sure some people will have fun, and they will find it powerful, or they will have a sort of personal connection with the characters and the story, but from an impartial point of view, it is not very well done. The film revolves around atypical adolescents, full of anguish, each with a different stereotype that makes us believe that this is like being a teenager. Let's look at the lifestyle of every teenager, but the whole project seemed very pretentious to me, whether it's the continuous corner shootings of tree branches in the wind, or black and white "interviews" with the students , there was nothing new or original on display in this film, and nothing that I needed to see. Yes, it is strong material and the dramatic scenes are interpreted and performed well, but the whole project seems unnecessary, especially when it almost seems like an exact replica of Van Sant's "Elephant" (one who deals with suicide, the another with a shooting school). As I said, some people will probably appreciate this, and the director / screenwriter has clearly had some sort of inspiration to make this movie based on the death of a strait, so it's nice that the film was made with a little heart, I feel it's incredibly ineffective and when it comes to material that can easily be clicked to do something original with it. I would not recommend this movie.
