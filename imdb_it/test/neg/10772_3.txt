After reading the books and seeing the 1982 version of Seymour Anthony Andrews / Jane <br /> <br />, I have to say that it's not good at all. <br /> <br /> According to the books, Percy is supposed to be an aristocrat apparently <br /> <br /> foppish when he is the Percy, and witty and intelligent <br /> <br /> when he is the Pimpernel, but here he just seems bored like <br /> Percy and means like the Pimpernel. Marguerite should be <br /> <br /> the most beautiful woman in Europe, not a tired and discouraging-looking matron (she seems to be middle-aged, probably due to a bad make-up). Richard E. Grant has done much better things, and Elizabeth McGovern's acting is not inspired and flat. The ingenuity and the dash of the books and the Andrews / Seymour film are here replaced by <br /> <br /> from a brilliant and flashy montage that does not make the cut. <br /> <br /> I could add it to a person who has not seen any previous version <br /> <br /> or read the book, it would probably be ok.
