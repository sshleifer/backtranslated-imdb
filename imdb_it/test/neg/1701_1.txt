I have just seen this "newer" version of Macbeth and I was pleasantly surprised by the solid acting and the obvious effort that had to turn a low budget historical piece into a full-fledged movie. <br /> <br /> One note however, the music was very lame and added nothing to the intensity of the film and sounded like someone with a keyboard and a group of samplers compared to a full orchestral soundtrack. I think Paul Farrer needs to get on stage !!!
