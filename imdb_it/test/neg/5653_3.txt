Miranda Cosgrove is known for her "School of Rock" debut with Jack Black and her role as Megan on the "Drake and Josh" show and has become a favorite with fans of the Nickelodeon audience, so it's no surprise that Dan Schneider would create a show just for her. Unfortunately, it ends up being the worst, if not the worst, of "The Amanda Show". <br /> <br /> "iCarly" is about three friends, Carly, Sam and Freddie, who have become idols in the junior high community through a webcam show called "iCarly". Carly and Sam are the hosts and Freddie shoots and puts it on the internet. Carly also has an older brother named Spencer, played by the hilarious Jerry Trainor, known for his work in "Drake and Josh" as Crazy Steve. <br /> <br /> Well, let me tell you this. I don't think that 8.3 out of 10 of this show has been received because it's pathetic in almost every aspect. Dan Schneider probably spent about 5 minutes studying adolescent interests because all I see is him saying "iPod? IPhone? IHome? Aha! Teenagers love anything that starts with" me "!" and most of the concerts that have been used in "Drake and Josh", if they are not so, are just very dry and forced jokes that do not even count a small laugh of generosity, like "Do you want me to turn the AC for 60 degrees? "" No. We want you to turn it into 60 pickles! " Not only that, but if you look closely, almost all of the show sets have been used in "Drake and Josh" and "Ned's Declassified" which were simply spit-and-polished with random things to try to make it different. <br /> <br /> The scenes in which the show shows an iCarly network broadcast is as terrible as the entire series itself. The dialogue in them is atrociously bad, which can be accepted by some, since they are just two friends playing in front of a camera, but what is the deal with the really strange and humorless antics that they make like "Random Dancing ! "? And it's just worse than that. <br /> <br /> In terms of acting, Miranda and Jennette are not at their best so far. Nathan Kress, who played Freddie, is sometimes not credible, but he does a good job. The person who really steals the show is the humorous feat of Jerry Trainor, who fits very well into his role as "protective big brother" and his gaping-eyed acting can create rather amusing segments. Too bad they are not frequent, because this could have given the show an extra star in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Dan Schneider must have made this show for the sole purpose of giving Miranda Cosgrove their own cable born playground to jump around and unleash unhealthy jokes and pathetic cue-card jokes in every direction, because everyone the others have an exceptional talent buried under the script and weightless acting. Dan Schneider did a great job with "Drake and Josh" so it's a real disappointment that "iCarly" is such a failure. Jerry Trainor's acting saved this show from a 1 in 10 rating, but he can't save "iCarly" alone from being as horrible as it is.
