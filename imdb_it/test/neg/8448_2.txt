This is just one of those movies that can't justify much of everything that happens. These people are going on a journey: the girl wants to photograph animals. There really are no Piranhas, but I guess the psychotic hunter is the real piranha. However, there are many animals and there is a lot of driving. There's a remarkable anti-gun talk, but we all know where it's going. Towards the end, there is a lot of action and a rape thrown in. Someone has to pay, and they do it. It would have been nice to have a couple of piranhas to fill the thing. There were many monkeys. If you advance quickly through the boring parts, you have five minutes.
