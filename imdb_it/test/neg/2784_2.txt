Straight to the video and with good reason. It's like the kids in the neighborhood playing in the garden, but worse. A young man (Don Digiulio) inherits a farm in West Virginia that has been inactive for generations. He decides to take some friends to check the property. This agricultural land produced good corn crops, even during the Great Depression. The secret is that the owner was killing people and watering the fields with their blood. So hang their bodies like scarecrows. The special effects are pretty crappy and the horrible dialogue is full of funny slogans and the jokes are so ridiculous that the sound could be turned off. Gore economic and a fiction of a horror film. Together with Digiulio in the cast: Jeanie Cheek, B.W. York, Booty Chewning and Jessica Dunphy.
