Before the airport 79 'these films were quite good. They had decent special effects, cast of famous actors and good acting. This film has destroyed the franchise, and there are many reasons for this. Let's talk about the special effects WOW !!!! they are horrible, what the director was thinking about. I know it's only 1979, but we look at other films with very good special effects like Star Wars (1977) and Moonraker (1979). I like the idea of ​​the Concord and this could be the best film at the airport, but they did too much with it. What do you think of Joe Patroni (George Kennedey) shooting a flare outside the cockpit window, to prevent a missile looking for heat to try to strike concord. It is also doing 90-degree dives and loops. This completely unbelievable and unrealistic WOW !!!!!! Believe me, the special effects don't help this scene, and I'm really above the poor .... They almost look like cartoons, and that's how the whole movie is !!! Finally we talk about the acting which in my opinion is extremely poor at best at best ... Besides acting it is a big problem in this film, in particular George Kennedy .. I really like him as an actor, but he doesn't cut into this movie. The total blame must go to the director, who has done a terrible job of editing, and he really took out the Airport Franchise. Too bad the Concord is not yet used today it was a marvel of air travel ...
