It is proof that film producers and their financiers treat their public with contempt is not a new phenomenon as was done already in the 1940s and HOUSE OF Dracula is a great example. You'd think you had a movie with Dracula, the wolf man and Frankenstein's monster that the producer would have dictated to the writer to make all three appear in one scene. They had a chance with HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN when they then had a second bite of the cherry they blew it again with HOUSE OF Dracula. Losing a chance is a disgrace, losing two slaps of cynical money making <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the producers are beyond the cure. Larry Talbot reappears even though he was shown to die in the previous film that sums up the cynicism of the franchise. He also shows that poor script is and is abused in some horrible plot, as if Talbot's conditions were cured by a particular type of plant that would soften his skull. I think screenwriter Edward T Lowe could have softened his skull if that's the kind of thing he has in mind <br /> <br /> Director Erie C Kenton can't improve the script and throw in a few keys on his own. For example, Talbot is surprised to see Dr. Edelmann lift a cart on a cart, but nonchalantly he watches Edelmann climb a wall and jump into the castle courtyard. One cannot help but think that Talbot's reaction shots were mistakenly exchanged during the assembly phase. <br /> <br /> Lon Chaney Jnr is famous for his roles in horror films but has not had much career outside of them. Perhaps this is due to the fact that he is not a good actor and here is the worst kind of acting - being very wooden. It is not all his fault, because all the characters speak of rather horrible dialogues and are rather wooden, partly due to the poor direction of Kenton. <br /> <br /> HOUSE OF Dracula feels a million miles from the 1931 James Whale film and its sequel from 1935 and would have been a very sad note to finish. But ironically, Universal decided to make another film to close the franchise with a horror comedy with Abbot and Costello
