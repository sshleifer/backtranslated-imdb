First let me say that I am not a person who usually makes me shudder at having to think while I watch movies, I love Tarkowsky's films, for example, Berghman is also a favorite ..... but this? The positive points can be easily summarized: the photography is splendid and the music is perfect .... does it make a good film? I used to think so, but this is a perfect example of what (to me) doesn't ... maybe it's because I'm too stupid? possible, but I don't think so .... Tarkwosky for example has also used very long shots, but what he never did was to film 5 minutes of the exact same image of two people walking (and I mean only their heads , because in this film there are many of those shots, but sometimes it is effective), the general result is clearly boring, even with the intelligent undertones (which are made in a way that, despite being intelligent, is above all very pedantic) < br /> <br /> you also feel that the director is doing some of the long shots not for aesthetics, or symbolic effect, but only to save on the budget .... <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed in this film, because I really liked the first 30 minutes or so, but it went on and on, without even maintaining the same level as the first scenes .... <br /> <br /> Reading the highly laudatory comments on this page, I also had the feeling that some people try to see a lot of more in the film than there is ... when a film is slow and artistic, it is not necessary arily means that it is very deep ... yes it is an allegory of music theory placed in the context of a small city, which is quite interesting on itself, but it does NOT make a deep film ... except for the people that I absolutely want to do a kind of intellectual masturbation, but then it is not what you find in the film, but what you find in yourself .... an exercise that, in my opinion, can be made much more effective while watching "Stalker" or "Solyaris" by Werckmeister Harmonies, which owes a lot to Tarkowsky, but the taxi is never the same as its level ....
