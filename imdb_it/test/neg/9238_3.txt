**** Probably will contain spoilers **** <br /> <br /> After a successful attempt to attract attention (I wouldn't call to make sure I get help before I die "failed suicide attempt"), Joey finds out about be pregnant and start seeing images of spirits. <br /> <br /> Overall the film was a bit slow, but fun enough to watch it all. For a horror movie, there were only a few little chills and shivers. Halfway, however, it was a really terrifying scene (I don't get it) :) I saw this movie because I really liked the previous film, The Eye. <br /> <br /> I was a little confused, however to determine that, in addition to being a "supernatural suspense" movie by the creators themselves, The Eye 2 had no connection with The Eye, * any *; different cast, different story. The Eye2 doesn't even have anything to do with eyes: <br /> <br /> The film has some questionable scenes: Joey attempts suicide 3 times (4 times, if you count the time that witnesses say they have having seen Joey try to jump in front of the train), is associated with brutally defacing an attacker, gets scared in a restaurant and witnesses say she was "attacking" people and yet she is allowed to do her business freely, without even so much an evaluation of the psyche or hospitalization (for reasons other than pregnancy). <br /> <br /> The film was not the greatest horror film, the story was quite unbelievable (even for a fiction film: P), the spectra were few and / or nothing that we have not seen before. However, it was an "interesting" story and once you know the "truth" behind the fantasies, it was an interesting turning point in the "ghost" story. <br /> <br /> Rated the movie 3 of 10.
