After watching this movie, I felt like I had just eaten a box of old and sturdy cracker jack just to find no prize inside. This film has a real promise: porn stars in a skinemax function! Unfortunately, someone forgot to tell the producers that SOME T&A SOME OF OUR T & A FLICKS !!! Of course, we get some quick flashes and a couple of "bath in the stream" scenes. But where is the sex? How can you have four girls, "female sisterhood" no less, in this kind of movie with a single, pitiful 5 second lesbian scene? Good night, USA Up All Night offers more titillation! Look, we don't watch this kind of film for great photography, screenplay or action. We want to see some knots! What a disappointment.
