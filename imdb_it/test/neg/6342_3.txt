But to be a little more precise, I don't think it's as bad as it could be. Even if the actors (famous for their famous seeds) haven't done a great job. Fault of the administrators? Could it be the script too difficult for me to say? However, if you are looking for a lot of fantastic weapons and action, this is not the movie for you, but they run with a lot of vintage WW2 weapons. A kind of fun :) Well, I guess I can say more but I don't think it's worth it. If you are desperate enough or a Hackman monster you see it otherwise not! <br /> <br /> Live well and prosper
