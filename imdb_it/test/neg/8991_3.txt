The film begins in Latvia immediately after the First World War. Being a history teacher, I knew that multinational troops occupied a large part of Russia during this period. There was serious concern about the spread of Bolshevism and the troops were apparently there to protect the interests of their nations. However, sometimes they carried out missions or had armed conflicts with the Communist army, as the nations involved really wanted to see the so-called "Bianchi" victory. However, the whites were deeply split: some wanted the return of a tsar, some wanted a republic and some wanted something in between. Due to these mixed objectives and the lack of a real commitment by foreign armies, the entire expedition was condemned and left the Soviet Union after only a year or two. However, what I did NOT know was that German troops were also involved. This surprised me, since they had just lost World War I and were not in the best shape to mount such an expedition. <br /> <br /> This is the background of the film, but it also concerns a rich pro-communist lady and her unfortunate love for a childhood friend who is among the German troops. He throws himself against him repeatedly but in any case rejects her. So, you sublimate these desires with various deals. Although none of this sex is all that is graphic, this is the reason why the man is not interested in making this film rather adult and I would not show it to the younger ones. <br /> <br /> While the setting for this film is interesting, the film in general is gray and lifeless like any other I've ever seen. I don't recommend it unless you are an extraordinarily patient person or you are really taken by overrated German films. In particular, I warn anyone who suffers from depression, as it will undoubtedly make the situation worse. The simple fact is that there are so many better German films out there waiting to be seen - like MOSTLY MARTHA, DAS BOOT, MOTHER KUSTERS GOES TO SKY, WINGS OF WISH or ALI, FEAR EATS THE SOUL (among others) .
