The frantic, somewhat petty and childish humor abounds in this city boy who has become a famous peasant tale. It is not scandalous enough to appeal to the crowd of Will Ferrell, and not interesting enough to bring the feature film. The most I can commend "Son In Law" would be to say that for the most part it avoids humor in the toilets. The main problem is that all the characters lack heat, and Pauly Shore is so abrasive that he is a very unlikely hero. There are some fun pieces that involve farm animals, and that's it. The story, what is there, is so simplistic and predictable, makes "Jury Duty" seem like "Gone with the wind". - MERK
