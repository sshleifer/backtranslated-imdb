This film was really terrible. It wasn't scary at all, or even surprising. I went to see him with a group of friends and at the end of the evening we were saying "The ruins ruined my night". <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie in movie theaters, renting it or even watching the movie on television by mistake. It is an absolute waste of an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The plot was almost non-existent, the characters were horribly underdeveloped, and gave no background for everything that was happening, and then left it completely open at the end, as if preparing for a sequel.
