I went to see this movie mainly because it looked so good in the trailers. Robin Williams and Barry Levinson should equal the size. Instead, only Williams' bad film series continues lately. What's wrong with the movie? More than anything else it is right: the crew of the crew does a great job around Robin, and as usual, Christopher Walken is fantastic. That being said, this movie just wasn't right. I really recommend seeing him only if you want to see what it would be like if Jon Stewart were a candidate and president. To say that he won is not a spoiler, since he was in the trailer. The concept and the idea are really fun, but that's all. Most of Robin's jokes are just recycled from his old comedies, and there are very few laughs out loud, and most are just stupid. Like most comedies that are sucked out, all the fun parts are included in the trailer. There really are no surprises, but come on! Some of the films act like a Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn novel! People expected this to be Robin's return to greatness. Instead, it's more a Flubber.
