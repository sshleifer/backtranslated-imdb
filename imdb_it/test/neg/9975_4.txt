I expected "Born to Kill" to be an exciting, high-voltage film noir. Instead, it has two good action pieces (one at the beginning and one at the end) and a wonderfully suggestive cinematography by Robert de Grasse (usually a "glamor" cameraman and a surprising credit for a noir), but the rest of the movie is pretty boring. Lawrence Tierney goes through his psychological football but it is a performance strictly by the numbers, mechanically churning out what the public expected from him after "Dillinger" (an overrated but at least better than this film). The character of Claire Trevor is too stupid and unmotivated to attract the attention of the public, and the action (as it is) remains so resolute in that damn San Francisco house that the film becomes claustrophobic instead of electrifying. It is one of those films in which supportive players - in particular Elisha Cook, Jr. (whose homoerotic itch for Tierney is one of the few subtleties in an otherwise fairly obvious script) and Isabel Jewell - implement the leads. Also, almost half a century after Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins revolutionized the depiction of psychopaths on the screen in "Psycho", Tierney is so coarse and obvious that he might even have "PSYCHO" tattooed on his forehead. Furthermore, there is no indication in the film as to why the original novel was titled "Deadlier than the Male", but perhaps James Gunn made the female characters stronger and more interesting than they are in the film. "Born to Kill" is a real disappointment for Robert Wise, who already had some quality films behind him and who would embark on a stellar career.
