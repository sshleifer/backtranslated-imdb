Rossini once described the work of rival composer Wagner as "some wonderful moments ... and some horrible quarter of an hour". Inuyasha, apparently, can also be described in this way. It has many fantastic episodes, but among these there are countless episodes of filling. The entire series consists of about 175 episodes, of which I would say that at least 125 are fillers or a sort of subframe (I didn't bother to count and I wouldn't be surprised if that number was actually higher, though). <br /> <br /> Some of these filling episodes are actually quite enjoyable, although many are rather stupid or boring. However, constant digressions begin to deteriorate after the first few seasons, while the plot ends up progressing during the scan for most series. Even the development of the character slows down considerably and in subsequent seasons, the cast has become quite unchanging, with the result of increasingly stale jokes (in particular those concerning the monk, whose ironic traits begin with a certain humor but become boring when the jokes they associate with them appear repeatedly). <br /> <br /> However, this does not mean that Inuyasha is a bad series. The way in which Neon Genesis Evangelion, for example, is generally considered is simply not a great series. As something to look at the end of a difficult day, it's beautiful, but it could never be confused with high art.
