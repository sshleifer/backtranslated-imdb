I didn't really hate Mirrormask. I really wanted more from a movie than a nice graphic. The film begins with a girl named Helana who works in a circus. But while other children (presumably) want to escape to the circus, she just wants to escape from the circus. During a heated discussion with her mother, Helana would like her to die. Wrong move. The mother gets sick of ... something (presumably cancer) and needs surgery. The night before the intervention she dreams of traveling in a wonderful world composed of her dreams and nightmares in which she "finds herself". Personally the film made me sick as soon as he started dreaming. The first scenes show the strange and wonderful world of the circus and then contrast it with the squalor of the hospital and the dirtiness of a condominium. But as soon as he dreams, the whole film moves to the land of CGI, where almost everything is an image of a computer. The problem is that this dream world does not have the mystery and wonder it should have. while films like the Wizard of Oz seemed tempting to explore Mirrormask stuffing images into our faces and then tearing them away to give us another image. There is little rhyme or reason in the design of this film and although some things are very nice (the librarian is a masterpiece), they disappear so quickly that they are soon forgotten. Helana and her partner Valentine are annoying at best and unbearable at worst. Overall, Mirrormask is like a good bet that you bite and discover that it is actually ash. Stick to real world children.
