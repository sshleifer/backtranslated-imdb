I had a bad time watching this movie. Unless you are very pro-adultery and love to hear people talking WITHOUT PART of their sexual prowess, I can't see how you could enjoy this movie. Geez: most of the main characters behaved like a weasel and their infidelity on their many infidelities became boring. About the only element of what I appreciated was the DISGUSTING scene in which the only character was urinating and the blood was splashed everywhere because he had picked up an STD --- BIG SURPRISE!?! Hmm. <br /> <br /> If you want a GOOD movie, watch the sequel, Barbarian Invasions. Despite the general unlikely nature of many of the characters, the sequel is VERY engaging and more realistic - it's worth dedicating your time.
