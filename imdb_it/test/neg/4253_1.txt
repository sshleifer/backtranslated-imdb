I don't see why everyone loves this movie so much. True, it has good intentions and meaning, but it is not possible to compensate for such a poor script. Woody Allen is a brilliant film producer, but I'm afraid this is just a piece of junk. It is extremely predictable and the topic is too visible. I happen to be a big fan of Woody Allan and I love most of his work, but I can't recommend it.
