While I was coming home after work, I bought some movies for my four-year-old twins. I bought this movie that my kids would love. I saw it with my children. My 10 and 17 year old were about to vomit. In this film, the dad acts like a tard. My little ones would watch it every day. One day, they threw away all our films. I sold the Omosis Jones movie on Ebay. My Grade: F ++++++++++++++++ I'd rather be seen in the worst list of clothes. <br /> <br /> My kids hate this stupid movie. If it gives the idea that germs can talk to each other. I wonder how the stupid movie sounds in Japanese. I broke the CD halfway when I was irritated to see it again and again. No offense but, the acting of Brandy and Elena was the best
