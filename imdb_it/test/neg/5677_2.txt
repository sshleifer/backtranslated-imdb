This show was an extraordinary idea, fresh and innovative in the 70s, when it was first broadcast. The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but things went later. In 1990, the show was no longer fun, and continued its decline as well as the complete waste of time it is today. <br /> <br /> It's really shameful how far this show has fallen. The script is painfully bad, the performances are almost as bad - if it weren't for the guests' delicate break, this show probably wouldn't be on the air yet. I find it so hard to believe that the same creator who selected the original cast by hand also chose the hack band that followed. How can we recognize this brilliance and therefore consider it appropriate to replace it with such mediocrity? I felt I had to give 2 stars for respect to the original cast that made this show a huge success. As it is now, the show is simply horrible. I can't believe it's still on the air.
