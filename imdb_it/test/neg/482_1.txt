I love the so-called "blaxploitation" movies and have seen them dozens. Some, like COTTON, come to HARLEM, SHAFT and HAMMER have excellent production values ​​and are very funny, while many others are very cheap and foolish, but still fun, like the BROTHERHOOD OF DEATH or COFFY. However, DOLEMITE handles something rare for the genre: it's just cheap and silly and no less fun! It's like blaxploitation made for very, very stupid people. <br /> <br /> Years ago, I saw a take-off on Dolemite movies on "Mad TV" and unfortunately, the real DOLEMITE is no better. Like the parody, the acting is simply atrocious. Rudy Ray Moore has all the charm and charisma of a piece of balsa wood. He can barely read his lines and his "karate" is a joke - with his kicks he obviously misses the target again and again. As for the rest of the actors, many could be even worse. My favorite was the FBI guy who couldn't even remember his lines and really struggled to get them out - yet they didn't even bother to reprogram these scenes! In fact, much of it was inept that I had difficulty understanding if the film was intended as a joke. <br /> <br /> If you think that despite the action and the horrible action there is something worth watching this film, you're wrong. Even for the perverts out there hoping to see some skin, they will be disappointed. Naked women in the movie really look like unlucky prostitutes and there's nothing remotely sexy in their sagging bodies. I think looking at naked old people - REACTIONALLY naked old people - is no worse than looking at these "ladies". And as for Rudy Ray, he has "man boobs". No black superhero or antihero should look so bad !! For goodness sake, wear your clothes and create a script that does not seem written by Winos !!! <br /> <br /> FYI - Apparently, there are actually sequels of this movie! ! I can't imagine watching them, so you'll just have to find someone else to examine them. I saw PLAN 9 FROM THE EXTERIOR SPACE, THE TEENAGERS FROM THE FOREIGN SPACE AND THE WORLD OF ROBOTS, but I don't think I can bring another film on Dolemite: I'm so sick!
