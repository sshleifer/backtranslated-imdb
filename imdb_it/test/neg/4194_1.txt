Completely agree with other reviews. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for about 5 minutes. I searched for the only review on another site and found that it wasn't even a real sequel. This happened after I slowly got away from the TV with the remote control in hand, with the jaw coming down lower and lower. <br /> <br /> The quality of the footage goes beyond the low budget. It doesn't even look like a scary movie. If I watched a "home video" movie from a documentary, I would expect it. <br /> <br /> In summary: avoid, avoid avoiding it. Boooo Lion's Gate! <br /> <br /> I am completely ashamed of myself for watching 5 minutes and hope to have saved others from renting or possession.
