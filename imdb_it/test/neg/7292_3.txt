When I put this film in my DVD player, and sat down with a coke and some fries, I had expectations. I was hoping that this film contained some of the strengths of the first film: Awsome animation, good flowing history, excellent voice cast, funny comedy and a kick-ass soundtrack. But, to my great disappointment, none of this is found in Atlantis: Milo's Return. I had read some reviews before, maybe I wouldn't have been so disappointed. The following paragraph will be directed to those who have seen the first film, and those who have enjoyed it mainly for the points mentioned. <br /> <br /> When the first scene appears, you are in shock if you have just chosen Atlantis: Milo's return from the window of your local video store (or anything else), and I had the expectations I had . The music seems a bad imitation of the first film, and the vocal cast has been replaced by a less suitable one. (Except for some characters, like the voice of Sweet). Real drawings are not so bad, but animation in particular is sad. The plot is also quite weak, as it is more like three Schooby-Doo episodes than the single adventurous story we had last time. But don't get me wrong, they are not good Schooby-Doo episodes. I didn't laugh once, even though I could have giggled once or twice. <br /> <br /> To the public who has not seen the first film, or who does not particularly care about a similar sequel, here is a quick review of this film as an independent product: if you liked schooby-doo, you could like this movie. If you didn't, you could still enjoy this movie if you have nothing else to do. And I suspect it could be a good children's movie, but I wouldn't know. It would have been better if Milo's Return had been a series of three episodes on a comic book channel or on breakfast TV.
