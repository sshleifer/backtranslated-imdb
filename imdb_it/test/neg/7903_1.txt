Well, for starters, I've become black as black, and I can tell you that it's very sad when blacks think a "black movie" sucks. I can't say I've ever seen a poorly directed film or a worse plot. <br /> <br /> Snoop is my dawg and all but he didn't hear this movie at all, I don't know I know how much they paid to be in this shit bucket called a movie, but I hope it's enough to wash the smell . <br /> <br /> I'm all in support of a movie for the two, but this was bad, really very bad. Chuck blew in every aspect, no real plot, the story sucked, the cast couldn't act and the best was the white guy! <br /> <br /> I almost asked for a refund for my exit from the theater door, half of the crowd raised and left before it ended, I still want to have it too. Save yourself some pain and go see something else, anything else ...
