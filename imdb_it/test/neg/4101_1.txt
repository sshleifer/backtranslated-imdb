What could have been a good story has been destroyed by the ridiculous time travel scenario. If something in the past had been altered that changed evolution and humans never developed, the time machine would never have been built. If something from the past was brought into the present, it would have no effect on the past. <br /> <br /> I really would like film producers to pass on their ideas to a real scientist before finishing the script. Even if you suspend the reality and believe that time travel is possible, you must respect logic. <br /> <br /> OTOH, Ben Kingsley seemed to enjoy his top performance. All the other actors seemed to be doing the best they could. It was the writing that made them bend to the wind. <br /> <br /> "Back to the future" has handled it better.
