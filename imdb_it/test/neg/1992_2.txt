Coward and cynical, "The Hospital" represents the nadir of Paddy Chayefsky's special brand that celebrates the status quo disguised as a satire. <br /> <br /> Thanks to director Arthur Hiller, this ridiculous script becomes visually ugly, an unwelcome presentation it deserves. <br /> <br /> Only a great performance by George C. Scott, in the role of petty spirits that he was born to interpret, prevents "The Hospital" from being a complete disaster. <br /> <br /> Ironically, however, Scott's performance makes spectators a disservice. Its magnetism keeps them looking when they could turn off the VCR and clean the cabinets, look at the clouds or see "Baywatch" replicas. Surely, anyone who invests emotionally _ modern medicine apparently out of place _ will feel deceived by the sad payment, where Chayefsky reveals that the system works well, so leave your roadway. <br /> <br /> While the first half of this film provides some funny black comedies, everything turns out to be a red herring. But before that becomes clear, Chayefsky gives some good jokes to Scott as his middle-aged white middle-class male interlocutor. <br /> <br /> Bitter, alcoholic, powerless, Dr. Herbert Bock of Scott has alienated those who know him best, and he has the bile of continuing to alienate them. In Chayefsky's view of the world, all of this naturally makes Bock a magnet for a hippie chick of half his age. <br /> <br /> Reproduction of a collection of adjectives, the woman with long hair, long legs, without legs and almost without bust Rigg fights for "the girl". The British Rigg is uncomfortable as a free spirit of the southwest, but any other actress could also struggle. Like the rest of a good wasted cast, Rigg can't get past a script that isn't interested in any character except Bock, or any philosophy beyond banality. <br /> <br /> For fans of George C. Scott, this is another turning point in the stars and worth looking at. For black comedy fans, turn it off after the first 45 minutes. For anyone else, don't worry.
