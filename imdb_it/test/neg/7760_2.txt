Yes, I could not stop yawning, nor my partner. Incredibly boring - 90 minutes seemed to stretch to at least 3 hours - and I'm not even a fan of action films, but this one just falls asleep - unless you're a fan of 70s polo neck sweaters! <br /> <br /> ** SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW ** If you were expecting something to happen, don't hold your breath - it's not like that! <br /> <br /> But seriously, it fails to convince or engage the observer. It's like a long, boring and rather bumpy dream. Frederic crosses it, manages to leave work whenever he wants, and with attractive secretaries who constantly bring tea and messages. Obviously not real life! And an office with virtually no paper or files - just a giant calendar to let you know that the movie really takes 6 months to watch. <br /> <br /> Federico never seems to be touched by any real emotion, neither his wife nor the children behave like rag dolls - in stark contrast to real life. Even Chloe, despite her strong points of view, never gives the impression of really feeling anything. The only 3 seconds of any real feeling occurs between a supervised couple in a bar, and they have nothing to do with the plot. <br /> <br /> Okay, so maybe there are some moral considerations, but if it's entertainment, or even the good cinematography you're looking for, I think this movie is incredibly overrated by most other viewers.
