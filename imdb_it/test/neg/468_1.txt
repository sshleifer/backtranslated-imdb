what a waste of a film, once again the film industry does not trust to make a film that could only concern the ideas of man. there is practically nothing in his theories or evolution, instead the more boring story of domestic life and the relationship with a daughter, a ponderous script, great freedoms taken with Darwin's life, dialogue given to his character that I find hard to believe would have expressed. Darwin never gave up his belief in a higher power, he may not have rightly believed in God's established Christian idea, but he was not an atheist. what this movie implies. what would have been a compelling and much better film, is if they had started with the publication of "On the Origin of Species" and built a story of the great revolution that ensues, and of an extraordinary cast of characters involved from all sides. instead we have a boring drama, mostly rigged, a great injustice
