That was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Why would anyone make a film about getting away with murder!?! Mr. Allen again plays the only type of character who is able, the sexually stunted man who can't get the girl. You hear a clue, Allen, there's a reason that's the only character you can successfully portray. Avoid this movie! It's a waste of time, unless you want to know how to kill someone successfully. I'm sorry for the actors who say "yes" to Woody Allen. Watch his cast and tell me how many of those people are still working. My respect for all the actors, who work for him, goes down immediately because they chose to participate in the film.
