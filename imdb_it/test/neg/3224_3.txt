This movie could be o.k. if not for all the language in it. I think the plot itself isn't bad, but I'd be too embarrassed to let my wife or children see the movie. I know that children will learn all the bad words along the way in the end, it's true, but parents should not assist them in the process by allowing them to see and hear things in the guise of entertainment. <br /> <br /> I used enough to Robert Loggia; he has a distinctive gritty quality with that rough voice of his, but in the last few years all I've seen in him are roles with a lot of language in them. If we had a prize for excessive use of the word F, he should have been a contender. Unfortunately, I think he's lost me as a fan now. When I see his name in films in the future, I will think twice about collecting that title. <br /> <br /> Look, I'm not a prude. Sometimes I use language even in extreme circumstances, but when we watch a film it is for the sake of E N T E R T A I N M E N T, something that we hope will bring us joy and escape. I don't want to be reminded of what's happening in the streets of a big city these days, and it's a pain to have to wonder if a movie is suitable for my family to watch. <br /> <br /> I also like Matt Modine, but it's a shame that he has associated himself with a photo that has lowered his image in this way. He probably did an o.k. I work in the film, but I turned off about 1/4 after having had my ears attacked once too often by others in the cast. Why can't these actors simply say no when these scripts ask them to continue with this bad language? Once enough actors, (especially the big names), raise a fuss about it, the writers will stop putting it in the movies! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can't recommend this image. It's a shame, because I think it would probably have been all right, if it had been done well enough for decent families to watch! Thank God I only wasted $ 2.00!
