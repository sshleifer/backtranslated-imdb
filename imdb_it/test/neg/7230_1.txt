Oh wow, the character shares my name by name! Nick! This film is as bad as the first, if not worse. Well, at least there's a real octopus in this movie. A real octopus that looks better in this movie. To put it better, "Longer" the acting is rather dry and it is difficult to sit. Just to let you know, when this ninety-minute movie ends not only does it free you from your couch but you get your ability to breathe. Not only that, but you realize how stupid you are and then commit suicide, realizing how horrible life is after seeing this movie. Really, it shows how desperate horror films are today, the more bullshit they are realizing and where the hell are the true masters of horror? This film should have been the last straw so that we can bring the genes of cinema back to horror cinema, which could make some GOOD modern horror films the bites of this film.
