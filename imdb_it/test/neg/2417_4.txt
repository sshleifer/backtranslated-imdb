If you are not old enough to remember Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan here is the overview: they are a couple of producers and producers of Israeli films who founded the Cannon film company in the early 1980s. The only Israeli to have a worse press than these two was Menachim Begin. Initially it probably deserved the bad press, but Globus and Golan were a god he sent to film producers because it didn't matter how bad the script was. They happily finance your film and normally employ directors who cannot direct and actors who could not act. In fact, you have often had the impression that people simply walked towards Yoram and Menahem asking them for some money and that they would oblige without seeing the director's curriculum. If today only the producers were so confident. <br /> <br /> THE YOUNG WARRIORS is not a Cannon film, but Globus and Golan have funded it and have their signature everywhere. He is misdirected, misinterpreted, badly written, but it is the script that comes out and attacks you with his terribleness. It starts with a group of high school athletes involved in all sorts of funny jokes, in fact the first 20 minutes of the film play like a sexual comedy and it's a bit of a shock when THE YOUNG WARRIORS turns into a vigilante movie. But it's not just a type of surveillance film like EXTERMINATOR 2 or DEATH WISH 3 (Note a connection? They are both sequels and both are vigilance films made by Cannon films), no siree this is a ridiculous bad vigilante movie of a handsome high school boy and their poodle on a mission to wipe out the junk. This film is proof that Globus and Golan were giving money to people regardless of their ability to make films and you have to worry about people who seem to spend their reserves to make films set entirely around vigilantes
