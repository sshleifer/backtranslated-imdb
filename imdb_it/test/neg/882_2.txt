My husband brought this home from the video store, so I could see something while I was home sick. The kind of sick you could never focus on in a book, but he plays a silly, light, romantic, fair movie (and a bowl of chicken soup). Well, he meant well. <br /> <br /> My first thought (like some other posts here too) was that the house MUST be false ... it is not only isolated on the beach, but it is fixed to the moorings in the loose sand and so close to the ocean that the surf waves pass directly under the house! This seems so obviously dangerous (in the land of hurricanes, in THE FALL), so potentially disastrous that I was sure the filmmakers simply had CGI'd the whole thing (or used cinematic magic to plunk a nice B & B in the surf). <br /> <br /> But I have to tell you guys, thanks to "the interwebs", I can say that the house, "Serendipity" is very real, it's really close to Rodanthe and, except for some shop windows and shrubs, appears to more like he does in the film. You can rent it by yourself, out of season, for $ 1710 a week (or about $ 3850 in summer)! Just do it! But ... curiously, the house has serious problems. The second thing that struck me later "would have been wiped out" was "what about the plumbing / electrical systems? In that surf?", And sure enough, "Serendipity" was convicted of a break in sanitation, caused by the overflow from the ocean. (They are reconstructing.) <br /> <br /> And the house is not of the "Civil War". Not to mention the fact that Viola Davis, playing the "best friend black cliché" (thankless role for a beautiful actress, last time in "Doubt"), is not remotely old enough that her GRANDMOTH could have built something in the War Civil! HELLO! that was 150 years ago! Try fantastic, GREAT! (Actually, "Serendipity" was built in 1988, ridiculously lately.) <br /> <br /> The base film is built on a typical Nicholas Sparks, which means a lot of predictable coincidence and banality. It is also very absurdly aimed at "women" - you know, we women who love B & Bs, antiques and fake junk ... who dream of romance and boys who look like Richard Gere and dance in the moonlight. Don't give us plot, or development of the reflective character; just set up some mechanisms and carry on the love scenes! <br /> <br /> Gere plays a plastic surgeon, who lost a patient during a routine operation for a benign cyst on his cheek. Obviously, she died of an overdose of ANESTHESIA, so you immediately wonder why the surgeon is imprisoned and not the anesthesiologist! HELLO! where is that boy Why does the wrong doctor feel guilty? <br /> <br /> Gere came to pout and face the woman's husband, and is at the remote B & B ... who should be there, because the ONLY ONLY OTHER IN THE INN ... Diane Lane! She is a solitary divorcee, with rotten children, and an ex-husband who wants her back. While trying to decide on this, the black cliché best friend has his subtitle as hostess at the B & B. <br /> <br /> Now, in the real world, if this set had ever happened, the doctor would have looked like Ernest Borgnine ... and the solitary divorcee, like Rosie O'Donnell. She spent the holidays at the beach with the 22-year-old girls, while she pouted and thought about dieting. But this is not the real world; I digress. <br /> <br /> The couple confesses everything, falls in love, hurricane blows ... they make love, fall in love, he must leave, he dies and she cries a lot about this. The end. <br /> <br /> There, I saved you from it; now you don't have to torture yourself or any male acquaintance (husbands, children, engaged couples) while sitting in this tripe. Very tired. <br /> <br /> Someone else asked why Diane Lane, a perfect tiny woman (which filmmakers seem to love for the cast, because she is simply beautiful and thin that most women would like to look like, but she is 45ish and not over-the-top, so it's not threatening) is constantly covered by large shawls similar to towels. This would make sense if it were plump, but it is not. <br /> <br /> However, someone throws a beautiful paisley shawl on this film. So we don't have to watch it. Conclusion: read a book, unless you are too sick. If you are too sick, go to sleep.
