What begins as a passable film degenerates into one of the most incoherent, obscene, incompetently made and stupid horror films of recent years. <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible. It is such a derivative mess that rips every fright that can be imagined without producing a scare. Whether you copy the recent trend with children or gruesome ghosts passing in front of the camera or the horror of Fulci's old Gates of Hell school. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that there isn't even a cat jumping out of a closet to make you jump. To avoid.
