SPOILER !! Terrible photographic work, horrible writing, non-existent plot and numerous sets of the plot. Wonderful acting! Except for Julia Roberts. Who misunderstands someone who is impersonating Julia Roberts, badly. Catherine Zeta Jones is adorable in this movie. <br /> <br /> During the film, we zoom in on each of the twelve (!) Characters. Twelve are too many, even for a classic like 12 Angry Men. And the problem is that we boringly magnify the characters, when everyone is in the same room, doing the same thing. <br /> <br /> Yes, Clooney is eating. Yes, he's eating Pitt. Yes, the Jew is eating. Yes, the geek is eating. Yes, the bodybuilder is eating. Yes, Mr. Sensitive is eating. Yes yes yes yes yes. Yes. Damn it! This happens at least three more times in the film. Yes, they are all sitting in the car, bored. Yes, they are all arrested, scared. Yes, they were all taken out of a prison, depressed. <br /> <br /> But it wasn't until I got home that I realized how badly they would "take" me on this. This is a robbery movie, right? This is what I went to see, right? But when I came in and put the car keys in the gearbox, only then did I understand: NOTHING HAS BEEN MADE IN THE FILM! Quite right. It's a robbery film, in which nothing is stolen. Oh, they try. They go and try to steal some boring documents or something, from someone's house (anything), and it turns out that it's already been stolen. 20 minutes of my life, wasted. Then they try to steal an egg from a museum (YAWN!), And they blow it up and get arrested. <br /> <br /> Then we see how a fairy French guy stole the egg even before them, and we get all the joy of "Entrapment", except this time the person inside the tight suit dancing around fake lasers is ... a nasty, thin French guy. Um. <br /> <br /> But it turns out that he didn't actually steal the egg either. Actually, our heroes stole the egg, LOOOONG does, in another film entirely, that it would be a GREAT movie to watch if they made that movie. <br /> <br /> Instead we will see a 30-second clip in black-and-white on how they robbed some college students of his backpack. You heard me ... the bold caper, the last lightning bolt - the accumulation of these 2 and a half hours of pure boring shit - is stealing a backpack from a college student, creatively entering a baseball team fight and distracts him, and replaces his backpack with an identical backpack? What?? <br /> <br /> Ugh. I'm telling you, this was so bad, I didn't even realize how serious it was ... just how much I had been robbed ... until I got home.
