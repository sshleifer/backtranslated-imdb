"The Secret Life" begins with the worst narrative intro: "The crimes committed by Jeffrey Dahmer are too horrible to make a film about ...". Okay, so what are you suggesting? That we shouldn't worry about keeping watching because the movie won't be accurate or bloody, anyway? And they were right too! The film is not at all shocking and contains almost no blood or blood. Although I think it's mainly due to low budget production values ​​and not because Dahmer's crimes are too horrible. Basically, "The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer" is just a sequence repeated endlessly. Young, pitiful and mentally confused, Jeffrey collects the victims (always male, since he was a homosexual), kills them and then talks about how it was not his intention to hurt them and how much he is. This gets really fast and even the admirable interpretation of the unknown actor Carl Crew cannot save this film from being a real disaster. Still, this version is much better than the pretentious and hopelessly "Dahmer" that was released in 2002.
