42/100. Often referred to as "Tarzan with clothes on", but not at all in the same league as his far superior Tarzan series. Basically, the Jungle Jim series has become a Tarzan replacement for Johnny Weismuller, after he started to become too out of shape for a thong. In Jungle Jim, he is completely dressed. It cannot be compared to the Tarzan series in any way, not in acting, screenplays or production quality. It's pretty stuff. This is the first the best in the series, and it's not saying much. Too much repertoire material is used and it is so obvious. The score is exaggerated, and the plot is lame and the production is so poor as to make it difficult to watch sometimes.
