I wanted to love this movie so badly ... I really did. But it was a horrible disappointment. <br /> <br /> I read the Jennifer Egan novel in 1996 and was fascinated by the story. In fact it remains one of my favorite books of all time. Mind you, the book had much more depth than this film, in the plot and in the emotional resonance. HE MADE that you care about the characters. He painted a complete image of Phoebe, unlike the characterization of the poor girl in the film. <br /> <br /> Although beautiful and a showcase of * some * promised in her thriving career, Jordana Brewster was flat and empty of this performance as was the script. And Christopher Eccleston (Wolf) was just a horrible choice for the role of Wolf, both physically and logistically. What a strange looking couple. Wolf should have been a darker and more physically attractive character, as if he were in the book. Furthermore, the chemistry between the two actors was painfully forced. <br /> <br /> Cameron Diaz, however, deserves the greatest appreciation for his performance. He took an incredibly mediocre script and gave his character a life, a true spirit. She is simply gorgeous and her careful mannerisms make her very credible as a hippie. Too bad his talent was wasted on this forgettable movie. <br /> <br /> In the book-to-film category, this is a terrible translation, almost as bad as Message in a Bottle with Kevin Costner. But don't get me started on that ... <br /> <br /> I'm usually not so strict in my reviews, but I was so disappointed here, because I really cared about the story and wanted to see it told right. He did not deliver ... <br /> <br />
