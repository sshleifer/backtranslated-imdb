Meh, it really sums it up for me. Boring story, bland dialogues, boring action scenes (HOW do you do something like a fight or a boring shooting? Do you really TRY to do it?), No real character etc. Simply boring. Snipes is a gifted actor and a physical performer, but none of this has come to the surface in ANY of his DTV work, when the opportunity is there to give the public a product far more superior than they are used to. Imagine a decent script with few solid characters you care about and some damn explosive action, fights, shootings, etc. How can it be so difficult to manage? My personal opinion is that the protagonists of the productions simply don't care. There is no evidence of enthusiasm for what they are doing. Watch the Snipes in the first 2 Blades, 57 Passenger, Rising Sun, New Jack City, Demolition Man etc. Extraordinary and intense shows completed by decent (if not always exceptional) scripts, supporting cast and evil action. <br /> <br /> None of this is evident in any of these versions so far, which is a real shame. The distributors slap Wesley's face on the cover, knowing that the public will stone them because they haven't realized yet that they haven't seen it in theaters for almost 2 years. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see Snipes work with someone like Isaac Florentine who really knows how to get the most out of a DTV production, and work with Alpha Stunts which are simply some of the best action boys out there. Together they will all make a fantastic team and a Snipes action vehicle that we would all be proud to see. <br /> <br /> The detonator sucks. It's not as bad as The Marksman, which chews, but it really sucks.
