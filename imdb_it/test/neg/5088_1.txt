The River Queen sound recorder should have been fired, in this day and age there is no excuse for poor recording on the set. The grumbling voices were the end result and the cinematography was average at most. The story had potential and I'm sorry for the foreign actors who must have known they were shooting a turkey while they were shooting. It is obvious that the film was affected by el cheapo's budget syndrome, and the scene in which Temuera is preparing inside the house while a battle rages outside is simply too stupid for words. <br /> <br /> I noticed some shortcuts taken on the Maori protocol side, but this was probably due to film length restrictions etc. All in all I was not impressed by this film, the Whanganui river has many beautiful places but this film gives us a cold, gray and claustrophobic image, without any beauty. The film needed more sunshine and better camera angles, less screen clutter, better sound recording and more thought needed to be put into what movie-goers would see on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Hats off to everyone involved for completing what must have been a very difficult shoo. I have the greatest appreciation for anyone who can make a feature film, unfortunately I didn't like this.
