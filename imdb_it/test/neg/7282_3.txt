So, he came to this. In the most voted commentary on this film, someone says "Nishi is a man of honor". Really? This is a guy who kills and mainly affects people in the movie. It takes a short break to rob a bank. Honorable? Would you like your children to go to school with the children of someone who calls them honorable? Wait, there's more! The person also says "we can say he is constantly thinking." How can we do it? Well, you know what a joke "How can you tell when a CEO / politician / lawyer is lying?" ... "His lips move". Well, Nishi's lips never move, so I guess that means he's thinking. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is existentialism to warm the hearts of the cult of victimization. It is assumed that existentialism emphasizes that an individual takes responsibility for the consequences of his actions. Not Nishi. Borrow money from the yakuza. What, do they want it back? Kill them. The cops find out. Kill yourself and your wife. <br /> <br /> Really honorable.
