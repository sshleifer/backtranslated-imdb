These days, Asian horror films are among the best in the world, known for their atmosphere and the reflection of contemporary society. This is not one of those movies! Instead, "The Record" is a mediocre slasher film highly derived from American films like "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and "Scream". The plot is familiar: 5 teenagers accidentally accuse a terrible crime, but they cover the secret by swearing. A year later, they are chased by a maniac wielding a knife (with the disguise, partly uneven, of a sterile hospital mask and an orange overalls). It doesn't help that teenagers are a generally unlikely group (this is one of those films where the killer's motifs seem quite reasonable) and there are numerous silly plot patterns to keep the story going. The direction of the film is undoubted, more influenced by MTV than by the current Asian horror films (like "The Ring"). The last third of the film is not so bad, offering some decent suspense scenes, although there is probably too many "turns" at the end. 4/10
