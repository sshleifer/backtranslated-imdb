I'm not sure what the reason was for making this film. It appears to have been created by a historical society to be shown in your local "Pistol Pete" museum. At first it seems like it could be the beginning of a Mad TV or SNL sketch. But then the joke is about you when there isn't a punchline and you realize that someone took it seriously. The story wasn't bad but the inclusion of SASS members seemed to be a ploy (which worked) to show me the movie. I swear, the trailer listed all the characters in the movie in "dead cowboy # 5". The reason Westerners are so funny is the atmosphere and the characters it brings. I had the feeling that I was watching the rean-actors of the Civil War dressed as cowboys. Not even digital video on which it was recorded is worth.
