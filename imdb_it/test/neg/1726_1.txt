Like many others, I counted on Dennis Hopper's appearance to make this not a complete waste of time. I was wrong sadly. All that is negative about this is more than true. What takes the cake, however, is the horrible and horrible plot of the protagonist. <br /> <br /> Here's why: The planet could be destroyed, the ONLY way to recover, for ALL the human race to be saved through it, is to bring so many intelligent, capable, nice and competent people into a underground hiding place. And Dennis Hopper is the only seer / scientist with a vision that has been prepared for the worst and who has understood it. But what is the main motivation of Stevens (Sonny D'Angelo) ?? He is angry because Dennis has decided who must be saved or condemned! While he clearly explained to Stevens that the character of Dennis did everything to warn people of danger, but that he was mocked. Hopper's character was the guy with the finger in the dam, and now Stevens is blaming him for "choosing and choosing" ??? And if that's not enough, he wants to prevent everyone from entering this hiding place, because "it's not fair!" And ... he is responsible for the death of a boy who is the savior of humanity! OH MY GOD, how stupid are you? <br /> <br /> What is also crazy that IMDb forces one to write ten minimal lines on this piece of shit. I mean TWO MILLION budget, what could have been done? Think of Clerks, Blair Witch and many other films that have been made for less than $ 100,000 and are even better. Aaaaargh! I consider myself lucky not to have paid a penny to see this shit, and to sit at the end of this total, Ãºber-crap, is one of the most heroic things I did this year. No wonder the writers of this pile of dung have had a job as camera operator and title designer before ...
