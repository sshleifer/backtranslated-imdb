I love movies in this genre. Beautiful girls, toilet humor, free nudity. So why didn't I like this movie? No film like this should add even the slightest confusion to the plot. Who's who, where's the money, it's not SE7EN, just let me laugh. Maybe it's me, but I've never felt frustrated watching American Pie movies or other more modern National Lampoon movies. This film has no flow that makes me smile, waiting for what comes next. Instead, I find myself stopping to think, "Why did they keep that scene?" I don't recommend this movie. If you expect Van Wilder, think again. The only fun I saw during this film was to guess what movie the actors were in when they were children. 2/10 generously.
