This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It should be a remake or update of "The One-armed Swordsman" by Chang Cheh. The crazy direction and the choreography of disgusting struggle mean that the fight scenes are not even worth watching. The script desperately tries to look serious, but it's full of clich√©s like "And then I knew nothing would be the same ..." or "If only I knew what price I would have to pay". Ugh! And who is that girl playing Sing? Someone finds it and eliminated it !! It's terrible. If you like Chinese martial arts movies, you'll be better off with Lau Gar Leung. This stinks.
