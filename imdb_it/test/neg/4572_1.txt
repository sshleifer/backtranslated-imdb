I wouldn't call myself a big fan of inventive genius, so I might not be the best audience for this show. Although, being a critic, I have a sense for what I personally like and don't like, as this is the latest. <br /> <br /> Lack of humor is a big turning point when it comes to comedy, things can be catchy, cool and lively for about 4 minutes and after that you will start to get bored unless it is Rate animation a couple of years ago (?) This is the exact opposite, with a rigid script and a boring voice-over to suffer. Unfortunately, since he had a big market ahead of himself and great potential. <br /> <br /> A waste of time.
