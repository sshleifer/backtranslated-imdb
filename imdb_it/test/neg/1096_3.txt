... And the boy is so soft <br /> <br /> I saw this on the Bravo cable channel on a Saturday night and here in Britain we often have these terrible "core" soft core movies that appear late at night on Good boy. This follows the plot of a couple of college fanatics who build a virtual reality headset that makes you have sexual fantasies. <br /> <br /> When you saw one of these films, you saw them all with a series of bimbos that look like silicone prosthesis advertisements. Come on, I really saw the breasts in real life (I'm sure some of us have them too) and they swing around unlike here where they defy the laws of physics, if not gravity, at least. Sex scenes are these boring chores in which a well-wrung grotesque rubs against his co-star without dialogue or sounds other than a few muzak and when they have the climax it seems that both are having a bad attack of constipation. The girls are very nice especially Brandy Davis and Nikki Fritz but they are wasted in this type of soft core film <br /> <br /> And if it's the fantasy you're looking for, I recommend the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy
