At the beginning of the film, paleontologist Donald Sutherland arrives at the home of the Argyle family and turns out to be the undeniable alibi for one of the members executed for killing his mother two years ago, the feeling is that you are about to watch a thriller top; an innocent man has been convicted and a killer is still in circulation. But as the movie runs along your disappointment inevitably increases. <br /> <br /> "Ordeal by Innocence" is a boring and sometimes boring film that doesn't get up at any moment. Nothing interesting happens and even the final revelation of the facts lacks surprise and intensity (if you guessed it or not). <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, Cristopher Plummer, Faye Dunaway and Sarah Miles (far from his good performance in "Ryan's Daughter"), just go through their roles and not with much enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> You won't lose much if you skip this.
