This soap is worse than bad: it is poisonous. Among the TV shows that have had a corrosive influence on British society in the last twenty years, Eastenders is the main example. For two decades this show has celebrated the detective, the hooligan, the boy, the tart, the prostitute, the violent, the sexually incontinent, the criminal, the ignorant, the non-ambitious ... <br /> <br /> How many times has anyone noticed that Eastenders "mirrors life"? Life on which planet, exactly? <br /> <br /> It is written on the characters of the "working class", as imagined by middle class people who have taken a course in creative writing. Eager to show their middle-class peers how familiar they are with the "working class", they imagine the mob that is Eastenders' citizenship. <br /> <br /> This has a toxic effect on some minds less well equipped than others to handle fiction, and so we find members of the real population taking on the attitudes and behavior of the Walford inhabitants. <br /> <br /> Thus, it has happened that Eastenders reflects life; but only after life had been tricked and reflected the Eastenders. <br /> <br /> Other knowledge has followed in the footsteps of EE, full of their fetid saurians with horrible characters with the face of a potato, with a shaved head and bulging, looking at each other and constantly emits threats. This is the proletariat as perceived by the writers who produce this garbage. Writers will be enriched by the proceeds of this production and will continue to enjoy the most beautiful things in life in their rarefied enclaves. Meanwhile, the growing number of new TV-induced drones will inexorably move towards cultural bankruptcy. <br /> <br /> And here are the new priests and the new creatures of the early 21st century. Much of this is due to the immeasurable power of that illuminated box of dancing pixels in the corner of your living room. It's your fault, gentle reader: that's what you chose as the only window through which to look out of your prison.
