I wanted to like this - the situation was rich and the setting unusual and interesting. But the story is flooded with feminine romantic and childish elements that are hard to swallow. The director is unfairly prejudiced against the "goy" characters, who are content to be grotesque caricatures of cardboard, and inexplicably lenient towards the abnormal behavior of heroin. The struggle for potentially interesting power between the inventor and the governess is not really addressed. <br /> <br /> Feminist filmmakers will have more credibility when they stop manipulating situations to give all the heroine sympathy and start dealing honestly with problems. This film is more reminiscent of "The 7 golden pieces", another serious failure, more than "The Piano" - a true story of passion.
