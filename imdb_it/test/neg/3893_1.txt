Now don't get me wrong, I love a good movie and after watching The Thin Red Line (and loving it) I was eager to track down Terrence Malicks' two previous films and, having just seen Days of Heaven, my enthusiasm for seeing Badlands has practically disappeared. <br /> <br /> I noticed a lot of enthusiasm for beautiful photography, but I saw this film on a terribly old VHS tape that made it quite horrible. All I can say is that I hope the photography was superb, because it would have been one of the only things of interest in this film. Not since Killers substitutes fell asleep during a movie. The film seemed so long (and it wasn't!), The editing was choppy and disjointed, the plot non-existent, the voice was an incoherent round, the characters weakly developed, and the whole thing was not involving. I know Malick was unsure how to make the film. As a result, he shot a lot of footage, then spent about two years editing in an attempt to put it all together. This is very evident on the screen. Everything seems chopped up, every time a scene seemed to gain some momentum (or a bit of character development), it would inevitably be reduced to boring scenes of people doing boring things. It was as if someone had tried to cut a story together out of the repertoire material of popular agriculture. The few positive points are the music and the chase scene towards the end, but those things are not close enough to keep the interest. Normally I would let a bad movie go by without being too vocal, but when it's so highly overrated we have to say something. <br /> <br /> Maybe a peasant would like ...?
