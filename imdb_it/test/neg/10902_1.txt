Apparently, in the eyes of some - these days there are not enough horror films involving young people chased in a desert by a mysterious bloodthirsty madman in a truck. I mean, all we have so far is Joy Ride, Wolf Creek, Jeepers Creepers, Monster Man - among others. REST STOP may very well be the worst of them. It's about a girl and her boyfriend who leave their lives behind to start over together in California. Along the way, they stop at a grimy toilet so the young woman can free herself, but when she returns, she discovers that her boyfriend and his car have disappeared. From there, he learns that the culprit is a guy driving a yellow pickup truck who proceeds to persecute and terrorize her while she hides in the bathrooms. This film is so unoriginal that it seems boring. The acting is annoying, the blood is mild and the murderer, whose identity is not revealed during the entire film, is anything but memorable. Terrible - terrible movie ...
