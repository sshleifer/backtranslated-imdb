This started as a good sketching comedy. The first shows were very good and I couldn't wait to run a lot. What was really fun was the imitation of Mariah Carey and the takeoff of Beverly Hills 90210 with the fight for hair. The heavyweight battle of Delta Burke vs. William Conrad was also good. Unfortunately the following shows went down relatively quickly. The writing became uninspired and, oh, so predictable as if the show had acquired a cult following its young mandate. Nothing new was offered and the recurring scenes were boring. An example is the family of guns (or whatever it was called) which became a weekly feature. This sketch was not so funny at first, not to mention that it is a normal feature. An example of a promising rapid start, then a sudden fall.
