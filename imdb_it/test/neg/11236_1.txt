I had to watch this movie for a film class, I suffered all the time. I'm not Asian but I was still very offended by this movie. The basis of the film is racism, the overall minorities (Rex Harrison is not even Asian!) They are depicted in a restricted way. The banning of the film in Thailand illustrates the inaccuracy of the degree and the subjective representation of Asians. Furthermore, there has been critical attention given to Anna's biography. Many critics claim that Anna has added many fictitious events to her story to project herself in a positive way. Some critics of the film and the biography even claimed that Anna invented the whole story. A terrible but good film for BioPics discussion as a form of meta-narrative fiction rather than a non-fiction work.
