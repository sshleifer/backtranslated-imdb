What offends me more than the critics following this film is the mention of "originality". This film does not contain an innovative element. If by "originality" you refer to pathetic action scenes, excessive, greed of violence, outspoken humor and a script beyond intellectual belief. So "originality" is something that the Swedish film can do without. <br /> <br /> As Röse and Karlsson can accept to "act" in this poor excuse for a film is a mystery to me. And like Eva Röse after the making of this film can be seen at breakfast-TV promoting it disappoints me. <br /> <br /> This film does not contain a story, the script is illogical, rigid and hard but not at least, simply ugly. These two young directors have put together a rather disgusting fantasy-boy containing trivialized violence, comics and psychological portraits. I wouldn't be surprised if the DD scene masturbating in the kitchen for a microwave dinner is actually put there to describe the daily life of these two invaded movie nerds posing as directors. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't show this movie to my worst enemy.
