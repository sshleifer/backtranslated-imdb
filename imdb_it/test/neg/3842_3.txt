Sometimes when I watch this movie, I start thinking that the people who made this film were drugs. What's wrong with this movie, I'll tell you Bad Plot, Bad Jokes.Bad Acting and flat-out characters all just hurt. <br /> <br /> The film is about Pest Vargas, a two-bit swindler cheater who has the chance to survive for $ 50,000 for 24 hours from a German hunter who kills people to live. So now Pest has to think about ways to think about this hunter before he is killed. <br /> <br /> I know what you think "What The Hell is this?" another aspiring Ace Ventura who tries to get money, this plot is just boring and confusing sometimes changing the plot of the plot and you get lost during the movie. <br /> <br /> As for the funny scenes in this movie I had a cheek oh yes I smiled a couple of times but nothing ride-out loud.beides the jokes are trivial and seen before is like watching Ace Ventura meets Dumb and Dumber but badly. <br /> <br /> As for the character development it is dry and flat. You don't learn much about the main Pest character all you know is that he is an annoying scammer, but that's how he doesn't change his image or not he is a bit crafty, but only for the German hunter all that you are that is crazy and wants to return to Germany. You really start to wonder why this guy lives on an island if he has money to go to Germany. The son of the hunter Himmel is better, but not much. He's really a coward and he's a snake obsessed for reasons at the end, he gets up from his father and sided with Pest. <br /> <br /> As for acting, no o There were memorable perforations but just over the top. For example, John Legizomo is so exaggerated in performance and not suited to his role, he is out of place like Jeffery Jones, who plays the same thing as the hunter, but provides a stereotypical performance as well.as otherwise or not quite used or just over it. <br /> <br /> bad general comedy that you will find for $ 2.00 at K-Mart.
