Skeletons In The Closet takes the teenage father-son genre to new low-level levels. This is a film that has no purpose. The plot is set in the first minutes, there is no suspense, the characters are clich√©s and despite the twists and turns that try to confuse and obfuscate, everything takes place exactly as you think. In the middle of the film I could no longer bear the snail's rhythm and I started to make rapid progress. The film is finished exactly as I expected. Linda Hamilton is fantastic as always and the other actors are above average considering that there seems to be a complete lack of direction. If you really think you need to see this petty, unpleasant wannabe idiot, look at it fast.
