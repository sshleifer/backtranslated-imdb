Honestly, this is a very funny movie if you are looking for bad acting (Heather Graham could never live this down ... she has three titles for a reason - to protect the culprits!), Bel beautiful dialogue ("You like it. .. ribs? "), and a plot that only a mother could approve, this is your Friday night entertainment! <br /> <br /> My roommate rented it with the title of "Terrified" because he liked Heather Graham, but terrified is what we felt after the credits. Not because the film is scary, but because someone actually paid money to make this asshole on a reel of film. <br /> <br /> Horrible movie. There are some unnamed actors who offer some involuntary plays, but they are not worth seeing. Heather Graham's dramatic climax was also one of the most pathetic and disturbing things I've ever seen. I assign this film to no point and may God have mercy on his soul.
