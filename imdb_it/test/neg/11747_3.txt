Do not be fooled by thinking that this is a remake as in these years the remake of THE TIME MACHINE is based on a previous film. It is not because this is a meaningless film. This is the director who used the original screenplay for the camera similar to the "remake" of THE GET AWAY a few years ago. The scenes are identical to the original, the dialogue is identical to the original, the camera angles are identical, no attempt is made to embellish or restructure the original script, (but with a director like Van Sant at the helm we should be grateful for sure it's not Hitchcock) in fact, I could also be correct in saying that the costumes could be the same because the private eye wears a pig's pie hat. Didn't they go out of fashion in the late 1960s? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Avoid
