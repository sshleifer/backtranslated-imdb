An anonymous film that could have been directed by someone. Where is Anthony Mann, the director of classics like "El Cid" "the naked spur" or "the man of Laramie"? <br /> <br /> they are wonderful shots of planes in the clouds, lovingly filmed. The story is very trivial, and almost completely devoid of dramatization. The couple lives an almost routine life and the user who complains about June Allyson's choice for his wife, IMHO, totally lacks point. With his not-too-attractive appearance, his hoarse voice, he was the perfect housewife the script needed. At that time, women were barefoot and pregnant: there is not a single woman among the basic staff, not even on the work desk. Everyone had to worry about their hubbies, who were fighting for democracy and against an enemy whose name we never heard, but in 1955 it was not difficult to guess. <br /> <br /> wonders why a young man who has never seen a Mann film should choose this from all the great films he has made.
