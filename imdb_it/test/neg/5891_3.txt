I honestly expected more from this movie. This could have been the problem. There was not a single time when the camera was still - never. In the close-ups, the camera shakes, the subjects move and I get a headache. The cuts are so frequent and so fast that the viewer often finds himself wondering what just happened. (LOOK, NOTICE SPOILER) At the end of the film, when you expect to have a happy ending after being subjected to so much useless reflection to understand what is happening, they end up losing. For me, this was a fundamentally terrible film, ruined by a cameraman with ADHD, and the lack of a meaningful and meaningful storyline.
