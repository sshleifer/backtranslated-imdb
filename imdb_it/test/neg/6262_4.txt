I never expected too much from a trash B-movie director Jim Wynorski's movie: a silly premise, some cheapo effects and some nudity from some busty girls, and I'm usually pretty happy. <br /> <br /> Well, Cheerleader Massacre offers the first and certainly the second, but unfortunately it is a bit light when it comes to splatter. And when a movie has the word "massacre" in the title, and it looks at the blood, then in Houston, we have a problem. <br /> <br /> Wynorski's film focuses on a group of cheerleaders who, together with their teacher, minibus driver and a couple of boys, run aground in the mountains during a snow storm. They walk towards a deserted mountain refuge, where they find food and shelter. And a crazy killer who wants them all dead! From the beginning, good old Jim makes his film full of scenes loaded with T & A, and includes the obligatory shower scene, along with numerous other moments when tasty women get the nekkid (including a spot of soft soft sex and a very free three -bambes-in-a-hot-tub scenes). None of the women seems young enough to be a cheerleader (and not even seen in their clothes), but who cares about these details when they are all too willing to undress in the name of art? <br /> <br /> I am interested, however, in the film's numerous lackluster deaths. With a title so horrible, I was hoping for some inventive bloodshed to go with all the tramps, bushes and boobs; instead, virtually all murders occur off-screen or are almost bloodless. Only a stupid post-decapitation scene (made with cheap CGI) arrives almost everywhere to deliver the goods. <br /> <br /> However, if you feel in the mood for some titillation, or a bit of slasher nonsense minus the grue, then at 82 minutes, at least the Cheerleader massacre won't be a waste of time.
