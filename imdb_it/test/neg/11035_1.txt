I watched this movie with an audience of .... 5 in total! I had a choice between Lakshya and Asambhav ... (I realized that I should go for Lakshya). A typical plot ... India v Pakistan ... but it's not just cricket like in Kashmir. An Indian superhero embarks on a mission to save the president of India from some Pakistani rebels involved in a drug smuggling racket. I left the film halfway because it was simply boring and the plot was confusing and everywhere. Even the songs were horrible, the film tries to hide the flaws with its special effects, but unfortunately they are also obsolete. <br /> <br /> Overall ... avoid it if you can, it must be the worst movie I have seen this year.
