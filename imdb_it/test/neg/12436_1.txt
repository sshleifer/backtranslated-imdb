Look, don't get me wrong, I love independent films but COME! I could barely sit without wanting to kill myself. the director had absolutely no talent and he turned something that could fit into a F *** ing Nightmare. I'm a fan of punk music myself and the music also made me sick. the acting was disgusting. <br /> <br /> They are usually a bleeding heart for these low budget films but this one has not even tried. Please don't waste your precious time and money. I'm sorry to be so hard but come on! dragged forward and forward and forward. Remember when the children entered that party with the bizarre cupcakes and watermelon martinis? how did they just mix? It frustrated me the way they could go anywhere they wanted and get into trouble and have sex and a "meaningful conversation" with anyone they wanted. I know I'm joking, but my mind is full of everything I hated about this movie.
