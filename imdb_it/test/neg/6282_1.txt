SPOILERS <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> Is this Tenchi? <br /> <br /> This is not Tenchi. <br /> <br /> Virtually everyone is written horribly out of character ... When it comes to characterization, the only bright spot is the friendship between Ayeka and Ryoko. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the villain is not punished for his actions, which amount to a rape of mind control. If a bad male had done to one of the women what Haruna does to Tenchi, then he would (rightly) bought painfully at the end of the film, dying horribly, and the public would cheer. But Haruna not only pays no price for his crimes, Ryoko actually LOSES and UNDERSTANDS his actions. No! The real Ryoko would have disintegrated her for what Haruna had done to her beloved Tenchi; the audience with whom I saw this, including myself, whistled loudly about this scene <br /> <br /> anime fan, avoid this movie. Fan of Tenchi, avoid this film even more difficult.
