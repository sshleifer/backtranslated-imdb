There is no reason to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Why? Many reasons. First of all, acting is horrible. There is no line that is not misunderstood, but this is not surprising given the banality, stupidity and repetitiveness of the dialogue that the actors are called to put in their mouths. It is terribly written. One of the most annoying things about the script is that writers seem to know only one way to keep their characters talking after a certain point and that is to make them repeat the most important words of the line of the previous character. <br /> "Repeat?" <br /> <br /> "Yes, they repeat it throughout the film." <br /> <br /> "The whole movie?" <br /> <br /> "Yes, the whole movie." <br /> <br /> Etc. <br /> <br /> In films like this you generally know who the bad guys are and what they look for. (All good guys usually have to do is stop the bad guys, set up a good "Mwahahaha! With X in my grasp I will rule the universe!" The villain is the first stop in any cheapo SF storyline) but in this turkey ? - you tell me. <br /> <br /> As I understand it, our "heroes" are a group of mass murderers sent in the past on a Dirty Dozen mission. They are sent by a totalitarian fascist state to prevent other mass murderers from altering the course of history. The new story would not include the rise of totalitarianism and a war that kills 30 billion people and leaves the Earth a dead planet (we know all this because this film has one of those long situation reports on screen shortly before the beginning of the action, which tells you who is who and what is what. It is an indication of who the producers think their target audience will be, that is narrated and that appears on the screen - only to save the public from taxing the brain too much doing a lot of readings). So, just who should we be rooting for here? I imagine that we are asked to believe that our hero undertakes a sort of journey from totalitarianism to love, peace and understanding while shooting many people - but this does not work like a bow because we are shown to be a decent man ( ish) at the beginning, when he tries to save all the civilians aboard the rebel station. I imagine the producers were aiming for some sort of deeper complexity than normal in this film, but they just ended up with a wicked mess with more holes in the plot and logical inconsistencies from about a dozen of your average science fiction movies. <br /> <br /> The opening credits were beautiful.
