This film has the feeling of a university project on it, which wants to make a blair witch project meets the theme seen. But it is not successful. Cinematography is scarce and acting is even more so. The characters, in my opinion, are not at all credible. Not even the editing of the film works as expected. There are many negative effects, which I believe are put there to try to add a horrendous effect. But for me it just gives me a feeling of indifference. <br /> <br /> I'd stay away from this movie, unless you're a movie fanatic, who likes to watch "different" and "horror" indie movies. However, I believe this film is not worth watching for the average person. You will not get any pleasure from the negative effects and the sensation of the handycam, which this film gives its viewers.
