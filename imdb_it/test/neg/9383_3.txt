When Jan Svankmajer lets his imagination run, get ready. You like dark and heartbreaking movies like "Alice" and "Little Otik" or gems like "Down to the Cellar" and "Jabberwocky". All of these are excellent films that represent disturbing and surreal film production at its best. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, when Svankmajer attempts to make a political statement of any kind, it is advisable to leave the room in a hurry. Svankmajer's films in this vein tend to be both teenagers and beloved ones, presenting caricatures of straw men repetitively to express his pseudo-brilliant insights. <br /> <br /> "Lunacy", unfortunately, it is a lot of this last type of film. Ideas and characters from the cartoon are strained for two terrible hours. There are some moments that arouse interest for a short time, but these few oases are separated by vast deserts of boredom. <br /> <br /> If you have found the frightening and monotonous short film by Svankmajer "Et Cetera" brilliant and hilarious, you probably love "Lunacy". If you've never seen a Svankmajer movie before, please start somewhere else.
