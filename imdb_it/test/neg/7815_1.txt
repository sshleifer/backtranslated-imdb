This is by far the most terrible movie I've ever seen. I've never rated a 1 in 10 movie. My advice is not to watch it. This is not even classified as a movie. <br /> <br /> You better sit on the bored couch rather than watch this movie. Acting was terrible, but the worst part was by far the plot. Highly unlikely sequence of events that isn't even fun. They are actually very lame and stupid. Very silly choice of Ashton Kutcher and Tara Reid for acting in this film. They might even upset their careers a bit. <br /> <br /> When I joined Blockbuster, the main focus was on this movie, so I decided to rent it. I sincerely regret it. <br /> <br /> Once 10 or 20 minutes have passed in the movie, you could basically predict what would have happened. I was hoping it would improve, but instead it got worse. <br /> <br /> I'm not exaggerating with this. The film is terrible. Don't watch it I hope this helps you.
