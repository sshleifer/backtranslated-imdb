The laughter is few and far between in this boring film, and I can't help wondering why this mess was made. The only positive thing in this film is the talent of Griffin Dunne, but his best efforts were easily obscured by Madonna's hateful performance. I was able to sit down without getting bored, but this is probably the best thing I can say about this waste of time.
