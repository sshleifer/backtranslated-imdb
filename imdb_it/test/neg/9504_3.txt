Usually I much prefer French films to American ones, with explosions and car chases, but this film was very disappointing. There is no way to write a spoiler because nothing happens. This French couple has lived in Lisbon for years and return to Paris for a friend's wedding. They announce to another friend that they are having dinner with what they are about to share. So it doesn't happen much, they don't seem to know if they want to separate or not. I don't necessarily think that their hesitations create a bad movie, it's very human to hesitate before making such a decision for good, but this could be treated in an interesting way, giving a little flesh to their wishes and their relationship, this does not happen. One leaves the theater uncertain why these two have joined or want to split up. The only piece I liked was the conversation with the drunk. It was true for life.
