Honestly, this short movie sucks. the dummy used in the necro scene is quite well done but still quite fake which seems to ruin the visual experience. the Unearthed DVD is crisp and clear and I haven't decided if this helps or hinders it. If the movie was a little grainy it might have added a "creepy factor" to what was happening. I have no idea why this film has so much clamor surrounding it other than the subject - but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q among others, are more shocking than in AFTERMATH. All this talking about the fact that the film is about solitude and every other way of profound philosophy is the bull ****. This is an expensive, beautifully filmed asshole. It's not so shocking, it's not so disgusting. if you insist on seeing it - rent it. I give him a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit films about necrophilia (there should certainly be a bigger selection for us bewitching;) - the shots are good and have some "blood" (if you look at a doll rubbery looking to be cut out is considered gore ...), but other than that - absolutely nothing for this overcrowded mess. On the other hand - GENESIS - The sequel to AFTERMATH by Cerda (now available as a "double film" from the Unearthed films) is an absolute masterpiece of a short film, really demonstrating which Cerda is a good director when he receives the right material. Although I don't care about AFTERMATH at all, GENESIS is so well made that I will forgive Cerda and that I will certainly keep an eye out for him in the future ...
