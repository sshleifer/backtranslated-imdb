We summarize how stupid this film is with two details: Arnold to Antichrist: "Let's see who is worse," he said with a straight face. And you can say they weren't trying to be funny. <br /> <br /> How do you think Arnold will fight the evil of all evil? <br /> <br /> Blessed Water, A crucifix, a priest. .nooo! with a bazooka, yes, not even Satan expected them to be so smart. <br /> <br /> After a thrilling start (reminiscent of the devil's attorney) it doesn't go anywhere. Someone takes me back those two hours of my life. Never look at it, rent it, or buy it. <br /> <br />
