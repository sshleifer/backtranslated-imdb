Derek Jarman has shown us over and over again that dialogue is not his strong suit. He is a painter and he paints. His films are almost always visually beautiful, but exciting to look like an already dry paint. Watch his movies fast forward, the really fast setting that you can only get on DVD. In The Tempest, Jarman does very little with the script or the characters, simply using them as a lattice to hang a very long and well-constructed film frame. It goes so far as to contradict Shakespeare's original script to create these excessively slow and lifeless scenes. There is no romantic story, magic, deception or urgency that the script requires, little spontaneity, and the character of Caliban in particular is reduced to a trembling and crazy idiot, similar to Gaveston's in Jarman's Edward II. Too bad this is just the only film version of The Tempest available.
