"Afterlife" is about a somewhat arrogant and reasonable man who discovers that his mother is dying and finds himself looking after his sister, who has Down syndrome. He cannot be disturbed by her, and basically he just wants to get out of her hands; he has better things to do. At one point he finds out that he has to take her, in the car (she doesn't like flying) all over the country. <br /> <br /> If it looks familiar, it's probably because you've seen `Rainman, 'a film far superior to its imitator,` AfterLife.' That you copy the basic premise (heck, it cancels some characters and even scenes) is not the fundamental problem of the film. The fundamental problem is that I didn't care about these characters. <br /> <br /> The brother, Kenny (Kevin McKidd), is a bit of a womanizer. He has a girl who comes and goes in history and learns to love the sister of Down syndrome (again, this is taken from "Rainman"). He is a journalist, trying to get an interview with a doctor who is facing a scandal. When she ends up caring for Roberta, her sister, she doesn't have much time for her, and sometimes leaves her alone for a little too long. When she walks away, she becomes even more angry with her. Am I ruining something by saying that he becomes a kinder and more loving person by the end of the film? <br /> <br /> Roberta is not determined to be 'normal'; she is "normal" and wants people to stop treating her differently. She is played by Paula Sage, an actress who has Down syndrome, and her performance is easily the best thing about the film; why didn't the writer deepen his character? Well, probably because that would mean that the characters would get in the way of the story. When we surely know the story, didn't the filmmakers see the problem they were creating? <br /> <br /> For a film about a dying mother and her handicapped daughter (her father is absent, I think he's dead, but I'm not sure), it's surprising how little impact the film has on the emotions of the viewer. The scenes are performed in a standard, boring way, with a standard and predictable dialogue, which I found myself rolling my eyes. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against sentimentality in the movies, but it really only works if you care about the characters. Here the characters are so uninteresting and two-dimensional that I didn't really think there was much to look after. "Rain Man" has an emotional climax, but this moved me, because I cared about the characters. <br /> <br /> Speaking of climax, this film has a stink. There is a sequence at the end of the film that begins as an incredible situation and ends up in an even worse territory; an unforgivably cruel game is played on the public. The sequence is designed to move the audience, but ends up being horribly manipulative and offending the viewer's intelligence. The public is not stupid and knows when the film is cheating. What an economic blow. <br /> <br /> There is no scene in this film that has the impact it should. There are some sequences that are fun, yes, but when the characters talk to each other, I can practically see the script in front of me, moving in a predictable and uninteresting way, without ever hitting anything that touches my mind or heart. There are those fake topics that are reserved especially for movies, where the other character knows exactly what the answer is. Because apparently "realistic" films do not realize that, in real life, anger can be irrational and that sometimes people cannot express their emotions and may say things that make no sense or may not be able to tell anything? All the actors in this film deserve better material. This film is not fact-based, but I think a documentary about a family with a member of Down's syndrome would be much more interesting. In this way, we may have had truth and emotion. For some reason the characters in this film think that an emotion only involves saying something aloud and making a suitable facial expression. <br /> <br /> ** (out of 5)
