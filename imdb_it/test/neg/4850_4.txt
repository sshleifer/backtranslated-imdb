Well ... I like Patricia Kaas. She is a beautiful lady and an extremely gifted and versatile singer. His acting in this film is more than competent and from my point of view on the unique saving beauty of this film. Gently captures the essence of the solitary singer with a very serious helath problem. However, what I greatly regret about the film is the shameless positioning of the product for a famous French hotel chain. The other thing is that the story seems to wander around for a long time without really deciding what the film is about and what it wants to be. On a positive note it could be argued that the film is not predictable, but it could also be said that it is clearly boring due to the lack of cohesion. There are some nice shots in the movie that you can't help but think that all the parts don't add up to anything. It's really a pity that Kaas really shines in this movie.
