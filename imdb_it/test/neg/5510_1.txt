Really terrible. Obviously an attempt to cash in on the Star Wars craze, but there is no excuse for this bland piece of trash. The plot is lost before the half, the characters are forgettable and the boy is a non-talent that all he does is pose for the camera. An alien planet they land on is actually the naval depots of Long Beach, California. <br /> <br /> This movie really made me physically sick at watching it. <br /> <br /> Roger Corman has made some good, some bad films in his career, but there is no excuse for that. <br /> <br /> 0/10 - IMDb will not let you score zero.
