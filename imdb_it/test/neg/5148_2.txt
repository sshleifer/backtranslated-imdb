***** Spoiler Ahead ***** <br /> <br /> I suppose you shouldn't expect much of a TV movie, but this was particularly bad, the plot was a good idea, but badly done, the acting was not particularly good. And the film's ending was simply terrible. The main character was perfectly normal throughout the film, and then suddenly when we find out that she was the killer, she turns into a psychopath with mental problems. It's completely pathetic. <br /> <br /> Is there only one reason to watch this movie, Yasmin Bleeth, even though we haven't seen it in a bathing suit before? Don't even worry about watching this waste of time, if you want a film about the beauty contest world then look at "Drop Dead Gorgeous" instead, it's just an infinite number of times better.
