The film opens with a cult leader trying to resurrect a dead member with his followers singing for his rebirth as the sun hits them in the desert. Reanhauer (Bill Roy) firmly believes in his power, and is so agitated that he collapses with what appeared to be a heart attack. Unable to keep him alive, all those involved, doctors and nurses, are condemned for attacking with the demonic spirit of Reanhauer that invades the curvaceous body of nurse Sherri (.. busty Jill Jacobson) targeting each as a weapon of revenge. Forced against his will, without memory to inflict such damage, Sherri's host body kills some selected victims. Fortunately, Sherri's colleague, nurse Tara (Marilyn Joi), begins a rather blossoming love affair with a blind patient, Marcus Washington (Prentiss Moulden), once a football player, whose mother was a practitioner of voodoo. Through the knowledge of Marcus, passed down from mom, Tara discovers possession and how to save Sherri before she kills everyone unconsciously. Meanwhile, Sherri's lover, Dr. Peter Desmond (Geoffrey Land) worries about his current condition and well-being. <br /> <br /> Well, this was my first Al Adamson film and I have to agree with his detractors that, from this movie alone, it seems that he keeps them together with Elmer's staples and glue . The animation with which we see the spirit taking control of Sherri is beyond terrible and rather ridiculous. A little soft-core nonsense like filler, a bit of demonic possession thrown into the mix (Sherri actually speaks in another voice when she is possessed), with a bad nurse behavior (.. the three nurses focused in the film are all quite sexually active and free-breathing) and some violence / gore. The film is essentially shot in tiny rooms with a boring dialogue from a rather trivial cast. Sexual situations are not so difficult and Al le shoots often without revealing this. The film seems embarrassingly cheap and there is an absence of chills, even though the chilling score (which sounds like something from Dark Shadows) helps a little. Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass (.. like a nurse Beth who seems to be a nymphomaniac if she can fuck a mentally ill, always complaining about diseases she doesn't actually have, with enough bibs to declare him a Neanderthal) aren't bad, and Adamson's storyline, although fragile, is a bit coherent (it seems that he rarely directs films that are). Overall, the film seems to cost $ 5 and Adamson fails to overcome the budget restrictions (.. or, in my opinion, create an unpleasant atmosphere due to a sometimes tiring narrative and boring scenes that do little for the story ). John F Goff has the role of the hospital psychiatrist who wants to commit Sherri, not believing the idea of ​​being possessed, constantly quarrels with Peter about her. I looked at the unclassified "lost" version that I imagine is the real version to watch of Nurse Sherri.
