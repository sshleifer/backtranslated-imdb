I hated that the first movie was really boring and in the end we come to see only the octopus. <br /> <br /> The plot The bodies were found in the port of New York. The police have no clues or suspicions until Nick and his colleague realize that the killer is a giant octopus. Everyone, especially the police captain, refuses to believe Nick's story, and soon the port will be full of boats for the July 4th celebrations ... <br /> <br /> In this film we will see more of the Octopus Giant and special effects for this film are really good for his time. <br /> <br /> Acting is not a bad film but not exceptional but it is fine and looks good. <br /> <br /> The movie scenes are really from movies, but if you can overcome them, you should enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> 5/10
