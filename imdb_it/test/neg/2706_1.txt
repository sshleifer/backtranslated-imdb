The first time I saw this movie I was ten. I thought it was so bad, and at that age I had no cinematic taste. I saw this movie on Cinemax about 3 days ago and was reminded of it because I hated the movie in the first place. Madonna's character, Nikki, is annoying and obnoxious. There is no way that the protagonist will fall in love with her. The jokes were trivial and the dialogue was worse than a t.v. soap opera!! I'm glad I didn't see this movie at the theater, or rent it. I feel bad for my parents who had to endure watching it with me! Madonna is not necessarily a bad actress, but in this role she is interpreted as a complete idiot.
