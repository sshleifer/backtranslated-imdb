The Capture Of Bigfoot is one of the most silent and worst movies of all time. I love Sasquatch and Bigfoot movies, but this is just a waste of time. Terrible, terrible, terrible! I watched this movie last night, and it was all I could do to finish watching. I realized this crazy fool wanted to capture Bigfoot, but that was the only thing that made sense in this movie. There were some fun parts though. There was this very dingy and drab nightclub with bad nightclubs that seemed to go on for too long in the movie. I think the director was trying to fill the time. The worst thing was the way the Bigfoot looked. The man in a dress looked like a bigfoot in pink faux fur. It was ridiculous. If you want to see a very ugly Bigfoot movie, then I suggest you buy this movie. Personally, I wasted my time and my money on this!
