Veber is not famous for his exceptional directing skills. In fact, no one cares how much laughter they got, some here in fact, scattered throughout the whole process, thanks to the characterization of Depardieu's character and the dialogue that Veber puts into his mouth. <br /> <br /> But this is not enough to make a great comedy since there is no film outside the usual Veber premise: a tough guy is doomed to collaborate with a very naive character. In L'Emmerdeur, La Chèvre or Les Compères there was a real story that took place in the fire against water processes. The Diner de Cons, although it was a game, managed to create a real suspense for the next catastrophe that would cause Pinon. In Tais-toi the background on revenge is both redundant and too weak to arouse our interest. Furthermore, the heavy men are lame both on the screen and in the script. <br /> <br /> Now, what's wrong? Veber wraps it up creating no action, no rhythm. Instead he systematically uses and overhangs the ellipses (perhaps he met William Goldman in Hollywood) and "music" really emphasizes the lack of nervousness and a backbone in history. <br /> <br /> So you must be happy with the performance of Depardieu.
