This film was not only disappointing for the horror / suspense movie lover, it was disappointing for anyone to see it. Wow. I thought this movie could be fun because the guy with the huge head. However, it was full of long conversations that were not necessary. There was so much sex that I hate women and men now. This film was not only boring, but there was no substance. Wow. Wow. In all this, every scene seems to have been the light of a single light bulb, and I think they used the same set for two different lawyers, a restaurant and an airport. This film is not for the movie lover who loves bad movies, because in the end, he likes to waste time. Watch the film! <br /> <br /> -party
