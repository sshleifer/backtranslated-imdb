The fifth collaboration between Marlene Dietrich and the director Josef von Sternberg, BLONDE VENUS is a film that looks beautiful while playing but cannot involve the viewer. Dietrich's strenuous plot that is fought between two men, becoming a mammoth cabaret star, and struggling for his son's custody is confused and often feels like a fragment of three separate films half-cooked together. Dietrich is unwisely thrown into a rather passive and reactive role for much of the film and his character remains detached from the spectators, while Herbert Marshal is not as convincing as his irascible husband, and Cary Grant is largely wasted as a suave suitor who launches out of the photo. The film contains some interesting pieces (the number "Hot Voodoo" is the highest point) that are extraordinarily surreal for this Hollywood era, although it is not very helpful in a film so boring and inconsistent.
