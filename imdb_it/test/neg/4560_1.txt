The comments for Commune make a film look very interesting, of which I would be deeply interested. Unfortunately, the producers did not see fit to include captions for the deaf and the deaf. This leaves me and countless others like me, who depend on subtitles to follow a movie, completely out. <br /> <br /> This is unforgivable for any film produced in the year 2005. In a world where all types of disabilities and disabilities are accommodated, it is irritating and ironic that the entertainment industry has never pretended that all productions and cinemas are closed with a caption.
