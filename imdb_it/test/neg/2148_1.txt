You know you have a bad movie when you hear that the soundtrack is performed completely on a single cheap programmable synthesizer, without any melody or sense of rhythm. <br /> <br /> It's hard to understand how anyone can take this movie seriously, even if it gives it a negative review. This film is very "bad". <br /> <br /> The continuity of this film is shockingly slaughtered. In a fight scene, we the hero (wearing blue jeans and undershirt) turn a corner with two revolvers in hand; doubles, only now he has two semi-automatics in his hands; turns another corner and now has an automatic rifle in his hands; chases down a corridor and exits (suddenly dressed in his army fatigue jacket) with a shotgun; after which he exits the building with another automatic rifle. Or here's one for books: a bus slams into a high-speed car; the car goes flying, launched by a giant explosion - cut off from the bus which is completely unharmed by the explosion itself? Narrative continuity suffers from an equally unpleasant sense of unreality; the bad guys really want to kill the hero - obviously - but every time they knock him out or put him in a vulnerable position, they suddenly decide they want to "live to see him!" Eh? One of the most enjoyable moments of the film is when the hero is released from isolation because his lawyer came to see him; then the villain decides that he will not let the two meet after all; and this despite the fact that the villain, the hero and his lawyer all know what happens, so the hero writes a ticket for the lawyer and then we see that the note is passed to the lawyer by another prisoner, even if we never did see the hero give it to him. (This lawyer, by the way, has full access to the ATF offices in California, including confidential computer files.) Huh? Well, it's an unreasonable action movie, so how are the action scenes? Not bad, surprisingly; unfortunately they were robbed by a dozen Hong Kong films made five or ten years earlier. The opening scene, a shoot-out in a junker garage, actually has shots whose composition was stolen directly from "Hard Boiled" - so clearly it's a wonder that John Woo didn't sue for plagiarism. <br /> <br /> Other stolen Hong Kong films include "Prison on Fire", "Island on Fire", "Burning Paradise", "Police Story" I, II and III (or "Supercop"). I thought I'd also recognize a couple of Sammo Hung clips here. In other words, action scenes are exciting only to the extent that they are duplications of action scenes from other movies. <br /> <br /> There is nothing you can do with this movie unless you shoot and you need a lot of visual stimuli that don't need meaning. <br /> <br /> Very funny movie, for all the wrong reasons.
