Some boys go to an old abandoned farm left to one of them by their dead grandfather, unaware that there have been several murders there decades before, because their grandfather had made a pact with the devil for a good harvest - he couldn't have thought of something better to sell his soul? The man's grandson and his friends are ready to be the next sacrifice, for reasons that are never explained. The stereotypical teenage son and his girlfriend, the black guy with a white girl, and the two lesbians have to fight with three assassin scarecrows - but, not to be deceived as I was, this is not as funny as it seems. Mostly it's just a lot of talk about soccer ball, drug smoking and the main actor who complains that he never met his parents. The camera work is atrocious and shaky, perhaps done on a camcorder in some scenes, which is perhaps a good thing since the scarecrows seem to come from a child's birthday party, and apparently could only hire two people to play the three scarecrows! Some of the best movies I've seen have been these low-budget independent horror films, but that's just pathetic. The cast and crew seem to have been composed of a group of people who knew each other, had never acted before and had no intention of acting again, and they had a few thousand dollars (I can't believe that this film cost $ 130,000 to make) and a weekend of free time on their hands - even the lesbian diving scene is disgusting. <br /> <br /> I think it's also fun, that at the time of this writing there is a sequel that no one has even bothered adding to IMDb. <br /> <br /> * of ****, and I only rate it very much because of the skinny dive scene, no matter how lame it may be.
