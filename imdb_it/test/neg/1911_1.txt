Well, if you put aside the fact that this film has an abysmal acting; and, if you put aside the fact that the story is confused and wanders in about five different directions without ever deciding which way it really wants to go; and, if I put aside the fact that I didn't find a single scene in this film that was remotely interesting; Well, if you put all this aside, this is still a REALLY terrible movie! <br /> <br /> I suppose this is a love story about the rich boy / poor girl. I never really understood for a moment why this love story between Kelley (Chris Klein) and Samantha (Leelee Sobieski) ever started. The inexplicable love story is compounded by a total lack of chemistry between Klein and Sobieski. The script (by Michael Seitzman) is boring to the point of surprising. How Seitzman managed to write the thing without falling asleep is a miracle; who would think that anyone would want to pay to see this is incredible. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that this is a REALLY terrible movie? <br /> <br /> I would give him a ZERO, but the IMDb does not provide for ZERO votes. So give him one while I'm holding my nose.
