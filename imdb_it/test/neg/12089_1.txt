This film had an excellent premise, and could have been a fascinating look at racism, the attitude towards women at work and the relations between men and women in England at the beginning of the last century. However, it has simply turned into a sloppy love story. But the worst thing is that the romance was absolutely incredible. The acting was mostly poor, the direction confused, but above all the script and the story were non-existent. The only thing I liked about the film was how dark it must have been before electric lighting. I really got the feeling of how little light a candle gives off.
