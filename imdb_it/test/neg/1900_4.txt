This was one of Christie's later stories. During her long career, she was interested in the changing narrative and the notion of conflicting agents. Both are essentially the same thing and boil down to questions about who controls or creates the situation. <br /> <br /> In detective fiction, the game is a matter of conflicting realities. The killer intends to change reality to deceive the detective, the writer intends to do the same with the reader. Both the reader and the detective are in similar battles to create what they see. That's why his stories often include a writer. <br /> <br /> In his work, he explores every combination of tricks he can think of in this agreement. Along the way, we often have bodies that are not what they seem, and times, and expected victims, and so on. But the real magic of books is this notion of control. In 'Bertram's' it was literally a building. <br /> <br /> Here, he is a dead man. Well, sometimes it happens, but not so. It is as if the writer was the famous Mr. Rafiel. This is particularly sweet for the readers of Marple who remember the same character as the "Mystery of the Caribbean", which in a sense had been framed by his nephew. In that story, Rafiel was the transporter of history for the authorities. <br /> <br /> The producers of this series have an almost extravagant commitment to using a different creative team on each of them. Sometimes it produces a bland job. The "Bertram" episode was rather brilliantly staged. This is the most luxurious of the lot and has an active camera. But unlike the work of "Bertram", it has nothing to do with history. <br /> <br /> The camera moves and captures simply because it's possible. The quote "Citizen Kane" at the beginning was a bit too literal and frank. This story is good, but the adapter has taken some pretty critical things, and that irrelevant camera bothers. <br /> <br /> Ted's Evaluation - 2 of 3: It has some interesting elements.
