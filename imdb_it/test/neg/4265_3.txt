There is nothing wrong with showing an old man in love with a young girl. Lolita did it. American Beauty did it. <br /> <br /> But. They did it subtly. They haven't made it so obvious from the beginning that the director is preparing them to make them fall in love with each other. Not with the same naturalness of two people (Age no bar), but forcing them to stand around each other as if they were destined to fall in love. <br /> <br /> All in all, there should have been chemistry. It would solve the biggest problem. Even people with reservations about the subject would have been addicted and perhaps convinced. It would have become the perfect love story, regardless of its impracticability. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I found it difficult to believe the character of Jia. What I found most difficult to understand is the reason why Vijay - a photographer and an artist who seems serious - would have had an interest in such a frivolous girl. Unless he has a bit of frivolity hidden in himself, something that didn't come out at all. <br /> <br /> There is much use of Dutch corners or corners where the frame is tilted. It is generally used to show something unnatural or something that could lead to something that is not right. So RGV himself defines the unnatural relationship. <br /> <br /> The corners of the camera, the background score, the editing and even the juxtaposition of shots and symbologies emphasize and emphasize their relationship. Is the Indian public so stupid that they have to say something in 10 different ways for us to understand? Especially when the two of them were dancing together ... it was clear what was happening. What was the need to slow down the scene with dramatic background music? I feel that the subject has been chosen very well. But Verma should not have made the film with the fact constantly in mind that this is a controversial topic. If it is, then handle it gently, why not?
