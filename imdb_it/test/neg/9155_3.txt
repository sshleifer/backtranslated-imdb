Great book, badly made film. Style performances and artificial situations make this film a festive and sentimental bore. Flat, uninspired work by most actors leaves this film in the special After School category. There is no doubt that there is a lot of talent to draw from this cast and crew, but something has gone terribly wrong. The talented Gretchen Mol tries to extract this film from the mud but she also doesn't seem to stand above the stupid dialogue. Looks like everyone just called. Even the make-up (20-year-old Mulrooney during the film) seems amateurish and raw. Don't waste time with this clunker ... read the book.
