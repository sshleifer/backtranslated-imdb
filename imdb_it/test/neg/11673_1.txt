This is not exactly what I would call a Mad Max movie, after seeing Road Warrior and experiencing the excellence of that movie, I felt a little disappointed after seeing it. Presumably he started out as a kind of kid in the wilderness movie, and was joined in the Mad Max franchise (bad idea). The casting wasn't exactly the best, I mean come on Tina Turner? One of the main problems with this film is that there are no good bad guys. No Wez, no Humungus, not even a good Toecutter! Nothing really happens if you're going to see this action movie (can you even call it that?) Make sure you see Mad Max 2 or Mad Max, or better still both. Another problem with this film is that there are too many people, even Thunderdome's battle sequence is boring, Max doesn't even kill anyone! The music is bad, the characters are bad (not in the good sense) and after watching this movie, it left a bad taste in my mouth.
