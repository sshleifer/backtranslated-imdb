I would like to know what to do with a film like this. It appears to be divided into two parts: ground sequences of action and personal dramas. Ashton Kutsher follows through the school of survival swimmers, led by chieftain Kevin Costner, then in Alaska, where a couple of spectacular rescues take place, the last one to death. <br /> <br /> I must say that the scenes on the beach hit me so stereotypically in so many ways that they should be encrusted with barnacles. A typical encounter between the Navy's bar and coast guards ("pirates of the puddles"). The old expert Timer Costner who is, like an old bartender tells him, "married to the Coast Guard". The older chief who "continues to prove to himself that he is still nineteen years old". The former wife neglected on the shore to whom Kostner pays a farewell visit. The apparently sadistic demands placed on swimmers by instructors, all looking for a higher goal. The gifted young man is limped by a troubled past. <br /> <br /> The problem is that we've seen it all before. If it's Kevin Costner here, I'm Clint Eastwood or John Wayne or Lou Gosset Jr. or Vigo Mortenson or Robert De Niro elsewhere. And the climate scene has elements shamelessly designed by "The Perfect Storm" and "Dead Calm". None of this is new and none of the old characters and stereotypical situations is managed with originality. <br /> <br /> It works best as a kind of documentary about what happens in the swimmer's school and what might happen next and this is also a bit weak because we don't get much in terms of education. It is above all personal conflict, romance and tension on rinsing. It's a shame because the US Coast Guard is quite a noble suit, its official mission is "the security of lives and property at sea". In wartime he is transferred to the Navy Department and serves in combat roles. During World War II, the Coast Guard even managed to get a Medal of Honor winner in its ranks. <br /> <br /> But once again, we don't learn much about it. We don't learn much about anything. The film turns into a succession of visual displays and not too much else. A delusion.
