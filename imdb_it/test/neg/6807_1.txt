In an unsuccessful attempt to be taken seriously and move into "adult" films, Hughes gives us this movie about a young married couple. True, there are all the clich√©s in the book, nonsense and things like that, but above all, it has Elizabeth McGovern. Clearly the best actress who ever appeared in a John Hughes film, she gives a weight to it that elevates the sometimes silly material. Kevin Bacon (and his hair) is quite as good as her husband, but McGovern steals the film with his quiet moments of honesty. The movie 'teen movie' that worked so well in other Hughes films is flat here - like a favorite uncle whose jokes made you laugh when you were 9, but keep telling him when you're 15 and you'd like him to find some new material . But I keep going back to the McGoverns performance, because it's really moving. Mr. Hughes' most interesting films for me have real actors in them (Some Kind of Wonderful, Breakfast Club) and when his material collides with real talent, wonderful things can happen. If only he had faith in the fact that he shouldn't be updated with stupid fantasy things.
