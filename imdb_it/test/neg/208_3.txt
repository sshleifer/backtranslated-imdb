The film had moments, but it was disappointing in my eyes anyway. It was a reworking of Trespass (Walter Hill) and so The treasure of the Sierra Madre, with less tension, bite and human emotion. There was a beautiful acting, but the story was weak and lacked any real depth. I saw the film for Mr. Reno and Mr. Fishburn, neither was inspired and both had little to say or act for the skin. This film was made to death in the past and should not be done, eat money that could be used on better films. For an action movie it was scanty in action and like a thriller it didn't impress. Better than watching the snow fall, but not for me.
