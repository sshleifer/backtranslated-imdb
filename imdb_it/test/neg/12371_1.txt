This is one of the most incredibly ugly movies I've ever seen. I can't believe anyone who wrote the review above was serious. Maybe he was connected to it. He has nothing to do about it. There is no suspense, the acting is terrible, the direction is hopeless. The musical score (?) It is of three trite notes reproduced to the point of nausea. The plot (?) It must have taken all five minutes to write. Dialogue is what a 10-year-old could do if asked to do a homework project. The only (slightly) saving feature is the actor who plays the same psychopath, who makes a grimace, trembles and turns beautifully and, at times, is also fun. The only reason you would be on the edge of the seat would be if you had a weak bladder. Do not waste time.
