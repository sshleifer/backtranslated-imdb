This was so bad, I want God to give me two extra hours of life for having to sit down. <br /> <br /> First of all, the acting was uniformly negative. There was hardly a plot, unless it mattered "The story of the Shaggy dog ​​with a boy in a rain poncho and a skeletal mask instead of a dog". <br /> <br /> The assembly was everywhere, and the slow strokes of "gore" (red corn syrup flying through the air - no doubt thrown with a spoon) became irritated after the tenth time, and infuriated after the hundredth time. <br /> <br /> I like Michael Rooker. He did a good job. This was not good. This was less than good. And by that I mean it sucked. Hard. <br /> <br /> For God's sake, don't watch this movie.
