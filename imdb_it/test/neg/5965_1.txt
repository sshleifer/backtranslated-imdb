This film is a complete and total waste of time, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And coming to me, he's definitely saying something. In fact, I wanted to give him the negative stars instead of classifying them as a pathetic horrible star-star. <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie, I had an open mind. I find the chupacabra legend interesting and I have a fondness for cheese horror movies. But I draw the line to this. <br /> <br /> Acting sucked. The male protagonist gives one of the worst performances ever, looking and sounding unnatural while delivering his badly written lines. The female protagonist offers a slightly more attractive performance, but it doesn't take much. <br /> <br /> The chupacabra ... well, considering how low the budget of this film was, the creature was tolerable. However, it looks exactly like someone in a mask and overalls. The mask is quite detailed and might look beautiful in person, but not so on the screen. <br /> <br /> Speaking on the screen, you'd think they could at least use a better camera. It looks like it was shot with a video camera to shout loudly. Not even a very good one. <br /> <br /> I don't know what anyone who wrote this abomination thought. The dialogue sucks and ... I can't describe what I feel about it. At least not without having had problems with the site. <br /> <br /> My advice? Avoid this at all costs. It's not worth it. If it comes on TV and you have nothing else to do or to watch, then * find * something else to do or to watch. Read a book, listen to music, * anything. * Don't limit yourself to this. If you do, you can't say you weren't warned. And for the love of the Lord and the Lady, don't rent it. It's not worth it, even if you have the chance to rent it for fifty cents. Trust me, I know.
