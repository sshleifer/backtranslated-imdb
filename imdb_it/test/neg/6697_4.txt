A coach who was good, but who had to move to a new area to get away from what he once did; a team of non-hopers; the stellar player who has a row with the coach; the assistant coach with an alcohol problem, the little guy who is kicked by scoring the winning basket; the whole city against the coach (all except for the protagonist). It's the old story - directly from the British comics, where a team of mirrors and fat guys teases Brazilians about soccer and wins. <br /> <br /> This film, certainly well put together, is full of these clichés. The only part I had not foreseen was when at the town meeting, the star player suddenly decided to side with the coach. No reason has ever been given. It seemed a very strange thing to show that everything was going its own way until that moment. Perhaps he felt sorry for the poor boy. <br /> <br /> Gene Hackman plays a Popey Doyle locker room. I'm sure an actor of the caliber of Dennis Hopper didn't find anything particularly challenging for his role. The same can be said of Barbara Hershey. <br /> <br /> All in all, a film full of clichés that could have been done much better than it was.
