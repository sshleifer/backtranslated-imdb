Of the thousands of films I've seen so far, this is the first one that made me think of the expression "wasted talents". I had never seen so many good actors performing in such terrible shows (Frédéric Pierrot, Elsa Zylberstein, and so on). The "aged" make up is rather horrible and, to make it worse, generally enlightened. The use of music (for example love at first sight for the young aide-de-camp) is sometimes so caricatural that I could hear most of the spectators around me smile embarrassed. So far, Antoine de Caunes has been a good actor, but seeing this is "les morsures de l'aube" I think he should start to consider quitting. Please Antoine, abandon that project of "master of the balancer"; I doubt you deserve it.
