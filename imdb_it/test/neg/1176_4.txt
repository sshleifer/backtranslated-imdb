I saw this film quite confused. I'm not sure if I'm trying to be a horror fest in a Rob Zombie-like affair or an exploration of real events. <br /> <br /> In both cases he missed the target. It is not particularly accurate from a historical point of view with the characters cut and modified for the sake of history. <br /> <br /> The performances were neither compelling nor negative. <br /> <br /> For me, I would have preferred a more psychological approach and this film could easily have followed this path without ruining the overall effect.
