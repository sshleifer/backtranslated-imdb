Yes, there is a "sleeper" who looks at Sleeper Cell and it was me. After reading the comparisons with "24" (as on the DVD cover), I expected a frantic action game. But no ... this series goes on. In my half-drowsy state I thought, "It's going to ..." and, poof, would have happened ... "Guess the van is about to roll away ..." and here it is. <br /> <br /> And so on. <br /> <br /> And why does Darwyn chase a child in a very deep cover? Could it be, perhaps, provide a small T&A? Hey, this works for me, so four stars instead of three. <br /> <br /> This show is not "24". I saw "24". Sleeper Cell, you're not "24".
