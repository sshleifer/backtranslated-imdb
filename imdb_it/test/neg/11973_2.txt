Wow! Here's another straight-to-video scarecrow to keep film masochists happy. If the economic-looking opening titles don't tell you you're around, then the diabolically tragic "writing" will surely do it. <br /> <br /> A diabetic child is tied to a legendary scarecrow as part of his initiation into the baseball team. Then the scarecrow goes mad and starts to kill people. Do I have to say anything else? This film is composed mainly of economic effects that make it as if it had been modified with iMovie (known as a disquieting color reversal) and actors who apparently weren't good enough to appear in a special Cinemax late at night. Actually, this is not right, as the actors didn't have much room to get around the abysmal script. Parts of this film really look like parodies, especially when a character takes his guitar and starts playing the worst song ever designed by humans, with the worst lip sync ever performed to get along. The "gore" here is also a big disappointment. In most B movies like this, there is a thick layer of cheap Gore FX to compensate for what is lacking in the plot and acting. Here, the material is so cheap that it's not even fun. This movie actually makes "Jack Frost 2" very fun by comparison. <br /> <br /> If you think this film is the "worst you've ever seen" then you probably didn't go deep into the world of straight-to-video B-horror. Regardless, this film will cause you a great deal of mental angst regardless of your background.
