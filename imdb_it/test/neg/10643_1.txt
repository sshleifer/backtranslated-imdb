A sort of recognition must be given to "Hellraiser: Bloodline". In reality it is full moon full of full moon. Bring all the signs of, for example, your series of 'Demonic Toys' or 'Puppet Master', without their charm, uh, charm? Full Moon can get away with stupid products because they know it's silly. These things Hellraiser, friend, never take themselves seriously. This increasingly stupid series (though not as stupid as they are to have seen it) once made up for its low budget by being elegant. Now it's just ish.
