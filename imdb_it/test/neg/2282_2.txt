I was extremely disappointed with this. Having just read the wonderful story of Oscar Wilde, I had hoped for at least some magic to be translated on the screen. Well, there was nobody there. This version worked as a condensed, amazed Reader's Digest movie. Not only did he feel rushed, he was devalued and reworked unnecessarily. The main characters and plot points have been changed or completely removed. I appreciate the difficulty of trying to bring a novel to the screen, especially on what might very well be a limited budget (TV), but there is no excuse to alter a great story in this way. I highly recommend reading Wilde's story about the depravity that exists even in the most beautiful exteriors. But I can't advise anyone to rent this parody.
