"The polar Express" was a terrible film. What makes this film worse is the hypocrisy of presenting itself as an innocent, sugary and harmless story for children about the "true" meaning of Christmas. I've never read Chris Van Allsburg's book in what was inspired, but the most disappointing is that it was directed by Robert Zemeckis, the same one who made the great "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?", An excellent film in which shows that animation could be appreciated equally for children and adults, while in this film it seems to be a victim of its own ambition and gives too much importance to creating an impressive level of detail compared to an interesting story. I'm sorry to say, but "The Polar Express" has a level as artistic as an advertising campaign for a video game or a toy. Everything in this film seems to be so lifeless: the characters might look human, but they have nothing of life on them, and they have a malicious touch in their eyes. <br /> <br /> But the worst ... is the "message" in this film. It could be seen in some parts of the film, and believe me, it was cowardly. Take for example a scene, in which a child refuses to enter the Polar Express. Note that the character that looks like Tom Hanks makes a gesture like saying "you're stupid not to accept my offer". Second, when the girl says that toys are so "hot" and things like that. All those damn movies that kids keep talking about how great the gifts Santa would give them. There is also a song about gifts! The tramp is an irrelevant and weak character. And, in the last scene, the character seems to "discover" the true meaning of Christmas: and what would it be? what do you think ? gifts ! many Christmas movies are close to saying something like that, but "The Polar Express" is an ode to materialism and greed. Seriously, I refuse to call it a "children's movie", because if that's how children would learn, I don't want to think about what our future would be like.
