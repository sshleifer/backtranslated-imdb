I borrowed it on DVD from a friend the other day. I really didn't know what to expect. I haven't seen many Russian films, and I don't think I've ever seen a Russian war movie. Perhaps this made me wait for something different, something more along the line of an imagined Russian mentality. But whatever the expectations, they were ashamed as this is a fairly normal war movie. <br /> <br /> The entire formula to follow some young people from their recruitment, through training, deployment and through some battles, is well known. We have seen it done both many years ago and recently (as with Jarhead). Of course, here there is a difference because the film is about Russian rather than American soldiers, as almost always happens. But in general this could easily have been a Vietnam film. I guess this just underlines my feeling that Afghanistan was the Soviet union of Vietnam. A country that should have been a success for a superpower drove the war for years with terrible loss of life for both soldiers and civilians. <br /> <br /> The good points of this film seemed to me a good photograph (there are some beautiful shots) and decent effects for what I imagine should be a low-cost film. What made me disappointed is above all the story itself. He cannot stir up any emotion in me. Mainly because the character development is bad. And to really try something when people are killed, you have to make them people, not just faceless cardboard faces. They can't do it in this movie. It is also too long, and lately it seems like a trend. In my opinion, a film that is more than two hours long should have a lot to offer and this movie doesn't cut it. Also there is a disturbing music that is put like a wet blanket on every scene. Especially in the action scenes this is very annoying, not that you need action music, but something more than just music with a slow keyboard would be nice. Otherwise the production values ​​were quite good, that was not the problem. <br /> <br /> I don't know how to view this movie. As a reminder that no matter where you are, the war sucks? That Russian filmmakers have already seen too many American war films to create something original? Regardless, this film is rather cliché, lacking in spirit and while it has acceptable technical qualities, it lacks script and character development. In the end it becomes just another of all those war movies that fail to make you think, and it fails to add anything to the genre. I've seen a lot worse, but a lot better. I consider this 4/10.
