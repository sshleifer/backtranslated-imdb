My God ... I haven't seen such a terrible movie in a long time ... I saw it last night and wanted to leave after 20 minutes ... keira Knightley really tries very hard, but I can't handle it. accent from time to time and did not have the charisma to fill the role ... sienna millers acting takes you to a point where you start to wonder: have you ever had acting lessons? judging from the limit of love has never been to the acting class, but should consider going in the near future ... both look really beautiful ... maybe that's what they should focus on in their future career. .. if they can be actresses everyone can!
