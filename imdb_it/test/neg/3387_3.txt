Last night I sat in my TV room, beer in hand, bowl of pretzels on the TV tray and decided to put the movie "Monster Man" in my trusty VCR. Waiting for a funny, bloody, crash & bash cheesefest of a movie. What do I get instead? One of the most stupid, stupid, scary and predictable movies I've ever had the regret of sitting down. And what is even worse, all during the "sex scene" (and I use this next sentence freely) the girl keeps all her clothes on! I will make this summary short and sweet: mix "Dude Where's My Car" (about a good 1/2 of the film) with a very watered down "Hitcher", add a redneck version of the "I Madman" antagonist as the main villain and finally some incoherent black magic mumbo jumbo and you will understand how rotten this movie is. It is also absolutely predictable for everything. The only noteworthy factor to this movie friend disguised as a "horror movie" is that some of the moments between the 2 guys (although the hero is a big annoying MAJOR and the other is a clone of Jack Black) they're a bit funny (just mediocre funny ie.like most SNL skits). In addition to this, "Monster Man" is a monstrous mess! 3/10 (I will distribute this around Halloween - I hope only after the person sees it that I don't scratch my house or worse)
