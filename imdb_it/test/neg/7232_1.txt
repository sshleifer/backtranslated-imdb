A carnivorous octopus, where the man Boaz continues to take inspiration from (which ...?) Davidson? However, even for the low and low standards of both giant marine animals that kill mankind and me, this is just beyond the terrible. The octopus is one of the most tender, lazy and weakest monsters I've ever seen. he just ended up in (ahum) East River because Sea World got bored of him. Actors can be seen repeatedly helping the octopus to suffocate them. A lot of idiots, that way you will never learn! Do you guys want all the other giant killer polyps (which is the correct plural, by the way) to laugh at him? Meanies. <br /> <br /> As far as stopping the octopus are wind, razors that are difficult to handle and even the special shipping agent Nick Hartfield and his partner, who will retire in a week but first must be eaten by the octopus . Oddly, the octopus won the fight! Another pair will evolve (the scars in my mind remain). Of course, of course, try to help him not do a damn thing (doesn't he have a gun or something?) But no, that magically doesn't help either. <br /> <br /> Ok, enter the love interest of the sea police, Rachel Starbird. Is it based on some comics or something? However, together they try to stop the octopus by walking in the park. They hope this helps, because it's July 4th in a couple of days, and the octopus could join the party. And you don't know how it is when he's drunk. Rachel then takes a school bus out of thin air to make sure this movie doesn't end while Nick feeds the octopus and other sea cops. <br /> <br /> But everything is disgusting that ends up being crappy, Nick manages to blow the octopus into pieces a couple of times, and a group of children who were there rejoice and laugh. You know, on your stomach, you'd probably get an R. In real life, I'd say all ages, but I like all ages, so my final idea is: suitable for absolutely anyone. There is no sex, no blood, nothing. Now forget that this film has ever existed. Enter the club.
