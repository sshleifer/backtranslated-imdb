Be alerted by the line at the back of the box that promotes a story that involves "too sexy athletes". There is nothing redeeming about Carrie 2. The plot is absurd, the acting terrible and the ending too predictable. <br /> <br /> I did not expect a masterpiece, but I expected to be entertained. I was not. The only way to rationalize the vision of this film was because I was at a relative's house while waiting for my car to be repaired. Unless in the same situation it is not very far from this film.
