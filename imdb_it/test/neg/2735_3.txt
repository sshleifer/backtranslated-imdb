This is a VERY VERY Nasty movie! <br /> <br /> The plot is weak, acting is bad and science is worse. <br /> <br /> The special effects do not convince. Dramatic scenes are a joke. At each step, you can see a mile away. The end is disappointing and there is no suspense. The best aspect of the film is the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The only reason for not giving a lower grade is because it's a TV movie and I think the budget was low at the beginning. <Br /> <br /> I think the young Luke Parry fans will still see this movie, but he did a better job. Again this is Terrible. Very very very terrible. If you have a choice, look at something else.
