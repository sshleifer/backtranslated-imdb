What a bad movie, the premise was all there, the actors were all there. Yet a credible plot, a good dialogue, characters to relate to were somehow dispersed. <br /> <br /> Typical hit hit premise set against the backdrop of every man being questioned by the system. The main character Tye and his little brother had no luck and their home will be recovered, along with the godfather Matt Dillon (who doesn't look much older than Tye so not exactly sure what happened) to the rescue with a plan to steal money from an armored van on which they work as security guards. Tye has a brief flirt with his conscience, but decides to get along. And so begins a truly terrible pit ride for 30 minutes of unbelievable rubbish. I will not list all the ways in which this film is unrealistic, but let me point out the main ones: <br /> <br /> Because Tye decides to be a good guy because a homeless person has become collateral damage, all his close friends , including his godfather, die. His godfather who is supposedly the family and the man who took him to the caper at the last minute to help him get out dies because of Tye. In an attempt to hinder his friends and the godfather he destroys all the money. The money came from the same bank that was recovering his house. Yet he chose it for the supposed family of Matt Dillon. <br /> <br /> There are many others, needless to say that this film was the tripe and I sincerely hope that no one else goes to see it.
