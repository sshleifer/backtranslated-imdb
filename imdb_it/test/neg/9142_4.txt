What a disappointment! I liked Jon Cleary's books on Scobie Malone, but there's little resemblance between him and the cinematic Malone. In the books he is a citizen detective, who is devoted to his wife and does not get involved in fists. For the film the character was spiced, in a copper outback that uses fists and is not against throwing himself in bed with a beautiful girl, even if what she and the other interest in the film see in him I don't know; Taylor was 39 and his face was swelling. <br /> <br /> But the strength of his character is remarkable; flies from Australia, apparently goes directly to the Commissioner's home (rather carelessly trying to arrest him during a balanced reception), saves him from murder (entering a brawl in the process), goes to a casino with a girl, leaves with another and take her to bed. So much for jet lag! On the way home of the Commissioner (showing a good knowledge of secondary roads in London), he is beaten by the bad guys, but he is still the first to have breakfast! It is also noteworthy that the inspector's limousine miraculously repaired the windshield and the headlights within minutes of the murder attempt and that a character has a touching faith in the precise timing of a clock-activated bomb. <br /> <br /> The best thing is the contempt of Joseph the Butler for the coarse Malone. And at least the film avoids being a London travelogue, although some scenes take place during Wimbledon's tennis week.
