I was a photographer who worked in Europe in the summer when Jim Salter shot the movie Three. <br /> <br /> I took some wonderful photos for him, one of which was told to me as a poster for the film. I didn't see the movie until a few years later. I thought it was bad. A pity, because the elements that entered us were convincing. Robie Porter's girlfriend was as beautiful as Rampling. Salter asked me if I would have been an extra cameraman so they wouldn't have to shoot everything twice. I said sure, but I had to go back to New York, promising I'd come back. Alas, I never came back. One of the unknown melodies of life. <br /> <br /> I wish I could post the photos I took somewhere. <br /> <br /> Rowland Scherman
