Well, some people might go see this to see a rubber-and-PVC vampire killer quack kick his ass. If that's what you want, and wear a cape, limit the points to the points and think that the name Lilith Silver is beautiful, you'll see a good movie. <br /> <br /> If, like most people, a murderer dressed in a sparkling and cracked gum with a huge neckline, thick makeup and bad fangs makes you laugh, then this is one of the best comedies that you will see. I laughed so hard that I almost cried. The ridiculous acting, dialogue and script help make this parody better than Dracula, Dead and Loving It could be ... <br /> <br /> Try to be cool and goth, and all you can do is make it a hilarious scene. Even the stuck lesbian scene is fun (how * ha * he removed those boots so fast? They were tied up to * here * ...) <br /> <br /> Don't see them if you like good movies. Watch it if you like terrible movies and you want to laugh until you fall ... It's not good, it's just bad.
