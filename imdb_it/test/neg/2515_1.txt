How dare you? Adam Low, without apparent shame, gives his name to this fake tribute. Nor is it a serious study, an analysis or commentary on Visconti's great work. Yes, it is long and portentous, yes, we have some wonderful clips of the films that most people interested in the subject have already seen. But what resonates the longest, leaving the most lasting impression is gossip. The last and most noisy voice comes from a third-rate German actor, prey to delirium. The Mr. Low, rightly called, directed this, hoping, I imagine, to get better ratings than his previous, more precise, but deadly boring documentary on Kurosawa. Well, I have news for you, Mr. Low and your cohorts. You have missed a great opportunity and I am the first to give you another.
