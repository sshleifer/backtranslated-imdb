The Man with Bogart's Face makes it necessary to capture the nostalgia of the spectators for the end of the 30s and the end of the 40s. It fails miserably for several reasons. First, Sacchi, while looking reasonably like Bogart and also speaking like him during the occasion and using his mannerisms, completely misses any Bogart charisma or acting ability. This is evident when Sacchi is clearly not imitating a scene from one of the Bogart films. Secondly, the film does not have the first rate of actors with whom Bogart was able to work. There are no Peter Lorre or Sydney Greenstreet in this, people. Of course, we were treated by Victor Buaeno, Olivia Hussey and George Raft among others, but they are not of the same caliber (or do not have enough time for the screen or are uncomfortable). Third, all attempts at "modern" humor all fall away. All the jokes about underwear, which Marlowe almost * never * removed that damn hat and trench coat (although Bogart would have), etc. They're not funny at all and they really take down this movie. Fourth, I've never heard a goofier-themed song on this side of Mitchell. Finally, the false reverence of the film for Bogart (and other classical actors) is really irritating. Bogart almost * never * played a straight hero, on those occasions he was a hero. He played complicated characters. This film makes Bogart a happy and moralistic activator. While this may be true for some characters in the film, the Bogart characters rarely adapt to this project. They are films like this that make people not exposed to the cinema of the past think that it is all in all, "good boy beats the bad guys and gets the girl" sucks with low production values.
