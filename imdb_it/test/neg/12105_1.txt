Almost a master's degree in how not to direct a film. From the misjudged, often incomprehensible script, Dr. Rey relies on a series of bad decisions that make the film an atrocious experience. Unfortunately, the film never rises beyond a sort of old-fashioned, almost misogynistic, gay camp, in which women are too beaten, OTT and middle-aged and men are young, empty and forever in search of sex. The director was unable to express the tone of the film or the level of the performances. <br /> <br /> There is certainly a great deal of "acting" going on. Dianne Wiest slips into a pale imitation of her Bullets Over Broadway performance and poor old Jane Birkin trying to give a comic performance. Even if you have to pity him because there is really little comedy here. It all looks like a very low rent version of Merchant Ivory's Le Divorce which, to be honest, wasn't even very good.
