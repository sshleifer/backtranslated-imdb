Just what the world needed: another superficial video from Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. This film delivers horrible messages to girls around the world, complete with a stereotyped "junior high" experience. They make learning of everything that seems completely taboo. I can't stand the false French accents, or those kids on scooters that run around those who eventually "fall" for the twins. Why am I bracketing everything? Because it's all stereotyped. The twins also complain that they don't have a stereotypical grandfather. They should be happy to even have a grandfather. How does this fit the form of Mary-Kate / Ashley? This has them arranging a single guy who (startled !!) IS NOT THEIR FATHER !!!!! Yes, folks, they actually have a mother who appears for all five seconds. I haven't even spent thirty minutes of this and I can already tell you how it will end. This film is so painful that it makes Miss USA look like an academic bowl. Really.
