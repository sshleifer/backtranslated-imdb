I was so offended by this movie that I had to write SOMETHING about it, so please humor me. <br /> <br /> His only saving virtue, outside of good acting, is that it does not exceed 107 minutes. Even that length is about 30 minutes too long. <br /> <br /> Comparisons have been made here for the brilliantly dark "The Grifters", but I can't see it. They are two completely different films. The closest 'Swindled' comes to an existing film is 'The Sting', made in 1973. It borrows (sorry, STEALS) liberally from this splendid George Roy Hill show, which is exactly what it was. I liked it because it didn't pretend to be anything else. <br /> <br /> There are so many falsehoods in "Swindled" that I thought I was in an aquarium. He is very confused, but this is just one of his many problems. The main one is this: if you make a film where everyone is lying to everyone else, where everyone is confusing, we have no 'anchor' to take root. The inevitable result is a mixture of very sloppy seconds from other caper films. <br /> <br /> Almost everyone in this film is conniving and questionable. Surely a basic lesson of Film 101 would tell us that the public must "take care" of someone. We can't 'worry' about anyone here: they are ALL pigs. It may have worked like a dissolute comedy, but it plays it directly from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS FILM, DO NOT READ MORE. GREAT SPOILER COMING SOON. WE ARE SORRY, BUT I HAVE TO DO IT. <br /> <br /> There is so much fake blood and so many fake killings that do not strain the credulity - it destroys it. The ending is absolutely ridiculous - a "murder" in a crowded airport that is not a "murder" at all? And does the "murdered" boy, soaked in blood, simply get up, brush off, and walk away, with fake blood dripping, with the booty? All while the police and hordes of people are watching and nobody intercedes? The director must have many cojones if he thinks we should buy into this. The Noirish B-movies of the 1940s did better. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of European films, but this confirms that Schlock doesn't always come from Hollywood. As for "Swindled", my judgment is based on a famous phrase by the well-known producer Samuel Goldwyn, who knew all about Schlock: "Include me".
