Not many people remember "The Carey Treatment", and I can't say I blame them. <br /> <br /> Blake Edwards did this during his lean years (ie between "Pink Panther" movies.) And for a story about a doctor who became a detective (Coburn) who works to solve a murder in his hospital , actually it is rather forgettable. <br /> <br /> Coburn is as reliable as ever and O'Neill is as beautiful as ever but there seems to be something missing from the proceedings. The twists and turns of the story are not very involving and even the climax, which should be unnerving, is rather devastating. <br /> <br /> A missed opportunity altogether, and an unfortunate one for that, since it was based on a book by Michael Crichton. <br /> <br /> Oh well, at least Crichton didn't write a sequel. <br /> <br /> A star. "Carey", Coburn.
