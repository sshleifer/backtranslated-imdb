I'm starting to wonder if all these PG-13 horror movies are just glory tests for emerging young talents. Take a screenwriter for the first time, an inexperienced director, some television actors looking for the big screen break and see what they can do. 'When a Stranger Calls' is a bit better than most of these recent offers, but it is still completely textbook; full of holes in the plot and genre clich√©s. <br /> <br /> The story is incredibly simplistic. The slim 87 minute run time is heavily stuffed with petty friends and a useless cheating boyfriend. The killer also lacks the symbolic motivation of Jason or Michael or even the killer of the original film, and as a result is never particularly scary. The police behave in such an incredibly ineffective and indolent way as to miss a professional misconduct. Simon West brings the same attractive banality in the processes he has managed with Lara Croft, but his style of directing is decidedly generic, lacking real talent or vision indicators. Performances are routine, dark corridors replace real horror, and fears are of the tired variety of cats in closets. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and production design, however, are above average for this type of film. The house is well designed, all in dark wood and glassy reflections, and there are some moments of visual interest. <br /> <br /> While lacking an ounce of dramatic originality, it behaves like a reasonably satisfying 'dark house' thriller, and keeps interest longer than most of its peers.
