I'm a big fan of the Farcry game, HUGE fans. It still has a place on my list of top-10 games of all time! The plot was new, fresh ... A really brilliant base on which to base a film ... or so I thought ... <br /> <br /> Farcry the Movie is nothing but another attempt by directors to cash in on a franchise of successful games (see Doom: The Movie, and many others ...). <br /> <br /> The video game starts when the player (Jack Carver) wakes up in a cave by the sea after being hit by a boat by an RPG of an unknown soldier. Jack then finds a communication device where (Harlan Doyle) guides him through islands, shipwrecks, jungles, installations and VOLCANO, to find his (friend?) (Valerie Constantine), all the super soldiers mutant fighters and genetically improved animals. <br /> <br /> The film is presented in a very different way: 1: there are 30 useless minutes (1/3 of the film) of "backstage" before even arriving at the scene of the "jumping boat". 2: Jack then walks on the beach, kills some assassins, then leaves ... Nothing like the game ... 3: There is no communicator with Doyle on the other side ... 4: "Modified Soldier" looks like albinos with singlets on ... And there were no mutant creatures similar to monkeys that jumped out of the bushes. Part of the Farcry game I liked to assign ... 5: There are no beach scenes filled with sunshine, no aircraft carriers, no communication stations on huge cliffs, SMALL reference to any game content (characters / objects / vehicles), in In fact, no attempt to follow the plot at all. 6: The climate scene of the game volcano is replaced by an old industrial building. 7: There is a final scene ... where everyone (except Krieger) lives happily ever after ... WHAT! <br /> <br /> I recommend avoiding this movie at all costs! If you are a player, he will hate that this movie will do all your soul. It's a film clearly intended for males, so girls, stay away ... So, if a male, 12-29, never played Farcry, and isn't disgusted by the directors' attempts to bring books / games to the cinema ... then this is for you ...
