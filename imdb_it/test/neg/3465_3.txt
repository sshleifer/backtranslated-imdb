How many times do I have to write the boring and not funny words on this page until I get to ten lines. George talks about an original actor like Alfalfa from the small Rascals. Although this is probably a bit of alfalfa. How many times have I sneaked into these overpaid films of actors before I learned that there is only one law in the film industry. Take the money and make a movie - even if it's crap. They spend millions to make this film, but it doesn't take a few minutes to see the final result. And Renee GoAwayZigger should stop taking the illegal drugs you are taking and ask for medical help for the facial problems you are having. At least I hope it is drug-free since it is rather unattractive while speaking out of its mouth. This film was neither fun nor dramatic and these hacks should simply stop shitting like this. George and Renee, you should be ashamed of yourself and stop quitting being fetid and greedy.
