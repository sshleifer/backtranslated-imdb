"Tenchi Muyo In Love 2" is Tenchi's third film. It seemed that its creators took elements from the first two to do this. At the risk of giving spoilers, Tenchi is kidnapped and the team has to bring him back. Nothing new there. A past love of Yosho is the villain. This was done in the second film. The battle between Aeka and Ryoko is starting to get boring. The film has almost no action scenes and very little comedy. I personally don't know what AIC was thinking, it's the producers. I gave this film a rating of 4.
