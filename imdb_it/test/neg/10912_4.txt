Cujo is a giant Saint Bernard, lovable, kind and affectionate owned by the Camber family, during the opening sequence Cujo chases a rabbit on fields and through a local wood somewhere in Castle Rock, Maine. The rabbit disappears in a den and Cujo sticks his head in the entrance hole. The rabbit disappears from the sight of Cujo, angry, Cujo begins to bark and in doing so inadvertently wakes up and annoys a colony of bats, one of which bites him on the nose. Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace-Stone in the role of Dee Wallace) has a relationship with Steve Kemp (Christopher Stone, Dee Wallace's real husband) that her husband Vic (Daniel Hugh Kelly), who works in advertising, discovers. Obviously their relationship becomes tense. Their young son Tad (Danny Pintauro) is happily unaware of this. Joe Camber (Ed Lauter) repairs the cars to live from his barn on his farm. Joe is planning a weekend for boys with one of his friends Gary Pervier (Mills Watson) when his wife Charity (Kaiulani Lee) wins $ 5,000 in the lottery and decides to take their young boy Brett (Billy Jayne as Billy Jacoby) in a trip to see his parents. Arriving at Gary's house to pick him up, Joe finds him dead on the floor, goes to the kitchen to call for help and his dog Cujo, who is now a rage and kills him. Donna and Tad drive to Camber's farm to try to get his car repaired. The place is deserted except for Cujo who is now completely angry, with foam at the mouth, his fur stained with blood and drenched in pain. Cujo attacks the car to try to reach Donna and Tad, fortunately for them the windows remain still, at least for the moment anyway. Donna tries to start the car but is completely broken, they are both trapped with nothing but the hope that someone will come and save them. Cujo is lurking, ready to attack and kill anyone who crosses his path. Directed by Lewis Teague, I thought the film was a bit slow for my taste. The first half trudges, the second part develops a steam head, but I still felt that it was a bit overwhelming and not very exciting. Acting is good for everyone, I have no complaints. Technically the film is OK, photography, music, special effects, editing and is generally well done. The big problem is the screenplay by Don Carlos Dunaway and Lauren Currier and in particular the first half, most of which seem to have been filled to lengthen the time spent. With a stopwatch just under 90 minutes, it seemed longer. It's also a bit predictable. Cujo like a monster has never really scared me, but I don't find the overweight of St. Bernards that I'm afraid of. I suppose there is nothing really wrong with that, but I don't think I'd be in a hurry to see it again. Average, not bad if you can find a cheap copy or take it for free on T.V.
