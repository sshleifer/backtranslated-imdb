Simon West's remake of the 1979 horror classic is a pathetic attempt to bring old-school thrills to a contemporary audience. Interesting teen talent Camilla Belle, when a Stanger Calls can't even get a shocked or even surprised face. Poor attempts to scare the public range from fuzzy coats that look like people building tense music for a cat that runs out of the shadows. The plot follows Jill Johnson (Belle), a teenager who has to pay an account to her father through a babysitter. She is invited to work for the night in a house near the river, and thinks it's a perfectly simple way to earn money. But little does he know, a stranger lurks at home and constantly harasses Johnson via the telephone. A pathetic excuse for a movie.
