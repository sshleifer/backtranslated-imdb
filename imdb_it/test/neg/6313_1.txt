This film easily falls into the category of ridicule, if not beyond that actually offensive. I mean in what alternative universe did filmmakers and studios think this movie would play? From the beginning to the end we were bombarded by Quaids with exaggerated and ridiculous expressions, which were a bit too much about the impression of "a wandering madman". Another turning point I had with the film was the lack of a realistic story of events that would make you grow to connect to a character. I mean, in a scene where Lewis is playing in a bar before he makes it big, there is this over the top, a completely absurd fighting bar that apparently every citizen in the city is part of. Then Lewis starts acting out his "Lots of shocks" and everyone immediately forgets their differences and they start dancing wildly like it's the most normal thing in the world. This type of scenes, of which there are numerous, together with the lack of depth in any of the characters, led me to real laughs. So all in all, this film is not worth seeing by anyone who is not interested in making fun of the decisions of a director and his actors for an hour and a half.
