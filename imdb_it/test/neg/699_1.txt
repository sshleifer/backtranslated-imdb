I'm in a film class and I know I don't know everything about the movie but honestly this is one of the worst, stupid, retarded and wasted movies I've ever seen and I've seen NAPOLEAN DINAMITE. they are both equally terrible. Conrack is boring and nothing interesting happens in the film, it's not really a story that warms the heart and Pat Conroy doesn't win anything! I'm not saying there should be fights and crap, but that would make a bland movie more beautiful. the kids they loved to play in this movie may have been the real kids on the island of yammacraux, they looked stupid and couldn't act, as far as I'm concerned, this was a stupid idea for a book and an even worse ID for a movie I don't know why this movie was made, with the five worst movies of all time.
