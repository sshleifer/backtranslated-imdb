This was the first feature film for almost everyone involved, including director Teck Tan, so they deserve the credit for doing so. But this film was embarrassing in his direction, preaching in his style, exaggerated in his acting and excessively politically correct. The plot was everywhere, preventing any aspect of it from developing well. The gangsters get involved in the story, although I'm not sure what their presence is added to the film except to make the film even more unrealistic. They could have been completely excluded and the film would have been better as a result. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a young ethnic Chinese Malay who returns to his country after studying in the West. His studies have brought him back to the skills he believes he needs to fulfill his dream of running a rock band and take him to the top of the Malaysian charts (a rather youthful premise). The beginning of the film hints at the conflict with the traditional father, but once the gangsters are involved, this part of the story is unclipped unceremoniously. <br /> <br /> The film seeks to exploit the wonderfully diverse ethnic mix of Malaysia, but unfortunately, the way these aspects have been staged seems either terribly artificial or even preacher. There is a beautiful scene of Malaysian women doing a beautiful traditional dance on a beach, but the way the vision is integrated into the plot seems forced and unnatural. <br /> <br /> The acting came out as a little amateur, and the male protagonist was particularly unconvincing. The Malay female was a notable exception that left the most positive mark. The film also has an openly gay character, and although it is a bit of a caricature, it offers some of the funniest moments in the film. But the film was just above a typical local TV soap opera. Unfortunately, this film, which is not in the least offensive, has been banned in Malaysia. 3/10
