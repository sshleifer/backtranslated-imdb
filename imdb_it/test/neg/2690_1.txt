I have long tried to understand why people like Shakespeare so much and every few years I give them another chance. I was hoping that this game / movie (my sixth different Shakespearian game) would unlock the lucky chest and marry me to the riches of this literary devil. Bah, I clearly chose the wrong key. <br /> <br /> Once the phrase "pound of flesh" had been pronounced for 10 minutes in the film, the main parts of the plot were transparent, grinding along with a languid script and lifeless acting. At each step, the plot is laid bare two scenes in advance. The idea that a dying aristocrat can persuade his daughter to choose her future husband through a lottery is incredulous. It's not surprising who wins the double jackpot because Bassanio is the main protagonist of the game .... and he is the third man to try ... and there are three boxes to choose from ... and his friend risks his life to pay the dote The only real surprise that I watched this film is that it did not end immediately after the resolution of the court case. However, as soon as the ring treachery started, it was immediately clear what would happen. <br /> <br /> OK so I know that millions of you love Shakespeare not for the surprise in well-known stories, but for the depth and passion of the characters. But I didn't hear anything about the characters. Rather than fascinated by suspense and admiration during the court scene, I sat there impassively hoping it would end, soon, please. <br /> <br /> One day, I might find a Shakespeare play that does something other than boring me.
