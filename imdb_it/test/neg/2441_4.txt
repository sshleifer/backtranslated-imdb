A British teen film that revolves around a girl (Justine) who accidentally creates her dream man (Jake) using a virtual machine, there is only one problem (well ??. Not just one ??) she is trapped inside the his body with a geek as the only person who knows the truth and the only person he can trust. It looks much worse than it is, I found it more watchable due to the fact that Laura Fraser acted in him more than the content of the film, on the contrary, it seems incredible especially when she dresses in a red lycra dress to impress Jake, WOW! !, If only I had a virtual reality machine ??????
