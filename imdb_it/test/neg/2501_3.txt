As a true horror fan, I understand that certain marketing tricks are used to sell movies, especially the really bad ones. So I wouldn't call it naivety that I thought was a softcore horror tearing Cannibal / Zombi / Jungle Holocaust. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong because this is very hardcore. I should have realized this when I saw the odd notice "No actual or identifiable minimum has been used". Notice the identifiable part as if it was challenging us to capture it? A group of scientists, half of whom are beautiful women in bikinis, are led by a sea captain with a penchant for the beach, looking for a native mutant village that kills. Due to a nuclear bomb detonated on an allegedly evacuated island, radiation has turned the latter into a rapist / murderer. <br /> <br /> The writer / actor George Eastman is the only one to try and manage to keep his clothes. Sex scenes have been eliminated. Women walk naked discovering a strange excess of confidence and even ask for a rape when her husband rejects her. Well, two chicks that slap each other naturally turn into a lesbian scene because women are little dogs. I saw the girl throw another chick and a finger herself. <br /> <br /> If there's anything you should know about this movie, it's that. Because the rest of this crazy movie is the same. Oh, who am I kidding? There is still a lot of things to say here. Like the white "Duchess" who pays for 2 blacks to tag her in a living room. Or the "duchess" who takes off her shirt to use it as a bandage when the captain cuts himself. When he refuses his advances, he starts crying. So being the good gentleman he is, he reluctantly pleases her in front of the other crew members. Honestly, I was waiting for the pizza boy to show up and the "Duchess" asked if there was another way to pay for it. <br /> <br /> And all this happens before they leave for the island to conduct their research. Wait, I thought it was a zombie movie? But the zombie does not enter up to the 73 minute mark, but at that point all the others were "inserted" in abundance. I found myself hitting some scenes quickly or more. This is my first splatter porn movie and I don't think it implies any justice. I guess it's the woman who talks to me when I say I'd like more conspiracy and less sweaty, drooling, hairy sex. The funny thing is that it could have worked like a decent horror movie, since the idea of ​​an atomic bombing that changed a bitter man and killed his family was a good idea. Even the character of Eastman shakes his head and moves away from a copulating couple. I wonder if it was the character or the writer who was disgusted. <br /> <br /> I don't want to get into the sound or the quality of the movie because you should have already imagined it was bad. This production was shot in series with 3 other films, including Erotic Nights of the Living Dead, which features most of the same cast. Eastman said this was done because everyone wanted a vacation and a salary. It doesn't matter, I want to talk about the sound suddenly. The sound was strange during sex scenes, because while the cast is speaking Italian, it seems that they have recorded some English voiceovers that they played during their dialogue. So while 2 people are boning, I can clearly hear someone in the background saying "No! Yes! Wonderful! Wait!" There was a slightly amusing Italian score that could not save this film. SFXs were minimal and consisted of some blood only in some scenes. And I would like to point out that there were no violent rape scenes like the luminous warning label on the DVD cover (ehm, another marketing ploy), so don't worry. Only fear the bad movie. <br /> <br /> Presented in Widescreen 1.85: 1 aspect ratio. I saw the non-nominal version 1 of the 113min running version released in 2005 by Exploitation Digital. Apparently there is a XXX version of Alfa Digital, which has the same duration, so I doubt that everything is different. Prices vary, but you should not pay more than $ 25.00 for a copy. Or how I would recommend, pay nothing and pretend that it does not exist. <br /> <br /> Favorite quote: Shipmate, "Civilians are bad luck. Women are bad luck. They too are scientists? monsters". DVD Extras: original trailer with hardcore hits and kills to make it more interesting than it is, Trailers for SS Hell Camp, Emmanuelle, & ENOTLD, and a very informative interview with Eastman. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Lame porno, but even weaker as a horror movie. Or take a real porn or watch the real horror. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 by Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com
