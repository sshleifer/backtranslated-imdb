Well, the first thing I saw after seeing the DVD box was "Best Screenplay" and I thought it would be a good rental. WOW, I was wrong! I'm sure there was a good movie here once, but after acting incredibly poor acting and "video game" values, this ends up looking like Tron's late half brother. The first scene sets the general atmosphere of the whole film. Five minutes later, you're wondering, "What the hell am I looking at?", And from there it will start flashing. A terrible soundtrack that makes every song look like Rob Zombie's "Dragula" complete this miserable piece of shit in a ridiculous ugly movie. In a side note, the most romantic quote n. 3 in a film - "I think you are the final destination".
