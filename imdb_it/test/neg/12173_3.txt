In the shocking zombie art-house film by Michele Soavi, Dellamorte Dellamore, Rupert Everett plays Francesco, a caretaker in a cemetery where the dead do not remain buried for long. Helped by his simple assistant, Gnaghi, Francesco confronts the problem of the cemetery zombies by shooting the undead at the head or by splitting them with a spade. <br /> <br /> However, immediately after falling for the mysterious and beautiful widow of one of his last interred, Francesco finds himself more committed than ever ?? <br /> <br /> After collecting some particularly favorable comments from some of IMDb's most respected horror officianados, I decided to see what it was. I just finished watching the movie, and I can honestly say I haven't been disappointed in a horror movie for a while. <br /> <br /> With its confusing pseudo-philosophical plot, and an extremely bland performance by the protagonist Everett, Dellamorte Dellamore is an annoying and tiring mess that not even a bit of gross blood (courtesy of Sergio Stivaletti) the free reception of nudity (from the busty Anna Fialchi) can save. I can't understand the amount of in-depth analysis and discussion that this pretentious bilge has received from its misguided fans.
