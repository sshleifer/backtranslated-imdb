Sherlock Holmes and Secret Weapon begin in Switzerland when the most famous detective in the world, Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone), outsmartes the Nazis and manages to smuggle a brilliant scientist named Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.) out of the country and towards the relative safety of London. But is London as sure as Holmes thinks? Dr. Tobel designed a new revolutionary bomb that will forever change the air raid and agreed to give it to the British government, but those Nazis want him just as badly and Professor Arnold Arnold, Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atwill), intends to steal the secret of the sight of the bomb and selling it to the Nazis. Add the clumsy inspector Lestrade (Denis Hoey) of Scotland Yard, the love interest of Dr. Tobel Charlotte Eberli (Kaaren Verne), murderers, mysterious scientists and an enigmatic coded message and Holmes has his job cut out to keep alive Dr. Tobel so he could deliver his bomb on sight ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Roy William Neill Sherlock Holmes and Secret Weapon was the fourth in a series of fourteen Holmes films made between 1939 and 1946 with the participation of Rathbone & Bruce as Holmes & Watson. The screenplay by Edward T. Lowe Jr., Scott Darling and Edmund L. Hartmann is based on the short film 'The Dancing Men' by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and is not the tradition of the Holmes murder mystery as it is more of an adventure story in time of war. To neglect what Holmes is all about, the resolution of crimes and complex mysteries is a big mistake for me and the involvement of the Nazis and the war as a backdrop for the story seems out of place, embarrassing and simply not being too comfortable with me dialogue is not great, Professor Moriarty seems almost an afterthought, as if they could not invent a villain for this, and overall is much less engaging than the others in the series. However, at least it's short. <br /> <br /> Director Neill does his usual efficient job, but you have to cut it a little and keep in mind that it was made over 60 years ago. It has no real style or imagination and lacks both atmosphere and intrigue. <br /> <br /> Technically the film is OK if not spectacular, black and white cinematography is fine even if I understand that a colorful computer version is also available. The acting goes well, Bruce & Hoey make their usual comic reliefs and Rathbone's hairstyle in this aspect is ridiculous and I'm glad he changed it for the next few episodes. <br /> <br /> Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon were a disappointment when compared to some of the other excellent voices in the series, there is very little I can recommend it from and everything that made the other so good seems to be missing here. Leave this to the last and watch some of the best before, just for the hard fans.
