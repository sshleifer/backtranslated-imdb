"Heaven Can Wait" is an overwhelming boredom and a misogynist and confused lie. I can't imagine anyone, apart from film students, studying it today. Don Ameche is present in almost all the scenes and, although he has a mellifluous voice that undoubtedly contributed to his successful radio career, he does not have the charisma to bring this film. Ameche plays Henry, a womanizer. Lubitsch wants to make Henry's sexual incontinence adorable and fun, and then directs Ameche to play the role as kindly as possible. The combination of Ameche's lack of charisma and Lubitsch's insistence on blandness translate into a main character who is both boring and completely icky. You wouldn't want to spend some time with this man; he would put you to sleep. You wouldn't leave him alone with your daughter, regardless of his age. Something creepy would have happened. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the film is rather boring. Scene after scene consists of static, excessively illuminated, diorama-style shots of stuffed shirts and thongs of Gilded Age, dressed in annoying fashion, relaxing in over-busy Victorian salons. There are so many frills and frills and doodles, so lilac and sky blue and pink, you need Dramamine. <br /> <br /> This film hates women as much as hardcore porn, but it presents that hatred with a coating of candy and a sweet bow on the top. The contrast between the content of the message and its delivery is disgusting. In one of the most hateful scenes in the film, an old woman is sent to hell because she is not physically attractive.
