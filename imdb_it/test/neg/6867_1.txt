The idea is great, ruined by the time of the judges. <br /> <br /> Why make fun of people? if what the inventors say is true, and as many of them say, have spent their lives saving on invention, the minimum is to reject the idea without making fun of people. <br /> <br /> shows when they want to accept an idea from the auctioneer who added to the judges. <br /> <br /> The only one I respect from the judges is the one who always sits on the right of the table, he is a respectable person <br /> <br /> of course the snobbish Englishman who claims to be a business, wearing a suite doesn't make you a friend <br /> last but not least, the big guy who sits between the Englishman and the auctioneer. wake up, it's not a work called and inventor because you can call yourself one. an inventor is an attribute not a man of work. <br /> <br /> I think they wanted to add someone like Simon to the American idol, they thought it worked there, that it could work here too. the context is different and the idea is completely different. <br /> <br /> is a good idea and could have made a good show if they simply changed the judges and removed their behavior and attitude. /> <br /> stop teasing people.
