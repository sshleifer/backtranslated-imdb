I'm sorry people, but I have to say that I really can't understand the overwhelming feelings that everyone feels when they see this movie ... <br /> <br /> When I saw it I looked at my watch to know how much longer I had to pass with this nonsense to kindergarten. <br /> <br /> So why this verdict? <br /> <br /> First of all: The film tells a story that offers no excitement! Nor is it the amused and distorted reality of a Quentin Tarantino we knew. This story could have come out of every child's head. It has nothing intelligent about it, nothing inventive and goes on for hours ... the plot has appropriate contents for about 30 minutes. The rest is just wonderfully improved scenes that should leave a pretty interesting picture. It doesn't work Even the previously seen cuts that Tarantino uses often confuse and are in no way interesting. <br /> <br /> Second: some boys go to Germany and kill the Nazis. Oh really? They do? The only Nazis they killed were a handful of boys, one of them is man enough to die rather than betray his companions. Is this the ugly face that Tarantino wanted to give to the Nazis? A brave soldier who is braver than all the "bastards"? Certainly not -> fail And what happens to the terrible Basterds who kill the Nazis? Well, they are all killed by the Nazis except two who are taken hostage -> wow, what terrible vengeful monsters are ... <br /> <br /> Third: all the characters? Yes, one! The only role and the only glimmer of hope for the entire film is Chritoph Waltz who is building a really deep and very detailed character here. Great acting! Brad Pitt really sucks and is completely beaten by Waltz. Never seen a performance so weak from Pitt ... and the rest? Well, some Germans you've never seen before and will never see after. When the film started and I saw the group of seven Basterds I was hoping to see something like the "Magnificent Seven": a group of extraordinary boys, each with a distinct character, who was heading towards their destiny without fear and knowing ... I was very disappointed when I saw the "Glorious Bastards". No details, no characters, no real men, just some casual guys who will not remember who has not been given any chance to stand out ... But in reality you don't even need to differentiate, because the "Glorious Bastards" except by Pitt who plays almost no role in this movie ... <br /> <br /> So I was really disappointed and seeing this movie on the # 40 spot of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing that leaves me with an open mouth ...
