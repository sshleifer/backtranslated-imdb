I saw him at my in-laws' house one night when he appeared on TV and my mother-in-law said it was one of his favorite movies. Well, she can have it. <br /> <br /> Look, I can enjoy a chick chick from time to time, as long as it's nice. But this is extra-mushy, unrealistic and simply predictable, despite some decent performances by Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman. It is disturbing how quickly a woman can accept having taken her eyes off sight. Oh, well, they say love is blind ... <br /> <br /> The happy and orderly little ending made me almost gag. And how often did we need Otto Kruger to repeat the title? It didn't happen once, not twice, but THREE TIMES!
