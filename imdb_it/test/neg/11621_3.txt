I really enjoyed BG Seasons 1-3 and really couldn't understand who he didn't like. But I can't defend this nonsense. Followed by spoilers. <br /> <br /> The first problem is that the characters are doing inexplicably stupid things on a regular basis: <br /> <br /> So if Starbuck thinks he knows where the Earth is, why not send it out in a Raptor? Would the Admiral have accepted the resignation of his third most experienced officer? Would the Quorum elect its new member, the non-elected Adama Junior? He has about three weeks of political experience behind him, and is the son of a man whom they distrust. Would Adama have sent Gaeta and Halo together with Starbuck, leaving the senior officers alone? Would Adama put a man to have sex with Cylon prisoners in charge of the fleet? <br /> <br /> I don't buy any of this. <br /> <br /> Secondly, as I accept there have been miracles and references to God until the end of season 3, now it's all completely over the top. I started watching BG because I thought it was Sci Fi, not a bit of a biblical epic. I expected the characters to continue to behave reasonably intelligently and wanted some satisfactory explanations regarding some of the more difficult developments in the series. <br /> <br /> Baltar was the best character on the show, but now he seems to be completely crazy. Not illogical considering what it has gone through, but very unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> All the characters seem to be just puppets that dance on the order of a third unknown (a divine entity). This is not a good drama, it is annoying and a policeman who writes. <br /> <br /> OK, so what are the positive points? Beautiful battle at the beginning of 4.1. Some good dramatic scenes (well performed) if viewed in isolation. A good final scene, a beautiful ball curve overhanging a development. <br /> <br /> But this is not Sci Fi, it has become Fantasy. I can't imagine how the authors can recover this.
