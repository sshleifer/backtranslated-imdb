Although presumably autobiographical, this film shows very little insight into both the protagonist's psychology (resulting in a flat and fragmented characterization) and large-scale historical processes, and my hope of learning something new or improving my understanding of Iran contemporary has remained unsatisfied. Instead, I found my sensitivity somewhat blurred as a succession of bad bearded Muslims replaced each other by mocking, torturing or killing the Iranian prototype of the haunted middle class whose Western cultural sympathies were patent (and whose release the film he seeks outright.) A deeper understanding of the film seems to demonstrate that of the mass media market, as it serves to nourish the prevailing Western folk ideologies (ie a "crowd pleaser"). <br /> <br /> What redeemed the film from being boring was its creative animation, a truly minimalist imagery that, however, has always kept the screen rich, expressive and unmistakable, no small party for which I give him stars.
