Oh my God, I was expecting something more fun than this when I downloaded this movie, since 1903 was one of my best years for movies, but it sucked! The "plot", although I would hesitate to call it that, is about a stupid elephant. Slowly he makes his way onto a platform and is shot to death. Boring. Even for a short film, the plot was too thin to keep my attention. Edison is, like, the worst director ever. Furthermore, the elephant has no screen presence. And the ending? Wow, it wasn't predictable at all. * sarcasm * <br /> <br /> Even the image quality is horrible. You can barely tell what happens most of the time. The only good thing about this movie is that, unlike most other non-scary horror films, this one didn't generate eleven sequels. Apart from that, it is a complete waste of money and 1 minute of your life you will never go back.
