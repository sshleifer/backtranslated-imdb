I had the misfortune of watching the BBC last night, I expect he may have been the only spectator. From the beginning there was something wrong with the film, after a few minutes of viewing I could figure out what it was. THE FILM HAS BEEN POOR! Not bad like Wolfpack or a Seagal movie that is simply poor. <br /> <br /> Why was it turned into a movie? I saw some episodes of the TV series and thought it was all right, but I only saw the repetitions of it because they did this. <br /> <br /> I spent most of the film trying to figure out what the story was and in the end I wasn't wiser. I seem to remember a character at some point, perhaps Farina's claims that the Mod Team can enter places where regular cops can't. The "place" turns out to be a "club", one of the most difficult places to enter, maybe it was the students' night? I lost track of the plot at this point or maybe there was no plot and the film was just chopped together from various leftovers from other TV series remakes. <br /> <br /> Was it an action comedy? I don't remember any laughter. <br /> <br /> Overall this film lacked the real scene that stole power from someone like Seymour Hoffman as the villain. With him Ribisi should have bounced someone.
