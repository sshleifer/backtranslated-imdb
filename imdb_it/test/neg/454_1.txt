From the weeks and weeks of promotion for this, ABC "The One" had to be "The Real World" meets "American Idol". We had to watch these singers perform, compete and see how they lived together in a house. The drama! The tension! <br /> <br /> Where do you start with this atrocity? Let's start with the "judges" who were known as "music experts" on this program. "Experts" implies that they have experience. Andre Harrell had at least one pedigree. He was at the head of Motown Records for a while. The other two ... eh. Kate Hudson's uncle, who could have been labeled Mr. Weird Beard. The hair on his face was dyed in three very different fluorescent colors. I wonder how scary it would have been with a black light! And the aspirant Paula Abdul, who did something I didn't think would happen: it was even more coarse and sickly than Paula! Then he corrected and became extremely severe after the first episode. The farce of "criticisms" that these three offered was a real joke and an insult, not only for the search process of the best singer, but for the audience that is now quite experienced, having already done so numerous times on Fox. /> <br /> There was the host. George Stroumboulopoulos was not Ryan Seacrest. In fact, he was as lackluster as he can be. Actually he sucked the little energy that was in the program, dry. How he got that job was the second biggest mystery of the show. <br /> <br /> The first was how did the 11 competitors choose for this program? This was literally a talent show without talent. OK. Maybe it's an exaggeration. And granted, the artists must be relatively close in abilities, because if they weren't, there wouldn't be a "contest". If only one person was "good", there would be no "suspense". So, I realized that everyone needed to be comparable. But everyone should have had * some * ribs! Furthermore, the judges ran a "Singing Academy", so the program was also part of "Fame". Clearly these artists desperately needed those lessons. But you need very talented people to teach those with little talent. And that wasn't exactly what was happening here. <br /> <br /> He seemed to be in the cast of the show, the priority was on the "homelife" elements, since all the players were very attractive to watch, equally sharing parts of how badly they vocalized. But the segments filmed in their home were cut and cut in two, you can't get into the stories that were starting to happen, so the show didn't capture the events there. <br /> <br /> As bad Conceived as all that was, "The One" had an incredible, incredible, fatal design flaw incorporated into the results that made it completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The public phoned the votes for those who liked the best, just like on "AI". But then, after the public vote was revealed, the three competitors below were forced to sing a final song. The "music experts", based on that performance, chose one person from the three to save the following week. And then, the competitors who were safe were able to vote for those who wanted to keep the remaining two, sending home the remaining competitor. <br /> <br /> The "design flaw" was that the competitors had the last word. I mean, if you were in a music competition and wanted to get as far as possible, would you vote to KEEP the best singer or would you like to get rid of your toughest rival? Any spectator of CBS 'first season of "Survivor" could answer that! And that's exactly what happened in the program. The person who had the best potential was lost, and the participants voted "the only one" who had no talent at all! Furthermore, the competitor who was just rescued from the fund by the "experts" was also authorized to vote against the remaining two! It was a complete farce! <br /> <br /> Maybe if they let the competitors vote first, at least the "experts" would save the best of two evils to finish. But this confirms that this show was not ready for the show, how unsatisfactory the whole process was and how the producers were misled into trying.
