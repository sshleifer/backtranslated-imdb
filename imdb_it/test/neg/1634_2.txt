Another in the long series of aspiring Conans who are tired of cashing in on the success of that film, this Italian monstrosity is as bad as they came. You know it's a bad sign when your heroes fight invisible enemies because the film was made at such a low price that there was no money, no adequate special effects or no hiring of real people. I won't even bother entering the plot as I challenge anyone to follow him and make sense of the plot. Maybe it's the TV cut I've seen, but I can't imagine that any version is much better. It all seems so random to me. Bad sorcerers, cavemen, giant snakes, medieval castles, grenades and hang gliding ?? none of this is combined. It is as if director Joe D'Amato had an epileptic fit while building Cave Dwellers (or any of the other half-dozen movie names) and throwing everything he could think of on the screen, no matter how foreign he was or how to get into the plot already baffling of the film. The acting is sufficiently negative. Miles O'Keeffe has never managed to get out of a wet paper bag and proves it once again in this film. The rest of the cast is equally atrocious. Then there is the. . . well, you get the idea. It's late, I'm tired, and I've already lost time writing about this piece of junk. Believe me on the word ?? avoid cave dwellers (or whatever else you want to call) at all costs.
