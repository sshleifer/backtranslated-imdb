This film was NOTHING like the book. I think the scriptwriter of the script should have wanted the job of writing the sequel to Gone with the Wind and being rejected. This was his way of getting their ideas anyway. The only similarity between this film and the story it was playing were the names of the main characters and the position of the main action. None of the events shown in the film happened that way in the book. For a fan of Gone with the Wind (both of the book and of the film) this was deeply disappointing. If you loved the Scarlett book, don't watch this movie hoping to see it reproduced on the screen. Only share the common title.
