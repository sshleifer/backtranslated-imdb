Construction workers interrupt the burial ground of the Native Americans of a large, gigantic skeletal monster that disintegrates its victims with its touch, its breath or the sword of bones! Krantz (Jim Storm) ordered his construction team to keep their skeletal findings secret to stop the continued development if the nearby Katona tribe took the wind that the remains had been unearthed and disturbed. An elderly Bruce Boxleitner, likeable as always, plays Sheriff Evans half-breed who tries to keep the peace between the Katonas and the Krantz crew. Peace was tense, at best, but with that skeletal monster that flowed unchecked making the victims disappear without a trace, Krantz soon wants answers about why members of his crew are missing ... Evans also starts to lose citizens. Evans is warned by the Katona Chief Storm Cloud (Michael Horse) that an ancient demon, the Bone Eater, has been loosened and can only be stopped with a sacred war ax (.. the ax was removed by a worker who has discovered that he remained with the weapon sunk inside) now in the back seat of his daughter Kelly (Clara Bryant, who wears tight jeans and shirts to reveal how Dad's boyfriend's truck has become a rather surprising girl). Evans must somehow defeat the demon if the killing stops ... and this must happen before the Eclipse or its power becomes too strong to defeat anyone. <br /> <br /> A solid cast, struggling in an embarrassing horror. The CGI is not very good, although the monster could have been rather threatening if done with a better budget. Ride a horse made of dust that chases its prey, for Petesake! Some cameo appearances include BUCK ROGERS Gil Gerard as Evan's deputy, Big Jim, Walter Koenig of STAR TREK as coroner and William Katt of HOUSE, as a country doctor who deals with Evan's deputy wounds. None of these cameos lasts more than a minute or so ... sado, really. Adoni Maropis, impresses in a role subscribed as a gloomy Katona, Johnny Black Hawk, who wants to use the bone eater to ward off the white man from the lands of his tribe. Jennifer Lee Wiggins portrays Kaya, a tasty dish from a Katona woman who opposes Black Hawk's hatred of the white man and Evans's desires to follow his Indian blood to end the Bone Eating monster. This might be worth seeing if only to see Boxleitner dressed in war paint and Indian clothes. I heard the actor, to be honest, while Bruce tries to keep a straight face in such a terrible movie. In yet another too elaborate and boring clich√©, Bruce Sheriff has a relationship that is estranged from his daughter, whose 17, hot, and who wants to hang out with the "bad boy" ... even if this ends up being a sub plot written like most of the plot about the murderous skeleton and many of the badly developed characters.
