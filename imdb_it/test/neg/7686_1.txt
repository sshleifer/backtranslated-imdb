I only watched the first twenty minutes of this film and personally I think this is the worst movie you can make in the last few years. <br /> <br /> The plot was so ugly that it would have been possible for a 10 written by a child of years. The acting was also sloppy with an almost unknown cast and not only that the action sequences, especially in the first part of the film, were so terrible that it was incredible. <br /> <br /> I don't know how the producers got the budget to film this film but the production company must be deplored by now. <br /> <br /> To anyone who may come across this film in the near future, I recommend you avoid this movie joke.
