This film has EVERY clich√© about any terrorism or aerial crisis films. <br /> <br /> However, it is not entirely unwatchable, thanks to the good performances of Rowland, Loken and Smallwood (and perhaps Enberg). <br /> <br /> What is incredibly bad, however, are the computer animations that try to pass on as live action scenes. Boy, oh boy, the CGI scenes of "The Last Starfighter", filmed in 1984, are better than these (shot 17 years later). The feeling of cheepnis really makes you shiver down your spine. <br /> <br /> Too bad, this could have been a much better film with a little more budget and taste.
