I'm a big horror fan, and I bought this movie from all the hype that was coming up on message boards. Well, let me tell you that I don't know who gave all this hype, but let me talk about some things. <br /> <br /> First of all this film is not "MUCH" of things. It is NOT scary, it is NOT full of suspense, it is NOT excessively bloody, it is NOT excessively sick (except for a MAYBE season) it was NOT beautifully marked .... AT ALL. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is that a couple flee to a small island in Greece because they have done a little malice in London. We don't even know what they did, but it is assumed that they killed someone. <br /> <br /> ** spoiler warning ** <br /> <br /> The male protagonist kills some people from his perversion of "cleaning up the island of perverts" strangely. Murders are cheap, the characters are cheaper and the effects suck. <br /> <br /> There is a part when he rapes a goat because his wife will not give him any in the morning, but even that is done without any care for how it turned. <br /> <br /> end of spoilers <br /> <br /> The end of the film is about the only thing that is not entirely predictable. I particularly appreciated when the "shepherd" runs over her husband. However, if you can rent this and have 2 hours to lose, go ahead. Nothing like a melted cheese sandwich on moldy bread. <br /> <br /> 3/10
