I would probably like to give this movie a zero if not for the climax, which involves not really Snakes on a train, but rather Train in a Snake. The premise was most likely prepared during a night of beers after hearing about Snakes on a Plane in production (this, in fact, was released to coincide with the release of that film). Probably the joke is not lost on those who seek it; I don't think there would be a soul out there who would consider this something as a serious action-thriller effort (unless it's an ironic level beyond the capacity for rational thought). This is a Mayan curse placed on a woman who is damned by her family for leaving with another man, and is soon seen as sick and coughing with green slime laced, of course, with snakes. She and her boyfriend go on a train to Los Angeles, and very soon after that the more than clich√© characters are aware of the snakes that overtake the train - with the originator woman becoming a snake herself. <br /> <br /> If it was worthwhile to list more about the film, I'd do it, but there's not enough time during the day. All that can be said for the quality factor is that it is almost non-existent; there are short films for students with larger budgets. Perhaps it was a wise calculation on the end of the filmmakers, that there would be so many copies sold, just for the prank factor alone, that they would rewrite their budget on the first weekend. Because looking at the sets (the trains themselves change randomly in the middle of a scene!), The actors (if you can call them that, with only one other actor - the one with the very thin hair that strikes a woman in the whole movie - who has benefited from the film produced), the FX (also next to non-existent, which makes the effects of Snakes on a Plane similar to Star Wars), and the current CGI acts as a snake, with the last huge behemoth snake something to see in terms of the science fiction film channel. <br /> <br /> All this basically means that it is a subdued brawl at every step of the way (especially, however cruel it may seem, when a child becomes involved in a snake's attention), with the disdain of good taste that works well in his favor. Having said that, it is also 100% disposable, like a lollipop with a sour taste from the movie B.
