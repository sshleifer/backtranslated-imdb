This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I would think you could get it from the title. Furthermore, there is a particular love scene that could be the strangest in the film's history. I can't even remember why I saw this movie or when. Only it's an absolutely horrible movie viewing experience. On the other hand, if you are looking for the strangest movie ever to waste two hours of your time, then by all means hire it. Good luck finding it in your local store though. I doubt that this film is in a very wide distribution. And please don't show it to children by any means as it could warp their impressionable minds forever.
