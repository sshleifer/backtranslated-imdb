Ok, <br /> <br /> I realize that there is some doubt that Thomas is out there ... I was one of them ... but then I saw this celluloid masterpiece. <br /> <br /> I can say that the scene in which George Wendt was sucked into SUO A **'s spaceship left me trembling. Sometimes I sit up in my bed, screaming like an old man on a proctologist's table to think about it. If the director is reading this ... I'd pay for it to be an extra in the sequel.
