This film is about a mysterious love letter that upset the love life of 4 people. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is interesting and the film could have been fun. However, this film is simply what a romantic comedy should not be. The characters are presented inadequately at the beginning, so it becomes so confused. The supporting characters come and go without adequate reasons, as if they existed only for a particular scene and then vanish into thin air. The pace is tremendously slow, which makes 90 minutes to look like 180 minutes. <br /> <br /> It may have been romantic and fun, but this movie failed to do the same.
