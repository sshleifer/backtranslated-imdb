I have trouble finding the words to explain how much I hated this movie. The historical process of Henriette Deluzy-Desportes and the Duc de Praslin is a tragic and compelling story that, I believe, had the potential to be a fantastic film, but failed. <br /> <br /> Although cinematography certainly had something to say on its own, it could not in any way compensate for the terrible structure of the film, the poorly written script and above all the horribly overcrowded characters. The worst of them were the sons of Duc who were so extravagant and maliciously fake that it was almost painful to watch. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film made me feel nothing but irritated and deeply disappointed.
