I was fascinated by the bad character of the boss like myself, and the daughter of the real boss was attractive and it was interesting to see an even younger Ashton Kushner, but this film is so childish that I had to turn it off. Watching it was a waste of time. When people started peeing all over the living room, it was too much to look at. Movie of painful and terrible shit. If they had just turned it down a little. Are there really people out there who find it funny and like it? I was relieved to know that IMDb readers judged it so low. The career side of the story was intriguing as was the young man who tried to get promoted and win the favor of the bosses. I liked that part. Also, the opening scene with colleagues on the train was interesting, since I like the characters of his colleagues. If you can handle meaningless movies or you're young enough, then it could be one you can stomach.
