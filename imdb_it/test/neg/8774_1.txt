I waited a long time until I was able to watch this Lone Ranger movie. I finally saw it on the Lone Star Channel and was very disappointed in the whole movie. Clayton Moore and John Hart performed better than Lone Rangers and Jay Silverheels as Tonto, compared to the two stars in this film. Very poor acting was done by everyone in this film. Even the plot was ugly and fascinating. I think the horse, playing Silver, was the best actor in this film. I'm glad I didn't go out and buy a copy of this movie when it came out, because I think it's a waste of money. I'm really sorry that the characters played by Clayton Moore, John Hart and Jay Silverheels, and brought to life on the big screen, have been misted so badly. Unless in the future they find actors worthy of portraying the characters in the same way that Clayton, John and Jay have done so well in the past, I won't spend the money to buy the movie. I will not watch this movie again. <br /> <br /> Wayne Davies
