Since "8 Heads in a Duffel Bag" and "How High" <br /> <br /> previews I have laughed so little at something the directors thought would be hysterical. <br /> <br /> Jerry Lewis is the richest man in the world. He is rejected as a 4-F <br /> by the army, and decides to use his money to increase his army- <br /> <br /> of about half a dozen. Then he impersonates a Nazi commander in <br /> Italy, and eventually tries to kill Hitler. This is the description of the fragile plot <br /> <br /> This movie is as fun as a heart attack. This film makes "Hogan's <br /> <br /> Heroes" similar to Shakespeare. If "The <br /> Producers" money really wanted to lose their money, they would have to show <br /> this movie. I can't stress how bad this thing is. <br /> <br /> The management of Lewis consists of two different cameras that take action <br /> <br /> from two different angles, to then be mounted together. This type of sitcom management <br /> <br /> works on television, but here is an obvious attempt to cheat the public. He ends most of his <br /> <br /> scenes with a shot, as if he were giving the viewer the chance to double down <br /> <br /> in stitches before moving on to the next tired setup. I spent most of <br /> <br /> on the movie doubled in abdominal agony, accompanied with severe flatulence, on this thing. <br /> <br /> Lewis, the director and producer, sets the film in 1943, but makes no attempt to use period costumes or sets. Everyone wears the latest style <br /> <br /> and has the most modern interior design ... for 1970. The supporting cast is lost while Lewis launches on his patented bribes, <br /> <br /> which last until major surgery and are just as painful to look at <br /> <br />. When Lewis becomes the Nazi commander, he spends the last half of the film screaming at the top of his lungs in a performance so odious as to make every good will stink try to bring <br /> <br / > at the beginning. <br /> <br /> The last embarrassing blow has Lewis and his cronies looking to <br /> <br /> put one on top of the Japanese. They wear buck teeth, narrow their eyes <br /> <br /> and speak in a "funny" accent. It could be one of the most <br /> <br/> blatantly racist events from internment camps. I was <br /> gaping for what Lewis did through this whole thing, but that put me to the limit. Watch Kaye Ballard's very insipid scene <br /> <br /> where she tries to attempt suicide over and over again. <br /> <br /> George Takei of "Star Trek" has two small scenes, then wisely <br /> <br /> exits the image. This has less laughter than Mel Brooks' last three films put together. There is nothing more sad than watching a previously respected comedian ruin a project so horribly, in reality you are ashamed for them. Jim Carrey learned it with "The Majestic", but Jerry Lewis still shows up on television once in a <br /> <br /> while pulling the same lousy fun. I'm sorry for him. <br /> <br /> "Which road to the front?" it's cheap, not funny, offensive and stupid. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for everyone involved, and anyone who has to put up with it. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend it. <br /> <br /> Although evaluated (G), this contains some physical violence, some weapons <br /> <br /> violence and some adult situations. If your child shows interest in <br /> <br /> seeing this, consult professional help. <br /> <br />
