I just saw this movie with some friends who said I had to see it but from the beginning I knew it would go from bad to worse. So I can only give this movie a 1 because the effects that were used were used so badly and I thought that anyone could see that there were no "real" ghosts. I feel that the worst part was that this so-called "haunted old house" contained a lot of new objects and some "conveniently placed objects". I could have imagined effects that would have seemed much better than a chair overturned by an invisible phantom (or should I say thread). Then later, when they examine the ribbon of the chair that turns it, it turns in a different way. Uh Oh this is a big mistake of continuity. If this was a really beautiful film, then they would have captured that and all the other objects of the "old house". This film is like a house rip-off on the haunted hill and the witch project Blair ended up in a poorly conceived and assembled film. I would be ashamed to put out something with that little bit of acting, the effects and the low-cost video shots of girls' cases and how cheap the camera falls when something "paranormal" happens. This film is an insult to people who are out there looking for ghosts and making real movies on tape.
