Quintet marks the only adventure of Paul Newman and director Robert Altman in the realm of science fiction. It was said of Newman that he could not do comedy, but he tried it until he finally got a real success in that genre with Slap Shot. But the failure of this film left him with a shy pistol and he never tried it again. <br /> <br /> This is one of the greatest downer movies I've ever seen. It's a futuristic ice age, caused by who knows what, but presumably it's a nuclear winter. Even during the ice age of thousands of years ago, the equatorial parts of the earth still supported animal and human life, but apparently not here. The seals have survived and Paul Newman is an outside seal hunter. <br /> <br /> But hunters need a small R & R and Newman goes to a futuristic city where things are so boring that natives have some kind of game played with six people and it's kind of a roulette Russian. To win, you must kill five other participants in your game. <br /> <br /> It is a sad turn to see which man arrived. This is one of the reasons I couldn't get into this story. The atmosphere is bleak, the story is bleak, people are sad, it's all so bleak. No wonder this thing has arrived at the box office. <br /> <br /> It is a film that almost everyone thinks will never be in the top ten of Paul Newman's films, including myself. <br /> <br /> This is the future of man, what a pity.
