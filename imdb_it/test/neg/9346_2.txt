Oh man, this movie was hurting toe-cringing. Bad look, horrible story ... the list of good things is shorter than the list of bad things about this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, of course it should be a comedy and everything but something tells me that this movie had to be the real deal. The film certainly doesn't start as a comedy, but more like an adventurous movie with fun elements put into it. In particular, you can say that they were serious in this with acting, in a serious and non-comical way, with the exception of a couple of exaggerated sequences, of course. At first it seemed that they had tried to make a real serious science fiction movie adventurous, maybe even a franchise, but soon began to notice how bad all this was and simply decided to insert some more deliberately exaggerated comic sequence, to make the film look more like a comedy and prevent it from turning into a complete disaster. <br /> <br /> The film is a bizarre attempt to mix adventurous swashbuckling pirate films with serious science fiction action. The film was obviously inspired by the "Star Wars" films and its success. The film is not too ashamed to copy entire sequences and even the way the story progresses, sets, characters and robots show similarities. They tried to hide it by entering some obviously spoofed sequences, but I'm not falling in love. So the film is not even original by itself, despite its original concept. It can be said that this film is "Spaceballs" of a poor man, without even really being a parody. <br /> <br /> The film is bad, with some special effects of video games (in some sequences even literally), horrible-looking costumes (coat of mail and swords in space?). The sound is sometimes even ridiculous. They seem to have shot some sequences without audio and then forgot to add all the sounds required later in post-production. mixing is also very bad. They tried to hide this by minimizing the sound sometimes and tuning the Bruce Broughton soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the movie is so busy that it tries to make the movie fun enough to make it totally forget about telling the story. It makes the movie's story extremely messy and poorly written, with a main plot almost completely underdeveloped. Moreover, it does not help to make the film flow. A lot of things are not explained and some are even abandoned after a while. The film starts as a 'pirate' movie, which constantly looks and steals water, since it is barely and there is only one planet in the whole galaxy that remains with water on it (yes, right!). However this plot is soon abandoned, especially in the central part of the film, in which the film seems to become totally different, with different motivations. It is just like that strange and ugly sequence, stupid after another, without really clicking. It also keeps the characters too superficial and uninteresting to worry about. <br /> <br /> Sad to see that actors like John Carradine, Anjelica Huston and a still young and unknown Ron Perlman were linked to this disastrous film. /> <br /> OK I admit I liked some of the moments, especially the ending when they go through time-warp was original and fun but in reality, not all of that was enough to save the movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't even like the movie in a campy way. <br /> <br /> 2/10
