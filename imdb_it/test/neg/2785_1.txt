This is a hopelessly stupid, boring, unimaginative piece of junk, lazily put together. When you look at a slasher directed at the video, it's fair to expect the movie to be sloppy on a certain level, but this goes beyond garbage. It's just awful at all levels, with a clich√© script that manages to be incredibly stupid and at the same time boring at the same time, a nameless cast on the actors and some of the worst special effects I've ever seen. Even fans of slasher movies won't be able to find anything here that would make this movie a useful use of an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The plot focuses on the usual group of young people who decide to spend the weekend at a remote farm in West Virginia that a member of the group recently inherited. Unfortunately for teenagers, the inherited land was once owned by a farmer who made sacrifices to help his crops grow, or something stupid along those lines, and now some scary scarecrows are out to kill everyone. I don't know anything about screenwriter Paul Moore's director, but I assume he's over ten years old, so he should be able to come up with something more original than the murderer scarecrows. Honestly. <br /> <br /> The special effects that give life to the scarecrows are ridiculous. They often seem little more than the Haloween costumes on sticks. Special effects like these would have been considered rather rather poor twenty years ago, but by today's standards, they are embarrassing to say the least. <br /> <br /> This is a total waste of time for all spectators, regardless of whether or not they are in horror movies. If you need to watch a slasher movie, rent one of the "Friday 13" or "Halloween" movies. Many of them are not very good, but they are certainly superior to shit like this.
