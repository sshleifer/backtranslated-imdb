Powerful film that proceeds slowly with a terrible acting on the whole - but enchanting places and clothes to admire, and, of course, Timothy Dalton, who does a compelling job, as always. I wanted to laugh out loud for the voiceover - so foolish !! But Dalton is always worth looking at, even in bad movies, a wonderful actor, older now, but still very handsome and masculine. This film is worth seeing just to see it ... and it seems that he came across a bad love story, a poor boy. Your time would have been better spent looking at Mr. Dalton in the "Wuthering Heights" of the 70s or in the first BBC version of the "Jane Eyre" 80s. Poor Sela Ward, so lovely, but so wooden ... she definitely improved in other films.
