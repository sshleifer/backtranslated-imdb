Froggie is upset that she never has a big party like all the other kids. Spanky and the band try to make up for it by giving him a surprise party. Unaware that all the decorations and preparations are for him Froggy sabotages everything just to find out too late that the party is for him. Okay The comedy Our Gang works in fits and starts. The bits work but I don't think it really works as a whole. Part of the problem is that we all know where it is going and given that much of the humor needs to have some form of surprise for it to work, the whole thing falls. I think the film is simply a mistake in a strange way. It's the kind of thing they actually thought might have been something more than a failed start. It is worth trying if you lower expectations
