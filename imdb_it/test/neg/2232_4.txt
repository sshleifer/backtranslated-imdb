If considered as an independent film, I can't say it's too ugly, but from where this sequel and the original "Lady and the Tramp" are, I disagree! They are two completely different films with different styles, different personalities of the voice, different narratives and the only thing they share among them are the images (for example the home of Jim Dear, Darling, Lady and Tramp) and none of those have changed. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for some kind of continuity years after the release of the original for those memorable songs like "Beautiful Night" and "The Siamesse Cats Song" this sequel will not give you at all! Almost all the songs have a little pop and those good old characters like Jock and Trusty, Jim Dear and Darling and Aunt Sarah and her cats can be seen but they seem to be somehow replaced by new characters, not to mention Peg who doesn't appear at all , whose voices are rather annoying. Even Lady and Tramp don't appear often enough and as far as Scamp is concerned ?! He is so spoiled! And he treats his father Tramp with absolute disrespect, then he runs away without remorse even after hearing how much he missed at home! And they called his flight a shameless adventure! I would say that Scott Wolf really brought out the violent bad guy in Scamp, wiping out the typical typical Disney animal. Even the old characters make you crazy in this; Trusty sounds like Pippo sick in the bed, Jock (Jeff-stupid-Bennett) - and his VOICE - don't sound neither Scottish nor worth listening to! Zappa as far away as possible to free our poor ears from his voice and with regard to the dumb, JUNKYARD EXHAUSTED dogs, full of feather hairs !!!!!! Someone put them down !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> "Lady and the Tramp 2" is not completely bad if you don't already have a difficult day, but I expect a lot more charm from a sequel to a true classic - Scamp is chavvy, so is his girlfriend Angel and there is a weak plot. Anyway, I think you should try it at least once because, like I said, there are much worse films out there.
