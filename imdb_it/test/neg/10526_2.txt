I thought this movie had an interesting name and could only try to think, but I was wrong. This film was boring, especially at the beginning and in the central parts. I can't comment on the ending because I couldn't stand to watch the whole movie. The premise of signing a student researcher just because it comes into your lab doesn't make sense. This student had an interesting type of moving robot in his apartment and unfortunately this non-living thing is more interesting than the characters in this movie. So, if you have problems with sleep, I suggest you rent this movie.
