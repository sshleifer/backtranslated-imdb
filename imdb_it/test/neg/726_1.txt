I decided to watch this show and try it, but I found it boring and, above all, boring ..... boring. <br /> <br /> There is too much sarcasm and the characters are all boring, there is too much talk and the character Lorelai ... continues to talk again and again and again ... During a second look I felt like suffocating the characters, the joke does not work and the whole story of love and romance ruins what is already disgusting .... I cannot believe that this show has survived the pilot .... This seems to be a show that forces the line of 'Listen to your parents' .... No current drama exists .... <br /> <br /> It should have remained a pilot ..... and a pilot alone ...
