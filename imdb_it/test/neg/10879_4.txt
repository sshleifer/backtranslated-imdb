First of all, let me tell you this ... Ghost Story .... hello!?! <br /> <br /> If one of the other people who trashed this film from beginning to end realized this fact, his reviews would have been very different The fact that the characters continued to disappear every time the protagonist returned to look, it should have been a dead gift. This film was not published as a ghost story when you went to rent it in the video store, not even a suggestion, and this is the BIGGEST mistake that was made by the studio that commercialized it. It was decided on their part not to publicize it as a ghost story to confuse you as if the main character was confused as you try to make sense of it. The problem with this is that they have lost too many viewers; the ghosts appeared "too human and real" without the usual signs, images or special effects that Hollywood usually uses to let you know that you are now seeing a ghost ... and this is what they were trying to do. The main character does not know that he is seeing the ghosts and not even the viewer. Now you understand? As long as you understand that the main character is seeing the ghosts, then you will understand the film and you will not be so irritated by what is perceived as a major oversight in the continuity or defects of the plot. <br /> <br /> I admit, this said, it was still not a good movie, but not so bad for all the others. See, if you're going to watch this movie, everything you see is "not" always what you think it is. 4 out of 10 for acting, 3 for originality, 5 for plot and 5 for fright, even if there were guttural and ghostly moments. Still not a good movie, just misunderstood.
