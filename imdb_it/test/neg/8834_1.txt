This shows how awful the WB network is in the last years of its existence. As a homeschooler, I naturally deplore this spectacle for its ridiculous, fantastic terrain, obscure and obscene stereotypes about the fact that children are "bizarre hippies who are so smart that they are alienated from super-cool high school students". Excuse the television writers, the world seen from inside your ass (which apparently contains your heads when you wrote this show) is NOT the world that talented people see with their eyes while we live in a small thing called reality. As for those who really liked this show ... please, sweet dear Jesus, PLEASE, rethink the statement that you really liked this shit for a very long walk. The acting is even more empty, fake and made of wood than the stereotypes on which the entire show was built. Thanks to WB for doing the right thing and putting this horse out of its misery from beginning to end. This show would never, ever have had the privilege of being realized, no less than eight terrible episodes. I really hope these actors had the slightest idea and stopped playing roles in junk TV shows like this as soon as this show ended.
