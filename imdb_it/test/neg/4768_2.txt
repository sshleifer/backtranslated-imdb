I've seen a couple of movies on Wixel Pixel and Sub Rosa Extreme lately, and I found a lot of pleasure in them. <br /> <br /> This SRE movie seemed much lighter than any other I've seen. Perhaps because this is a horror / comedy movie rather than a direct horror movie, and maybe it's also because humor didn't register very well with me. <br /> <br /> It's a little less than seventy minutes, and the credits start at the beginning of the last ten minutes. There are some outtakes, goofs and things behind the scenes that happen while those credits run. <br /> <br /> SRE films tend to be short and tend to feel stuffed despite that. This is no exception, with some scenes that tend to go too long. <br /> <br /> The story involves a poor child in Christmastown, California, who had been chosen by all his classmates. He had stolen a shoe and, being unable to replace it, was nicknamed "Oneshoe McGroo". Due to the pirates' obsession, his parents gave him a bandage at Christmas with an ornate Christmas tree on the bandage. <br /> <br /> Many classmates are killed, and the few who remain gather to decide what to do. They are chosen one by one by McGroo, who wanders around the sound of the sleigh bells. <br /> <br /> The characters are practically all stereotypes, like the nerd named Dorkus, etc. There is a strange scene in which a vicious couple has sex; the woman is handcuffed and blindfolded, the man is wearing a large slice of paper watermelon over his head. This reminded me of some foreign sex scenes from director Rinse Dream. <br /> <br /> Image quality is good and there are many extras. But basically a rather stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Oh well, I guess you can never have too many Christmas horror movies. However, there are many other needy festivals.
