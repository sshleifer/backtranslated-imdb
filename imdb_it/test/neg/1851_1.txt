If you are thinking of going to see this movie then my advice is - not. <br /> <br /> For me the film failed to vote at every level and was a reminder of how much the majority of English (and Irish) films are. The forgettable tripe is the best I can say. If it had been on telly, I would have turned away to do something more interesting five minutes after leaving. I saw this film with a group of friends and after reading the previews of the press went ahead and prepared to be non-critical and I hope to spend a fun 90 minutes. But, oh dear ..... <br /> <br /> As a comedy it wasn't funny, like a thriller the stupid story was neglected and lazy. Like an absolutely incredible love story. Especially like a piece of "gloriously over the whim" lacked both style and charm. Gambon and Caine did what they had to do to earn their money by playing ..... Gambon and Caine. Is it just me, but besides playing east gangster and jack the boy, does Michael Caine leave you cold? <br /> <br /> In all honesty, some of my friends thought it was "ok", but if you go, my advice is to have a few drinks (or puffs) first and leave your critical faculties locked up. home security. <br /> <br />
