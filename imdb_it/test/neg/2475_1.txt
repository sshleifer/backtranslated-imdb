What's wrong with American movies these days? Hollyweird continues to make films with men who act like women and women who act like men. The idiot director and screenwriter of this film must have his head examined. The main problems of this film are its obviously exaggerated feminist representations of the sexes. <br /> <br /> In the bar scenes, Eva Mendez and her friend are sipping beer bottles as one could find sailors on an oil tanker who does it in a bar in Iceland. Mendez continuously kisses every girl he sees later. He also dresses provocatively in every scene, yet he curses like a boy. She becomes very emotional when she fights with Will Smith for a while, while trying to "defend" all women from villains around the world. <br /> <br /> Men are no better in this film. What we see is a bunch of idiots trying to do everything possible to win an appointment. The males of this film are worried about getting both sexual favors and unable to speak clearly in front of a woman. Men in real life do not behave this way. <br /> <br /> What we see in this film is a product of culture that has gone wrong. Everything is upside down. Boys act like girls, girls behave like boys. All this is done while maintaining the extreme predilections of the sexes a part of history. Men are shown to be soft and stupid, but they are only interested in sex most of the time, while women are shown as sexist and bossy but only as a covering for their emotional insecurities. <br /> <br /> This movie would be great if it wasn't presented to the public. The content is not the culprit. It is the way the content is presented.
