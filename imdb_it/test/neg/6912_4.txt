When I saw this movie it was an afternoon after I got home from work. I love horror movies and I've seen some really eccentric ones, but this takes the cake. The plot presented to the viewer at the beginning of the film seems a bit intriguing, but as the film progresses, the script makes a wrong turn with horrible clich√©s and poor presentation, which in turn makes the film completely boring and boring. I do not intend to continue to criticize the script and the plot, because believe me it is not the worst part. I must say that overall the acting was not terrible for the novice actors, and I was impressed by Taylor Locke, this being one of his first films. The worst part of the film was the special effects. They were full of limited budgets and really ruined spectator entertainment, even though he was remotely interested in the plot. I suggest you watch this movie to understand the power of a bad script and plot. Only then can you really appreciate good writers and directors.
