This was not a good movie !! Why do people keep saying it? There's a nice story going on and then some sexy girls and then BAM vampires !!! Why? Why are there vampires? Where they come from? Besides, what the hell? There are all these "super human" vampires, but George Clooney and three other casual boys dominate ALL. Even fast. It's not like there has been a long fight scene with much effort. There were only three guys in the bar who killed these vampires like a fat man kills twinkies! The next thing you know, Clooney and the stupid girl are saved by Cheech and leave the homeless without family in the middle of Mexico. End of the story. Literally. Oh, the strip club was an Aztec temple, which is fun because it would be southern Mexico and not the border. Why do people lie and tell people that this is a good movie? Don't rent, buy or even watch this movie at a friend's house. I hope you have that time in your life back.
