Every time I watch Larry King Live, he launches more softball questions for his guests. He rarely receives useful information because he does not ask difficult questions. This comes from his start on the radio. <br /> <br /> King established himself on the radio and basically did not change a piece of the television format except for his visible speaking head. Become like a puppy for his guests and the only time he gets really useful information from them is whether they offer it voluntarily or a caller to the show actually poses a difficult question. <br /> <br /> Larry is a nice, paternal type of interviewer. This means that you shouldn't have a prime time show on a big news network considering CNN one. Not because of the history of CNN. <br /> <br /> Copy (eg via cable) New network was started by Ted Turner as an alternative to network news as it could broadcast news 24/7. When it started, the only TV contest was NBC, ABC and CBS. For this reason, CNN has copied the format of their competition and obtained respectable evaluations. <br /> <br /> This worked well for CNN until they got competing networks that were innovative and provided better / fresher news coverage. In response to the warming of competition, CNN denied and sorted its competitors who were eating their lunch and assessments because CNN wanted to resist the change. This did not work very long and their assessments started to collapse. <br /> <br /> Now the Copying News Network is trying to reform itself by reinventing itself by copying the main format of the news network. Unfortunately, this show is a big part of the problem. He is 21 years old and shows his age very badly. <br /> <br /> Sorry, King must be moved from Prime Time or discarded altogether.
