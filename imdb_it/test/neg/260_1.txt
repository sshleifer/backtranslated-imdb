K Murli Mohan Rao made the best BANDHAN in 1998 This film is a terrible remake of THE WEDDING SINGER <br /> <br /> Basically in short, the film is composed of: Salman Khan who in those days had the role of a disconsolate lover who loses his girlfriend and he also had his comic scenes in which he hammered badly even today is good he does everything here too and also loses his shirt in the scenes <br /> <br /> Jackie Shroff- wasted , bored and tired, his role is so stupid. Is shown as a lover of Pooja Bhatra so in 1 scene he is shown as a womanizer? <br /> <br /> Inder Kumar - once again confused characterization <br /> <br /> Rani Mukherjee - boring, overweight and does nothing special Pooja Bhatra - tall, fair and worthy actress but without talent < br /> <br /> Kashmira Shah- says a dial as if it were a poem <br /> <br /> Mohinish Behl - poor thing, even the 2 children were horrible <br /> <br /> The story is the same and has terrible comic scenes, a sudden romance and drunken drunken scenes plus a Shakti Kapoo comic strip r <br /> <br /> Direction is poor Music is decent <br /> <br /> Salman khan makes only the movements, Jackie is bad, Rani is as usual, Pooja is bad, Mohinish and Kashmira are nothing exceptional Inder is terrible
