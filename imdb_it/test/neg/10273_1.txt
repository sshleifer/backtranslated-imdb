I am relieved that subsequent reviews have become harsh - reading all the positive feedback, I was starting to worry that my understanding of movies (and life) was completely different from anyone else's in the world. Everything in this film sounded fake to me ... the characters, the dialogue, the manipulative soundtrack, the trite narrative, everything. As each scene unfolded, I kept thinking, "People don't behave like that." It is relentlessly heavy and mushy. In a way, I think the movie pushes you to like it, or pretend to like it, because it's serious and concerns real people and faces problems. But buddy, it really didn't work for me.
