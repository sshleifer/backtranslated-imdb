Terrible terrible film for television. Once again life brings us the predictable triangle; intriguing bitch woman to get the stupid and unaware wife of another stupid husband who has no idea. <br /> <br /> I get anxious when I see these films. You might ask, why do I watch them then? I have no idea. Usually by mistake. And the movie is so bad I can't get rid of it. I wait for the whore to turn her back. And I'm usually not satisfied with the way the sweets get her. <br /> <br /> Now, if you can believe our fox, steal the embryos from the clinic, and how do you do it? Without blood tests, DNA, requests for information and recommendations. Does he proceed to kill the real estate agent, Gabrielle Rose, who is near her, in broad daylight in the courtyard of a house for sale and nobody sees her? He kills his mother, Susan Hogan, and you could predict that assumption when the mother barely mentions that she's allergic to peanuts and that the pills to combat this allergy are in her pocket book. Guess what? I will not continue on this. <br /> <br /> Finally you stayed at home alone with your wife and bitch. Evil triumphs well, but too slowly. Victoria Pratt as an evil girlfriend is adequate in the role, she seems a bit too shaggy and obvious. Tori Spelling only stands most of the time. He has those big Bette Davis eyes that seem to come out of his head. I loved TRICK. And Tahmoh Penikett makes sure that her husband goes around to guarantee to his wife that there is nothing too him and his ex-girlfriend, even though he has been seen throughout the city being very friendly with her, standing half naked with her in his house when he sent his wife to the city to stay overnight. Yet he continues to deny the love story. <br /> <br /> Life never disappoints viewers with their crazy stories and stories about women and their stupid husbands. I wish I could give this chestnut a "0" rating.
