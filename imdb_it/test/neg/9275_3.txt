I rented the film version of "Troilus and Cressida" from my library last Thursday, and simply couldn't believe my eyes. Where should I start? no effort has been made to make the game seem as remote as it was for the Trojan War, all the actors wore Elizabethan clothing. Also, most of the actors were too old and horribly wrong - Aeneas (with his white beard) looked older than Nestor, Troilus was at least 30 years old, Hector looked like a Spanish pirate, Ajax was badly played anyway and Thersite was a transvestite. br /> <br /> Likewise the action is scarce, the duel between Ajax and Hector is short and amateur, the camera angle is more focused on Nestor's face, so we can only see what happens in the background that it is frustrating in itself. Nor is the "battle" ultimately given due respect. We do not see Troilo and Diomede fighting, nor anyone else, apparently, Paris and Menelaus seem to be fighting mud in front of Tersite. Even the death of Patroclus has been omitted. All this was a great disappointment considering that I reached a boring and boring drama series in the BBC costume to get to that point. <br /> <br /> However, it wasn't bad at all. I thought Incredible Orlando like Thersites and John Shrapnel like Hector were well played, even if they didn't seem fair enough. I would say the same as Kenneth Haigh as Achilles, since he didn't look surprising and sometimes he was a little dry. SPOILER: The climax at the end - the death of Hector - was perhaps the best part of the film, Achilles' dialogue here is excellent and sums up the attitude of a cold and expert murderer. However, the cruelty of the scene (when Achilles stamps on what Hector's head was) distinguishes him anyway. Charles Gray as Pandarus was as delightful as a sleazy old pervert and I thought the actress who played Cressida did a Good job The Troilus warrior, however, was annoying and I think the game would have been better if he had been killed by Achilles instead of a pacifist like Hector. <br /> <br /> Conclusion? OK, but it could have been better if he had a younger cast and costumes that at least tried to look like Ancient Grecian, not to mention the lack of action. 5/10
