Avida is a play on words that mixes life and enthusiasm, but I personally think that this film has been exaggerated by its ambition and does not do justice to its title. Collects a series of clumsy characters joined by incredible connections. Furthermore, the way everything is connected to the end is, in my opinion, a bit pathetic. What remains of it was a set of images ... interesting, but not enough to make this a good movie. <br /> <br /> I think this movie should be a comedy, but I certainly didn't notice! The absurdity and the caricature nature of the film are actually the only positive thing, but when it is dragged and continues to be no longer bearable. I must say that I fought hard to keep seeing it until the end, and I'm still not sure it was worth it ...
