Flashdance is one of those horrible and stupid movies that you really like, just because I'm so disgusting. I just saw it on TV and my friend and I were amazed at how amazing it was. It is true that Don Simpson and the other producers had the idea of ​​a cheap enough lowbrow movie with a lot of sweaty bodies to help sell a pop soundtrack (admittedly catchy), so Flashdance is a kind of pioneer: the first MTV film. Adrian Lyne has started advertising and shows why Flashdance is almost a commercial for himself. You have already decided to watch it but the film has this weird underground, full of panic, as if you were afraid that you could change your mind at any time. Continue to sell to you again and again, all the way, using elegant commercial-style editing and shiny close-ups of jiggling breasts. The story is as thin as a waffle (honestly I can't think of another film I've seen with less plot) and it never makes much sense, but it's a very elaborate and calculating film, so it's consistent. People say it's dated, but Flashdance has always been rubbish. Viewers in the early 1980s knew that it was a poor type T & A, but it works silly. There is a maudlin romanticism for the chick-flick crowd and piles of large, twisted female bodies for their dates, all in a disco-like rhythm. How could it fail? Help dialogue is useless, so you can take a popcorn without losing anything important and, if this kind of thing is not your cup of tea, you can always laugh at the "interpretive dance" on display. The scene in which a double for Jennifer Beals convulsive / "dances" on stage in front of a TV with a fan and a face full of white clown make-up tore us to pieces. An authentic guilty pleasure.
