In the dark days of 1990, the desirable Throne of Spielberg (after the failure of the alleged science fiction boy Phil Joanou) was mistakenly believed to be the pretentious Spielberg aspirant David Mickey Evans. Evans managed to show his studies for over a million dollars, sucking baby boomers into believing that his script - a combination of nostalgic references from the 1960s and a disturbing drama about child abuse - somehow equivalent to a good narrative and a decent film. <br /> <br /> As Rod Stewart once sang, "look how far you can go wrong." <br /> <br /> But the script inspired by the novice's novel, "ET", convinced enough people to be the next Chosen One - the New Spielberg - and therefore an agreement was reached to not only buy the script for more money than 99% of the world population will ever see in their lives, but also for Evans to direct the film - even though he had never directed anything in his life. <br /> <br /> Hey, how hard can it be to be another movie genius, after all? <br /> <br /> Two weeks after filming, he discovered Columbia. His newspapers were called "totally unusable" by the studio - or at least those with a level sufficient to not have fallen under the E.N.C. (New Emperor's dress). All his footage was discarded and recycled into guitar photos. <br /> <br /> What is a study to do after having sunk 10 or 20 million dollars into something that they still believed represented the Resurrection of Steven Spielberg? Does Spielberg rent the same to save the day? Columbia probably tried. <br /> <br /> Join the old pro Richard Donner. Hey, he might not be a film genius, but he did the job. "Superman" wasn't so bad after all - and the first "lethal weapon" was pretty good. <br /> <br /> So Donner intervenes and takes the reins of the direction. Fortunately he manages to convince Columbia that the film's worst tasteless fantasy sequences - which would take place like an acid journey of a decade - must go. Unfortunately, he leaves Crying Buffalo (ooh, as poetic) and Spielberg's ridiculous final pseudonym, complete with Clueless Mom, perfectly happy for the rest of his life to get his missing son's postcards as he goes around the globe in his red chariot . Quite right. <br /> <br /> But Donner managed to get a decent performance from Elijah Wood. And even Lorraine Bracco as Idiot Mom was not bad. Maybe Donner should be re-evaluated. Maybe it's not a fake Hollywood hacker like everyone has always believed. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm giving this over-baked misfire a score of 2 is that someone was smart enough to cast the great John Heard (but in the wrong part, of course). The children are fine ... although Tom Hanks' horrible, overly explanatory narrative almost destroys every scene in which he intrudes. <br /> <br /> One might think that after David Mickey Evanses and Phil Joanous and Troy Duffys of the world, the studios could finally be tested. One might hope that these disasters caused by the mounting can prevent the Emperor's new clothes syndrome from ever reviving its ugly head. <br /> <br /> Doubts!
