This show drives me crazy. It goes against everything a family should be, even if it is meant to be a comedy. The show should follow Dave and Vicky Gold (Michael Rapaport and Anita Barone) while raising their three teenage children: Hilary, Larry and Mike. A good premise for a comedy yes, but it does not mean that it will be a good show. <br /> <br /> I don't think I've ever heard cruel words from parents to children and vice versa. The only discourse that seems to be in the show is the control of children by parents and sex. I know that sexual relations are usually a topic that adolescents often talk about, but they are reported in almost all episodes without any sense. The episode I was looking at was about parents giving their daughter, Hilary, a car, not once do you think they are connected in any way by the way they talk to each other and how parents talk about how Hilary is like " their slave ". "<br /> <br /> The show fails more comically. I didn't laugh at this show once in the many times I tried to see it, and I'm a person who gave a very high score to films like Animal House and Dumb and Dumber Michael Rapaport is a very good actor and because he chose to ruin his career by making this piece of dirt a movie out of me. <br /> <br /> Parents, make sure your kids don't never and I mean never look at this Guys, you will probably get a laugh just because of the flashy sexual references but nothing comes out and then you feel rather drained. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2/5 stars.
