it's just me or all the "horror" movies become nothing but titties, crap and a bad superior who can't be killed. this film made no sense whatever happened to the days when a person managed to escape from the killer like in a hostel. and at least make the killer a little more realistic. Victor Crowley was the worst killer I've ever seen. reminded me of a generation of demons between quasimodo and skin. it was over the top that while the winner lay there in flames, no one thought to finish the job. and the end was the greatest disappointment of all the reminiscences of the soprano finale. I had to agree with the guy behind me when he snapped ... WHAT? if I could give the film a negative score I would have taken care of it.
