First, I want to point a large, direct middle finger at the Troma DVD distribution team, which was actually stupid enough to reveal the identity of the killer of this movie on the back cover! The synopsis randomly mentions who is responsible for the massacre on graduation day, for God's sake! I don't care how terrible or predictable the slasher of the 1980s can be; just to mention who ruined the whole point! So, a word of advice in case you also buy the dual functionality of Troma containing "Graduation Day" and "Barbarian nympho in the Inferno of the dinosaurs", don't do it ?? repeat NOT ?? turn the box and read the back! Watching the movie is already a painful experience, but reading the shoulders could really ruin everything. <br /> <br /> Now, what about the actual movie? Oh boy! Personally, I'm a fan of Herb Freed's "film work". Well, actually, I really don't know if I should admire or pity him! All of Herb's films are rather naughty and amateur, but at the same time you can say that his direction is lively and full of good intentions! Unlike "Haunts" and "Beyond Evil", he followed a contemporary popular genre trend and tried to cash in on typical high school slasher films. To offer a minimum of originality, all the victims of "Graduation Day" are promising athletes and members of the same track of coach George Michaels (fantastic name! I suppose Herb Freed is a fan of "Wham!"). During the opening credits, we see how a young girl dies dramatically on the field, a few moments after winning a 30-second run. The debate about the possibility that his coach and the other members of the athletic team are not pushing his physical limits too much is raised, but a particular individual takes one more step and sadistically kills everyone he considers responsible for death of Laura. What a crazy movie! The script must be one of the most inconsistent I've ever seen, with a lot of fake strings and sub-frames that are absolutely nowhere and death sequences that are almost too trivial for words! There is a guy impaled by a balloon attached to a javelin, others are beheaded with an absurdly large sword and the most unfortunate bastard of all even falls to his death on a bed disguised with thorns! Herb focuses on ingenuity and the fast pace of killing, so much so that he totally forgets the secondary storylines he introduced earlier in the movie! For example, Laura's sister returns home from her military training and appears to be investigating the circumstances of her death. In the middle of the film, however, his character barely appears in the film. Furthermore, the stepfather of the girls is called a violent drunk, but this interesting data is immediately ignored. Instead of carefully mounted suspense and false misleading tracks, we will need disco dance and roller skating sequences and ?? obviously ?? numerous images of attractive little chicks from the 80s who strip off. Despite being really bad, "Graduation Day" could count on a very respectable cast! Christopher George ("Grizzly", "The city of the living dead") is very present as a demanding coach, Carmen Argenziano ("When a Stranger Calls", "The Accused") appears briefly as a police detective investigating the number growing number of missing teenagers and Michael Pataki ("Dead & Buried", "Dracula's Dog") has a very funny part as the main stressed out of the school. Teen beauties on duty include Linnea Quigley and Vanna White. Heck, for some fans of horror, the presence of these two ladies is already a sufficient reason to count the "Graduation Day" among the most characteristic snipes of the early 80s. It's a stupid movie, but entertainment and laughter are guaranteed!
