If you are looking for the thunderbolt of summer, Dark Harvest 2 could be your ticket. The production values ​​of this film are extremely high (it seems as if they were filmed with a Sony Handicam and modified using iMovie), in particular the sound effects: they play directly from a CD "Spooky Halloween Sounds"! The scarecrow on the cover, even if it doesn't appear in the film and has no relevance, is terrifyingly realistic! From beginning to end, you will see a man aiming for his daughters through a play on words, MAISTA! At the climatic end of the film you'll see, well ... you'll have to watch yourself. <br /> <br /> What I'm trying to say is that they don't arrive within 1000 yards of this movie. I rented it because I thought it would be some kind of fun "Troll 2", but it's not. I cried after seeing this movie, because I realized that I had spent money (and I found the $ 4 I spent on the rental). Actually I fell asleep for 20 minutes and I still knew what was happening.
