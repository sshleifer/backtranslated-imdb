GOLD RAIDERS (1951) <br /> <br /> A boring western / comedy with the Three Stooges (including Shemp Howard at this point, which I have always appreciated as the "third Stooge") doing the usual schtick, and directed by the usual trustworthy Edward Bernds, who also made some of their most fun and classic short films - so one must ask, what happened this time? The most likely answer is that what worked well as a 15-minute two-reeler appears too much for a 55-minute movie. Unlike many of their classic short subjects, GOLD RAIDERS is not worth revisiting. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
