Here's what's good about "The Slaughter Rule:" <br /> <br /> - Ryan Gosling, Clea Duvall and David Morse give great results. Gosling is, as always, damn exceptional. The premises are often breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Here's what's wrong with "The Slaughter Rule:" <br /> <br /> - Everything else. The script is horribly confusing. And while I can certainly appreciate a film that is not "good", this film is simply boring. Great shows can't wear make-up for a movie with a stupid premise and a script full of throw-away lines that often don't even make sense. Just passing the first hour has become a thankless job. <br /> <br /> I got confused with Gosling, but in the end I did myself a favor and changed the channel. The spoilers here transmitted the ending to me. I didn't miss much. Do yourself a favor - if you want a good Gosling movie, take a look at "The Believer". <br /> <br /> My score: 2 out of 10.
