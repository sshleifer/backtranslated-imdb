Oh boy, it was really bad. <br /> <br /> I saw this on videotape. <br /> <br /> In the scenes that had the soundtrack, it was difficult to hear the dialogue. When people were on the phone, it was difficult to hear the person on the other side. It turned out that at least two different types of films or videos were used, because colors and focus sometimes shifted drastically between changes. And there were many out of focus shots that didn't seem intentional. <br /> <br /> An indicator of the budget (one of many) was when a news bulletin arrived on TV. There is only one "flash news" title card that is badly superimposed with a video effect on a TV screen and a voiceover by a journalist. Weren't they able to film a journalist and then show it on TV? <br /> <br /> The film begins with a killer wearing a lab coat and a surgical mask, brandishing a scalpel. Presumably he is a schizophrenic paranoid who flees the hospital to avoid having a lobotomy performed. <br /> <br /> Students are left at school for a break, and three young women decide to have a sleepover. Three guys decide to crash the party, and a geek named Science decides to crash it. The pajama party is rather boring, and the boys continue to show up by casually wearing masks, taking off their masks and disappearing. The mother and father (the surgeon who had to do the lobotomy) of one of the girls also continue to appear. The killer tears people's throats to pieces without anyone noticing. The apparent advantage of the film more or less sleepwalking through the film. Maybe it was bad acting, or maybe it was intentional, since much of the film is a nightmare, and partly a nightmare in a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Even the ending is really horrible. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is the flashy United Home Video VHS box art, which was revived for the DVD release (a dual function with Terror at Tenkiller). I honestly cannot say if it is a photo, a painting or a combination of both. The women depicted on the cover are not in the film, and the clothes they wear are much more revealing than anything women wore in the film. The throat that is affected on the cover is scarier than that of the film - in which people tend to influence a funny look with squinting eyes. After all, this is what the killer has most of the time: head tilted, and eyes slamming out, attacking the camera. Often the scalpel was held close to the camera in focus, while the killer mask's face was in the foreground but blurred in the background.
