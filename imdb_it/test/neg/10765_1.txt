This is by far the most repugnant and atrocious version of The Scarlet Pimpernel that was ever conceived. As a Pimpernel fan, I was genuinely offended by what they did to the characters - but this atrocity is not worth looking at, even if you're not familiar with the story. <br /> <br /> Percy Blakeney, for example, would never stab people in the back just to get off a corridor. Chauvelin would never have had a series of women in his bed. Marguerite has never had a relationship with Chauvelin, nor Armand with Minette, whoever he is. Chauvelin wouldn't have shot Tony in the head at random. The name of Chauvelin is not, and never was, Paul. They completely eradicated any reference to Pimpernel's disguises, replacing them instead with James Bond gadgets and gadgets. <br /> <br /> As for the movie itself ... The trick is terrifying. Women look like clowns. Elizabeth McGovern's beauty mark wanders randomly over her face. Poor and pitiful actors don't have a script to work with, so it's not their fault that their characters are as thin as wet tissue paper. Dialogue ... oh, dialogue. The dialogue is unbearable. And anyone responsible for all those little captions at the bottom of the screen should be forced to watch this movie as a penance. (I counted 13 captions in the first half hour before giving up, as if we could not understand that the water basin between England and France is the English Channel.) <br /> <br /> The movie - If I can call it that, since it's really just a video recording with a filter - it's absolutely no ransom value. Don't waste your time and brain cells on this rancid turntable, instead, go see the 1982 version of Anthony Andrews / Jane Seymour, or the 1934 Leslie Howard movie, or ANYTHING but this one.
