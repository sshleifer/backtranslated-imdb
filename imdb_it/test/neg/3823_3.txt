Some of the reviewers of this film have been extremely "generous" with praise. Personally, I was disappointed, because due to those reviews I was optimistic when the opening credits started running. <br /> <br /> The all too familiar plot is as follows: Deformed boy and his father live in Louisiana swamp. Local kids ridicule and torment him. The local kids start with Gruesome, oh sorry, I mean Victor Crowley's barracks on fire with him inside. Dad tries to save his son, formerly known as Eddie Munster, meets the elephant man, but accidentally puts a hatchet on the baby's head. Victor becomes a killer ghost who chases the unfortunates who enter his domain. Oooo ... scary. <br /> <br /> One thing I liked about Hatchet is that he never took himself seriously and some of the gags even made me laugh. The fact is that I got tired of the beautiful Hollywood b-horror sticks. I like to laugh and enjoy a good scare, but this film did not provide a good dose of both. Since Crowley is the next Michael, Jason or Freddy ... Pumpkinhead has a better chance.
