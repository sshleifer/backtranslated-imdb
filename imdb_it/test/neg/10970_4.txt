Even if he only made his debut film in Australia and left for Britain and then America to continue his career, Australians will tell you that the biggest movie star they have ever produced was Errol Flynn . I'm not sure he's ever returned to Australia after his resounding success in Captain Blood. However I attribute this film to the well-known Australian irreverence for having ruined the reputation of one of them. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem in telling the life of Errol Flynn is that he told quite high stories in his life to the end in his memoir, My Wicked Waysed Ways. I saw that much of the film was based on this and on reading between the lines of that book. <br /> <br /> His mother's infidelity to his father was not written, but could have been deduced by reading My Evil Ways. He didn't particularly like the woman, which is clear from a few sources. <br /> <br /> I wish the film was more concerned with his adventures in New Guinea, which for me was the most interesting part of My Wicked Ways. As for his street fights in the Depression, I tend not to believe it. Even if he had succeeded, I guarantee that enough of that would ruin his appearance and he would never have a career as a protagonist. <br /> <br /> Still the people at the bottom seem to think that the atmosphere of Sydney during the Depression was well captured and Guy Pearce is a charismatic Errol Flynn. The American public knows him as the lieutenant, but honest Lieutenant Exley of LA Confidential, released in the same year as Flynn. <br /> <br /> But LA Confidential was a far better film.
