I didn't think this movie was very good. Basically they took a few jokes from the past from various Shirley Temple films, threw them together and made Orr act as Shirley Temple on the screen. "OMG!" It has been said quite a number of times. If you are familiar with Shirley Temple movies, you will recognize several direct lines from his films. The trouble is that they have Orr who tells them in Shirley's everyday life. In the end, what we get is a mixture of Shirley Temple films recreated, instead of any kind of real look in the life of Shirley Temple. Save fatigue and rent Shirley Temple movies, it's much better than watching Orr try and recreate Shirley's acting style.
