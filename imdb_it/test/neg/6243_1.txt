I hate it when people in the cinema talk to the screen. It's one of the main reasons why I stick to DVDs or videos. I saw The Clearing on DVD but if I had seen it in the movies I should have stood up and SCREAM "YOU'RE NOT DIED, YOU MORO!" <br /> <br /> The Clearing is another in a long list of horrible films featuring Mr. Redford. Legal eagles, Havana, indecent proposal, up close and personal, sneakers, last castle and spy game. If Robert Redford had told me to invest in something, I would go the other way. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing you can do to an audience is this. Say you've been kidnapped and your kidnapper has a gun. It keeps you on you for most of the movie. Turn the tables on him and start strangling him. Whatever you do, keep strangling him until he's DEAD! Don't just strangle him for ten seconds. Stay with it! Ten minutes at least. But Bob stops too early, walks away and forgets Mr. Kidnapper until ....... He gets up, finds the gun and holds it on our hero. At this point I wanted Mr. Kidnapper to shoot Robert Redford. More than a few times. And I wanted to shoot him too.
