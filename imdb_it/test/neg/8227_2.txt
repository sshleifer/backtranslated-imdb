Shot in my former home town by a couple of college kids, this movie focuses on a maniac called a "luther". Luther, recently released (he was revealed to us by a commission on freedom of speech in one of the most ridiculous scenes of all time), lets himself be surprised by Kroger's local grocery store eating an old woman's neck with his metal teeth. <br /> <br /> Luther runs to the farm where he eats a boy, steals a car, ties up an old woman, is chased and killed. Oh, and the girl on the SUPERBOY TV show strips off.
