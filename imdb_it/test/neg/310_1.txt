The film made no sense to me. The good actors (SergioCastellittoaparticular favorites, was very good in "Uomo DelleStelle" / "TheStarmaker" but it was made by Giuseppe Tornatore, a great Italian director in contrast to the mediocre one who made this effort), but a horrible and inconclusive script a terrible montage and a director who seemed to have no idea what he was trying to say and ended up saying exactly nothing. An inevitable load of rubbish, but the kind of film that certain very Italian intellectuals who had been my misfortune to have known in a dark and distant past would have loved, and unfortunately Italy does not have a monopoly on these, they can be found everywhere and probably this is a great masterpiece. I never thought much about Bellochio as a director. I remember seeing his first film "Pugni in Tasca" / "Fists in the Pocket" (or a similar title) in Rome when it was first shown near 50 years ago (I was living the time). All the usual pseudos were enthusiastic about it, but it left me a little cold. Then I didn't think he was a great director, and still not. Age has certainly not improved and this film must be considered one of the worst.
