This is a terrible film, and I'm not even sure why it's so terrible. It is ugly, for one, with that trendy style of the 70s that at the time seemed perhaps a good idea, but that now allows us to immediately recognize a film of that period as a product of the 70s. The film preserves the story and the songs that made the theatrical version of the musical a success, but the songs sound lifeless on the screen. But above all, the film sucks because of the weak performance of Lucille Ball, which you would think would be able to achieve something of this character bigger than life if someone could do it. She walks sleepwalking through the film like a terrified actress who suffocates her opening night, and the film sinks with her. Even Bea Arthur, who I bet was hilarious in the role of best friend on stage, cannot breathe life into this stinker. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br /> Vote: D
