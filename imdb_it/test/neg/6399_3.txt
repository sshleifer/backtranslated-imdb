I just finished watching this movie and for the most part I found a waste of time with little or no redemption factor. I don't really understand where all the positive reviews came from - the animation is awkward and unrefined, the plot makes absolutely no sense from an objective point of view, and there's no sense of intrigue or suspense in what it's looking for to pass himself as an intriguing and suspenseful film. I've never read the book, so I can't say if the film was faithful, but as with most film adaptations, it tries too hard to encompass all the information as quickly as possible. The result is a disconnected and illogical plot that does not really let you understand or relate to the characters, or, in reality, anything. On the whole, I felt completely detached from the characters and the plot to the point where I couldn't worry about what happened to them, and the only way I can see how this animation can be considered beautiful is if the Your normal animation standard is a Scooby-Doo cartoon.
