Normally, I love these "Stranger Within" thrillers. Some good examples are "Fatal Attraction", "Single White Female" and "Audition". Done right, they can be a lot of fun and are worth an hour or two of strong shocks and scares. Of course, the opposite may be true: badly done, they can be boring and stupid. "The Hand that Rocks the Cradle" is one of the latter. <br /> <br /> Bartels, Claire (Annabella Sciorra) and Michael (Matt McCoy) are welcoming another member of their family. But busy Claire is persuaded by Michael to take on a nanny. One day, a woman named Peyton Flanders appears (Rebecca DeMornay), and since she looks perfect, Bartels takes her. Of course, once it shows up, their idyllic life is slowly being destroyed ... <br /> <br /> This film suffers from a plethora of problems, but the greatest is the management of the villain. Peyton is never credible. Part of this has to do with how she wrote and how she behaved. The things that are supposed to prove us are so invented that they are ridiculous. De Mornay doesn't help much. She portrays Peyton as two different people. Although it is true that she should be the perfect nanny while hiding her psychotic tendencies, De Mornay's performance creates a division between the two facets of her character. <br /> <br /> The other actors are still good. Annabella Sciorrra is as terrifying as the asthmatic Claire. Sciorra is very natural in the role, but unfortunately, the script betrays her. Matt McCoy is almost invisible. However, Julianne Moore is as delightful as Claire's friend Marlene. Moore is a firecracker, but unfortunately it is only on the screen for a total of five minutes. <br /> <br /> Curtis Hanson is a good director, but you wouldn't know it by looking at this fool. The film has some decent shocks, but has a poor rhythm, and the climax, while generating a little tension, is actually ridiculous. That being said, he is working with a script that, at best, could be called pathetic. <br /> <br /> Trust me, when it comes to nannies, keep up with Fran Drescher. This should have gone to the direct-to-video basket.
