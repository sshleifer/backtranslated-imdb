I think I'd rather have my batteries rolled up with a pair of rusty shears than put up with another 5 minutes of this movie. In fact I can't even worry about going into details! Not sure how they managed to get the wooden hooks to heal the needles! It would be better for everyone if they had just killed the island after discovering the virus, that way it would have lasted until the commercial break, and we could have gone on with our lives. Also, another thing was this garbage commissioned by God's channel? Like all they seemed to do was to praise the bleeding gentleman most of the time. Avoid like the plague! In fact I would prefer!
