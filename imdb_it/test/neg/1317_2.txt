Oh, but this is painful. A good actor after another turns in a regrettable dialogue reluctantly under what must have been an incredibly pedestrian direction to consider it acceptable. I like Robert Carlyle and Joanne Whalley is one of my favorite actresses, Tom Courtney can do well when pushed and David Suchet is a professional of the highest integrity, but everyone turns like fish in a barrel of watery gin. I swear that Courtney was drunk with painkillers or both. <br /> <br /> Has there been a good performance in all? Yes, David Hood as a junior underground engineer whose partner was swept away seemed to take it seriously and believe him for that, it can't be easy when "all around are losing their" so to speak, or maybe his scenes are go under the direction of the deputy director (if there was one). I don't know what these people were doing in a movie that was so poor (besides paying the bills, of course) I can't begin to say how disappointed I am with them. YOU MUST BE KNOWN BY YOURSELF! <br /> <br /> Different positives from David Hood the third ... yes The largely submerged London aerial shots were very well done and the artists of the responsible effects deserved better than having their beautiful work punctuated by a such a superficial story, if you forgive the expression, because those few people who see them will do it on a screen much smaller than what would be to their best advantage. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? because British directors try to imitate such tabloid-level genres, characterized by uncertainty, spectators and spectators, and they do it even worse than the Americans. Gritty realism, integrity of character, the capture of true emotions in a way that makes you feel and cares ... The Way of the Family, Spring and Wine Port, Carter, The Long Good Friday, Trainspotting ... I don't understand I'm wrong I like a bit of escape hokum. The real "Italian work", The Adventures of Tom Jones; but oh, that should come to this, there was a more realistic drama in Carry On Camping.
