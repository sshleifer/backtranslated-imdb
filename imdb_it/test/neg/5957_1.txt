SPOILERS <br /> <br /> This film was rented as a joke, and it was a joke. The film is based on a dog hunter looking for El Chupacabra. The equipment for dog lovers is so ridiculous. He seems to have stitched the patch on his hat and for some reason shows his "muscles" rolling up his sleeves. Throughout the film, especially at night, you can see how bad the light is. I am in a car that is very bright and driving in pitch. You can often see the shadow of the camera on the ground. The costumes are terrible, the lighting is terrible and the acting is terrible. This is a good movie for a laugh ... maybe.
