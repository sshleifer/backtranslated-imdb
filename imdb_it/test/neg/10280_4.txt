I've always wanted to see ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE for a very long time. I have always been fascinated by the title, the star and the desert, but for some reason (now quite clear), this film is never shown on TV or I missed it if it is never shown. Well, after seeing the DVD, I now know why the film is rarely shown: it's because it's not so nice. In fact, I'd say it's pretty much a mess. <br /> <br /> ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE was created by a director and shows it for the first time. The film is primarily a series of cartoons with absolutely nothing that holds it together. More like a collection of short films put together at random. The film can be summarized in this: introduction (murder); policeman and girlfriend together; introductory credits; cops going to work; the madman tells the story; the police find the body; policeman and boss and girlfriend at the bar; chase the scene; etc. The scenes simply don't flow together. They are very distinctly independent of each other and for this reason the characterization is weak, borderline amateur. The bar scene with the girl, the farm scene with the hippies, the scene with Big John and the screaming boss were a bit worthy. I almost stopped the film during those (horrible) moments. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker's lack of experience is evident throughout the film. The style, like the 70s, is on the whole map. The credit introduction scene makes the film look like a commercial for the police. Then try to be a friendly film (Big John and Zipper) and then a mystery of murder; then a melodramatic love story; etc. A film must not have a particular style to be successful, but I fear that the style of ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE has been confused. You can clearly see that the director had no idea what he was doing or where he was going. <br /> <br /> The film is not a complete disaster. While the content of ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE is almost amateur, its appearance is extremely (and deceptively) professional. Cinematography is amazing. Each frame is worthy of an exhibition in an art gallery. Or because the first (and last) director was involved in the world of music, worthy of an album cover. The beautiful look of the film gives more credibility to the final product than it really deserves. And thanks to the acting of Robert Blake (of a really badly written character), the film maintains a certain level of realism, even if nothing else makes much sense. What is remarkable about the appearance and composition of the film is that it has been copied and duplicated a million times. The introductory titles reminded me of something like TOP GUN, which was done 13 years later. Scenes of Johnny dressing up, with his clothes on the bed, reminded me of American Gigolo. Strangely, ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE has a very contemporary look, due to its breathtaking graphics, even if the history and philosophy behind it are hopelessly outdated. <br /> <br /> So, ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE is, on the one hand, an undervalued and undervalued film because it obviously influenced many of the future directors out there when it comes to the look and composition. Few films can claim to have achieved this goal and legendary cinematographer Conrad Hall should take full credit. But, on the other hand, EGIB is also deservedly forgotten because the poor characters, the confused story and the confused direction, none of which is worth remembering.
