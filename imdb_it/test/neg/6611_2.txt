When there is only a few days before the film's premiere, his screenwriter withdraws from the project and asks that his name be removed from the end credits, you know that this does not bode well. <br /> <br /> Do the books on which "Wiedzmin" is based have great potential for a lively fantasy film? "Geralt de Rivia is a witcher, his only purpose is to destroy the monsters that afflict the world, but not everything that is monstrous is evil, and not everything is right?" But all that didn't matter, when a Polish troupe, with a low budget, no, or little appreciation for Sapkowski's work, decided to create a 13-part mini-series. The two-hour film is a by-product of their actions, to maximize profits. <br /> <br /> It is not difficult to emphasize in this case, what makes people label this film as bad. Plot (inconsistent, thanks to filling it with too many stories), acting (below average, except for Zebrowski), dialogues (tasteless), editing (moved), special effects (unbearable) and choreography (poor), added together to the overall bad film experience. Only the soundtrack, created by Grzegorz Ciechowski, highlights the beauty of the world of "Wiedzmin", which was never brought to the screen. Even the magnificent Polish flora and fauna (where the part of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" was filmed), a crucial element in almost all fantasy films, was not exploited to the fullest of their potential. The more I think about this loss, the more I'm running out of words. At least, it's comforting to know that Marek Brodzki, the director of "Wiedzmin", has only directed one film since then (also in Germany). <br /> <br /> For now, there remain high-level fantastic stories and a fantastic computer role-playing game (published in 2007) that refers to Wiedzmin's books. But I am sure that one day, I will do justice to the Wiedzmin saga, and we will be treated with a film adaptation just as good soon enough.
