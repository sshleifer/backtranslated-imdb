"You know, I've been to some cities where the girls weren't that good, in fact I've been to some cities where they're really bad, but it's the first time I've come to a city where there are no girls" I'm sure the fans of the great classic remember this phrase that belongs to Vin ... one of the seven magnificent seven (from the first film) ... <br /> <br /> Now I would like to rewrite it here. You know - I've seen some movies where the plot isn't that good. In fact I saw some movies where the plot is terrible, but it's the first time in my life that I've seen the movie where there's no plot. <br /> <br /> OK. Perhaps my statement above is a bit exaggerated, but honestly ... how can the plot be called a crap that is happening in this movie. The villain (oh, don't ask me to give you his name, because I don't remember and his is not even somehow close to Calvera, whose name and character is unforgettable ...) is trying to build the church in the name of his last children, who were killed in a battle, and this villain is kidnapping the poor villagers to force them to build the church ... <br /> <br /> first of all how big the church must be for to force hundreds of villagers to build it ... is it an Egyptian pyramid or something? but OK, let's stop here on the plot and the absolutely forgettable character of a bad boy and say a few words about The Seven itself ... <br /> <br /> The good old Yul Brynner's Chris, always calm, always silent, talking less but wise talk has gone (unfortunately). Oh no ... it's calm as it was ... but now, its calm is so fake that you don't buy it. (imagine, he meets a good old friend Chico, who has to save after so many years and there are only a few "hello, hello" and not even a handshake (as far as I remember)) ... honestly, it seems more like the encounter of two strangers in some internet chat, rather than the meeting of Chris and Chico. This makes the "new Chris" more like robocop or terminator than our beloved wise gun ... <br /> <br /> I won't stop here talking about other characters. There simply IS NO WHERE ... (imagine if a strong actor like Yul Brynner is so fake to forget, so what the other characters will be like) ... <br /> <br /> There are still some attempts to give we have a background story for each of them ... for example one is the type preferred by women, the second is a man with a dark past who was raped and killed by Indians and since then kills everyone and everything that moves ... but none of these characters makes sense or cannot take your heart. <br /> <br /> I remember I was a small child and when O'reilly (the character of Charles Bronson) died in the first movie I was crying. Here, I didn't care about every one of them ... even if all of them with the crew of the movie would die, it seems like I wouldn't care anymore ... <br /> <br /> So, please, go to SEE THIS FILM ... I recommend it, because you won't have the other chance to see something worse than that.
