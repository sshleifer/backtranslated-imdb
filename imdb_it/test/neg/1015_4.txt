Since Paul Kersey was short of real relatives to avenge, the third episode of the "Death Wish" saga revolves around his return to New York to visit an old war friend. He arrives only to discover that Brooklyn has completely changed into a pauperato gangster and that young hooligans have killed his friend and are constantly terrorizing all the other tenants of a dilapidated building. Kersey makes a deal with the local police commissioner, conquers the heart of his blonde lawyer, repels numerous criminals with an impressive Wildey Magnum pistol and gradually trains and inspires the petrified New Yorkers to defend themselves. Ok, there is no more reason to defend the "Death Wish" series after seeing the third part. The original of 1974 was a masterpiece that revolved as much on social drama as on pay and, even if it was pure exploitation, the second part still had some redeeming qualities and at least the events were logically related to those that occurred in the first. The number three often feels like a totally separate franchise. Apparently, Kersey is no longer an architect, he is ten times more sociable and sociable than before and suddenly no one, not even the police, is more against the actions of the vigilantes? All these changes and many other aspects make it more obvious that Michael Winner and Charles Bronson have reduced their "Death of Death" success to a series of brainless and exploitative actions, with a death toll that increases dramatically with each episode, armory that becomes more and more explosive and criminals that become more evil, leaner, meaner and much more difficult to kill. However, the lords do not seem to realize that the violent spitfire of violence actually creates an opposite effect, that is to say this extremely monotonous and much more boring than the previous two. I once read a brilliant review that referred to "Death Wish 3" as the pure definition of cinematographic masturbation. This description could not be more apt, since the script moves wearily from a repugnant sequence of execution to the next. In particular the last twenty minutes are a complete "orgy" of shots, explosions and executions carried out through improvised homemade measures. Yi-Haaa! This entry in the series has a rather interesting cast, including Martin Balsam ("Psycho", "12 Angry Men") as the fatigue neighbor who holds machine guns in his closet, Ed Lauter ("Familiar Plot", "The Longest Courtyard "") as the unorthodox copper and also Alex Winter (from "The excellent adventure of Bill and Ted!) in his debut role as one of the thugs.
