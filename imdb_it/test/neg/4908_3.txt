[Warning contains spoilers] <br /> <br /> I didn't like any of the characters, including the main one, who manages to defeat his friend v.quickly, (but that's okay as he takes care of him as an ex-prostitute from casino in which he works). The main character is interpreted as this wonderful intelligent writer who is dragged into a network of deceit while he is performing his monologue of the book he is writing. I can't say that I would buy the book, perhaps a better premise would have been if the off-screen voice (which annoyingly intervenes to tell any part of the film you might not have understood, through its book) would have 52 different personailties ... to represent every card in the deck, but I digress. In the end there was a turning point, so the main character was set by someone close to him, but at this point I didn't like his character very much (I found it impossible to please someone in this film, the characters are all one-dimensional zombies) that didn't matter to me, and I was glad the film was finished. <br /> <br /> More points: the British ER actress who gives a hint of South African accent Negative points: an irritating film
