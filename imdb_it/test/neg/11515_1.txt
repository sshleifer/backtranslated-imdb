I literally ran to look at him, expecting a film that would make me cry, or touch my heart. <br /> <br /> What I found was not heartbreaking, but a lame exploitation of a strong human character. <Br /> <br /> Intertwined between a couple of young lesbians and an obese man. <br /> <br /> In a setting that is basically soundless not to mention the most common acting. <br /> <br /> It wasn't entirely BAD, as I've seen worse - and I left the $ 10 cinema poorer but wiser - that a well publicized FILM is not the same as a WELL-MADE FILM.
