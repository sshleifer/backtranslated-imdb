The best thing about this movie for me was that Bryan Dick played Rafe and made me feel ... Rafe and all his beauty made the film worthy of note, even though I wanted to get up and scream. I've never seen a warmer man. <br /> <br /> -ahem- But that's not the point. <br /> <br /> The title? This is really what it is. They took the beautiful story written by Annette Curtis Klause and threw it out. In all my anal-retentive glory, I will point out what was missing, what has changed and everything else wrong with the film. <br /> <br /> Rest assured and here goes: <br /> <br /> - Apparently, RAFE is the son of ASTRID and GABRIEL and, apparently, ULF is no longer ASTRID's daughter, as in the book . And, as I remember from the book, RAFE and ASTRID were LOVERS. <br /> <br /> -ASTRID is apparently BLOND, in contrast to the RED HAT in particular described in the book. I think the book said it looked more like a FOX than a WOLF. And the film also shows that ASTRID is VIVIAN's aunt. <br /> <br /> -WHERE DID AXEL GO? <br /> <br /> -VIVIAN is 19 years old. In the book he was 16 years old. <br /> <br /> -VIVIAN and AIDEN meet in the HIGH SCHOOL that they both attend in the book. VIVIAN goes to see AIDEN because of his poem "Wolf Change". But, according to the film, Aiden beat his father, fled, and now lives in Romania, and draws Graphic Novels. This made me say "What the F ** K". <br /> <br /> - There is no "Kelly" in the film. WHERE THERE IS KELLY IN THE FILM. KELLY in the book, however, hated VIVIAN. And he also attended AIDEN after they broke up. Vivian even becomes shining in the book and basket her room. <br /> <br /> GABRIEL bears a striking resemblance to a Colombian Drug Queen in the film. And he sounds like one too. His acting was very good, but his appearance threw me out. <br /> <br /> VIVIAN had no parents in the film. His father and mother and two other brothers died in the film. Yet in the book, when he returns home one evening, his MOTHER, ESME is sitting on the couch, having fought with ASTRID on GABRIEL. And VIVIAN has no brothers. Only his father died in the book. <br /> <br /> -AIDEN accepts VIVAN for what it is. This has really earned me. He kills RAFE in the creepy church, confronts VIVIAN and rescues him from the other wolves, except that AIDEN shoots her, so they leave to look for medicine, and then try to leave the city together. WTF?! In the book, AIDEN frightens when she turns into a wolf, and cries like a girl, throws things at her, and so she panics, and jumps out of the window. Then he invented a story that he tried to break with her, and threw a chair out of the window. Does not seem to accept me. <br /> <br /> -AIDEN wants you to run away with him. In the book, he wants nothing to do with VIVAN after he turns to him. Nor does he hold his face lovingly and say he can control it. She cries like a woman because she is SCARED by her. <br /> <br /> And the final indignation ... the one that almost gave my three best friends and THE HEARTS ATTACKS TO OUR SEATS: <br /> <br /> - In the film, AIDEN and VIVIAN run away together, and VIVAN killed GABRIEL. As in she shoots it. GABRIEL dies. In the * BOOK * not only does VIVIAN not kill GABRIEL, I believe that UP TOGETHER. As in, she doesn't end with AIDEN, she ends up with GABRIEL. Small things have also been noticed: Ulf's red hair from Astrid has been turned into brown in the film, and Vivian works in a chocolate shop. <br /> <br /> A horrible shock; I'm ashamed. The book was not difficult to follow. If Disney can use an H! School at random, because the director did not find an H! Random school? <br /> <br /> * sigh * I really couldn't wait to see this movie, I loved the book, it's sad that it didn't follow a little. I give him a 2, just because (as the top of this review states) Rafe (played by Bryan Dick) was really sexy, and Agnes Bruckner did a great job. And, they kept Steppenwolf's poem <br /> <br /> With love, <br /> <br /> Caitlin
