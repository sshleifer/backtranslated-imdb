1 Bolo Yeung is in the ten-minute movie, including when he is serving iced drinks to his boss. 2 a lot of street hooligans who appear to be custodians of safes are immediately overwhelmed by the Asian superhero who talks like an illegal alien just out of a manure truck. 3 (thug) lets me-shirt go, gay model like muscle-heee-haaw! heeew-hee! hap hap! - He died on the floor with his neck, elbow, chin or broken balls - 4 low-cost semi-sex scenes in which the vast white comes out of nowhere digging the Asian superhero. 5 Norton (the former action movie of the action movie) does nothing but pretend to be a fashionable weapons smuggler who traffics white girls from sluts gathered in a nightclub where they willingly follow an idiot who poses as a millionaire who rails against them (collect what you sow) 6 yes, the local police captain is involved and yes, the first slaughtered policeman is the super-hero's former teammate (yaawn!). 7 action scenes are false, like A) hee-haw! The Chinese test a rotating kick B) the thin leg of the Chinese at the throat of the Negro thug C) ending the death move to the head too similar to Walker Texas ranger fake action 8 final titles finally <br /> <br /> total garbage. These people are good enough to be alone or double body in other C films and to be accredited AT more collectively as "stuntman provided by the county jail".
