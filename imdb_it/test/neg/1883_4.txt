I seem to be in the minority on this, but I found One True Thing to be schmaltzy, invented and generally unpleasant. Not that the acting was so bad, but the characters seemed little more than archetypes (the bad father, oh, but wait, maybe it's not hopelessly bad, maybe in the end there may be a solution ...). Of course, the woman I was with loved the movie, so maybe you'll like it. But I didn't.
