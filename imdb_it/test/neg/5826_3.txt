First of all I would like to point out that I loved Winnie The Pooh as a child and I really liked The Movie Tigger even though I'm about 20 years old. <br /> <br /> But this movie was so bad that I was ashamed I was a fan in my youth. <br /> <br /> OK, OK I know this is a children's movie and it's not for people like me, but that's my thoughts on the movie for other people my age. <br /> <br /> The main fall in this film is the heffalump itself, it must be the most annoying character I saw in a child's film (perhaps even more annoying than the child in Monsters Inc). He has the most annoying voice and chatter about singing stupid things and making even more stupid comments, I know that Pooh's films are not exactly high-level, but this was offensive even to the intelligence of a 2-year-old child! <br /> <br /> - where was the story? Pooh's previous releases have had at least one point for the story - yes, I can see that it's about accepting people who are different for you in your hearts - but it's actually over and I felt like I watched a cartoon from 5 minutes on children's TV. br /> <br /> I have no children of my own, but when I do I intend to show them quality films for children like The Tigger Movie, Toy Story and Finding Nemo (although they are too childish for me these days I can see how would be of great appeal to small children). Not so with this appalling film attempt. <br /> <br /> Oh and another thing: NOT ENOUGH Eeyore! He should have his movie!
