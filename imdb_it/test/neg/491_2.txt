The 60s rock (glam) is like the house music of the 90s or the current boybands: it's boring and has no ideas or ideals. The only thing that makes it a bit "cult" nowadays is that so much time has passed, so we can laugh at its nonsense. Too bad the "Rock Star" has no laughter at all, as it must be one of the most boring films of recent years. <br /> <br /> Chris (Mark Wahlberg) is the singer of a Steel Dragon tribute band. When he is kicked by the band at the same time as the real singer Steel Dragon is kicked, he becomes the next singer. You already know how it will end at that moment, with Chris losing him with sex, drugs and r & r and forgetting his longtime girlfriend / manager, Emily (Jennifer Aniston). <br /> <br /> There is way too much (boring) music in this formidable standard excuse for a movie and should be avoided at all costs. Watch the film (oversized, but still more fun) Almost Famous instead, or better yet, a film about real people who play real music with real emotions, What do you do. <br /> <br /> That stinker. 2/10.
