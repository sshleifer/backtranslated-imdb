I think it's very interesting this movie is called a thriller. It is anything but electrifying. <br /> <br /> Most of the time you hear piano sounds. Then hear the sounds of the piano. Then some people talk about facts that don't concern anyone. <br /> <br /> Then again piano sounds. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this film was the reason I recorded on IMDb, because I think this film is one of those that humanity must be aware of. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: By the way, the most action-like part occurs when a can of hot chocolate is poured. <br /> <br /> Very interesting: the "actors". Yes, the quotation marks are intentional, as you can think, because they do not act. They play the piano and play things small, but they don't act. <br /> <br /> I think that before this film I never left a cinema and I got angry. Really, this movie made me angry. Angry about the time and money I spent.
