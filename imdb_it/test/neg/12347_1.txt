A friend and I went to see this movie. We have opposing views on Fujimori but after seeing this film we agree on the following: the easiest way to get an inaccurate documentary is to do it on a foreign country where you were not present when events happened, no matter how talented or how much you invest in the film. If you are really trying to learn about the history of another country, look at something made by the natives of that country otherwise you won't be able to get away from your bubble. And those who try to force their opinions and opinions about something they don't belong to are really abusing their power. To make it even worse, the director chose not to talk about the embarrassing involvement of the CIA with the Fujimori regime. He decides to evade the only matter for the witch that his country has much to explain to the Peruvians. But this is not surprising because, both the director and the CIA are violating the sovereignty of Peru trying to influence democratic processes at very different levels, of course. <br /> <br /> If the director was really interested in helping Per Peru he would have financed a native to make the documentary. In any case, there are numerous Peruvian documentaries, films and books on the subject. Among these "Ojos Que No Ven", "Dias de Santiago", "Montesinos-Fujimori: Las Dos Caras de la Misma Moneda", "Montesinos: Poderoso Caballero", etc. The director of "The Fall of Fujimori" should spend time analyzing the many problems in his country or at least his country's involvement in other nations' issues.
