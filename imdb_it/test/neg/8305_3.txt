Low budget, but still gruesome enough to get your interest in another take-off on the infamous Frankenstein story. This film is also known as LADY FRANKENSTEIN. The seductive Tania Frankenstein (Sara Bay), fresh from medical school, arrives at her father's estate to discover that she is still up to her old tricks. Baron Frankenstein (Joseph Cotten) was assassinated by his own creation and now his daughter decides to continue the family tradition by creating herself a lover. This is closer to being a haunting melodrama of the horror film. The supporting cast includes Mickey Hargitay, Paul Whiteman, Paul Muller and Herbert Fux. A rainy night could amplify the atmosphere. Still a fun watch.
