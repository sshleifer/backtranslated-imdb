this is an example of a film that can have great potential and is performed very badly .. i'm a fan of kids and thumb suckers and many other so-called distress movies, but this annoyed me. <br /> <br /> because every white child is transformed into a delinquent who loves rap, becoming one-dimensional. the acting was horrible but simple since it consisted mainly of dropping the bomb after the bomb just a bad bad movie if you'd like to see better movies like this: the thumb sucking kids are bullying all those <br /> I think they are better then I recommend one of those that you would like to see a good "movie for teenagers", I hope my comment seemed useful and I hope you can hear your future comments
