How can anyone start to appreciate this movie really is beyond me. <br /> <br /> The idea? He has none. "A boy fell to pieces". This is the idea. Wow. An environment was slowly killing him ... now it's original and worth looking at. <br /> <br /> This is the first Fasbinder movie I've seen ... I heard he's a genius of staging the scene, but I've seen student films with more attention, inspiration, idea and craft than this ... this ... this nothing. It has nothing! <br /> <br /> Each shot is too long. There is so much emptiness in them ... Acting is horrible. You can see that the actors had no preparation, no understanding of their roles, not even an attempt to show emotions ... it's so ... superficial ... The lines are so explanatory that you could remove 90% of them and still have the same shit movie. Time? Who cares? Atmosphere, dynamic, this is for the pussies! One shot per scene, 80% of the time people look unrealistically, having no idea how to represent emotions and the importance of the moment as well as staring at the camera or each other ... Editing? All editing rules have been ignored without any pay-off whatsoever ... Photography? Half of the shots have a reflection in them, and a disgusting illumination without stylization of any kind. Shadows, plays of shadows ... who needs them? We need a boy who pisses, drinks, beats his wife as if he were ... as if he were acting. We need a series of close-ups of a not-so-beautiful woman ... we need an amateur climax of her capture by an unconvincing Arab torturer ... This film is so wrong that it doesn't deserve the no-budget had . <br /> <br /> Frankly, I haven't seen a movie so bad from American Pie 5. Yup. I started watching his movie "Veronica Foss", which looks much better, based on the first 15 minutes (since he has a bit of direction and artistic idea, unlike this shit), so I won't say that Fasbinder is all 'dark ... but this .... this film SUCKING!
