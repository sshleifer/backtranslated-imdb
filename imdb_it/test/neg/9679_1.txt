I've seen some Bible-based waste. This on top of everything. To make matters worse, it takes about three hours. A horrible waste of time, unless you want to combine your child's biblical knowledge with countless aberrations. Do yourself a favor - take a walk in the Sahara instead. Since I am obliged to give you a ten-line statement on why not watch this movie, let me say that there is absolutely no redeemable quality. God's conversations with Noah are ridiculous. It all smells like "let's make the biblical account seem retarded". The basic logic goes, if they spent the money on a biblical film, why isn't it worth it? Since the basic logic is not satisfied, something is wrong. The film begins with a disclaimer on the poetic licenses adopted ... it is the euphemism of the century. Poetic rape But then, poetry would be an undeserved favor.
