I will leave my punters, uhh, the best here to wander around and amaze this wonderful wonderful film, and to say that I thought it smelly. The great thing about this site is that you always get a variety of points of view and look for them, by any means. Don't say what you'll get out of the movie with. For me, those who have seen through sympathies and cheating have my money. There was one, perfectly perfect when he pointed out the two great moments of the thing, which belong to Pacino. The meeting and the airport. Apart from that, well, what a waste of time. Absolutely. Pacino is always doing the same thing over and over and over and over again, it would have been better to serve by lowering the show by about five notches to about the level of his protégé. Everyone always says, but this movie could have been much better. Of course they could all be. But most of them should never have been created. Including this.
