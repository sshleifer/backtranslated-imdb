My wife received tickets for our family to participate for free in the premier of this film by her employer. I'm just sorry about the price of popcorn and the two hours of my life wasted on this junk movie. <br /> <br /> I own the DVD of the original mask, and I loved it. I was expecting a remake anywhere near the original in the production values ​​or in the writing .. but I was not prepared for this vulgar pile of garbage. Weak interpretation, poor plot, a bad child in CGI passing gas and urinating in hyper mask mode. A woman turned into a giant nose, spewing mucus .. Funny eh? My eight-year-old son loves movies like The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Star Wars. After this was over, I asked him what he thought. His exact words; "I hated it, it's like the Scooby Doo movie: they take something good and they have to put all those rough things". My daughter and my twelve year old daughter also hated. Later my wife told me that my son would make her suffer twice if we could leave. He never did it before. I'm proud of him. In order not to think that I am a sort of puritan, from the moans and the lack of laughter I heard in the theater, I think most of the patrons agree with me. <br /> <br /> This film represents all that is bad for children's entertainment today, and any positive review MUST be from people financially connected with the film.
