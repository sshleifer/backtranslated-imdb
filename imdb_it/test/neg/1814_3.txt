Overall, the film "Heart of Darkness" was painful compared to the book. Anyone who has ever read the book and has had sufficient understanding would be able to see the countless obvious flaws. There is an immeasurable difference between the two. It seems to me that the director was walking in a lost battle. I could not imagine that someone would take on the monstrous task of recreating "Heart of Darkness". The immense detail and the magic of the story would be impossible to interpret correctly. Conrad's story had so many levels and so much depth that it would seem useless to try to make a visual interpretation. <br /> <br /> First, capturing the details of the story is unattainable. The colossal beauties created by Joseph Conrad cannot be recreated correctly through the film. Marlow's feelings and emotions cannot be interpreted in the same way in the film. If you have taken on the enormous task of facing Conrad's work, then you know how I Conrad wrote only half the story. The extra half is a series of connections made by the reader. You, as a reader, must be able to infer and connect the ideas of Joseph Conrad. As a result, some crucial details are missing in the film. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, although the film had an adequate length, the film seemed short. It seemed that Conrad was able to pack more details into 75 pages than the film could hold in an hour and a half. The speed of the film prevented the viewer from knowing the characters. Marlow was far more alien. The book's point of view puts you in Marlow's shoes. However, in the movie, you're almost watching Marlow from a distance. I began to think that the director was trying to use the same method of "reading between the lines" as Conrad did. However, the connections were weak. I know that if I hadn't read the book, then, in no way, would I be able to begin to understand the depth of the situation and the characters. <br /> <br /> Finally, Kurtz also seemed to be interpreted incorrectly. His role was short and the details were not all included. It was impossible to understand the real Kurtz in the time he was shown. An important detail of the book was that Kurtz had become a god to Africans. I didn't think they were defined as significant details. Moreover, in the book, Kurtz represented a soulless being. He died inside a long time ago. I believe the director understood this detail. However, instead of re-creating it, he only made sure that Kurtz worried and murmured everything. Furthermore, it seemed that the director had tried to make Kurtz seem mysterious, however, he seemed completely unknown. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film reminded me that a teenager is on the verge of ending a scientific project because of the next day. It seemed to have been made effortlessly and in no time. The characters were alienated, the crucial details were left out and, overall, the central plot was lost in the translation.
