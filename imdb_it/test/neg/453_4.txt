I'm a big fan of the Doctor Who series and I still am, but I was very disappointed when I started watching this new series. <br /> <br /> Children under the age of 15, or even better under the age of 10 will probably be appreciated by the best, and possibly new fans who have not seen any of the original series, but as for fans of the original series, will find this series lacking in the charm that made the original series so fantastic, it took David Tennant to make me appreciate how much Christoper Excellentestion was much better as a Doctor in season one. <br /> <br /> I would just like to recommend this series for people who haven't seen much original series, people who are less than 15 years old and EXTREMELY DIE HARD that fans, everyone else will just have a laugh and murmuring words about Russell T. Davies ruined one of our favorite TV shows.
