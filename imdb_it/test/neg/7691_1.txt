This piece of shit doesn't deserve a critical review so I'll write some information for those who don't know the background of this movie. First of all it's not the first Saudi film, they used this incorrect information for commercial purposes (they lied!). Secondly they did it for money not for anything else so they chose the jerk (Hesham) who won the Star Academy (like Big Brother) is a popular show and the asshole Hesham is popular but stupid, carefree and without talent then he has chosen the famous Kuwaiti actor Mohammed Al Sairafi (also stupid and without talent) but has a popularity (count how many times I will use the word "popular" then send me an e-mail to get your prize, however ..) has a popular show and Jordanian actress Mais Hamdan who appeared in pop-comedy show CBM (unfunny) so she's famous * PoPular! Then they chose some Saudi actors for .. blah blah blah. The funniest thing is the director! It's Canadian with Palestinian roots (I think the film's identity is the identity of its director) .. wait a minute! The script was written by an Egyptian scriptwriter (very horrible!) With the help of the Lebanese critic (famous as a critic but actually a collector of money!). This group of multi-races (slaves of money) knows nothing about the Saudi culture that they do not represent, but when we know who is behind this junk all our questions will be raised! Waleed bin Talaal is the Saudi prince and (BUSINESSMAN) who does not care about Saudi culture or the Saudi people even live in Saudi Arabia (even if he lives in his world, his world is far away from the real world the world of people ) so he knows nothing or worries about nothing except raising his infinite fortune. <br /> <br /> * It is not a Saudi film (no film). <br /> <br /> Screw them all. <br /> <br /> Beep on 10!
