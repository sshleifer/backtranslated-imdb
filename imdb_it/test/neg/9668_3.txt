Visually, this film is interesting. The light is literally generated in a sense, along with cinematography and an enticing presentation before the titles, which had my hopes at the beginning, but then - a b-movie is a b-movie is a b-movie, not it matters how much the show is seen. This film surrounds the life of Albert Fish, one of the most famous serial killers in the world. Active around the beginning of the 20th century, Fish's life is hasty and unfocused before he started killing older children. This film is based on two tracks: the life of Fish and that of William F. King, chief investigator of the case. What saves this film from becoming a Hallmark show and the usual debacle, every time we talk about serial killer movies, is the direction, which is a double-edged sword; director Scott L. Flynn concentrates enough on the fact that the b-actors don't let their flaws show too much, but at the same time he created a really dull and stereotyped vision of the American police through the corner of the king. Sure enough, he tackled Fish's encounter with Grace Budd, the 10-year-old girl he killed, fairly thoroughly, although I'm not sure his mother was the media-mad person that Flynn really tries to point out that she was. I miss more psychological immersion in Fish, not to mention the little time that has been devoted to the post-capture of Fish. All in all, interesting for those in serial-killer, but above all a disappointment; however, if the director made another film about another serial killer, I would certainly see it in the hope that the holes would be patched.
