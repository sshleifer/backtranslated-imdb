I tried watching this show on several occasions and each time I found that he was absolutely pale with humor. <br /> <br /> The reason, for one, is that it is based solely on the ridicule of all that the Republicans have done. In short, the political views of democratic parties are basically publicized as humor. <br /> <br /> All that Mr. Stewart does is a setback on all that the Republicans have done and the public is bathed in forced laughter. <br /> <br /> My hypothesis is that the left is so devoid of any real substance that it must be defined in terms of how much everyone hates Republicans. <br /> <br /> -LD <br /> <br /> _____________________________ <br /> <br /> my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
