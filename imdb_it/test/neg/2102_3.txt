Snakes on a train start when Mexican couples Brujo (A.J. Castro) and Alma (Julia Ruiz) cross the border into the United States, then illegally embark a train of seventeen hours to Los Angeles. However Alma's family did not approve her relationship and Brujo's and placed an ancient curse of black magic on her that turns all her bowels into snakes, is not life a b * tch? As the snakes spill out of Alma's mouth and glide towards other parts of the train, they begin to infect the other passengers with the same unusual malaise ... <br /> <br /> Modified and directed by the Mallachi brothers (although the IMDb claims that it's just a guy who uses a pseudonym, Peter Mervis), I must say that I thought Snakes on a Train was crap, it's really that simple. It seems that the entire film was created and created to cash in on the cult film by Samuel L. Jackson Snakes on a Plane (2006) by all horror fans, the less popular kindergarten production company, which specializes in Hollywood movies. this style of money and the making of a film is no longer evident here with Snakes on a Train, making a film just because the title rhymes with a most successful film is not a good starting point. The screenplay by Eric Forsberg is rubbish, to begin with Snakes on a Plane was a lot of fun, while Snakes on a Train is much more serious and, when analyzed and looked at, this should have been much lighter. In fact it probably would have worked better as a parody of Scary Movie (2000). You know what, I'm struggling to find a good thing to say about Snakes on a Train, it's so bad. To begin with, the characters are rubbish and it's impossible to imitate with anyone, the story is really terrible and it doesn't make sense (if people throw up all those little snakes where the huge ones come from?) Because Alma turned into the giant snake. At the end ? Why did Bujo kill the engineer? How would he stop the train once he arrived in Los Angeles? Where did that typhoon come from in the end?), Takes itself too seriously, the first seventy odd minutes are so boring and without incident I am surprised to have stayed awake and it's just a very, very poor movie on almost every level. <br /> <br /> Director Mervis only has a couple of railroad cars that look the same in the same way the film becomes very repetitive and boring to watch. There is barely blood or blood, there are snakes that borrow under the skin of some people, someone is hit and that's all. Even the special effects are rubbish, the giant CGI snake is really horrible in the end and the least is better. It's not scary, there's no atmosphere and it's a bit boring from start to finish. Even the real live snakes are a problem, they are so docile and non-threatening. If you watch a scene with a real snake and an actor, the snakes never move towards them or act aggressively and in fact always seem to want to crawl in the opposite direction. <br /> <br /> Shot in California technically the film is obviously low budget and shows, after all it seems cheap because it is. The acting is not exceptional, not that the actors deal with any type of material to work with. <br /> <br /> Snakes on the train are rubbish, I'm sorry but that's how I feel and I don't know how else to describe it. I really can't see what anyone would want to get from watching Snakes on a Train, it's really so ugly.
