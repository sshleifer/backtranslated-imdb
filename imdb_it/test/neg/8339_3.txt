When I saw this movie, all I could think of was: what a disaster! No, I'm not talking about the volcano, but the film itself. I've seen a lot of movies, but this is certainly one of the worst ever. I am not interested in the fact that an erupting volcano under the center of L.A. is it possible or not. Maybe it isn't, but this could have been a good movie too ... but it certainly isn't and I'll explain why. <br /> <br /> I don't know how many lava flows out of a medium volcano, but what I do know is that the volcano in this film makes Vesuvius, Etna and Monte Pinatubo together a small barbecue. I don't think there's ever been so much lava coming out of a volcano like the one we see in this movie. I'm sure the director had a lot of money to spend on his film, but I really wonder why he spent it on special effects and not on the script and the actors. I'm not saying that he should have engaged a high-level cast, but that's exactly the opposite of what I'd call good acting. Their performances are so incredibly poor that they make the whole movie even worse. <br /> <br /> And what's wrong with the script you're probably putting up. Well, can you tell me who has the idea of ​​people standing a few meters or even a few meters from the lava without being burned or having to hide for the moor? Or people who sink into the earth when the lava flow is not even two feet high? <br /> <br /> I'm sure I wouldn't be proud if I had written a script like that, but apparently there are writers in Hollywood who don't care about credibility as long as they pay good money! VERY nice money !!! <br /> <br /> When you see the movie, you will probably agree with me that this is one of the worst Hollywood disaster films, it's not worth more than a 3/10.
