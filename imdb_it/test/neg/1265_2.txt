I came across a rare copy of this first Almodovar film with high expectations - Almodovar is a prolific contemporary director, I enjoyed his 1988 film "Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown" and I read one or two very positive of the film. Well, I must have completely lost the humor that the reviewers saw in this movie. I found it inconsistent, tasteless and boring. Yes, there are a lot of innumerable people in trailing and raw sexual situations, and yes, these elements may have shocked the public in 1982 (which was almost certainly the intention of Almodovar), but much of the value of shock probably comes it is corroded over the years, leaving a soft texture. Besides that, the whole movie seemed very chaotic, none of the characters was particularly nice, and for a "comedy" - even a dark one - I didn't find this movie funny. I suppose it's possible that there is a VERY select audience for a film like this, but I'm not part of that audience, and I'm not sure I want to be.
