I couldn't disagree with anyone who says this is a lousy movie. My friend and I went to see him during the Stockholm film festival and this was one of my favorite films during the festival. The dolls used in horror movies are not something new, but I have not seen that many films have been performed as well as in this film. The atmosphere, the setting, the actors, the camera ... everything is simply beautiful. And they work really well with each other. Now, if you expect this movie to be another grudge or ring, you probably won't like it. But if you're out for a good stylized scare, then it's perfect. Although it's quite predictable and sometimes ridiculous, I would still recommend it to anyone who loves horror movies. Go see it. Now.
