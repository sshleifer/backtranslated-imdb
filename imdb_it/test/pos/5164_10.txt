The latest film by Swedish director Roy Andersson, You, the Living is not easy to review. One reason is that in his own words he broke with the Anglo-Saxon tradition of the story, essentially the model of most Western film productions. Another reason could be that, although Roy Andersson is a bit heavy in symbolism, his, unlike those of, for example, Andrei Tarkovsky, are more elusive in nature. It took 3 years to complete this 86-minute movie and it wasn't because he was forced to take long breaks between shootings due to financial problems or problems with the actors. The film is composed of 57 vignettes taken mainly from a camera, and it was the careful design of each of these scenes that took a long time. The imagery of this film, which is closely related to the previous film by the director Songs from the Second Floor, is of the utmost importance for the story, so this story is told largely by the environment and the environment in which the characters live of the Andersson universe. and interact. Before every scene was finally filmed, there would have been less than 10 different test shots with actors, colors, different dialogues, etc. The result is a dreamlike version of the surrounding world that many of us will recognize and if the setting is like a dream, why not dream a little? Just like in Bunuel's The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, when someone says "Last night I had a dream", you have to watch it. But then again, what is perceived as reality here is not very different from dreams. <br /> <br /> Although the film lacks a plot in the traditional sense of the term and there are no main characters like that, the different characters that appear and reappear in different scenes still meet and their stories are inevitably intertwined. What most of these characters have in common is their apparent loneliness despite being surrounded by other people. The garbage chain of the caravan and the binge drinking woman who dreams of having a motorcycle so that she can get away from "all this shit", from her burly and mostly silent boyfriend and from her fragile and apparently kind but rather distracted mother, members of a brass band whose ability to improve home efforts is not receiving a favorable reception either from their families or from their neighbors, from the depressed Middle Eastern hairdresser and his arrogant client on the road to "a very business meeting important ", an old man who has a nightmare about bombers in the skies, a girl who dreams of marrying the young rock star she is so madly in love with. These are dreams and nightmares against reality, but it works as much as a statement in support of the claims of the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein that "every human communication is a bad communication". People talk to each other but it's like they talk to each other. They try to reach others but they close others when they try to reach them. <br /> <br /> You, the Living is a poetic film physically set in Stockholm, but nevertheless universally applicable. The society he portrays is Sweden, his artistic language and exposed people are generally unmistakably Nordic. However, the subject he deals with, namely the misery of the human race in a selfish world, reaches far beyond this hemisphere. Despite the seriousness of the theme, the film seems much more cheerful and full of humor than might have been expected. But in the words of the director himself "living is so complicated for each of us that the only thing that saves us is our sense of humor". So this film is a tragic comedy or a comic tragedy, depending on your sensibilities, and not a depressing tour of black reality of human nature. It's unusual in its language and structure, but if you can think outside the box and appreciate it, you'll surely find this movie both fun and meaningful at the same time. It was presented at this year's Cannes Film Festival as part of the Un Certain Regard program which offers "original and different works" outside the competition. After the film was shown in the Salle Debussy, the audience of 1,000 people gave a standing ovation for several minutes. Do I have to say anything else?
