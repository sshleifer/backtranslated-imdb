This excellent musical film, in beautiful Technicolor, is so wonderful that it makes every person of Irish descent proud. Full of joy and celebration of all that is Irish, a refined cast, with brilliant settings and superb theatrical plots, the adorable Irish music and the superlative Irish tenor voice Dennis Morgan, it is the luck of the Irish to have such a wonderful film to have fun again and again! Not just for St. Patty's Day, mind you, but for the whole year. <br /> <br /> One of the jewels produced by Jack L. Warner during his heyday as head of the Burbank studio in the 1940s. /> <br /> Shame on Warner Brothers for not having this beautiful image available on home videos and DVDs!
