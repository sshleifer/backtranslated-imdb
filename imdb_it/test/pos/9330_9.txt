Before this was shown on MTV or VH1, it was in my local theater that played just before the main movie. I remember this short film more than the movie I saw that day. It was the first time I was making a musical film like this, but I'll tell you that seeing a 35mm print on a dark theater on the big screen gives a much better impact than seeing a cropped pan and scanning the VH1 version on Halloween.
