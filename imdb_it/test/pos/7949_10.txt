I was lucky enough to see this film at the international film festival just ended here. I was actually able to watch another South Korean film (The Power of Kangwon Province), but Christmas in August caught my attention the most. The story is quite simple, the usual boy-girl-meet (or should we say a girl-meets-boy?). What made it special for me was the way it was made. We can say that the film was calm and captivating. Here we have no striking and artificial romanticism, only two ordinary beings made wonderful by friendship and by unexpressed love for each other. I also loved the way the film used images as expressions of past and present relationships. I wanted this to be shown here as a normal movie. I'm sure it would call for a wider audience.
