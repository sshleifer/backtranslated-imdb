He could not. <br /> <br /> From the cutting dialogue to the super special effects this film was a joy to see in everything. The immediate sensation of the bitterness of the Antarctic, the affinity for the characters that are built on the basic level before the real action heats up and the astute ending come together to make this one of the most memorable and entertaining films in circulation. <Br /> <br /> Against a long list of films that have attempted to exploit the theme of visitors to another planet, The Thing comes out on top and laughs. Who can forget the perfectly synchronized dialogue and the chilling special effects? Special effects that are much more impressive than the computer-generated images we see today. I first found some of the funniest aspects of the film like the way we were slowly introduced to each crew member, and the way everyone had some distinctive character traits. This was not just a tasteless horror hit movie. This film had a feeling. Emotion. <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend this movie well enough. I still have to see something in his class that is approaching the meeting, not to mention the improvement, the almost perfect acting and the times used in this cunning multi-American prodigy of cinema.
