While I realized, that this show is too weird to please everyone, I don't understand where all these negative reviews come from, and I'm more surprised at the negative reviews it got from movie fans. I liked it and got passionate from the first episode I saw. It's a bit messy, though, that Kuzco was put into school. And it seems to be the High School rather than the College. But I guess he's only eighteen, right, so isn't he too old to be educated? And haven't the royals always had the best education possible for them? So "the Kuzco must graduate, or he will not become emperor", the thing does not seem too strange. And I think his education has been neglected before, so that's why he needs to be educated now.
