I remember hearing about this movie and how it sounded in almost every drive-in movie theater here in Toronto. This is a group of girls who are not accepted by the other sisters of their college, so they start by themselves, and they obviously call it H.O.T.S. It's a fun movie, full of drive-in nostalgia! Lots of t-shirts, vans, fights and a showdown of soccer games like no other! It has been compared to "Animal House", which is a good movie in its own right, but nothing compares to H.O.T.S. It has its own mark of fun and character. If you are looking for a classic T n'A movie, look no further than H.O.T.S. the girls are to the rescue, the boom-boom shorts and everything!
