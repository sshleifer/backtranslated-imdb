I really enjoyed this movie! Since I don't want to give much, it's basically a mother and a daughter and the life they have together. It is a very moving story, one of the struggles they have. I also think Natalie and Susan have perfect chemistry for the whole movie! This is definitely a must see! Two thumbs up, go!
