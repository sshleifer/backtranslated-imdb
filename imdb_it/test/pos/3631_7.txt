Let's face it: there are no rules for the script, so I won't say that the movie SHOULD be something different from what it is. I will only indicate my opinion. OK, I really liked the script, the way things are told and the characters are introduced. However, I think that when a game is adapted to the silver screen, it could perhaps try to adapt to this other media. Since this film was directed by João Falcão, the same man who directed the comedy, it's no surprise that the film has become a bit too theatrical. It's the first movie of man, for shouting out loud! What I'm saying is that there are parts in the film - like the city of Nordestina, which is somewhat reminiscent of the "Hoje é Dia de Maria" set - which looks like we're not in a movie theater. We are at the theater! The lines are pronounced too formally, the characters are moving choreographically and the lightning is clearly designed for a stage. Of course, maybe this was the intention, but it was done. On stage. Wonderful things were done when adapting a game to a movie - the beautiful "Closer", for example. When I went to see this, however, I didn't feel like watching a movie. But overall, it was a good one, worth watching. It's a beautiful love story, funny sometimes sad for others. My vote is a 7.
