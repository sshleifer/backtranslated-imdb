Friend, they never laugh so much this year, and it's pretty hard to make me laugh. While I was expecting some Hostel-style movies, the smile came to my mind from the beginning. This film-inside-film shows a female victim stabbed who messes up the entire set until she "dies". The exaggerated guide the director and his funny reaction tell us, the spectators, that Mute Witness is not a typically horror film. <br /> <br /> The main character, the silent American make-up artist Billy Hughes, is played by the beautiful and talented Russian actress Marina Zudina. His performance is first-rate; his character cannot speak, so body language and emotions on his face must compensate. And, oh boy, he did a great job. His sister (Fay Ripley) is the girlfriend or girlfriend or wife of the "director of the film" (Evan Richards). They were both very funny most of the time. I won't ruin it any more, but the scenes that followed the moment of the bathtub, with the two of them, the fake policemen and then the angry neighbor were the simple and brilliant black comedy. <br /> <br /> The plot twists towards the end, perhaps misleading at a particular time. But do not worry. Such a delightful film can be seen in the family or with your boyfriend / girlfriend / friend.
