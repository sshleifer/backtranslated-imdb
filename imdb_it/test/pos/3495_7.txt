Anyone who has seen Ali G before, should be well prepared for the entire movie that is 'Ali G Indahouse' <br /> <br /> Although I prefer Ali G when interviewing the rich and famous, his brand of completely comedy off the wall surely entertains from the beginning to the end even on the big screen. <br /> <br /> A ridiculous storyline, ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script, which make this film a riot for Ali G. fans. <br /> <br /> If you saw it and didn't like it, avoid this movie like the plague, because it's definitely the same thing; for everyone else - watch it Aiiii! 7/10
