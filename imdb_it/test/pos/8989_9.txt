Now, I realize that most of the people here exudes YOUNG WARRIORS or greets it as "so bad is fun" entertainment, but let me clarify something: in reality it is a high quality piece of low income, if you are willing to watch cinema without a critical eye. In fact, it's a lot more fun and challenging than most 80s action movies. <br /> <br /> The key is in the subject of the film. I am always crap for films that deal with the theme of vigilantism, especially when they aspire to search for the psyche of the characters involved. YOUNG WARRIORS may not have the intelligence or sensitivity of the first DEATH WISH movie (and yes, I think the first had both of these elements), but it is trying to be different from the Cannon run of the mill movies when it is really single. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple (don't worry, there will be no spoilers): a group of college student pranksters change course when one of their family members is attacked by a tough street gang. The students take to the streets in an attempt to fight street crime in general, because they don't know who the responsible gang is. Eventually they acquire some heavy artillery (machine guns and grenades) and go around armed all night. However, these are not Schwarzenegger types; they are weak, inexperienced, inexperienced, making gross mistakes almost every time they decide to clean up the city (usually with their frat mascot dog in tow). In the end, they understand who the gang is and go after them, but then you wouldn't expect a standard climax where the good guys will go unharmed. <br /> <br /> One thing about the film that struck me as strange but effective is that most of the first act offers no indication as to whether we will see any action or violence later on as it is treated as a fancy comedy that you would see on Up All Night in the United States (where I believe it was actually shown in one place). The script of the play really made me forget that the VHS cover showed a boy riding a motorcycle with a machine gun tied to his back. Then, when violence finally arrives, it's not funny or cute at all ... it's shocking. From that moment on, the film becomes a real fil rouge of action without compromises that contains surprising shootings and blood. <br /> <br /> Acting, though nothing special, is much more passionate than I thought. James Van Patten, who plays the protagonist, gives his best and his performance is surprisingly good for this type of film. The rest of the cast is equally invested, including the ever-reliable Ernest Borgnine as the hero's police officer father. Also the cinematography is above the norm and the action scenes are managed with a level of severity that I personally did not expect. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some people thought this film was worthless. dated, but those facets struck me as nothing short of cool in and of itself. The character of Van Patten is studying animation and his 80s-style work that is exhibited in different scenes is the psychedelic wet dream of a lover of retro cinema. I'm sure the most contemporary viewers would quote those same moments as the low points of the film, but I disagree. Furthermore, the soundtrack by Joe Walsh - which sounds like it was recorded only in 1983 - seemed particularly suitable and enjoyable, regardless of how "old" it seems today. <br /> <br /> YOUNG WARRIORS is one of my favorite action movies of the 80s and I strongly urge anyone interested in the genre to take a look. Unfortunately, however, it was published on VHS only at the time of writing this article, and it is not shown on TV these days. A beautiful DVD presentation would make me walk around my living room with such intensity that I'm sure my ankles will swell. Meanwhile, I beg all of you to go to Ebay or Amazon and redeem the ten dollars or anything else for the old big box tape. It's really a staple of the ambitious junk cinema.
