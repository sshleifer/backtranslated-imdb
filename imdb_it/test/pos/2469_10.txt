The most intense and powerful film I've seen in years. There have been other films that have investigated Vietnam Vet but nothing compared to this exciting film, like a typical American suburban family, about 1972, separates at the seams, revealing the scars that Vietnam has left on our all our collective souls . The cast is A ++++ fantastic with all four actors (with Kathy Bates standing out) giving compelling performances. What is wonderful about this film is that you do not take part, but you understand all four characters and empathize with them, even if all four have different points of view and needs. There are scenes here that are as powerful as they reveal secrets and family feelings (like the clash between mother and son) that will leave you emotionally drained and in tears of anguish. I actually cried in this movie, something I rarely do. The shocking end is a daze! A very neglected film that should be seen. I consider this 1996 film a 10/10 a superlative piece. Highly recommended especially in this day and age with again, our country involved in a horrible war, our titles screaming of atrocities and again, our young men and women return with deep psychological scars, with their deep pain of actions done in the line of honor. A movie to see.
