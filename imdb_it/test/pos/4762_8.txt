I love the other reviews of this movie. They reflect my attitude. I am a type of 70s boy, less "Star Wars" disco and childishness. There was nothing exceptional about this film, except for a hunting scene. That's why it was good, because it was hard, simple and cheap. Roy Scheider made the film, based on the crew, the 7 Ups, which supported Gene Hackman on the "French Connection". The people in it were credible and medium, who burned and poured coffee, showed fear in the chase scene and almost lost it after a close stop. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it would be easier to tell you what was missing. There were no extravagant weapons, only basic revolvers and crude pump-action rifles. There was no hard philosopher, wing Tarantino. There was no kung fu or samurai nonsense or even shooting. There wasn't a smart guy who made a complicated scheme based on hundreds of things that went the way he planned, including the reactions of everyone else. The criminals were bad, but they didn't shoot people for the fun of it. In reality, there was a body count of only three. something that the average movie these days would have passed in the opening credits. It could be a G movie today! No trucks loaded with orphaned children have been kidnapped, nor have terrorists threatened to kill half of the city. There were no hij hi high techs, nor were the crimes themselves moving or ingenious, the highest tech thing I saw was an ATT-toned wall phone. He had no subplots or fun developments of the character. Also, no sex or women, except a gangster's wife who screamed while our friend her hero threatened her. <br /> <br /> It was a small business owner who used his connections with the local crowd and the police to kidnap local mobsters for some easy money. The gravediggers. Vito, was played by Tony Lo Bianco who did a great job, as good as Roy Schneider, Buddy, the head of the 7 UPS cop, who informed and exploited. What happened to Tony Lo Bianco, looked like a Pacino shoe, good-looking and talented? What he did was a great New York background for a simple crime story. Places that were desolate and dehumanizing without being a sociological study. He had a simple plot that involved this kidnapping scheme in which one of Buddy's cops was accidentally involved, literally dragged accidentally and then accidentally killed. Since Buddy and his 7 ups are a hot dog unit, both the NYPD Brass and the mobsters thought he was involved, since the kidnappers had disguised themselves as simple cops to dress to attract the attention of the mobsters. Obviously the mobsters imagined they had lawyers and rights to protect them from the normal police. Even the mafiosi were simple, old and ugly, there were neither godfathers nor masters of the Soprano. <br /> <br /> It is a good base film with a scene of extraordinary chases in two Pontiacs 70s. Even the machines were simple and cheap, not even a GTO or a Trans Am, like acting and history. In the days of uber-hype Batman or "24" levels of doomsday scenarios, this movie reminds us that less is better. It should be shown to screenwriters and film directors as a warning not to surprise, to entertain and eventually insult us with acrobatics, gadgets and clown-like psychotic behavior in abundance.
