The numbers don't lie, 109 people voted for this movie. This says a lot about the position of one of the most intuitive comedians of the late 20th century. And for those of you who know Bill Hicks' work, if he were alive today, imagine what he would have to say about the boy's president from his home state? That his short career remains unrecognized is a sad situation and this film, or rather, these two films explain why. First, see how obvious his talent was from the start, over and over again, those who knew Bill Hicks always said that it wasn't just fun, it was also unique. The film also shows how the quality of his material was too demanding for many in the entertainment industry. His drinking has also contributed to his career problems, but this is less evident in this film. And then the second film is a complete performance. If you've never seen or heard of Bill Hicks, this is a wonderful introduction to the person and his dark but intelligent humor. Especially due to the fact that the arguments are now almost 14 years old, yet remains ironically updated, it is underlined by the fact that many of the events took place under the first President Bush. <br /> <br /> Looking at them together - first the biography and then the performance - makes you aware of how great this young man was, how quickly his life has passed and how the American media can sometimes act as great homogenizers . Let's make sure that nothing is too provocative, nothing will be too interesting And the result? Well, as the man himself said, going to sleep in America, your government has control ........... In his life, at least in Britain, this artist has been recognized for his talented and succeeded there. 11 years after his death, 109 people of IMDb can say something about the film. After seeing them both, I hope you understand why more people should listen to Bill Hicks.
