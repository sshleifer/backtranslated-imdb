The central airport is the story of a pilot named Jim (Richard Barthelmess) who has a bad flight in over 4000 hours and is forced to give up the commercial flight. Meet a beautiful girl named Jill (Sally Eilers) and the two begin an act that involves flying and stunts. The two begin a relationship, but when Jim is injured, his brother (Tom Brown) takes over for a while and falls for his brother's girlfriend. From there, things become exciting and terribly terribly sad. <br /> <br /> This film is a pre-code for several reasons. First, Jim and Jill consummated their relationship without being married and without any intention of having a marriage. Secondly, Eilers is shown in his underwear, and scene absolutely limited when the Production Code came into effect. <br /> <br /> This film does not skimp on the dramatic love triangle and, as a result, ends bittersweet.
