At one time Buddy Cop's films dominated the box office. It seemed that every summer flocks of Beverly Hills Cop policemen descended on the theaters of our nation. Not anymore. Lately the gusher has barely dried a trickle. The drought has declined somewhat recently with the release of Showtime, a film that is a genuinely fun and constantly entertaining example of the genre. <br /> <br /> Mitch Preston is a dedicated cop. He's not a dirty Harry guy in any way. He is an incredibly focused professional who is completely intolerant of anything that interferes with the execution of his tasks, such as, for example, a TV operator T.V. Mitch takes care of the cameraman in a socially irresponsible way and falls into the clutches of Chase Renzi, a producer looking for a killer hook for his `reality TV show T.V. cop show. She thinks that Mitch will give her the "sharp" push she needs to be a success, but she thinks it's too unlikely to bring the whole show alone. Join Trey Sellars, a police officer who has seen too many replicas of Police Story. Of course Mitch and Trey mix like oil and water and a great funeral ensues. <br /> <br /> We know that Mitch and Trey are destined to become best friends by the end of the film. This is how cop movies should work. In fact, it must be said that Showtime rarely deviates from the established clichés like Lethal Weapon and Tango & Cash. There's a high-tech McGuffin to roll the ball (in this case an automatic rifle that shoots bullets big enough to stop the tanks.) There's a pretty wicked foreigner with an indeterminate accent. There are chases, shootings and explosions. We all know this is happening and we have a pretty good idea of ​​how it will end. You know what? There is nothing wrong with that. Yes, we know that well-worn bases will be touched but the fun here is the journey, not the destination. Showtime does not struggle to be original. Instead his energies are channeled into his characters and humorous situations. As a result, Showtime does a competent job with action sequences but really shines in its comedy. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is as dry as Mitch. In the past I thought that De Niro was a cold and inexpressible actor, horribly given to theft when he was called to do comedy. But lately he grew up with me. He seems to be injecting more humanity into his roles. Eddie Murphy is as fun as Trey. The best way to describe his interpretation is that Trey is the one that Murphy would be if Murphy wasn't so talented and had reached the big moment. Rene Russo has a funny time playing Chase Renzi's bizarre lust. Walk through the film chasing high Nielson rankings with a majestic determination. In his zeal, he re-vamped Mitch's life to make it easier to use. He also turns to T. J. Hooker himself, William Shatner, to show Mitch how to be a more "authentic" policeman. Shatner is fun, he interprets himself exactly as we expect him to be, strong, ignorant and slightly hateful. <br /> <br /> I must admit I was looking forward to doing Showtime and I was not disappointed. Ten years ago this film would have been a guaranteed success. Today he is doing moderate business at best. It's a shame because Showtime is a lot of fun.
