I'm surprised by the amount of negative reviews on this film. If you don't like this movie for what it is - a stupid, exaggerated story, then you're just reading too much. This film is the classic story of a wife trying to escape "life" and the problems that follow her. Michelle Pfeiffer is formally the shirt of the 80s, which is an insecure and uncomfortable wife, while Matthew Modine is a malicious cop who falls in love with her. The plot is mostly predictable and predictable and Mercedes Ruel steals the show as the Queen of the Wives of the Mob. If you're not looking for something that is too dynamic and complex, this film is absolutely fun and a cult classic from the 1980s. You will not be able to stop looking if you start.
