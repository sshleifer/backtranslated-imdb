This is the best movie I've ever seen. He has all the tragedies and happiness of love and hate. It is a profound friendship that not even war can destroy. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful cast I've ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Read were the best in this film. <br /> <br /> If you see the first part, you will want to see everything. Some of my friends watched part of the movie at my house, then I went out and bought the movie. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of civil war, but this film has made my grandchildren interested in history. Any film that makes children learn the story is great. I have books I, II and III and when girls leave Florida every year they want to see North and South.
