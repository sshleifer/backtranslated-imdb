The Disney-based Buena Vista Pictures presents a wonderfully directed sports-based drama by actor Bill Paxton. Photography is superb, but history sometimes sinks. This film is about the 20-year-old amateur golfer Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf) and his competition in 1913 of the U.S. Open. What a story; a unique possibility for a young man apparently incapable of playing alongside the best golfers of the time, including British champions Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) and Ted Ray (Stephen Marcus). A fairy tale ending leaves a lump in my throat. The cast also includes: Peter Firth, Elias Koteas, Marnie McPhail, Robin Wilcox and perhaps steal the show is Josh Flitter, who plays Eddie Lowery, the caddy and Ouimet's best friend.
