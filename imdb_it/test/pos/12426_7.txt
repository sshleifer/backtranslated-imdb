Adam (Eric Jungmann) and the hateful best friend Harley (Justin Urich) are driving for a wedding. Along the way they pick up the sexy hitchhiker Sarah (Aimee Brooks). So, for no reason, a monster truck keeps trying to drive them off the road ... and maybe kill them. Who is doing this and why? <br /> <br /> Pretty good horror movie. It is energetic and full of flashy direction that takes you straight into action. It's also a horror comedy. Most of the humor is childish and REALLY coarse but actually a little funny. Even sometimes this film builds up on the blood, but that's a good thing! Acting is OK - Jungmann somewhat minimizes his role as a nerd; Urich is stuck with the desperate role of the best friend stunned by sex - but pulls him out; Brooks is also good in a limited role. <br /> <br /> BUT I saw the final "twist" arrive long before it happened and the logic completely disappears at the end (especially the rescue). Yet this is a bloody horror film, sometimes funny and sometimes scary. I give him a 7.
