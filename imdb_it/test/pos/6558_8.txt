Anyone who appreciates the bizarre Lynchian of Twin Peaks or any fan of HP Lovecraft who knows that the scariest things are familiar things, will really appreciate this movie. Don't look at it as a horror film in the "traditional" Western sense, but more like a Grimm fairy tale. It's bloody and certainly for 16+, but once you start looking at it, you too find yourself drawn to the vortex. Surely one of those movies that hangs with you for a few days after watching (I'll never look at my snails the same way again!)
