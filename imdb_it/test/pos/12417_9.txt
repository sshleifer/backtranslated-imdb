Five minutes later, I started to feel how good this was, you have a completely non-hero hero and your crazy overweight friend. Seen everything before, yes right. I was getting ready to get bored of my mind for quite a few hours. This is something I'm used to ... we don't all have. Then after a few minutes of insults fueled with testosterone and so, the truck appeared. Ok, the shooting techniques used to make it look faster were awkward, but who cares! That truck is fantastic! Soon, however, this is taken away again and we are back to the geek and his overweight friend. But now I'm satisfied that at least it won't be too terrible. I therefore proceed to be amazed again and again by the intelligence of the film. There are so many jokes at their expense, it's like everyone in the world was involved in this except the two. The mind behind the make-up and the effects was a genius I swear. Believe me, if you are a man you miss so many jokes in this movie, there is so much that only a girl can understand. <br /> <br /> Brother Bob is by far the best hillbilly killer that can be found anywhere, the fact that it is sewn together adds to the effect. There are of course some really stupid facts in this field, but this is not always the case. When our 'hero' is making his nose bleed and he uses blood to guide his brother Bob to death, he is now junk. In no way can bleeding from the nose be so ugly and does not mean a severed artery or something. They are all using too much blood, but this is taking a little too far. The jokes about incest are still predictable, but still fun. And the way brother Bob meets his end is more than classic. Overall, the rules of this film actually break the melodramatic tension of horror we got so much in 2003-2005. The end of this move simply couldn't have been better. <br /> <br /> This is a must-watch for all those who like their horror with different side orders of gore and attitude.
