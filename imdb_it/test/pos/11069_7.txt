This film is pretty good, actually it's like a good wine, it gets better and the more you look at it. The pace is rather slow for such a high topic, but cinematography is beautiful and surreal. There is a blue tint that "rides" the entire movie. There is also a great performance in the performance of Gabriel Casseus of the character "Midget". He is fantastic. Because this guy doesn't work more. If the film had better support, he probably would have done it.
