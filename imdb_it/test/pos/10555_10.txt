I think it's a fantastic and VERY fun movie. The story is so funny. Daughter Nicole brings her father Andre, in some embarrassing situations. In an attempt to impress the boy of his dreams, the daughter pretends that her father is her lover. You just have to see !! Heigl is as adorable as Nicole, perhaps too adorable; I'm not sure why he needs to lie to hook someone up? Gerard Depardieu plays very well in this play, it's so fun to watch. If you like comedy and romantic movies you just have to see it !!! I think you can watch this movie many times, and you'll still have a good laugh. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to impress the boy of his dreams, the girl pretends that her father is her lover.
