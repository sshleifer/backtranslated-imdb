(Warning: spoiler! - although it is difficult to ruin this film by telling the details of the story.) <br /> <br /> Eisenstein's black and white propaganda film is not for everyone. He is very old and is, um, awkward. What makes it perfect for me is the soundtrack, not the original but the updated soundtrack. Better still, the Prokofiev orchestral version created (my favorite performance is by Fritz Reiner and Chicago Symphony). <br /> <br /> The movie is actually fun in some places. Remember the old "A Midsummer Night's Dream". Some of the outdoor scenes are quite magnificent. Some of the actors are also magnificent. (The actor who played Nevsky could have been a superstar today. Ditto for the warrior girl, Vasilisa - definitely a rocker.) <br /> <br /> This could be the best film collection in the world of such Russian pithy (there are so many - they make up most of the pronounced lines). <br /> <br /> Battle scenes are actually much more realistic than most high-budget Hollywood flixes. These guys are as clumsy with their fights as the real peasants would be. The weapons look ugly, so the actors were probably trying to avoid hurting each other. <br /> <br /> The actor who plays the German "grand marshall" is trying * really * hard to look scary at the beginning of the movie, but it looks like he was really a pussycat. After being caught, it looks * so * pathetic. (The volumes speak of the expected audience, from?) <br /> <br /> A really funny touch is that the German army carries an * organ * with it, played by a character in a black tunic. Watch the Russians bring this boy * while he is playing. <br /> <br /> After the battle is over and almost all the Germans are dead, the best part of the film (and music) comes, the song sung to the dead soldiers who died defending the motherland. This part is so sad that it is almost a declaration against the war. <br /> <br /> Ten times more men than women voted for this film. I ask why? <br /> <br /> Attention: Joseph Stalin liked this movie. Ironic: he killed more Russians than anyone else. "Those who come to Russia carrying a sword will die by the sword".
