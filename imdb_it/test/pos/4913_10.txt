You have to think along the lines of Last Tango in Paris because the mood and emotions run along the same lines and maintain the same heights - the difference is that in this exceptional, intense and torrid representation of love in the ruins of a Dostoevsky dispossessed, the setting is a gay-subcultural environment - perhaps even one destined to fade over time, and not the equally fascinating but heterosexual context of Bertolucci's film. <br /> <br /> The last third of this film describes a passionate love never seen in gay cinema. Talking about pornography or gay homosexuality lacks the point and the intelligence of this work. This film, even if in first impression seems to take us into the familiar and often depicted underground world of gay life, then precedes to subvert the rules of this kind by exaggerating it in a super-real degree. The result is a hyper-charged emotional uplifting - an exceptional strategy that elevates drama to one of the great universal themes and giant gestures. <br /> <br /> This film rips the ground due to the brilliant performances of its actors, in particular a young Jean Hugues Anglade and director. A tour - De-force of cinema. Exceptional in ambition and it is incessant to fall into the depths of human emotions. As a contribution to gay cinema, this film conquers this difficult terrain and makes it a personal triumph.
