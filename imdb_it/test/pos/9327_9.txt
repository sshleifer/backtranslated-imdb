No matter how you feel about Michael Jackson himself, you can't deny that this video is the most unique video of all time. There is no other video that is even remotely close to "Thriller" The first time I saw it was when I was 6 and it scared me. Now I look at him with a smile because now I can appreciate the wonder that it is. I love this video and it will be for as long as music videos exist. I think everyone should sit and watch it when it is sometimes and look back and see how good it was, especially to be in 1983.
