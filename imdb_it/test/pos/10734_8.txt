The marriage of a high-level couple from the city of New York with a child collapses when the wife wants to go out ("It took a lot of courage for her to come out of that door!" A neighbor tells us); the busy and distracted husband takes on the "maternal" responsibilities and approaches his son, but soon the wife returns. A highly manipulative image does not provide us with a very realistic family unit (with the young Justin Henry who certainly does not resemble the product of a marriage between Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep!), But the dynamics are intriguing and engaging, and the director Robert Benton keeps pace by smacking with a lot of intelligence, wonderful classical music, iridescent editing and infallible pieces of humor. Streep's character is designed to be a cold and self-centered witch, but I was ready to try much more for her than Benton probably wanted. Everything has to be painted in terms of black and white, good and bad, with Hoffman learning how hard his wife was and he had a second chance to be a good parent. The film never wavers from its pre-established path, and the very fine acting almost saves him, but I'm not sure where Benton directed the film in the final act, and the final scene is terribly abrupt. *** from ****
