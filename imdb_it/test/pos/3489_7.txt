Alter Egos is no more fun than the creation of Sacha Baron Cohen's Ali G. Completely misled by his delusional and non-existent sense of the suburban surroundings of central England, of which his social background is composed. Persists in living the style of a Los Angeles Gansta. While still living with his grandmother in the London suburb of Staines, he retains control of his Posse, the "Massiv" West Staines. Spend your free time between Me Julie, his girlfriend, the Posse and eight-year local Scout Teaching at the "Keep it Real (advanced)" lectures at the government-funded John Nike Leisure Center. <br /> <br /> Here is where the story takes off, being told that the government funding has stopped, Ali G then proceeds in a mission of a man "In the struggle for justice, I intend to give myself life, just like Martin Luther Van Dross did ". Be his answer to the local media team when interviewing him on a hunger strike while he is chained to a fence. <br /> <br /> Charles Dance here plays David Carlton, the deputy and threatening Deputy Prime Minister, who is "Even more evasive than Skeletor". Using Ali G, unknowingly, to lose the prime minister 18,000 votes three weeks before the general election. Seeing Ali G as a bumbling idiot, his plan fails. Ali G suddenly becomes a nocturnal sensation and a savior of the people, working directly with the Prime Minister. The story becomes more sinister and with hilarious consequences. Ali G Indahouse is a great British film that brings the talented writing attributes, along with Dan Mazer, executive production and acting of Sacha Baron Cohen. Charles Dance and Michael Gambon, as the P.M. recite their parts with great seriousness among the gags and hilarity that is Ali G. <br /> <br /> Ironically, to see the parodies interpret their parts in a world that is really real, and that continue to preach "Keep it Real "from their little world which is the West Staines" Massiv "is a real comic paradox. <br /> <br /> Directed by Mark Mylod, his first feature film since he directed television work such as Shameless, Shooting Stars, The Fast Show and the smell of Reeves and Mortimer to name a few. <br /> <br /> Very real and very funny.
