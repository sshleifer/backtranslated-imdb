This film is a fascinating example of Luis Bunuel's narrative skills. This is a comedy that is not a comedy, and a social drama that is not a social drama. Even though I don't think it was particularly fun, it made me laugh. Furthermore, although Bunuel cannot be taken too seriously, the film has made us reflect on religion and its importance in the lives of some people. Bunuel tells the story of a Catholic priest, devoted to his faith like no other and the viewer witnesses what happens when the immortal commitment of the priest to serve others is put to the test. As usual, Bunuel's goal is Catholicism, but I don't think he tried to mock the church as he often does. At least I didn't take the movie as a mockery of the institution. I think he is trying to make an interesting point about how religion could be a nuisance in today's modern society. Not because faith in itself is bad, but because people always try to put together the concept. Message aside, I think this is one of Bunuel's most intelligent works. Francisco Rabal is as superb as the priest. Surely, one of the director's best films.
