Perhaps the deepest cartoon made in the United States, "Duckman" is short for 70 episodes in four seasons. <br /> <br /> Unlike the often harmless criticisms found in "The Simpsons" (a rather good show in its own right) and the rude humor in "South Park", every part of this series follows a plan. The critique of American society, from its mercantilism to its selfishness, brings much more annoyance than any other animated series. <br /> <br /> Even the cultural references in "Duckman" tend to be obscure, sometimes fan sites will realize that many have not even been captured). In this, it is different from "The Simpsons", which usually uses pop culture instead of the often hidden high-face stuff in "Duckman". As other people who write it note, there is a growth in the characters (Bernice, Duckman and Cornfed). Furthermore, by making the main character not only an offensive neurotic, but actually someone who is experiencing a personal tragedy (as was made clear in episodes like "The Once and Future Duck" ("You will love her until the end of your days ... ') and in "Bev Takes a Holiday" (when he has the chance to tell Beverly all those things he can't say to Beatrice), the series is anchored in a deep sense of reality. <br /> <br /> Not you can avoid feeling sorry for him and his lucid madness. <br /> <br /> All in all, in my opinion, the best cartoon ever made in the United States and one of the best series ever will always be on DVD though Too many things Duck said make a lot more sense today.
