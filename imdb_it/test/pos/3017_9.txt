THE CELL (2000) Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> The Cell, like Antz, must be seen twice to be appreciated. The first time I saw this movie I thought it was mediocre, but the film had such a lasting impression on me after watching, I decided I had to rent it again. I did it, and I found the movie a lot nicer. The Cell is not for everyone, but it shares its stories with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams of images and plot that cannot be matched. The film's screenplay can be hard at times, as well as acting, but the images are brilliant and bring the compelling story to an exotic and intriguing life. The Oscar nominated make-up is also bold and careful, while the beautiful costumes and the absolutely brilliant decoration of the set have gone unnoticed. Tarsem Singh, who has also directed music videos, goes completely mad in his direction and is successful. He has a great talent and this film has great potential if you give him an opportunity. Overall, The Cell is a powerful, disturbing and avoids being too sticky which makes it a great and pleasant watch.
