The feast of Babette, for me, is about healing: repairing the schism between spirit and body in Orthodox Christianity. This Puritan community in remote Denmark lacks an adequate appreciation of all of God's gifts in creation. They have taken the dualism of St. Paul to the extreme and underline the life of the "spirit", not the life of the "flesh". Both the elderly sisters, in their youth, were frightened by the call of love and the temptations of life outside their simple village. They, and their parishioners, cling to the close biblical interpretation of their former leader and the father of the sisters. The elderly congregation has become stubborn and quarrelsome and the sisters do not know what to do. Enter Babette, a French foreigner and someone to whom they can show kindness. They have no way of knowing that they will eventually return their kindness and give fertile ground to their dry and dusty theology. Babette will give all she has and, in the process, she will teach the sisters and their flock grace, sacrifice, the way in which the sensual experience (as in the bread and wine of the Eucharist) can change life and why the real art moves us so deeply. When they can forgive each other and themselves, they can focus on the love of God that unfolds before them in a concrete way in the present. As a minister and artist, I can't recommend a film more highly. True art and true grace !!
