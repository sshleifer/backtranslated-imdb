My wife and children are a good and fun series that really shows the worries and problems that occur the most even in the best families. Michael Kyle (dad) is a man who always tries to stop children from doing stuff for teenagers like partying, drinking, loving or making love. When they do something wrong, he is right there to correct them (by the way he loves to do bad penis) <br /> <br /> Janet 'Jay' Kyle (mother) has a strong personality and rarely agrees with his husband. He understands that their children are teenagers and like to do "wrong" things, unlike Michael. <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle "Jr" is a fool who believes in everything others say. At the beginning of the series, he's such a nice guy and tries to be like his father, but lately, I don't know why, he becomes a very stupid guy and starts to be a problematic guy. At the end of the series he falls in love with Vanessa and becomes a father, or I should say, a stupid father who does nothing good <br /> <br /> Kady Kyle is a typical teenager who loves to party, kiss and drink. He has many problems with his parents because they invade his privacy too much. He has a boy named Tony, a Catholic, and he's afraid of everything, so we can't understand what makes him go out with him. I can remember an episode that they are willing to have sex, but Michael Kyle scares Tony by claiming that sex is very dangerous and deadly, so he decides to protect himself until he gets married. <br /> <br /> I resume that this is the best series of my life and I still watch it every day after 3 years, so I recommend it to all of you, especially teenagers.
