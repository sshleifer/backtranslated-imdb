The director Bill Paxton follows his promising debut, the gothic horror film "Frailty", with this family sports drama on the US Open of 1913, where a young American caddy rises from his humble background to play against his idol Bristish in what he was nicknamed as "The best game ever played". I'm not a fan of golf, and these creaking unlucky sports films are a dozen dozen (the most recent was made in style with "Miracle" and "Cinderella Man"), but some of how this film was compelling anyway . <Br /> <br /> The film begins with some creative opening titles (imagine a disneyfied version of the animated headlines of HBO "Carnivale" and "Roma"), but advances slowly for its first hour of numbers. Once the action moves to the United States, open things go very well. Paxton does a good job and shows a talent for an effective directorial effect (I loved the wet editing of the second-day opening scene) that pushes the plot further or adds unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings. There is a compelling development of the character when the British Harry Vardon is obsessed with the images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats that destroyed his family's child's cottage to make way for a golf course. It also does a good job of visually representing what happens in the heads of pressured players. Golf, a painfully boring sport, is vividly brought alive here. You should also give credit to set designers and costume designers to create an avant-garde atmosphere between London and Boston in the early twentieth century. <br /> <br /> You know how it will end not only because it is based on a true story, but also because films of this genre follow the same model over and over again, but Paxton offers a better show than average and perhaps indicates more talent behind the camera than I've ever had in front of it. Despite its formidable nature, this is a film that is easy and easy to put at the root, which deserves to find an audience.
