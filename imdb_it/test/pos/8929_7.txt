"Eighteen" (2004) tells the story of Pip Anders, a depressed and extremely cynical young man who is estranged from his dysfunctional middle-high class family and who lives on the streets of Vancouver. On his eighteenth birthday, he receives a cassette and a player from his recently deceased grandfather, who recounts his memories of his eighteenth birthday, who spent time with the British army in France, trying to help an injured comrade avoid the capture by the German occupiers. While Pip listens to the tape (Ian McKellen provided the voice of his grandfather), we see the scenes he describes as flashbacks, alternating with everyday scenes from Pip's life, as well as more recent flashbacks that fill the dark secret of why Pip leaves the home and find it impossible to trust anyone who is kind to him. <br /> <br /> A second ambitious film by writer / director Richard Bell ("Two Brothers"), with a refined look, excellent photography, an undeveloped - stereotyped characters (with gays and straight treated the same way) and commendable efforts in emotionally and physically demanding roles by some new talented actors (especially Paul Anthony as Pip and Brendan Fletcher as his grandfather at 18). There is also a remarkable breakthrough by Alan Cummings as a priest who tried to help Pip, and a small supporting role played by Thea Gill ("Queer As Folk"). The complex story - in the words of the director in his commentary on DVD - is designed to guide a "vortex of emotions" that pushes Pip to his breaking point, and certainly realizes it. My only criticisms are that the overall effect is too "schmaltzy" or artificial for an audience to truly identify itself, much of the too elaborate and predictable support dialogue (and ending), and the direction must be more acute to reduce the excess of some scenes. I recommend it, 7 out of 10 stars, including extra points for a remarkable effort.
