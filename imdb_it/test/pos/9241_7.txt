Everyone who has ever wondered how to make a film without a budget should see this documentary. The determination of everyone portrayed in this project has been very moving for me, and should connect to those of us who have ever ventured into any part of the show, be it film, music or writing. I think the directors could have done a better job, prefiguring the events that led to this film, becoming a documentary, perhaps through a narrator; apart from this, the film presents itself as a true example of how the show does not concern "the show", but rather "the business". <br /> <br /> I hope the current Repo Man II project comes to see the light of day. I think the directors did a good job with the little they had to work with and everything they had to overcome to complete it.
