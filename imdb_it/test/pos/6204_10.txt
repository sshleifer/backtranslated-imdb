I saw Sleeper Cell with some trepidation to worry if the terrorists would be glorified. This fascinating series not only managed the subject responsibly, but created depth and substance for almost all the characters. Oded Fehr only eats the screen in every scene he finds himself in and even though his character is the charismatic leader of a jihadist terrorist cell, he still has a hypnotic charm. Michael Ealy behaved well, although in some scenes I wondered why it wasn't shot on the spot because of the frown he was wearing. <br /> <br /> The professionals of the series are the two protagonists, Fehr and Ealy, the well-written characters - all credible and tragic elements, and the disconcerting issues faced in history. Having been married to myself with a Muslim, the atmosphere created was quite realistic. The cons, for me personally, were that the female T & A was excessive ?? most looked free, as did some of the sex scenes. Nevertheless, it is a raw series that will make you think. Someone gives Fehr more juicy roles like this and lets him run with it. He has an incredible presence on the screen and a strange kind of innate power that emanates from him.
