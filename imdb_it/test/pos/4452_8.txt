I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the story and the development of the character. Fulci was a master at creating horrible atmospheres using inventive machine work, vivid cinematography and wonderfully explicit taste. <br /> <br /> This film is no exception, however, compared to his later films (The Beyond, Zombie 2, City of the Living Dead, Graveyard House, etc.) The characters here are extremely well developed and the emphasis moves away from the supernatural and is more about the suspense created by a classic dunnit among the lush hills of Italy. The scenery is in some moments reminiscent of dear folklore and then immediately thwarted by mud and blood-drenched terror wrapped in ruined ruins. The blood in this film is not so widespread and seems contained compared to Fulci's subsequent films, however, splatter and yellow fans will most likely be satisfied with some close-up shots of wounds and the last 5 minutes of the film. > <br /> Overall a fantastic and mature film by one of our great Italian horror directors.
