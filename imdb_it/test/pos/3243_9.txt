Heath Ledgers who plays in this film annoys me a lot, but overall it's a great watch. Bryan Brown is excellent when I normally don't like him, but then his whole band is a great job. Jimmy is an unfortunate gangster who can't do the right thing (SPOILERS: he loses the pandos money, the auto ackos and almost runs into a bank robbery), but still comes out on top. <br /> <br /> did not know what the two were at the beginning there are children, but they tie some stories together well. <br /> <br /> overall a nice piece of 9/10 Australian cinema
