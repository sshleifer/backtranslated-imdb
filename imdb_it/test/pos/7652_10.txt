My girls 4 and 6 love this show. We ran into a PBS station and they always ask when it's on. Remind them of their grandmother who takes care of them every summer day. It's also fun and sometimes they can't stop talking about one scene or another. I highly recommend this show to all small children. It's very clean and seems to slow down and it's not about watching TV all day. When Nana reads a story, she is slow and talks about every page with Mona. It reminds me of slowing down when I read the next book to my girls before going to bed and talk about the book instead of examining it quickly just to get them to sleep.
