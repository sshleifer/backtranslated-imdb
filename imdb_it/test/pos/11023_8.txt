Wow! I discovered it on IFC shortly after seeing But Im A Cheerleader. I've never heard of this film, but the description seemed remotely interesting. I went with low expectations and now I have to say that this is one of the best love stories in cinema. Robin Tunney does an excellent job playing a person with tourettes. The relationship between the two and only the smallest details in the film are so accurate and credible. I usually hate "romance" and I love movies, but this movie really touched me. I recommend this film to anyone with vision.
