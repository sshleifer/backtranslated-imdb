This is truly a love documentary about a fascinating character, his view of life and his extended family. The directors have spent three years recording Sister Helen in her halfway house and have managed to capture such wonderful material that you can't help but hear her sister Helen and her "boys". The house contains 21 addicts each hospitalized with a story almost as involving as that of Sister Helen. The final scenes are particularly engaging and exciting. <br /> <br /> Sister Helen's story of marriage, addiction and loss reveals a very complex character whose hard love is always fun, touching and engaging. <br /> <br /> The film is fantastic in the way it tells its story in a wonderful sequence of life sequences that develop into a story that is almost as clear as if every scene were written and interpreted by the best. The honesty (and obvious dishonesty) of "clients" is very engaging as you learn about their fears and observe their attempts to grow. <br /> <br /> You will never forget Sister Helen, Robert, Moe or poor Ashish (spelling?).
