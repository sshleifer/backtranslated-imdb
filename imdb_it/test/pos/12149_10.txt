A strange one should be able to run into "Tous Risques Class" just by chance; should be on any "best of film-noir" list, including that of IMDb. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is better than ever; knowing his terrible and delicate family situation gives more weight to his almost expressionless face and brief dialogues. Belmondo's sober performance under Sautet's resolute direction shows only what a wonderful actor could - and should - have been. <br /> <br /> "Class Tous Risques" is absolutely mininal, dry and cold, without the artistic scenery of Melville, the beautiful faces and fantasy machines. It is almost film-noir that meets neo-realism. Davos's few harsh words to his children that describe their secret life from then on take a hold on your throat until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The last sentence of the film - a voiceover from the end of Davos in no more than ten words dry and dark - leaves you with a hard punch in the stomach. <br /> <br /> A real jewel in the great crown of the French noir film.
