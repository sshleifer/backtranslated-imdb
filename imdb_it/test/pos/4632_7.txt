This is a fascinating little film, which like many others of its kind, draws its charm from the circumstances involved rather than from real dialogue. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford (as always) transpires in a great comic performance as a penniless officer in the Air Force, married after only one day with showgirl Debbie Reynolds. <br /> <br /> After the wedding night of passion and a life-changing move in Spain, the two immediately realize that apart from the strong sexual attraction they feel for each other they have no nothing in common. <br /> <br /> However, when he decides to start their marriage, he knows that for a trial period of only one month and sex Surely it is not in the cards. <br /> <br /> Even Ford is failing with its new $ 40,000 Lincoln Futura Concept Car (the future Batmobile) that wins in a lottery the same evening it meets its new wife. <br /> <br /> The machine is bringing unwanted attention from the Air Force, which sees it as a vulgar Splay of American wealth and is carrying suspicions of corruption and embezzlement, etc. He is also putting him in the 80-90% tax range and penniless as he now faces a tax charge of over $ 17,000. It's not the kind of money you should have when your wife is the kind of person who spends over $ 1,000 on a shopping trip. <br /> <br /> Even when trying to sell it brings bad luck selling so much like a cigarette or a pair of socks for the natives is punishable by court martial, so you can imagine that a $ 17,500 transaction has practically the assault of the rifle. <br /> <br /> Even his potential buyer causes him problems as he is a disgustingly handsome Spanish bull fighting nobleman, who is the interest in the car has led to a stronger interest in Ford's wife , compounded by the fact that a rich jet-set lifestyle is offered and is what he sought for so <br /> <br /> With Ford's sexual frustration on the rise and jealousy in his growing rival love, in coupled with the materialistic attitude of Reynolds and the flirtatious behavior around the Spanish in love that serves to drive the deeper wedge between the two, it seems that their whirling relationship is destined to end. <br /> <br /> But the love and attraction that threw these two birds of love, in the first place, shine and keep them together? <br /> <br /> It is not the best example of this kind of film, but due to the interpretable interpretations of its principles and pleasant plot, it is certainly a good film.
