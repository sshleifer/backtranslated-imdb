I, having both read and watched Gone With The Wind, found it very difficult not to compare this film with the original. Although I thought Scarlett, the novel, was superb, the film was not summed up. It was a completely different story. Of course, there will never be Rossella and Rhett again besides Leigh and Gable, but the new actors have done a great job, considering. I loved the way the book and the film wrapped Gon With the Wind's story, because after reading it I felt a wave of disappointment because it stopped and left readers wondering what had happened. Scarlett ends the story very well, and Alexandra Ripley was very good in the book. I just hope the film has followed the story more, although it is excellent in itself.
