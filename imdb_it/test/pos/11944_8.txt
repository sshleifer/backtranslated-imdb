I usually have trouble watching a movie on TV, extra long commercial breaks break my concentration and I give up and find a good book. This however made me endure the add and stay with it until the end. I realize that the film was based on a true story, but it was not explained why it took so long to find Denny? They had his name and I assumed his social security number. As he moved a lot, it seemed like he would be found as soon as his number was entered for a job, etc. The actors looked a little old for the part and a metal object buried when it wasn't rusted. These were just technical glitches and they didn't take from the file. For a LifeTime movie it was better than most.
