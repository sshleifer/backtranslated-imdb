Anyone who has enjoyed this series during the first broadcast (I came home from school to see it) now has a certain age, so I can only add my comments to those asking for a DVD version to allow all of us to relive the memories of the first broadcast before it simply becomes a piece of unsaved TV archive history. If so many old TV series of the sixties and seventies can be published, why not? Authorizations for rights certainly cannot be so difficult. Most of the Shakespeare lines I can cite come from this iconic series and I remember exchanging them with my schoolmates as we tried to overcome each other's text memories. Peter Dews has rightly deserved the credit for having the foresight to bring it to the screen. This certainly has been public broadcasting at its best. Robert Hardy and Sean Connery fight to the death - it's compelling stuff and since the beginning of the BBC Television's golden age. Come to the BBC. Delete it and authorize it please. March 2009 So finally the DVD is here and congratulations to those who made it happen. The image quality is extraordinarily good and the performance is just as good as the memory. Now all those who are clamoring for this must buy it and relive those magical moments. <br /> <br /> Spectators from the United Kingdom. Since the series was made in the UK by the BBC using British actors, it is strange that the DVD version is not available there on the DVD of region 2 (Europe) and can only be imported from the United States and reproduced on modified players. It seems almost unlikely that there are important rights issues, perhaps the market has been deemed too small, so why wasn't the "free region" released? so everyone could enjoy it?
