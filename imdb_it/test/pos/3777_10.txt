Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde. <br /> <br /> Michael McGuire was the father. <br /> <br /> Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon. <br /> <br /> Have you seen this movie? ? I doubt it! <br /> <br /> Blankfield was popular enough right now to play the Friday popping-doctor. Thomerson was fun in everything he does, from movies to series to standing comedy. If I ever found this movie on DVD, I would definitely buy it. I recorded this film on HBO in 1982 and practically ran out of tape. One of the most fun themes ever on the Jekyll & Hyde theme. <br /> <br /> Of course. with all the references to cocaine in this film, today it would be too politically incorrect, as would Cheech and Chong. Too bad, because it's FUN, FUN, FUN!
