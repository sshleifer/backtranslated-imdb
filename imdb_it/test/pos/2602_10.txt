This is my favorite cartoon Looney Tunes of all time. It's a common plot: Daffy Duck tries to convince Elmer Fudd that it's really a rabbit season and shoot Bugs. But you can never outsmart that rabbit! In addition to the usual cartoon comedy, this comic is supported by a word game that will keep you glued to the floor.
