I rented this movie without knowing what to expect, but WHOA I was in for a surprise! <br /> <br /> For anyone like me, he was waiting for a good movie that combines horror and sci fi, it's time to rejoice because the wait is finally over. Writing, acting, filming and directing - all first-rate. I hate to admit it, but actually I cried at one point (when Dracula was talking to the crippled guy). Truly an emotional roller coaster from start to finish. The ship's corridors provided the perfect backdrop for this story and the actors were really able to bring their fears to life. And Coolio like a vampire .... very nice! <br /> <br /> And believe me .... as big as most of the film was ... the ending will make you SEE! I know this movie has a lot of influence on this site for some reason, but I know none of you saw the end of the movie. Brilliant!
