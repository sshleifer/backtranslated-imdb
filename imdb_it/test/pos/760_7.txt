I had never heard of this film before finding it while I was looking through the shelves of a local rental store. Having just seen the last installment of Harry Potter, I was intrigued by Rupert Grint and wanted to see more of his work. Reading the description about "a too zealous, wealthy Christian evangelical", and identifying myself as an evangelical Christian, I thought, "Oooh ?? this should be interesting." And so it was. I found the story of Mr Brock beautiful both in words and in images; and unfortunately enough, all too familiar. The contrast between the interpretations of Ben's parents about what it means to be a Christian is a moving comment on how Christians see themselves and the impact that perception has on those around them. On the one hand, Ben's mother says, "Whatever happens behind these walls, Ben, we are God's ambassadors. We show the world a smiling face". On the other hand, Ben's dad talks about the truth in his sermon at the beginning of the film. At the end of his monologue, he says: "The more a person flaunts his own Christianity for the benefit of others, the less I am inclined to trust the Christianity they claim. God tells us that true faith is the freedom to choose the truth. How you express this , the way, the ways, the means at your disposal, these things have no consequence, be a Christian or an atheist, unless in your heart you are true ". If only our churches were full of Christians who attributed to the latter definition what it means to be a follower of Jesus, rather than the former. What a difference it would make! As a Christian and psychologist, I would like an imperfect but authentic faith on a perfectly polished image every day. What a tragedy ?? feeling like I always need to play a role when, really, I just need to rest in the freedom to be completely who God made me to be. I think Mr. Brock takes a refreshing look at how this freedom appears in Christ. I recommend this film to anyone who wants a new look at faith.
