I went to see this because I have some friends in Ukraine. but the film has moved me beyond what I expected, turning out to be a perfect mixture of laughter with the belly (the strange use of Alex's English), situational comedy and heaviness that borders on the depressing. I loved the range. made me want to jump on an old car and take the road to Ukraine. alex (hutz) perfectly interprets his guiding part and provides an excellent counterpoint to the seriousness of elijah woods poker. the film shows the positive side of humanity when a group of different cultures can tie and do the right thing when they feel the sincerity of the situation, even when it has entered it with preconceived notions and prejudices, and how this can open doors in depth memories buried. there is a lot in this film.
