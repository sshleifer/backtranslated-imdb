I have to admit I had low expectations for this film. But I was surprised to find it funny, interesting and fun. It's a fun thriller and not so much a horror movie. There were moments that made me get my hair up again! Even better, though, were the very funny, occasionally hysterical and comical moments of the film (you'll know who I'm talking about). There are also some great special effects (and humor and special effects are not necessarily separate). <br /> <br /> Acting, overall, is very good, much better than a typical low budget horror movie. The main character (Jackie), in particular, and many of the minor roles (such as the lawyer, the couple who live next door, the pizza man) are well recited. If they hadn't been, the film would not have kept my interest and I would have lost my conviction in history. This is a good, interesting low-budget thriller and certainly worth hiring!
