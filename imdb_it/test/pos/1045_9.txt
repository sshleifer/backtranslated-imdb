Barbara Stanwyck probably didn't think about it, but it's a relief to see her in a darker haircut (if it weren't a wig) compared to what she was wearing in "Double Indemnity" the year before. That movie, while the premiere "film noir" and a great all-around film, gave her a great role, but oh, that hair. Here, she is more chic and certainly no femme fatale, but she is certainly a woman of the 40s. She has become accustomed to life without men because most of them are at war, and as a successful artist like Martha Stewart, she writes a family column in which she describes her country house while the camera explores what it really is. We meet his boss, Sydney Greenstreet, who has no idea of ​​living a lie, and when he makes his way to a distant Christmas at his alleged Connecticut home, he has to come with a husband (Reginald Gardiner) and a baby before we can say " Jingle Bells ". Hungarian chef S.Z. Sakall intervenes to help and ends up in a cutsey pie one on one with Irish Una O'Connor. "It's not Goulash, it's Irish Stew." Sakall simply takes the paprika, pours most of it and says "Now it's goulash", totally changing what he prepared for lunch. Then, when it comes to the flapjacks, he turns around and she digs. For years, some of my friends and I will use that line whenever the pancakes come into a conversation. "I don't understand, I scoop!" He won't turn one up for Greenstreet, saying "I've never changed my life." O'Connor can get nervous when he screams several times in some movies, but here, he is delightfully adorable, and his pairing with Sakall is very fascinating. <br /> <br /> It is evident in the romance department that Reginald Gardiner is not Barbara Stanwyck's cup of tea, especially when he meets the handsome Dennis Morgan, who is a little cheated when he bathes the child, who eats the soap, causing Stanwyck to be a bit alarmed. He should suspect something instantly, but he doesn't. But it does not matter. The film is so charming with the country setting full of snow, plenty of rocking chairs and a dog running towards them as the sled arrives. Living in New York after 25 years in Los Angeles after growing up in a small town in western New York made me miss this kind of Christmas. Although Central Park is beautiful after a first snow and even the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center is perfect, there is something to watch a snowy field of trees and occasionally see deer, rabbits or other wild life. <br /> <br /> This is a great party movie that can also bring the Christmas spirit out of season, and is a great match with another Barbara Stanwyck Christmas movie, "Remember the Night", an underrated gem. Add the Christmas of "Meet John Doe" to the big city and you have found perhaps one of the most popular stars of holiday movies around.
