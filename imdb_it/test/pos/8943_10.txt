I think this film deserves a 10 out of 10 because it's hilarious and fun from beginning to end. The plot is simple and direct but keeps you looking and there are so many laughs that you really start to love it. When I went to see this movie I didn't know much and I didn't know what to expect. I thought it would be a kind of old ladies movie like Calendar Girls or something, but it took me completely by surprise. Even though I'm still a teenager and the film is probably not aimed at my age group, I found it excellent and I think people of all ages would like it. I think it's a shame that it's not at all famous and that you deserve more publicity so that more people will go see it and realize what is a great movie.
