Four adorable young nurses in their last year of nursing school experience all kinds of turmoil and excitement in their lives: sweet Susan (the lucky brunette Elaine Giftos) tries to comfort the bitter, terminally ill Greg (a moving performance by Darrell Larson ), eager, but the nebulous Phred (the beautiful blonde Karen Carlson) plays the brilliant gynecologist Jim Caspar (affable Lawrence Casey), Priscilla's hippie pricipata (the amazingly stunning Barbara Leigh) impregnated by the drug dealer Les (the solid Richard Rust and compassionate Lynn (well played by Brioni Farrell) helps the angry Mexican revolutionary Victor Charlie (the excellent Reni Santoni). Despite the fact that this film was made for the legendary exploitation outfit by Roger Corman, New World Pictures, it is anything but the usual irreverent piece of schering soft-core leering. Instead, it is a very pleasant, fascinating and often thoughtful time capsule of the social and political upheavals of the early 1970s (the subplot involving Lynn and the revolutionaries is particularly powerful and provocative). Special compliments are needed for director Stephanie Rothman, who brings a welcoming and refreshing sensibility and sensitivity to the material. Furthermore, the four attractive and attractive women all lead to doing a healthy and commendable job. Scottie MacGregor also impresses as Mrs. Boswell's wise supervisor and the ubiquitous' 70s trailer voice Ronald Gans provides the voice of a psychiatrist. The refined cinematography of Stevan Larner, the fantastic rock soundtrack and the hugely popular and amusing soundtrack of Clancy B. Grass III are all up to par. A real sleeper.
