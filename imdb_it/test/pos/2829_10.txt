And this is saying a lot. Rent this if you want to be baffled by the strangeness, swept away by one of the most bizarre scripts, by the direction and chronology of the films. I'm staggered. I can't believe I saw it. I'm a big fan of Bernadette Peters, normally - but this has put my determination to the test. Don't read more reviews here, it's better if you know nothing about the plot. Just rent it. You won't believe what you see .......
