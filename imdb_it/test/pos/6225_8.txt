Actually I had seen the last parts of this film when I was a child. Thanks to the texture search function I was able to find out the name. For years I did not know the name, but the film remained in my mind. The finale left hope that the main character would return to Earth at the end. It was a shame not to have done it to a series. This movie reminds me of Journey to the Far Side Of the Sun. Also known as Doppleganger. If you liked this feature, the other one is worth a watch. It was made before The Stranger, but shares a similar storyline. Yet different. I just picked up The Stranger from eBay on VHS. I hope they make a DVD, but it's doubtful if it doesn't come out on Dollar DVD. Some pilots are doing it on cheap DVDs and maybe this will.
