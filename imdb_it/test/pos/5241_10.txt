What a mistake for dialogues drawn and / or reject as archetypal characterizations accurately represents the way people spoke, lived and was before the Second World War, let alone in all the years that "The Big Trail" represents in the film . <br /> <br /> the film took my breath away the first time I saw it years ago. Reading the boards here helped me understand why he missed the box office and why film-goers benefited from Wayne in B Western for another ten years. Wayne was in my opinion better on "The Big Trail" and the years of Bs than most of his stars after 1939 with Ford's incredible cavalry trilogy, "True Grit" and "The Shootist" being Big exceptions time. <br /> <br /> What theater of shame we missed on this boat in 1930. If this film had hit, we could have enjoyed more movies with more realism and less hokum. In my opinion this is not only one of the best westerns ever filmed with an accurate dialogue and an accurate realization of the characters, but among the most beautiful representations of a song of any kind ever put on film. <br /> <br /> I still take my breath. Especially the dialogue and accurate characterizations of types that simply no longer exist. Some celebrate the superficial homogenization of our culture which actually hides the greatest cultural degradation (in "people like us" and "people like them") and political divisions (corporatists vs Main Streetists) in US history, but for me "The Big Trail" "represents a time when our surface differences were more obvious but underneath most people wanted to solve the nation's failures and most people aspired to build a great culture and a great nation . <br /> <br /> "The Big Trail" is an epic of the melting pot moving towards the American dream, certainly the best film about the path I've ever seen - that subject never shot.
