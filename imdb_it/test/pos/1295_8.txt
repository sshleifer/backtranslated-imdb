Having seen other Bollywood films with Salman Khan in them, I can say that this is my favorite among the most recent ones. The songs are all pretty funny, especially 'O Priya O Priya' which seems to have a nice mix of Beatles, Indian music and (I dare say this) a bit of Prince. Love stories are a little more believable than, say, Chal Mere Bhai. Prem's occasional attention to alcohol use is sometimes disturbing, as it seems to make no sense to me, but it sounded good to Khan - though his voice becomes squeaky when he draws back the drunkenness.
