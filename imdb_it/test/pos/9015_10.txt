I had the privilege of participating in a regional premiere for this, this is one of the most entertaining English films of all time, the plot is fantastic, focusing on a girl who involuntarily turns into her ideal man at a computer fair, also creating a copy of herself, who falls in love with him, the film is full of jokes, both visual and sound, and looks bright and fresh, and the acting is of great quality, released in the UK on 2 July this film is a must, go see it !!!
