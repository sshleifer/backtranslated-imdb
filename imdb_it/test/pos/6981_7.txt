The reasonably effective horror / science fiction at the "Alien" is quite well done given its limited ambitions. Some beautiful special effects and rhythmic action sequences adapt adequately to the cracks in the rather boring dialogue. When a spaceship crashes on a remote planet, the survivors soon realize that a horrible terror awaits them in the darkness of the next total eclipse.
