This has been an excellent film with good acting and keeps your attention until the end. Maybe people are either tired or uncomfortable with the topic and that's why it's ruining so much. It could also be too deep for many of the spectators out there who give films like the highest scores in the American Pie series. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal is a CIA analyst, not an agent, who must observe an interrogation of an Egyptian man by Moroccans, not Egyptians. It should not be a hardened agent and therefore it turns out to be naive of the interrogation techniques used. This is more credible than if it were to appear as an "old hat" inside. <br /> <br /> The story skips a bit and can be confusing, but it keeps you focused on what's going on until the end, when everything comes together when the puzzle falls into place. The supporting actors did a good job helping to bring the film. I found the film powerful and inspiring.
