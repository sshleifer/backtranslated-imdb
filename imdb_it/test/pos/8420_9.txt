Captured this movie on DD while browsing the channels ... And thank God, even this when it just started ... Having studied in Pune, this film has touched many happy memories of the city ... that apart from that one wonders why more films like this are not made ... Each character is so well engraved - the grandfather, the child, the doctor ... apart from the social worker who croaks a little, the rest of the film has almost no defect. .. a worthy voice for the Oscars, even if it was not named ... it certainly leaves a lump in the throat ... who if you need the mush to tickle your tears? And to think that this film needed Sachin Tendulkar to propagate it. Despite being in Marathi, there was hardly a time when I was unable to follow the film ... the subtitles were good .. Not to be missed for a fan of good cinema.
