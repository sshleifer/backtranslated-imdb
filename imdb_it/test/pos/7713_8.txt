The eighth, and therefore penultimate to the last of the Animatrix, is the only one quite similar. This takes two of the main types of inspiration for Matrix entertainment films, and combines them incredibly well. This is immensely faithful to the trilogy in that aspect, the tone. The animation is a wonderful and breathtaking Anim√©. The style, which is omnipresent in this, is Noir. The plot is right, and even the narration, like music, is apt. The sound in general is fantastic and really helps to solidify the atmosphere and atmosphere, along with the drawings and designs. Voice acting is flawless. This is one of the only two in which people also in the movies resume their roles, and both have Anne-Moss, who is the only one of them who appears in this. This is one of the best of the nine and also one of my personal favorites. This is about ten minutes. The pace is perfect. It never slows down a lot, but it's not overwhelming either. The ending could not have been more appropriate for this. This lasts for nine and a half minutes with Kid's Story, and is well done and informative. I highly recommend it to all the fans of the universe and to the two genres of which it is composed. 8/10
