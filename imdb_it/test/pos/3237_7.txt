I just saw it on BBC Channel 4. It's not the best Jane Austen novel, but the film is a reasonable interpretation. I suspect the Assembly Chambers in Bath would have been a little more crowded than shown; maybe they couldn't afford the extras. Also, why does everyone fall silent so that the dancing couple can have an audible conversation? I have never heard anything that anyone ever told me when I was dancing and I suspect it would have been the same in 18th / 19th century Bath. <br /> <br /> I can't believe the United States / Reviews in Canada; the ironic element in the film is completely missing. "Gothic" scenes are cleverly presented but need to be read correctly. I'm sure Jane A would be slightly amused by those reviews. A proposal of nothing, someone else thinks that Peter Firth looks more like Colin Baker (a former Doctor Who) or vice versa older people get both?
