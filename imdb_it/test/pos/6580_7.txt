The problem I have as a Finn is that most of the actors in this film are in every Finnish film. I have the feeling that Finland has only five actors. I think if you don't come from Finland you really like this movie as a refreshing novelty. <br /> <br /> This film is about a terrible chain of events that hits some people quite hard. Alcoholism, cold weather and darkness can all be clich√©s, but they are still very real in today's Finnish society. A lot of people in Finland suffer from depression, especially during the winter. <br /> <br /> The tone of the film is very melancholy. I liked it and Louhimes' direction was again very solid. I really enjoyed this movie, the only negative thing is that you see the same faces you've seen over and over again.
