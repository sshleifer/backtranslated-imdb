I saw all the doctor who reproduced episodes of my local PBS station during growth (he was introduced to the doctor by John Pertwee) and "cameras" of a doctor who was sent to the United States by fans from the UK to their US counterparts. I really enjoyed the show, but it never seemed to take me seriously - I mean seriously like a science fiction show about a time traveler. I went to the CONs, did a little costume (doctor # 5.6 and Tegan were my costumed characters), I loved it. then all stopped suddenly. political agenda and lack of interest and funding have turned the doctor into an old 25-year-old antiques that has moved into the ethos. <br /> <br /> when I learned that the science fiction channel had chosen the new doctor, my first thought was, "cool, now my 11-year-old son can see what I'm grumbling about all these years, and I know what the heck is a TARDIS "(I have several telephone booths and TARDIS of various sizes around the house) expect the excellent quality of the story, the character development and the f / x. I had to say the least - satisfied. for the first time, I found a doctor who was not a cheater, a clown, a flask, a trip-head, a pussy or a jerk. Christopher Eccleston is by far the most credible doctor to date. Now, now, calm down the bakers' fans! Don't get me wrong, I loved almost all the doctors and its quirks, but Christopher gave something to the doctor he had never had before - true credibility of words. I'm just sad that he decided against another season. I'll try David Tennant like I would any other doctor, but now the bar has risen ... <br /> <br /> rules of the big bad wolf !!!!! <br /> <br /> Update 2008 - I love David Tennant! his "mod" character is something that my generation remembers, my son's generation can deal with, and the fashion I can handle can relax! he's a little more human than Christopher, but he's not as humane as the other doctors. I miss the rose, I dug Martha, and what were they thinking with noble woman!?!? it's still the best race on TV
