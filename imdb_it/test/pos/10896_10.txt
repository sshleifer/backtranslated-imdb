Since I was allowed to play Goldeneye once again, it was impossible to distract me. I'm surprised I could have gone without it. It is, without doubt, one of the greatest games of all time. I've never played other shooting games, but I know this is above all the rules. Many people blame too much violence, but I find it ridiculous. There may be some graphic antics, but there's a lot worse out there. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, it's fun. With an impressive arsenal of weapons like the RC-P90 and the classic Golden Gun, you will have to pass several challenging levels of the film, complete crucial goals and defend swarms of guards. There are lots of fantastic tricks to get and also two secret levels that you will only gain if you have the real skill. Goldeneye is also one of the biggest multiplayer games ever. You can choose different characters from the movie, the evil classics of the old 007 movies (Baron Samedi, Oddjob, May Day and Jaws) and the game guards. It is likely that you and your partner are laughing so hard as you blow each other that you will look as if Bart and Lisa Simpson were watching an episode of the Itchy and Scratchy show. <br /> <br /> So if you don't have the game, don't rent it: just buy it. It's too good to be true. For interesting news on Goldeneye, visit Detstar.com's Goldeneye website. Every James Bond lover will dig this game great.
