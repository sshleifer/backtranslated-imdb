I loved this movie, the audience I was a part of loved this movie, and the 7-year-old girl who was with me loved this movie. We all laughed at word games, visual humor and the good feeling with which you left the cinema when it ended. I could easily understand why it was a big box office success in France. I'm thinking of buying the DVD, so I can see it again and laugh at all the pieces I lost while I was laughing so hard the first time.
