Simply a well made film, well written and wonderfully performed. Eastwood is the classic secret agent of the secret services Frank Horrigan and Rene Russo who holds the role of partner (and love interest) Lilly Raines. But the greatness of the film is on the shoulders of John Malkovich as "Booth". Capture the anger and hatred of this character, as well as his humanity strangely enough. <br /> <br /> I personally think that this was his best performance and he should have received an Oscar for this (But I also loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive that year). Overall, a fantastic movie to see that you want to peek into the mind of a murderer and be <br /> <br /> on the edge of your seat all the way. To enjoy!!
