I was so moved by this movie in 1981, I went back to the theater four times to see it again! Something I've never done for another movie. No film evokes the feeling of growing up in the 60s as Four Friends. That he is so close to my experiences in the 1960s is probably something that many will share. Jodi Thelen is incredibly beautiful and unforgettable! Because she didn't become a major star after this I'll never know. The acting of the entire cast is as flawless as Steve Tisch's script is. I always wanted to know how much of the story was autobiographical. But alas, Steve is no longer here to answer this question. I almost ran out of my VHS copy of this great movie! Highly recommended!
