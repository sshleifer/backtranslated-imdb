The fact that the reviewers feel very intensely negative about the show is an interesting fact all its own. If you don't like it so much, don't watch it. <br /> <br /> Some reviewers say that you have to be stupid, dull or just primitive to enjoy this show. Au contraire, my friends. I'm not saying that all competitors are smart. There are clever ones and there are stupid ones. But I'd say they probably have a higher average IQ than the average reviewer on this site. That's right, I said it. There is much to be said for the science of seductive girls. I'm sorry, but please take all the sticks out of your ass and realize why you hate these guys is that they threaten you. <br /> <br /> Those who ignore the social sciences and, more specifically, the science behind the mating is clearly going to lose the boat completely. <br /> <br /> One thing is clear: clubs are not the only places to meet girls. I personally think that deserving women don't even go to clubs, so they don't fall prey to men like the ones we see on the show. But what are men like these ???? In addition to those whose games stink, they are the epitome of men. They are men who meet women in the most difficult situations. These are the men who take possession of their sexuality. These men do not beg their girlfriends not to break up with them, and these men do not say "OK" to the phrase "we are just friends". <br /> <br /> Sounds familiar ???? Actually, these are the guys you're afraid of when you bring your special long-term girlfriend to the club. We are all. These guys know what women like. (again, only those who have "game") <br /> <br /> And even those who are bad ... are worth a laugh! <br /> <br /> If you went to a club and actually interacted with people around you, you should find this show fun. <br /> <br /> Look, I can't understand why there's so much hatred for this show. My best guess is that it aggravates insecurity in men who have had bad experiences in clubs, or threatens men who believe that women are wonderful creatures without ego who just want a good guy to buy their attention. <br /> <br /> I personally love this show. It's pure fun and, above all, it's REAL. It is a very insightful take on the most recent state of sexual psychology. Sexual roles have never been so different from before, and this show provides a very real view of it, I think it actually takes a bit of intelligence to take something positive out of this show. <br /> <br /> This show is aimed at a particular target market, and if you're out of this, I suppose you shouldn't tune in to the show. We could still say about other shows, can't we? <br /> <br /> Growing up, <br /> <br /> ApolloHelios
