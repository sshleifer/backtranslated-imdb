Italian work is a real explosion to watch. It's a really fun movie, something you only watch for fun. It is not heavy with drama or emotional torment, it has no cosmic statements about life, and it is not violent or profane. It's just a funny movie. Between watching the little Mini Coopers fly the crowded streets of Los Angeles and the great stories of a computer geek-turn-cro-stereotypical (cheerfully played by Seth Greene), I had a great time watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Special compliments for background music. They really have a masterful tone for such a film, so subtle but it keeps you on the edge when needed. Apparently many artists contributed to the music, I found it to be the most classic part of the film. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. It is not a film that inspires fear, but it is a great film to watch at the end of a shitty day in the office. <br /> <br /> Barky
