The philosophical and meditative tone of this film makes it unique. I'd give 10 stars for that alone. Having said that, however, what struck me with particular force was what I take, perhaps erroneously, to be his Art Direction. Many of the interior shots feature a rich blend of chromatic mixtures apparently based on very refined Munsell Color Model progressions and complementary juxtapositions. This makes the film probably unrealistic for contemporary eyes, but, for me, very beautiful as an aesthetic work in itself. I think this film is truly unique for this quality and, if nothing else, it gains a complete and careful digital restoration. Fox, are you listening?
