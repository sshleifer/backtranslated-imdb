probably the best horror film in 5 years .. there have been limping remakes, attempts to scare you (when they just make you go out of the theater) and movies that shouldn't be made. but this is worth it. the only reason I didn't give him a 10 is because Paris Hilton is in it (but the scene of his death makes up for it, believe me) .. <br /> <br /> so here I am .. the SPOILERS of all the death scenes in the movie .. <br /> <br /> 1. my favorite death scene ever - Paris Hilton! after finding her boyfriend Blake lying on the ground with a knife sticking out of his neck, Paige starts running. well, fast walking is more respectable. she finds this garage with all these machines. then (one of) the killers cut her ankle from below (all this time she is holding a huge metal picket) so she drops it and runs and hides behind this machine. the killer picks it up and as he looks through the window he throws it through the window and hits her across the forehead. I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO EXCESSED OR REDUCED SO DURING MY LIFE. <br /> <br /> 2. Paige's boyfriend, Blake, takes a knife in his neck and then the killer approaches him (while he's on the ground) and takes a step forward pushing him deeper into his throat .. then he dies. <br /> <br /> 3. Elisha Cuthbert (carly) (one of the hottest chicks EVER) doesn't die PHEW but she gets her lips super-glued together, punched her in the face, and cut off part of her index finger (yes, I felt like panting 4. Carly's twin brother Nick also survives, but not without getting his ass kicked and stabbed in the leg. <br /> <br /> 5. Nick Dalton's best friend is knocked down by a flight of stairs, and then he is beheaded, his body is dragged away and we see his eyes blink .. then he covers himself with wax. <br /> <br /> 6. wade (Carly's boyfriend) gets his Achilles tendon cut by a pair of huge scissors, and then it is attacked by the same scissors. It does not die, but is covered with wax, and on 2 occasions its skin is accidentally removed, revealing its bleeding flesh. YUMMY. <br /> <br /> .. so it is, definitely worth your money.
