Set in Paris in 1910, an old retired opera singer decides to give his fortune to his beautiful cat Duchess (voiced by Eva Gabor) and his kittens, but the jealous butler Edgar approaches with a plan while he kidnaps cats and leaves them in the countryside. Luckily for them, with the help of an independent and streetwise Tomcat named Thomas O'Malley (voiced by Phil Harris) he helps them get home especially by meeting some of his good friends like the swinging 'Scat Cat (voiced by Scatman Crothers) and try to wave Edgar's plans. <br /> <br /> Very fun and edgy post-Walt Disney animated death film with a couple of nice jazzy tunes like the memorable "Everyone wants to be a cat", good vocal acting and a terrific animation for his time even in these times of computer animation. Not one of Disney's biggest animated films, but one animated Disney cult bean and one of the few gems of its day that works well, highly recommended.
