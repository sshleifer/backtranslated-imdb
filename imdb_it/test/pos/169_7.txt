This movie is fantastic. The 80's slasher film about three children born during an eclipse, so they kill everyone they see. The reason they kill doesn't make sense, but just adds to the charm of this movie. And dang, these guys are crazy, especially Curtis. If you've seen the movie, you know who I'm talking about. That boy is slimy! Even if the film doesn't have much blood, it's fun and for some reason you worry about the characters. It also has beautiful nudity. It also has a decent acting, a decent movie from the 80s, it's worth a look if you have the chance to see it. You will have nightmares about those damn boys, I guarantee you!
