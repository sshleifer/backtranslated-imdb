Overall, I give this film a good 7.6. To begin with, I will say that I love how the character was portrayed and adapted to the screen. If you read comics from time to time or just watch DVD extras, you'll see that the Blade character is drastically different from what we see in the movie. Among the changes, Blade is now mainly half of the vampires, so he acquires "all their strengths, but none of their weaknesses". The credit goes obviously to David Goyer, a fan of the dark genre of comics. Thanks to him Blade has become a much more interesting character and I really find him one of my favorite anti-heroes. Wesley Snipes was born to play this role, although some would probably have played Dezenel Washington or Will Smith (lol). His acting here doesn't need to be exactly an Oscar winner to say considering the character, but I'm glad he decides to play the Day Walker in the two sequels. Stephen Dorff as our main villain and Kris Kristofferson as Blade's Alfred are also starring. The acting is good and the action definitely keeps the plot. The club opening scene is one of my favorite parts I have to say. As much as I like this movie, there are some things that annoy me and that take something like "Spider-Man" or "X-Men" from this movie standings. Stephen Norrington had the villains portrayed in a way that I didn't like so honestly. Their jokes were so full of dirty-mouth comedies that it didn't seem like a comic book to me. Furthermore, "La Magra" is a bit disappointing as the final villain, but the intense struggle with the sword makes up for it. Not to mention an extra sense of unrealism: a black man in a leather coat with a sword sticking out the # $% ^ of a policeman in a daylight, a bit like going unnoticed by the walking crowd seemed a little .. well. ..dumb. Moving away from some of his flaws, Mark Isham's music was great and he adapted the film well. Fortunately all these problems have been solved and improved in the extraordinary "Blade 2" sequel.
