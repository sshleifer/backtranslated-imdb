Wildman's chief advisor, Tripper Harrison (Bill Murray in sinuous dress in his first starring role) presides over the wacky balls at the North Star expansion. Tripper befriends Rudy, a sad and lonely maladjusted boy (a beautiful and touching performance by Chris Makepeace). Director Ivan Reitman tells the amusing comic strips at an incessant and lively pace and maintains a pleasantly good-natured tone. This film cleverly reveals the lively summer atmosphere of summer: making friends, falling in love, playing pranks, competing in a rival camp, singing with campfires and, of course, the inevitable frightening urban legend of the psychopathic escapade with the hook hand . The sense of cheerful and cheerful fun that this image generates is positively contagious. Furthermore, humor is always stupid and occasionally coarse, but never too bad or mean. Best of all, there is a winning surplus of pure heart that goes along with the aforementioned humor (the warm relationship between Tripper and Rudy in particular is genuinely moving). The cast has an obvious ball that plays their cute characters: Murray's glorious gonzo and galvanization presence keeps things buzzing constantly (his crazy PA ads are utterly broken), plus there are healthy contributions from Harvey Atkin as the unfortunate owner of the field Morty, Kate Lynch in the role of Tripper the old flame Roxanne, Russ Banham as the amiable Crockett, Kristine DeBell as the sweet, foxy AL, Sarah Torgov as the exuberant Candace, Jack Blum as the bespectacled nerd Spaz, Keith Knight like the tubby slob Larry Finkelstein, Cindy Girling like the flashy Wendy, and Matt Craven as Hard Hardware. Donald Wilder's cinematography gives the film an attractive solar appearance and makes elegant use of wipes. Elmer Bernstein's lively and melodic soundtrack also does the same. A real riot.
