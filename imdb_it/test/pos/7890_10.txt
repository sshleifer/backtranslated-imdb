I voted only excellently because this film took two snapshots of Americana: one in 1970 and one for each subsequent year. <br /> <br /> Nothing has really changed. <br /> <br /> Joe is actually an idiot, a big stupid idiot who is angry with everyone else in the world for his own idiocy. This is not really a spoiler, but the key to the film is the big, "never wrong" guy who makes friends with this semi-troglodyte Joe, and gets some sort of ... validation from his bigotry and his stupidity sense of being offended. <br /> <br /> However, few claim that the merchant's boyfriend deserved to die. And those kids shouldn't have taken Joe and Compton out. And Joe and Compton were actually getting into hashish and young skin until they were robbed. A simple film in many ways, except that in 1970 New York City was in a battle zone thanks to Nixon's care and all the money destined for the war in Vietnam. As I write this (2/25/2007) there is a "very long wait" on Netflix for this film - which makes me happy because I think there are people who want to learn. This was a good snapshot - not exact, a bit caricaturist - but actually very similar to what it was then. And the scary thing is that things haven't changed much. Of course, there is no longer any welfare, but this only means that wage slavery has won. <br /> <br /> Amazing how millionaires will complain about not earning enough, so they complain that $ 5.15 an hour is too much to pay their people.
