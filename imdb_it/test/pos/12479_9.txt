Great artists, they always suffered while they were young. I could mention Mozart and Beethoven, but that's not the point. <br /> <br /> This film was made by HG Clouzot whose family wanted him to succeed in the legal professions. <br /> <br /> Its main protagonist is Louis Jouvet who studied and practiced as a pharmacist before becoming "The Greatest Actor" and also director of France's Theater before and after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Both have had health problems. Clouzot had TB as a young man, Jouvet had heart problems and died in a theater. <br /> <br /> Such events shape the character of men (and women, of course). It could also be said that today's artists are so poor, because they have never suffered and fought for their lives. <br /> <br /> For me, this is the biggest of Clouzot's films. "Wages of Fear" is greater in "suspense", "Diabolique" also has more "suspense" and a better storyline and is more about "female evil". <br /> <br /> Quai des Orf√®vres is more human. Clouzot was falsely accused by De Gaulle's entourage (mostly communists and Jews) of collaboration with the Nazis and forbidden to make films until De Gaulle left the French government in early 1946. De Gaulle returned in 1958, as President. <br /> <br /> The main characters are all good souls: Jenny Amour can perform as "putain" on stage, but she is not a "whore" (the synonyms make the synonyms of those words, but they are not the same thing), he loves his husband, and refuses the slight "advance" from his friend (presumably a lesbian) Dora, the photographer. <br /> <br /> Maurice the husband is jealous and shy, but runs away from the crime scene. coward because he fell in love with a woman and eventually exchanged a more refined career for love .. <br /> <br /> Antoine, the detective (played by the great Louis Jouvet, practically a theater actor, plays in this French "Gray" not Noir, as well as EG Robinson in "Double Indemnity" shows the talent for pseudo-criminals, tenderness for a negro son (?), And compassion for the true author of the crime, because he remembers that the father has cleaned the latrines in a castle of a nobleman !! <br /> <br /> Clouzot was able to slap the face of an actor by order to put him in the right frame of mind, but deep down he was very human. <br /> <br /> I have his horoscope in front of me. He had Venus in Sagittarius which means generosity, devotion, charity and altruism. For those who do not believe in astrology, my sincerest apologies ...
