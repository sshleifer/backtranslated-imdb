Writing about something so wonderful is completely difficult. In fact, it is almost impossible to describe the peculiarities of this film. This is a wonderful story about sex and sex, and it's almost unbelievable that we're not dealing with obscene sex scenes. Feeling, this film was created for people who love to feel and simply experience life in all its complexity in a simple and wonderful way. We look at it and something starts to grow inside our minds, even our hearts: it is a pure poem. I've seen some "gay" movies and I'm almost always dissatisfied with unnecessary sex scenes, not because I don't like sex scenes, but in general they are so pornographic that I have to think that the director or producers or writer of the script think that homosexuality means perversion. Nagisa no Shindobaddo is totally different from those. There are three main characters. We have Ito, Yoshida and Aihara, two boys and a girl in a particular love triangle. Ito likes his best friend Yoshida, Yoshida likes Aihara and Aihara likes Ito. Imagine what could turn into unprepared hands? But on the contrary, Hashiguchi creates a magnificent story that deeply enters the philosophy of life, adding a question in our mind that made me think, astonished, at the end of the film: Why? And this because I expanded into more questions within my brain and inside my heart. The scenes, in reality, sometimes tend to be boring, they are moments of the most delightful poem we are able to experience, but totally unable to write in words. And perhaps because of this, we are unable to understand the question at the end of the film. I'm sure this movie was not made for us to discuss every piece of it ?? Some people want to understand a film almost by dissecting it. Others are so used to common "American gay" films that they cannot appreciate the real value of this masterpiece. Look at it, close your eyes in the end credits and listen, everything, feel yourself, feel the wonderful song. For all this and much, much more, I give a nine. And I don't give a ten, because ten out of ten is perfection. But I confess I almost did it.
