The Consequences of Love (2004) is a beautifully crafted film that takes small steps carefully positioned towards its ending that must be enjoyed to be enjoyed. From the contrasting landscapes, to the tightly closed world that the hero lives in, we are taken by the Director and controlled from the moment we enter the hotel. We, like the hero, will never escape the stifling intensity and paradoxical monotony of his criminal mafia world. That the film resists the stereotypes of the mafia while having fun, makes it even more successful. The concrete tomb, the inevitable brutal executions and the overwhelming masculinity are laid bare and exposed for what they are. Only brutality and business, and no more. Life is part of the corporate machine that is organized crime and not love or life for oneself, family or others. Our hero is really a hero as he renounces his life for the touch of the beautiful barista, the resolution of the misery suffered by his only neighbors in the hotel and to escape his decorative prison. The consequences of love are really beautiful and brutal at the same time. Watch it!!
