I have to admit, I didn't expect it to be so good. Also, I didn't expect Samuel L. Jackson to play slides and sing in blue. <br /> <br /> Cinemark of Beaver County PA does it often. They advertise movies in the lobby, they excite you to see it, and then they disappoint you by not showing it ... <br /> <br /> I expected that with such an exceptional cast of Jackson and Ricci and even a former N'Syncer Timberlake), which this film would have at least shown for a week. But indeed, at that moment, if I remember correctly, MI3 was showing on 3 screens (that or some other type of presumed success). <br /> <br /> Like Blues Brothers and Crossroads, this film incorporates the mystic and legend of what blues music is all about. Passion and difficult times. Religion and sex. Hell Hounds of the past. Redemption. I mean that so many elements enter the blues to make it work. <br /> <br /> This was just a good all-round story. Of course, not many people will see it because it has no pirates or swinging spiders. But he has Samuel L. Jackson ... <br /> <br /> Think about what happens to the character of Jacksons of Pulp Fiction after he walks on the earth and settles down and essentially describes it as a "T". /> <br /> Large and undervalued, but are they not so beautiful?
