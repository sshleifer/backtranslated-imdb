Almost 50 years have passed since I saw "Jennifer" for the first and only time. I didn't know the name of this film until I searched on this website, but I told many people (especially my grandchildren) how the movies should not include graphic details to scare you and leave a strong impact. The story cleverly introduces you into concepts that, if true, put Ida Lupino in a very dangerous situation. Every time Miss Lupino discovers a new "fact", she attracts the viewer in her confusion and fear. <br /> <br /> This film has such an impact on me that almost 50 years later I list it again as one of the most terrifying films I've ever seen. Yet this film does not contain blood and blood that became popular shortly after the making of this film. The impact that a good story and great actors can have is incredible.
