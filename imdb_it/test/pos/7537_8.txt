As funny as the English comedy of the 1950s, THE BELLES OF ST TRINIAN'S almost has a gag in the minute ... and in the 91st minute it's a fantastic moment. Other films that I also recommend in the same period are THE TITFIELD THUNDERBOLT and THE GREEN MAN. In fact any film with Alistair Sim or Terry Thomas, George Cole, Richard Wattis or Joyce Grenfell or any combination is a delight. in ST TRINIAN'S we get a double dose of Sims who plays two roles with that hilarious contempt that constantly lets her face ripple. Joyce Grenfell as Ruby Gates (oh dear! That name!) He plays his "cheerful hockey cop" incognito in exhilarating perfection. Probably the best laughs come from George Cole in the role of Flash Harry (who comes out of a bush when he whistled) and various visits to classrooms by Mrs. Fritton (Sims) who react to the explosions ("Oh poor Betty!") Or to production gin of scientific laboratory ("send a few bottles of that to my room"). Every part of the film is fun for the characters, their costumes, the antics and the setting. There were sequels but the first three are the best: including this one, BLUE MURDER IN ST TRINIAN'S and later in color THE GRAN TRINIAN'S TRAIN ROBBERY.
