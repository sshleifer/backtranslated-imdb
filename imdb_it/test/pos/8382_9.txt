Brad Pitt sticks his index finger in Diane Kruger's leg wound and holds it there until he gets what he wants. Funny, horribly. The invented yarn takes "The Dirty Dozen" for a ride and sometimes abandons it to pay tribute to other films. Very funny. "Paris when sizzles" is also mentioned in a delightful organic dialogue. I was thrilled by the character of Christoph Waltzer and his sensational performance. Brad Pitt creates a true original. I love the actor's lack of vanity. There is an oddity in the character that is pure Brad Pitt. Tarantino visits a new universe but. fortunately, his hand. his brain and his heart are visible everywhere.
