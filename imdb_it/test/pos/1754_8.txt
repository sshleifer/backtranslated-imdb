What I liked most about this 1941 animated feature is the great feeling it gives in the early 1940s. They are the songs, the clothes, the cars, the buildings, the jargon of the day, etc. You feel like you've gone back in time. <br /> <br /> Reading some of the reviews here, I see that this was a tough -luck movie, released a couple of days before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Wow, no one would be interested in going to the movies for a feature film during those shocking and eventful days, I'm sure. Too bad, because people lost a good animation, they would have been really impressed then, almost 70 years ago. The colors are beautiful, the designs are beautiful and the plot involves while we cheer for insects led by "Hoppity" and his beautiful girl "Honey" to do it happily and always out of danger. It also concerns all of them who find a grassy place where they can live and don't care about the humans that trample them. <br /> <br /> There is an evil villain, though - "C. Beetle Beetle" - and two of his henchmen. These helpers ("Swat, The Fly" and "Smack, the Mosquito") are comical, complete with their Brooklyn accents! The story is familiar when an old villain wants to marry the sweet girl and uses unscrupulous means to force his hand. The good guy, meanwhile, has the cloak stacked against him but eventually, of course, prevails. <br /> <br /> My favorite part - this will sound worse than it was - was when good boy "Hoppity" was electrocuted and danced in black and white. It was a fantastic animation! <br /> <br /> You know, it's a good thing that I didn't see it as a very small child; I was afraid to play outside and crush all those nice people! You never know what (or who) is in that grass under your feet!
