This is a simple episode so far after seeing all the episodes of Season 11 (with the exception of the Imaginationland trilogy) this is what made me laugh the most, it's definitely my favorite so far of Season 11. So basically Cartman sees at a toy store a child who has Tourette syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman. You can imagine, now Cartman has Tourette syndrome and it's great since Kyle, once he knows it's like "he's faking". Cartman is certainly on fire, saying whatever he wants to the teachers, the headmaster, anyone. On the other hand we have Kyle who is now intolerant, basically for saying that Cartman was pretending to have been led to meet children with Tourette's syndrome just to make him understand that Tourette's syndrome is real and it's fantastic since Kyle is like "well" maybe someone is pretending to have Tourette for fun, "in short Kyle couldn't explain that Cartman was pretending. Probably my favorite scene of this episode is when Cartman is with Kyle's family, but right after this scene another one Pinman child who is simply pretending, the guy with Tourette who was at the toy store, Cartman basically told that guy this: "Isn't he have fantastic Tourette." But to say what he wants and be a brave boy for everyone is just the beginning for Cartman, his main plan: to go on TV to say everything he wants ("people will call it brilliant TV, I will probably give it an Em my "- fantastic, in this episode the word" s *** "is used 26 times and certainly not all, South Park won an Emmy about a month before the broadcast of this episode). But here is a turning point, Cartman has virtually removed all the bricks of the wall, he now says everything without thinking, so we heard from Cartman that he wet his bed last night, now it's not fun for Cartman and he's like "Not I can control what I say "and surely the person who was with him is like" well, of course you can't control what you say, you have Tourette's "so Cartman is like" my Tourette got worse, before I just threw things out interesting about the Jews who are lame and stuff, but now they have become really bad ". There are also things about Chris Hansen and To Catch a Predator, actually what happened with a pervert here happens with many more perverts, Kyle and Thomas were behind to stop Cartman, Kyle ends up being Cartman's savior! Fantastic! <br /> <br /> VOICES YOUR VOICE On "South Park" 3rd episode of October <br /> <br /> Wednesday 3 October, the cable network Comedy Central will air an episode of the animated series "South" Park "in which one of the young characters, Cartman," obtains "Tourette syndrome. Given the nature of this program, we expect it to be offensive and insensitive to people with TS and collect numerous calls and emails from our members and from TS community. <br /> <br /> We have already taken some pre-emptive strikes, such as the request for Comedy Central to broadcast our public service announcement (with comedian Richard Lewis) during or after the show. , once the episode is broadcast and we will be able to see exactly how TS is interpreted, we will be able to respond with specific problems and problems we have with the show to the writers. <br /> <br /> "We are in actually surprisingly, the creators took so long au use TS as a comedy fodder in this program, since no disability, disease or controversial topic is off limits to them, "said Judit Ungar, President, TSA. <br /> <br /> "We always see portraits of TS (good and bad) as an opportunity for awareness and education, and a show of this magnitude and popularity is certainly no exception and provides a way for the TSA to spread factual information on the disorder, "said Tracy Colletti-Flynn, Head of Public Relations and Communication, TSA. <br /> <br /> We will publish an official statement on this site with TSA's reaction to the program after the air show. <br /> <br /> TSA RESPONDS to the episode "South Park" <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as happened with too many peop media portraits with the Tourette Syndrome (TS), the opening of the season of South Park ("Le Petit Tourette", 10-3-07) served to perpetuate even more the absolute myth that most people with TS have involuntary explosions of vulgar language. In fact, 85-90% of people with TS have never experienced this tragically socially stigmatizing symptom (called coprolalia). For viewers who are less familiar with the symptoms of this neurological disorder, couldn't the misleading message be taken clearer? unless you damn yourself, you don't have TS. <br /> <br /> Despite our previous trepidations, we admit that the episode was surprisingly well studied. Despite the exaggerated emphasis on coprolalia, for the attentive spectator, there was a surprising amount of accurate information transmitted. The written contribution of parents, a neurologist, colleagues and the therapy session with the "TS child support group" were all smart tools to provide this data to the public. "Undoubtedly this episode of South Park has generated more national awareness of TS. However, we are very concerned that children in schools with TS are being mocked and even bullied by insensitive colleagues who may have seen the program, "said Judit Ungar, President of the TSA. "We realize that for over a decade satirical parodies of writers have not spared any group of celebrities, disabled or politicians. The fact that TS was the subject of a popular television program attests to the fact that the public is much more aware of the disorder Obviously, this greater awareness that we have worked too hard to achieve can sometimes prove to be a double-edged sword ". <br /> <br /> TSA contacted the program managers before airing and we will be in touch with them again. Perhaps we will be able to turn this into an opportunity for positive TS awareness.
