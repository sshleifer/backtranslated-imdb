This is one of my favorite movies of all time, if you're not in the car then forget it !! This film features 1 of Australia's biggest muscle cars, the XYGTHO. Yes, acting is not the best - it was never done to win an Oscar. The action of the machine will make you come back for more and more. There's a nice collection of 70s muscle cars and an Awesome '57 Chev - with a real fashionable cat! Also there is a really fantastic song sung by Terry Serio, the main actor. Acting is pretty fun if taken lightly, but the smokin and drag racing tire is the main focus of this movie. Big fast cars with a large number of steel (NO PLASTIC CARS), and a long way to go. I recommend it only to people who are in the car and not to someone looking for exceptional acting.
