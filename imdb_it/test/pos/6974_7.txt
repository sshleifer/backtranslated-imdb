Francis Ford Coppola has written and directed this incredibly personal story of the escape of a married woman from her husband - and the reality that perhaps the jovial joy and excitement of her younger years are behind her. We learn little about the marriage of this woman, except that she felt her independence vanish like in recent times; she has also recently learned that she is pregnant, which has further complicated her heart (she does not want to be a smug companion, despite the maternal way in which she speaks by telephone on the phone). He meets two men on his journey: a former college hero who - after an accident during a game - was left with permanent brain damage, and a sexy and stiff cop who has a lot of trouble in his life. Clear and clean landscapes (as photographed by the talented Wilmer Butler) are cleverly crafted, as are the characters. Shirley Knight, James Caan and Robert Duvall offer strong and compelling performances, especially since they are not very nice people in conventional terms. Some scenes (like Knight's first call from a phone booth, or his first night alone with Caan where they play "Simon Says") are almost too intimate to watch. Coppola plays with reality, transforming the jagged memories of his characters into scrapbooks to which we have been made public. It allows the scenes to play, but the editing is quite agile and the film is never allowed to become too heavy (there are at least two or three very vivid moments). It is an intoxicating enterprise, so much so that the image was still shown at parties almost five years later. Some might avoid Coppola's catchphrase of events to emphasize the ending with bitter irony, yet the strength and thrust behind the picture almost wipes out its flaws. *** from ****
