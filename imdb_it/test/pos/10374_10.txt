Aunt Cora had always been tactless, and her well-mannered family ignored the remark she made after her brother Richard's funeral: "He was murdered, wasn't he?" They remembered it the next day, when Cora was found brutally murdered with a hatchet ... <br /> <br /> For some reason, POIROT films this year were far from faithful to the book original. I was disappointed by the changes made to CARDS ON THE TABLE, my favorite book by Poirot. AFTER THE FUNERAL it is my second favorite Poirot book, and I was afraid the story would be destroyed. It was not! The film was almost faithful from page to page, up to the killer's motive! All the actors were wonderful, but my favorite is Monica Dolan, who gives a great performance as Miss Gilchrist, the companion of Aunt Cora. Without a doubt the best Poirot film of all time!
