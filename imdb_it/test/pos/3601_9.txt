This film gives us some history of the Second World War along with some moving love stories, a bit of fantasy and significant emotions - and a beautiful setting. We never miss Nicholas Cage, and he does a great job here too. And so do the other main characters. A key character, the doctor / father played by John Hurd, delivers (to his daughter) one of the best definitions of love I have ever heard. Some of the events are a bit too casual to be true, but I excused it, knowing that this is partly fairy tale and fantasy. My wife and I really liked the movie. And it's nice to see people take the risk of loving the enemy. A man who left the theater near us told his wife: "Now this is the way to make war!" I think you will see what he means when you look at the Italian occupants of this delightful Greek island.
