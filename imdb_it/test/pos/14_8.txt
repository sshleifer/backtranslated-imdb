I attended a preliminary screening of this film, not sure what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher; both delivered less memorable performances and films. Although the underlying "general" plot is somewhat familiar, this film was excellent. Both Costner and Kutcher offered powerful performances playing very well with one another. The frailties and human strengths of their respective characters have been incredibly interpreted by both; the scene in which Costner confronts Kutcher with the personal reasons why Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue elite was the most unforgettable emotional moment in the film. The "specific" plot was an upbringing in itself that represented personal sacrifice and required physical training that elite Coast Guard rescuers have to face in preparation for their only job and responsibility ... to save lives at sea. The special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and "wowing" ... I didn't see so angry seas from "The Perfect Storm". Co-star Clancy Brown (the "Carnivale" of HBO - it's nice to see him again) played the role of captain of the Kodiak of the Coast Guard, based in Alaska, in a strong and convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and water ice in his veins. The film wonderfully and finally gives long exposure and respect for the Coast Guard; in the end the audience applauded.
