Watching this movie caused a rather emotional reaction. This is what today's documentaries are all about. It is refreshing to look at something so personal, honest and real. Mr. Block's thoughts, opinions and disclosure are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here. It is a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. This film treads very carefully and successfully. <br /> <br /> One might think that learning how an apparently normal couple does not live up to the expectations of society would have given rise to pessimism ... but it is not. On the contrary: it made me feel good. I feel I know more about marriage now ... about women. <br /> <br /> Definitely check this, it will make you think - exactly what a good documentary should be designed to do.
