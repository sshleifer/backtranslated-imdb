The first thing you see in this film is a static angle (which will be repeated later in the film), which describes the chaos in place (not seen by the public) in a studio that broadcasts news. Shortly thereafter, the typical Fonda character story is shown at the same angle. Don't be fooled by this; the film is not about a woman journalist, a woman struggling to succeed in a profession dominated by men. This is simply a lead-in, a way to start the movie (although it is used later). The actual point of this production is gradually revealed, and the first one we see is in a deliberately long scene at the beginning. The whole film has that rhythm; not slow or pulled out, but deliberate. It's never really fast, even in the few sequences you would normally expect to be like this. This rhythm (especially because it seems to slow down further as the plot is revealed, while the disturbing and disturbing nature of the film is revealed) is strong, almost painful for the viewer. It inspires you, if it were possible, to jump on the screen, grab the people responsible for the collar and shout to them * do * something about it, to remedy the situation. Never once did I feel like getting up or even taking my eyes off the screen for a moment. The subject is extremely important to be aware of, and is managed perfectly here. No excessive dramatization (well ... very little, anyway), just an accurate presentation of the problem. The direction is staggering. The empathy you feel for the character of Lemmon is profound. Editing is masterly ... a near scene finally illustrates it perfectly. The publisher, judging by his filmography, is very underrated. The writing was excellent. The acting was great, in particular by Lemmon, Fonda and Douglas (who also produced it). The lack of a score is perfect; no music is needed to improve. The finish is sublime and effective. The film has some negative points ... among these, some of the dialogues are obviously and undeniably primarily an exhibition, a part of the film, although dramatic, seems not to mesh with something that follows it. Not everyone will watch the film due to two features that are commonly (and rightly so) attributed to bad movies; the rhythm (which can be mistaken for slow) and the (lack of) score. It could be argued that this is a bad thing, since everyone should consider the points he presents, but perhaps it is better this way; manage the heavy subject with intelligence and respect (both for the topic and for the viewer) ... something like that, maybe it shouldn't be fed with a spoon. I was mesmerized by the film and was very surprised. I recommend it to anyone who thinks they are strong enough to handle it. 9/10
