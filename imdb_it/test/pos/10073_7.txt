So, Madonna is not Meryl Streep. Still, this is one of his first films and a comedy about it. Give it a break! Of course, the film is mediocre and pales in comparison to its previous counterpart with Katherine Hepburn, Bringing Up Baby. For what it is, though (a bit of hair), it's a little fun to watch. I have yet to hear anyone who jolts Madonna's acting skills with tests or even adjectives other than "terrible", "bad" or other words so vague and descriptive. If you want to see bad acting or justify the argument that singers should stick to singing, how about Whitney Houston? She had the most undeserved commercial success of any actress in history and was unable to get out of a hatbox. The American public, of course, cannot discern the difference between a credible performance in a film and a star power. I think Madonna has always been at least credible in her films. Get real people. The baptism of Madonna is so 90s.
