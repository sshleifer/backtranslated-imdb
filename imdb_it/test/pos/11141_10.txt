I loved this movie because Bobbie Phillips can REALLY FIGHT! I always hate when actors are not credible in the action parts. It was nice to see, without offense, but a WOMAN who can skillfully perform martial arts and fights. If you compare this with most action movies with females, surely you will see what I mean. They don't have to cut the blows with someone who can fight and runs better. I was very impressed. I hope there's more!
