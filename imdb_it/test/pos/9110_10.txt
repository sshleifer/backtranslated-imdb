This film oscillates ... so much ... <br /> <br /> Cameos ... references to drugs ... sharing ... love ... ROCKING !!! When Jack and Kyle first met in Tim Robbins '"Actors' Gang" theater company, who knew that such an impressive legacy of music and exhilaration would follow? All that door-to-door swinging has paid off ... <br /> <br /> Although anyone who loves classic rock will get a big hit from this movie, I'll advise you to rent the original 6 HBO episodes in the your local video store before going to see the movie at the cinema. I'm on the DVD of Tenacious D Masterworks, available for rent in almost all video stores. There are some jokes in the film that refer to these previous episodes that will add something more pleasant to the overall visual experience ...
