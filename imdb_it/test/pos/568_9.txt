I just watched the movie, via Netflix. I was intrigued by the way the film was described, but in the end it was better. I was moved to many different directions while watching this movie. I was filled with pain, hatred, anger, bitterness, pain and finally relief. Looking at the accused young man would break your heart and convince you that they had the wrong person. Police complacency makes you want to, because just as the Rodney King Beating brought to light, police brutality, this film brings out the total lack of moral fiber in these police forces. And the fact that they beat this guy, and they left, just makes you more angry. <br /> <br /> But, I have to tell you, I fell in love with the lawyer, Mc Guinness. One of my favorite jokes when he was telling us it was a real police hole ... The cop told him to keep sucking that cancer bar. Mc Guinness told the cop ... "I always have a cigarette before sex ..." I was letting him know I was going to cheat him "<br /> <br /> I have a new respect for some of the laws in this country.
