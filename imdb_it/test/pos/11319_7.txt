I lived in London most of my adult life before moving to the United States, so I lost this movie when it came out and only saw it on HBO now. I disagree with those who think that this should have been a Hollywood production, the UK team gave a compelling and disturbing atmosphere from day one and I was on the edge of my seat for the last 30 minutes wondering what it would be success at my home town. And of course, nine months after the movie came out, 7/7 happens. Yes, the truth is stranger than fiction. Having lived in both countries, it is also clear that the likelihood of this happening in the UK is much greater than in the United States, Muslims live in ghettos and isolate themselves in the United Kingdom, in the United States they assimilate much more easily.
