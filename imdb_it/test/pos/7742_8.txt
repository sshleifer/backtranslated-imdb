I can't say what the source of this film adds, but this is one of my favorite films by Paul Mazursky (director and co-author). This is a revival of Shakespeare's "comedy", but completely removed from the stage. Without much text, Mazursky and the star Cassavettes make visual a mid-life crisis of passion and purpose. In a desperate attempt to refocus itself, Cassavettes retires to a remote Greek island, where the locals and the island itself weave some magic. With Raul Julia in particular, Susan Sarandon and Molly Ringwald, this is an emotionally satisfying and visually stunning adult fantasy. It is funny. It wasn't a huge box office success, but every time it comes to DVD, it will sell it.
