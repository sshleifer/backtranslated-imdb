Do you like explosions? What about fighting? Well, this movie has both. You know the other thing you can't do without a movie: an ass bike, the type that bounces on someone's head and hits them at the same time. Bet the stabilizer has one. There is also a classic cliff scene. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'm proud enough to have seen this movie ... and even more proud to have my review as the first ... YES!
