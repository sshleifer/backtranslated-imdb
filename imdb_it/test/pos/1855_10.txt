Return to Me is a movie you will want to own. It is a story of inspiration and family love that appeals to all ages. The story, although apparently impossible, aspires to divine intervention when a man loses his wife in a tragic accident and finds that love again in the woman who receives his wife's heart. David Duchovny and Minnie Driver offer warm performances like the designated lovers who meet by chance. But the real story resides in friends and in the family that surrounds them, who loves them and supports them in times of trial. Carol O'Connor, the grandfather of Minnie Driver, is authentic in every scene. Bonnie Hunt as the friend whose ingenuity and encouragement emphasizes Minnie as a "sister" is fun but hot in the scenes, especially with James Belushi as her husband. Classic scenes and scripts make this story so pleasant and moving to look at infinity. Thank you for making a film that demonstrates families and friends as people in close contact who love each other through difficult times.
