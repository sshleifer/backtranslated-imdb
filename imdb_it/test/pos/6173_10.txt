A good film, skillfully filmed with an eye to the details of the war era and (considering that it is set during the Second World War) minimal violence. <br /> <br /> A small cast weaves an emotional journey through the occupation of Czechoslovakia, separation from loved ones as pilots leave for England (separation from the spaniel will touch hearts), spitfire scenes, love, friendship and betrayal. The theme of betrayal flows deep within the film, from the betrayal of love, to the betrayal of friendship, and finally the betrayal shown by the communist regime to the former RAF pilots after the war. <br /> <br /> A desperately sad film, all the more because it is so precise I would recommend it to everyone.
