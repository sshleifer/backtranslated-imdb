I must say that this is one of the best films I've seen so far for Naruto. the action was much better than the first film because it had a much higher fighting scene and was held at a faster pace. it was great, the choreography was excellent as was most of the visual effects. <br /> <br /> the plot is something new in Naruto. but it's basically the same as the first movie. in the series you see them fighting against other ninjas, but in the movies (1 + 2) you see them fighting against the machine of mass destruction. it's nice to see them fight against something other than ninja, and that it was nice to see another power other than the chakra. and how other people from other lands fight across the ocean. even sakura eventually killed someone who is stronger than her. (she really became strong) it was much better than the fillers in the series I'm looking at now. when you watch this movie, the fast action scene will surely beat your heart. With the new jutsus and garra in the movie, you know it's good. and the music was good too, but I find something missing. But the ending was a plus. (dind dong dang) I think it was a really nice song. I absolutely recommend it. <br /> <br /> all in all, I give this film a 10, because I love it. if you decide to watch it, have fun. lol
