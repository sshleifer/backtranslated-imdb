Many have denigrated Never Say Never Again because it's not an official James Bond movie. However, it is clear that the producers have adhered to Bond's fruitful formula. Although the film does not have a pre-credit sequence, it is clear that the training exercise at the beginning of the film is meant to be the introductory scene. It would have been impossible for EON to prevent manufacturers from including a sequence of pre-credit and securities, even without the introduction of the barrel. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is in excellent shape as an immortal secret agent and this film is certainly better than dr. No, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice and Diamonds Are Forever. Although NSNA is thought to be a Thunderball remake, it's a big improvement. 007 spends more time on land and a more diverse range of exotic locations is included in the film. <br /> <br /> There is a certain resounding acting in this film. Barbara Carrera is as flawless as the bizarre Fatima Blush. One of the best scenes in the film is the coup de grace between Bond and Fatima in Nice, preceded by a dynamic motorcycle chase through the city. Klaus Maria Brandauer plays the psychotic Largo and Max Von Sydow is free from the melodrama that the other actors portraying Blofeld have indulging. <br /> <br /> NSNA tends to focus on Connery rather than the Bond character. At the beginning it is stated that Bond is aging and is out of action. This seems to refer to the 12-year break in Connery's portrait of Bond. Bond promises "never again" to work in the secret service; an allusion to Connery's portrait of Bond. It seems that the producers were trying to damage the official Bond franchise. <br /> <br /> However, it is definitely worth watching this movie. This is the last time Sean Connery plays James Bond, but his interpretation has convinced me that maybe he should never have said "never again".
