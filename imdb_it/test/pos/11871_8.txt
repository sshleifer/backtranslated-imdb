This film will never be included in a list of the 50 best films of all time, but if you're compiling a list of "funny movies", this is not a bad place to start. Liv Tyler is incredible, engaging and sensual, and everyone else died for their parts. It is a 21st century counterpart of "Tom Jones" - in other words; just good fun, obscene. I think this could be Tyler's revolutionary film on its way to celebrity. Without nudity she exudes sex in this film. No wonder all the kids give her toys. How could they help him, but do it for an innocent, as innocent as Gio Job?
