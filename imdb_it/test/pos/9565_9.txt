I saw this movie with an open mind, not knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this film was written, directed and acted in such a way that every minute of it is a delightful watch. People don't seem as if they were acting, more like they were real people who actually train dogs and lead lives portrayed in this movie. There are some wonderful moments when you laugh or chuckle, some jokes can be dry but presented in a very visible way. Highly recommended!
