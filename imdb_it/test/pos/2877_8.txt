So the WWE did it. They went to the cinema: their first is See No Evil, with their own Kane. I took this movie and I didn't expect it to be a great movie ... It just looked like clich√©s and looked nothing new. To my surprise, it really wasn't bad at all. A spectator has stated above that it is a good B-horror funny movie, and honestly this is the best way to describe it. Now the question I was asking was how Kane would do ... Well, let's say he made a bad ass out of the "Jacob Goodnight" character. He sold the role very well and really looks threatening. But what can you expect from someone who is almost a meter tall and weighs about 320 solid muscles. The acting was decent, and the story was not new, of course, but we all know it. The direction and the cinematography were done very well and the background of the hotel seemed really rundown and well done. Considering that this was directed by a director of porn movies, I was rather surprised. I would recommend this movie if you are looking for gore and brainless killing and just a little bit of general fun. Think of this film as a modern day, this Friday the 13th film. And save space for the end too, because it's good. And it remains even after the credits ...
