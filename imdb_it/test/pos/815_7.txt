"Blind Date" is one of three stories made in the film by author Vida Hurst. Many familiar faces in this old 1934 movie. Mickey Rooney as a small open mouthed punk. It seems to be in the film for "family values" comedy and family. Jane Darwell still plays the strong-willed mother, just as she did with Grapes of Wrath and the Oxbow incident. Ann Sothern is Kitty, who attended Bill (Paul Kelly), but meets rich Bob Hartwell, played by Neil Hamilton, which may or may not be better for her. It can certainly be said that this was done right at the beginning of Hays production code - at one point, Kitty says she can't be up there alone with him if there's nobody else at home ... than at change alone a year or two before, when everything and nothing was OK. A good solid storyline, but lots of conversations and loving talk. He raises the question of what a girl should look for in a man; should he resist for a healthy man who treats her well, or simply find a man with a lot of money, as most of the films of the last 20 years had claimed ...? and how do men change when their situation changes? watch out for the violence in the strange dance marathon scene. 1960s TV viewers will recognize Hamilton as Batman's Commissioner Gordon ... Also some strange drama in life off screen for some of the cast in this film - Paul Kelly had gone to jail for being the accessory of a murder love triangle. Mickey Rooney had an affair with Norma Shearer, who was 20 years older; Rooney ended up getting married eight times. Tyler Brooke (Emory) and Spencer Charters (Pa) both threw themselves out in real life. The title "Blind Date" has been reused many times, for movies, TV series and even cartoons, but none of them seems to have the same storyline as this.
