This BBC series is excellent. I'm not a paleontologist, but this series offers the best historical representation of the dinosaurs I've ever seen. 3D animation and animatronics are very good and make you believe you have traveled back in time. The BBC deserves a pat on the back for a series as beautiful as Tim Haines who must have spent a long time transmitting this series.
