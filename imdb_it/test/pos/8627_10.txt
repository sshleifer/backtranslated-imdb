The Abbott and Costello duo live in this version of a classic of history. In "Jack and the Beanstalk", there is everything to see, music, magic and comedy in one. Costello plays Jack after listening to the story told by a boy once. We know that Jack was a poor boy who sells his "Dolly" cow for 5 magic beans. Well, plant those 5 beans, and they were really magical. He climbs to the sky, sees a big castle there, and sings a song, unknown would meet the giant (Buddy Baer). Not only him, he would have danced with the woman who was also a giant. He would have covered Jack's neck with his elbows during the dance. This was good! You have the harp that plays and knows how to put the giant at ease. The goose that lays the golden eggs. And my favorite, the way Jack gets rid of the giant. He takes the ax and begins to break down the magic bean. Another amusing is where the ax got stuck during cutting, and the final celebration occurs when people will dance around the footprint where the giant fell. Lots of fun and fun for the whole family. Highly recommended! 5 stars!
