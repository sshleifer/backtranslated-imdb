Let's face it: I'm an asshole with the emotional sensitivity of the cubic stone. Therefore I consider the dramas of people with disabilities, the social stigma or any illness they have and cry about and over it like stupid movies with little taste. I mean, if you have a message, you can say it without the help of sick or pitiful people. <br /> <br /> However, I liked this movie. These are people with an incredible misfortune as personal health goes, but they do not cry about it, on the contrary, they try to live and people try to "protect" or "take care of it" removing them from real life. The message is to live life to the fullest, even if the ending is as sad as possible. <br /> <br /> My conclusion: like the dramas of sick people, this is a keeper. It is sad, but full of hope. I like James McAvoy, even though he seems to always play the arrogant rebel. I also say that Steven Robertson played very well. Or that or does it really have partial paralysis. :)
