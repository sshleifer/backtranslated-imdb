I found it fascinating! No one but Kiarostami can do so little and still get a lot. You might think I'm weird, but I was so fascinated that I couldn't talk during the movie. While during other films I comment a lot. The short film made by him for Lumiere et Companie, the one with eggs, is unbeatable in my heart, but even that is wonderful. I liked it better than Ten. Kiarostami is, perhaps, the best director in my opinion, because he can see things! He doesn't need to use a lot of things "brought from home" to illustrate his images, he simply grabs a camera. Not many can do it ... Maybe I don't know much about movies, but I don't care about complicated things, all that someone has to do is touch my soul. Kiarostami yes.
