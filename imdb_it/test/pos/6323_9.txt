'Sleight of Hand' is my favorite episode of Rockford Files of the entire series. This episode shows a side of Jim Rockford that is usually ignored. By wit, Jim is genuinely in love with a beautiful woman and is shown as a father figure to his young daughter. The woman is recently divorced and she and Jim returned from a weekend with the boy. Through a strange turn of events, the woman is discovered missing after they return home. <br /> <br /> Rockford's telling his father, Rocky, of the events leading up to the disappearance of the woman remembers Remy by Mickey Spillane Series of hammers from an earlier era. After many reflections and reflections and with Rocky's encouragement, Jim comes across the clue that leads him to investigate the disappearance with his usual firmness. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Jim's girlfriend, Karen, involuntarily witnessed some mafia activity while they remained at the Buena Vista Inn. The crime bosses responded by killing Karen and replacing another woman in Jim's car. The impostor, apparently asleep in the back seat, immediately made his exit upon arriving home. A couple of cover-up murders follow and Jim proceeds to their solution while under the Los Angeles Police Department's indictment even when warrants are issued for his arrest. <br /> <br /> This episode evokes a more emotional reaction than all the other episodes of Rockford Files combined. James Garner in the role of Jim Rockford is seen in his most vulnerable moment and yet retains the presence of the mind to pursue the case. This is personal to Jim Rockford. In this case, he is not hired to do a job but is trying to recover his lost love to save her life. Unfortunately, this is not possible but Jim tries to resolve his feelings, but it is clear that he will soon be unable to overcome his pain. <br /> <br /> Despite the attractiveness of the main plot, many key questions are raised but never answered in this episode. (1) What will become of Jim's girlfriend's young daughter? (2) What did Karen see in the hotel that had the mafia killed? (3) How could Jim drive for hours with an impostor in the back seat without realizing it? (4) The daughter declared that "Mama did not return with us". So why didn't the girl scream or cry when she noticed that her mother was absent for hours of driving? Regardless of these ambiguities, "Sleight of Hand" is the episode of Rockford Files that comes closest to a tear-jerker: the suspense is compelling and the plot is told in a sensitive and vulnerable style that makes us feel Rockford's pain .
