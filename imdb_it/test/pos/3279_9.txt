Thank you Mario Van Peebles for letting us know not only about the existence of black cowboys, but also a compelling story that is easy to follow. <br /> <br /> The plot, the background, the music and the talent were the best. It was great that you used so many African-American artists to tell the story of the black cowboy. It was good to see Billy Zane in this movie. Will he never play a good boy? <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to expand their thinking. This is an excellent film and I feel privileged to have seen it. I hope you feel the same.
