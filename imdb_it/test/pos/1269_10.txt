An excellent debut film for the director of Batman Begins, comes the sequel, a film about a man who follows other people to inspire the characters in the stories he writes. A man who follows, decides to go further and the man turns out to be more than he contracted. <br /> <br /> Using a cast of non-actors and his uncle, writing directors producing and otherwise producing this film entirely on his own, without budget and independently produced, this film is much more than one would expect. <br /> <br /> For those who love Memento and complex twists, turns, bumps and jokes with time, this is definitely a movie for you.
