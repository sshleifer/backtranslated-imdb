watch this movie. it's really a nice ride through the difficulties of making an independent film, and what happens when it explodes in the face of the director. there are many things about punk rock and the philosophy that underlies that movement and its relationship with this project. so if you like old punks, American punks, you scaverai .... but, be careful, there are a lot of bad acting pieces of the failed project that are incorporated ... yet sometimes they have fun. . and, in reality, some of the best parts are listening to people who have never been involved in the process of film pontification and of what they have experienced in the three years necessary to put all this together. so whoever's out there is going to make a movie, especially if you haven't been to film school or worked in the field, you should watch it and learn from the director's mistakes.
