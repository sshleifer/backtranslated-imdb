Warning: Herzog is a director and, as such, tends to be a little too dramatic. So obsessions about door closing may or may not be a real part of the character's life, but the dramatic embellishment of a director - or so they agreed at the San Francisco premiere. But Herzog's usual fascination with character, dreams and perseverance are well adapted from this story first published in Soldier of Fortune, and now a full-length autobiographical book. (The Soldier of Fortune comment bounced loudly from SF's politically correct audience, and both the director and the main character had to assure the public that he had just seen the film, that SOF's interest was out of place - so beware , this is not Rambo, only survival.)
