let's face it, you know what to expect when you tune in to a 1990 Corey Feldman movie, there are probably tits, guns and cars. That being said, there is much more to this film than naked women (I regret to say), because it is mainly people who are killed in a variety of unusual, and as the name suggests, often "mystical" ways. I love filthy horror and I love this movie. If you don't, you probably won't. but I think it's worth it that most people try, it's not so disgusting that it will ruin your weekend or anything else. All in all, if his irreverent and amusing fun, a little love for the corpse and a childhood superstar from the 80s in vogue, then you are in the right place. it's a cracker !!!!
