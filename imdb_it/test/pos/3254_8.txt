Having seen and loved this film in Australia, I was very eager to have my paws on a copy. I got one on DVD in the UK just to find out that it's a very different change. <br /> <br /> The modification of Australain interior that I saw is sharper. The UK, and I assume the European, the changes spend much more on the narrator played by Jimmy's dead brother. And indeed, this and a few other points bring no real benefit. <br /> <br /> It is not a serious criticism, but the modification of Oz is simply lively and I think I'm more confident. <br /> <br /> Can't I say why they felt that expansion was needed for the foreign market? <br /> <br /> So watch which one for that. <br /> <br /> I went for both.
