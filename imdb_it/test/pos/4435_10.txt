This is a profound and moving work on the creation of art, what is uniquely human and cannot be produced by nature, the cost of genius and the search for transcendence and what ultimately constitutes the family, that is, all of us. I was very moved by the family discussion that Nathaniel had with his sisters about his father's shortcomings as it was set in a beautiful house that seemed to radiate warmth that Lou had created. And even though Esther seems so cold in her argument about Lou's inability to make money, you can appreciate how many points in her life she must have been a counterweight to her impulses. Nathaniel did a great job of showing how all the people in Lou's life adapt and completed him, becoming part of his job as his own genius. Yes, even, or perhaps above all, our failures make us what we are. And of course there are the buildings. I had only known Lou Kahn by name and in reality he did not link his name to his work, they are proof of grace. Perhaps one day there will be a building where we will all fit together, and it will certainly look like a building by Lou Kahn, perhaps the temple not built in Jerusalem. Perhaps there is salvation
