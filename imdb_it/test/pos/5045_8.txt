"Autumn Spring" recounts the misadventures of a dapper, walrus faced, 78 (about) a Czech man who unfortunately confuses and disorients all those who know him with his mischievous ways while his wife meticulously plans his funeral. Hana Centerpiece (Brodsk√Ω) shows us how to get girls to kiss you when you are 78 and how to deal with a feeling in an elevator and thank you for it as it makes its way from day to day in this warm and luminous look at old age and the creative, fun, but socially unacceptable ways of a man to enjoy life by refusing to be relegated to the old people's home. "Autumn Spring" is a strenuous and subtle comedy with messages for all ages that will have the greatest fascination with the most mature foreign cinema fans. (B +)
