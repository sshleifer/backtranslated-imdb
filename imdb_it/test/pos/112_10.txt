'Water' (2005), the final part of the Toronto trilogy of elementary Indian directors Deepa Mehta was finally completed, almost ten years after the release of the first controversial element, 'Fire' (1996), which was followed with a sequel a little less controversial "1947: Earth" (1998). Mehta made his directorial debut with a 24-minute Canadian short film "At 99: A Portrait of Louise Tandy Murch" (1975), but it was his Canadian feature film about the lives of Indians living in Canada that brought his fame back to the east. , his country by birth right, "Sam & Me" (1991). International recognition came in "Camilla" (1994), with Bridget Fonda, together with the actress who in 1990 won an Oscar for best actress in a category of leading roles at the age of 80, paving the way middle-aged actresses still have hope for her portrayal of a headstrong Jewish senior in "Driving Miss Daisy" (1989), late Jessica Tandy. <br /> <br /> 'Camilla' faced a friendship between two women from two other ends of human life, a friendship of May / December. 'Camilla' was Tandy's last photo; she died the same year. <br /> <br /> International fame followed Deepa Mehta in 1996 with the publication of the controversial "Fire", which spread angrily among the false patriotic consciousness existing among Indian extremists. Having already explored the friendship between two women in "Camilla", in "Fire" Mehta stepped forward to portray a more intimate relationship between two single neglected women. Set in present-day India, the outskirts of the capital of New Delhi, it shows two brothers and their wives, the elder brother (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) who has joined a strange Hindu sect leads a life of celibacy, loyal to his guru of existence without sex. The younger brother (Javed Jaffrey) has an extramarital affair with a Chinese woman (Alice Poon). Thus, both wives, Shabana Azmi who plays the wife of the older brothers and Nandita Das, the younger wife, find themselves neglected in their own way. One forced to lead a celibate life, thanks to the eccentricities of her husband, and the other whose only interaction with her husband is through sex, and nothing else. Living in a world of in-laws and being the only two strangers in the family, having no one else to confide in, the two women fall into each other's arms. Hence the question of lesbianism. If there were the shoulder of an external man to cry on, there would probably be the possibility that they would fall into the arms of a man, but not having anyone else to rely on, their need for mutual support is quite obvious. It does not necessarily say that all neglected women would end up taking lesbianism, it simply happened for the two women in this context. All in all, the film is excellent, and it digs much deeper than the only two women who roll in the bed. The main objective is not the lesbianism in the film, but the sad condition of the moderns has neglected Indian wives, even in the capital, the two female characters have had a sexual relationship. <br /> <br /> Two years later, the second episode of Deepa Mehta was the mother earth element, released in India with the name "1947: Earth", another excellent film by a great director, this once in Hindi language, unlike "Fire", which was made in English. <br /> <br /> Now Deepa Mehta has managed to complete the trilogy, despite a lot of problems, having recently released the latest episode, "Water". No doubt it would be just as beautiful as the other two.
