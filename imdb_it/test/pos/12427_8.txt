I saw it in Zone's Horror and I expected it to be a real competitive shit like most movies, but I was pleasantly surprised. The film revolves around 2 friends and a maniac in a monster truck that is chasing them (I know it looks like crap but it's actually quite good), the film is disturbing when it intends to be and it's funny to laugh out loud (and not even in unintentionally, it is well-paced and very funny as well as being very bloody, there is also a very funny black humor. His is not the most original film, but what if your after Shakespeare then this is not so, if you are after a funny movie then this should be fine
