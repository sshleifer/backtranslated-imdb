In the book of life, Martin Donovan plays Jesus, who shows up at the JFK airport on December 31st to inaugurate the new millennium by fighting with Thomas Jay Ryan (Satan) and deciding the fate of the world. There is also David Simonds (Kurt the Accountant of Amateur) as a compulsive and homeless player. <br /> <br /> As usual, Hartley creates a surreal world in which the beauty of the ordinary made strange and otherworldly flows through art - framed scenes and urban / industrial landscapes full of lights and dazzling shadows. As usual, he soon introduces apparently random details, then brings them back to hilarious and unexpected contexts - humor is simple, but dizzying and irrepressible. Hartley has an incredible ability to build banal and outrageous moments towards small and ecstatic moments. As usual, it creates a tired and tired tone of the world but at the same time vulnerable, open and honest. It moves within minutes of amazing humor in a language that is metaphysical and poetic - the kind of writing that is so perfect and perfect that it is difficult to hold back tears despite the lack of obvious emotions. Another fantastic and very funny movie. The book of life is filmed (a digital camera?) With a blurred effect: a sense of the heavenly hand in hand with an imminent destiny and a hyper-awareness of the present as fragile and fleeting in its last moments. All of Hartley's films have a way of prioritizing the present, but this unique effect mixes it up as the images spill out onto the screen in a way that is initially out of tune, but becomes more and more beautiful as you settle. The final shot is spectacular. All this may seem valuable, but the film is a comedy and makes fun of itself even if it makes fun of the concept of Armageddon, Judgment Day and "urbanity". Although it is actually quite deep, moving and affirmative, it is mostly carefree and playful. The acting is flawless from the point of view of the kind of subdued tone that Hartley developed in his films (a tone that some people don't understand and that pushes them to judge such acts as empty - the same people who have a negative answer to Peter Greenaway ). As always, there are certainly people who respond to this film with cynicism and contempt - people embarrassed by Hartley's abrupt changes and what they see as pretentious or mannerist techniques, but who have time to consider the opinions of so boring insensitive fools? Anyone who is a Hartley fan will love this movie, if he can get a chance to see it, that is. It's hard to say what the video would be like.
