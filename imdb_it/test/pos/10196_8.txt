The writer Robocop appears to have ransacked The Vindicator. This is a very solid horror / action movie about a man created in an accident to be used in a cruel experiment. Anyone who has seen Robocop knows the story. Watch out for Pam Grier as a rude and damn nice killer. This very effective, violent and bloody horror film may not appeal to everyone, but this Canadian release is worth looking for for anyone who is a fan of the genre. 8/10
