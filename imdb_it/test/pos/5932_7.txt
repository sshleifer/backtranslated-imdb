This Royal Rumble had in practice the wrestling message these days. Dodge and image are more popular than wrestling skills. <br /> <br /> HBK vs Edge. Quite good A lot of heat for Edge that had just started as a heel again and what better way to play a game with HBK. It has become a little slower at the end than usual. Overall this game gets a 6/10. Undertaker vs Hedinreich. It's not a good game. Undertaker had to bring Hedinreich through this match that seemed to be really lost and ruined his moves. It was interesting to see Raws Gene Snitsky and shortly after Kane get into this game. Overall the fans seemed more interested at the end of this game. 2/10 Kurt Angle vs JBL vs Big Show. At the beginning the game was slow but in the end it became quite good when Angle managed to speed up the match. Kurt Angle has made some really good wrestling moves and proves to be the best wrestler out of the game. JBL and Big Show have played a slow game. The end of this match was bad. Over all this match was a 5/10 mainly for Kurt Angle. Randy Orton vs HHH. Good game, surprising warmth for Randy Orton who was the face of this game. Randy has shown that he can go to the limit with any top star. This match also marks the first game in which HHH fought where someone does not go to the bottom and save him from a loss. Overall this match was around 6/10. <br /> <br /> The Royal Rumble game was OK. Some surprises Some not so good surprises. I was pretty upset that Kurt Angle hadn't been given enough time in this game. But throughout this game there was a boy I never thought would be pushed so soon. I will not tell you who wins. I give this game 8/10
