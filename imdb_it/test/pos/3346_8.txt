This version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is truly original. Even porn, fairy tale and musical comedy pieces - this film is certainly a strange piece in the history of adult films. <br /> <br /> Alice is a sexually naive librarian who ends up following the rabbit in "Wonderland", where she meets all kinds of "expert" weirdos like the Mad-Hatter (who likes to bring out her dong when possible), Humpty Dumpty (who broke his wiener with his shell), Tweedledee and Tweedledum (a brother / sisters sex-reduced couple), and the bisexual queen - among others. <br /> <br /> This version of ALICE IN WONDERLAND is actually quite domesticated by the standards of the time - a time when a lot of porn was bad - witty and bad (as noted by the "roughie" subgenre) - this actually it's pretty funny and strangely appealing. It's the kind of thing you'd show your children - if it wasn't for graphic sex. A little slow to get to "good things" ... but genuinely fun. Oh - and some of the musical numbers are pretty hilarious. If you are a drinker - you have some, if you are a smoker - roll a pair and give one to one. 8/10
