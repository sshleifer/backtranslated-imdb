The problem inherent in any staging of "The Merchant of Venice" has never been pseudo-controversial anti-Semitism, but the fact that there are two very different narrative lines in both tone and content; a sparkling romantic comedy and a burning tragedy. While mixing genres was all the rage in the sixteenth century (and mocked by Shakespeare in Hamlet), he rarely scratches himself with the modern audience. As a result, many directors are forced to place the emphasis on one plot at the expense of the other, and it is not surprising that the decision falls in favor of Shylock. <br /> <br /> Like so many of Shakespeare's great tragic heroes, Shylock continues to fascinate after 400 years because he is such a difficult and complex character. Pitiful, proud, angry, vindictive, weak, arrogant; his behavior simply challenges the analysis and continues to be discussed. It is imperfect not because he is Jewish but because he is human. Modern writers rarely infuse their creations with such richly structured contradictions, and it is to everyone's benefit that we have Shakespeare to get inspiration. <br /> <br /> The Shakespearean language is wild and rambling, saturated with multiple meanings, the word game and metaphor. To be understood, it must be opposed and tamed by an actor with the strength and knowledge to do so. When an actor fails, words flow into a stream of incomprehensible words, but when he succeeds, the English language comes to life with an immediacy and a liveliness that takes your breath away. Al Pacino is one of these actors, and here he shows an incredible level of clarity and control that, if there was any justice, would have swept every award in the offer. It meets the challenge of presenting Shylock with its head held high and offers extraordinarily subtle and nuanced performance. It would be a crime if we never had the opportunity to see what he does with King Lear. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is noteworthy. Jeremy Irons gives an original version of the familiar Antonio, presenting an older and calmer figure that shows the contradictory contradictions between the medieval cavalry and the bad prejudice of the time. Joseph Fiennes is a revelation as he matures beyond a superficial eye-pleaser to actually inhabit a character for once. Lynn Collins is the only disappointment. Many of Shakespeare's women are underwritten and require an actor who works really hard to bring her to life, and the impersonation of Gwyneth Paltrow of Collins seems a bit flat and unsuitable for the darker tone Radford is looking for. <br /> <br /> The design team must be recognized for creating a unique and absolutely credible vision of the late Renaissance in Venice. The city didn't seem so threatening from "Don't look now". Taking full advantage of existing places and natural light, the film has an appearance of authenticity that is greatly enhanced by the design of the dark and worn out costume. All, once again, deserve recognition. <br /> <br /> Funders of films like this must be praised. With a budget of $ 30 million, they must participate in such a venture with the full and certain knowledge that they will never make a profit, and yet still invest. We can all be grateful, as the result is a remarkable adaptation that will surely be a point of reference for many years to come.
