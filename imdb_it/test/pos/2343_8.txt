I agree that this film and its talented director do not receive the honors they deserve. We hope the DVD does very well and attracts the attention of a wider audience. The actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent. Perhaps overall the film is a bit long, but May Miles Thomas seems to be enjoying himself with his actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes keeps them in longer close ups than necessary. Good for the actors, I'm sure, but sometimes like the audience you're ready to go on to talk to the plot. May Miles Thomas deserves more recognition from the world of cinema as one of our most important digital film directors,
