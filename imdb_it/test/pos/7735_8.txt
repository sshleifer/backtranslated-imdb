Storm by Paul Mazursky - Interesting, strange and strange film about a mid-life crisis. Set in New York and a remote Greek island with John Cassavettes as a world-famous architect who decides to abandon. He is accompanied by his daughter (Molly Ringwald) and a singer (Susan Sarandon). A beautiful transfer of this 25 year old film to DVD - but without any extras - not even the theatrical trailer. So many scenographies and crystal-clear dialogues make this film of 2 and a half hours an interesting trip. Raul Julia and Gena Rowlands complete a strong cast. This latest version of DVD deserves to be rented. B +
