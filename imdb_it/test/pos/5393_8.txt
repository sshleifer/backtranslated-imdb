A return to the "old style" western of the '30s and' 40s (as DODGE CITY), DALLAS has a series of things to do: Gary Cooper in his most vivid and brilliant technicolor photograph by Ernest Haller (GONE WITH THE WIND) and a Max Steiner score (KING KONG, GWTW, DODGE CITY et al.) with heart rate. Furthermore, there is a masquerade, a wrong identity, a fake death and more hair leaks than a Republic serial. As always, Cooper defines what it means to be a man under pressure. Forget the western 50s angst ... this is pure fun!
