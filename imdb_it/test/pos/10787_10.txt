Well, the first time I saw "Talk Radio" it was in a video store for only $ 2 on VHS believe it or not, and I looked at it and thought it might be about Howard Stern, because I watched it for about thirty seconds, then I never saw it again. Then I went to another store about a month later and found "Talk Radio" on DVD for only $ 5.00. So I see that it was directed by Oliver Stone, and I picked it up. So, after the film ended, I was speechless. I've never seen a movie like this. Here is the main plot, then I'll tell you what I thought of it. <br /> <br /> It is a Dallas radio host, Barry Champlain, a Jewish radio host who talks about any other people bring him and he interrupts and is taking everything seriously. Now, a network wants to put its show live anywhere in the United States. So Barry's show gets a lot of interesting phone calls like Chet (a neo-natzi), Kent (a drugged rock n roll kid), John (rapist) and others. Now some of the callers look like the same actors / actresses. But I still think it's good. <br /> <br /> Now what I love about this film are the dark corners and the paranoid atmosphere of the radio station. Even the dark music in the background fits very well. He also has a flashback scene in the film about how he started with the radio, which I think did well. <br /> <br /> But the great thing about the movie is ending. I was surprised, and this makes you feel a little paranoid about the callers on the phone and everything is wonderful. It also tells you how to say the right things to people in a big city like Dallas. One of Oliver Stone's undervalued / weaker films has been mentioned, but I think it's the best in my opinion. <br /> <br /> But surely this movie if you like films with paranoia: you hear movies with a dark atmosphere with music left in the background. I still watch this movie many times when I'm bored, because I actually saw it tonight. Yes, if you really want to have the film's left feeling, watch it in the evening with the lights off. I might look crazy, but it makes the movie better! <br /> <br /> Another thing I forgot to mention is that the reason I don't think the film went so well was perhaps from my point of view. 'Speak radio.' It doesn't seem very complicated or anything, it's quite simple. A better title like the book "Talked To Death" or maybe "The Abusive Radio Host" or something catchy and not simple "Talk Radio". Or maybe because of Universal Pictures? Oliver Stone didn't usually do Universal, I don't think. Paramount may have been a good company. I don't know, something about this movie didn't go very well, but I like it. <br /> <br /> "Sticks and stones can break your bones, but words can cause permanent damage."
