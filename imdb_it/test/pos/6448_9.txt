I read the comment above and can't believe it! Obviously it's a film for children, it's an adaptation of a children's book !! This film is easy to grab, try play.com or amazon and it is very easy to get a copy! The jokes are fun for children and adults, and the adventure is clean without violence! It is completely suitable for children of all ages! The songs are fabulous, and yes, a little repetitive but this is what the children need and while I was watching it my little ones heard themselves singing "hello cocalorum" all night! They loved it, a story of innocence and friendship! Very beautiful and worth watching for children and adults of all ages!
