When the Hanabusa noble clan is decimated by the usurper clan of Samanosuke, the faithful servant Kogenta (Jun Fujimaki) escapes with the eight-year-old son of his lord, Tadafumi, and his daughter, Kozasa. They are protected by the priestess Shinobu (Otome Tsukimiya), who serves the god of the Hanabusa clan, Majin, a vengeful spirit imprisoned in the gigantic stature carved into the side of a local mountain. Ten years later, Kogenta and Tadafumi (Yoshihiko Aoyama) seek revenge against Lord Samanosuke (Yutaro Gomi), but are caught in the attempt and sentenced to die. The priestess Shinobu, desperately trying to save her master, threatens Samanosuke with the god's sorrow, only to be reduced to death for his efforts. Samanosuke, a vain man, cruel and narrow, orders that the statue of Majin be destroyed, in order to destroy the last traces of hope among the loyal loyalists of Hanabusa. But the god Majin, who until now has been relentlessly silent, has other ideas ... <br /> <br /> Daimajin is a compelling, timeless, deeply moving fairy tale. Produced with a respectable budget, it is a film about values: the values ​​of nobility, justice, decency, loyalty, sacrifice and love. It concerns the hierarchy and the government and the consequences of not being up to the responsibility that this rule entails. These are things we don't talk about much in our demotic times, except to scribble toads like William Bennet, but they're still relevant, and Daimajin shows us why. <br /> <br /> Daimajin is a perfect example of why Japanese cinema is so glorious. The values ​​listed above have a palpable relevance for those involved in this film, as they do for many Japanese directors. There is no service in the mouth, no condescension, no irony here. Instead, there is a genuine effort to evoke a world in which these values ​​can once again have life and show what happens when they fall into disuse. Just compare Daimajin, or the Lone Wolf and Cub series, or any other Kurosawa movie for Tarantino's distinguished Kill Bill b * llshit, to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> In a film whose contributing talent is so uniformly excellent, I would simply like to highlight the majestic soundtrack of master Akira Ifikuba, the talent and beauty of actors Jun Fujimaki, Yoshihiko Aoyama and Miwi Takada; and the splendid interpretation of Otome Tsukimiya. His death scene is one of the most moving and significant I've ever seen.
