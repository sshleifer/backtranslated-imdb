When I reviewed the video for a local magazine, I called it "the biggest hit in the history of American cinema". That wasn't completely ironic. TW & TL remains Milius' best work and it is sad that it has so few opportunities to work yet. However, TW & TL remains an extraordinary display of what was once known as The American Character, largely thanks to the superb portrait of Brian Keith of Teddy R. (Obviously Milius - and Keith - admired TR tremendously for making two films on of him, including "The Rough Riders.") It is difficult to criticize this film at all levels: a splendid balance of action, lightness, relationships and the serious theme of America becoming an adult in the world. Furthermore, TW & TL has an exceptional all-round appeal: note the statistics showing the best rates with children under 18, females 18-29 and over 45! Clearly Candy Bergen touched a reactive string with women and men.
