This film reminded me of the live dramas of the 1950s, not like the recent "Failsafe", which seemed more like a gimmick than anything else, but a real moral drama that is both engaging and stimulating. Anne Heche is more than credible when the army officer has a relationship with her superior, played by Sam Shepard, and Eric Stoltz is as wonderful as his lawyer who defends her against the military establishment. I found myself waiting for THEIR story to begin, even if only because it looks so good together. This film is apparently based on a true story, and it is a relief to be asked to think about real problems for a change. <br /> <br /> Directed by Christopher Menaul, who also did The Passion of Ayn Rand (with Stolz) and the Prime Suspect series, this is a film with verve and style and is a must see.
