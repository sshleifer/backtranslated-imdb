The shame is rather unique as a war movie (or rather rather the anti-war movie) as it not only does not focus on the soldiers or politics involved (there is politics but not how you think it would be shown), it treats its two main subjects as the only two beings that can be cured at all in this brutal and decadent society that inhabit. Ingmar Bergman, in the midst of his success, and following two other psychological films, Person and Hour of the Wolf, is much more interested in seeing what effect the war has on the usually civilized beings, which brings out the worst in them and also in a way cathartic is a reminder of what is truly crucial in life. His two main actors are the frequent collaborators and friends Max von Sydow and Liv Ullman (like the Rosenbergs in a rather strange way), who are musicians who live on a farm on an island (not too dissimilar to "Wolf" when they do think up). /> <br /> They see the tanks rolling, and a couple of old friends are already wearing themselves out, but they try not to put it too much at heart; there is a sweet scene in which the couple speaks, quite frankly but with the heart (all at once, as is repeated in the film, perhaps to create a sense of provocation) ... Then comes the problem, including a false movie of propaganda done under the threat of firearms with the Rosenbergs, the psychological turmoil of being prisoners of war and the terror involved in a "friend" in the military (one of Gunnar Bjornstrand's most subtle works with Bergman). Needless to say, this is not one of the easiest films to address in terms of Bergman's filmography, but for some it may be one of his most accessible works. His religious themes this time are kept very low, although the idea of ​​maintaining a kind of faith pervades the atmosphere of the film. When there is war action, it is filmed in an unconventional and rapid manner (through the great amigo Sven Nykvist). <br /> <br /> And the deconstruction of the relationship between Jan and Eva is corresponding with the background of a chaotic type of war-area in which the lines are never drawn too safely. In a sense, this film, shot at the height of the worst times in Vietnam, is even more relevant for today; I could not help but see chilling, uncompromising, coincidences between Iraq and elsewhere with some scenes of Jan and Eve with the fighters, or those "in charge". The last scene, by the way, is one of Bergman's best, all around (acting, directing, lighting). It's not the kind of war image (or, again, against the war, I find little of the spirit of John Wayne in this production of Svensk) that I would recommend to all my friends to save Private Ryan - he has a little more affinity with Paths of Glory, looking at the effects of the hypocrisy of war. But in reality, as in all Bergman's "genre" films, he finds himself alone, however one who acts as a pioneer for the art-house audience.
