Interesting story of giant giant elephants that are unleashed in modern India. It has transparent special effects: elephants dressed in bristly coats that show off fang extensions. That being said, we have a good story and a good cast at work, and an exciting climax. It has been said that the running time of this film was doubled when it was shown in India, thanks to Robert Lippert, a master of "padding". Given a choice, opt for the shorter version.
