When I saw this movie for the first time I was just a kid and I fell in love with it, they don't make films like this anymore, I look at it again now slightly older and still love it. <br /> <br /> The Humor is perfect and fits perfectly into the film, all the gags are pretty childish but they will make adults laugh too, and in a children's movie it's really very rare. <br /> <br /> Animation is amazing and watching the hand-drawn animation is a real breath of fresh air for all the computer animations we see today. The backgrounds are beautiful and the coloring is incredible. <br /> <br /> The characters are just the kind of characters you fall in love with when you start watching the girls think the Chipmunks are adorable and Guys will think of the Chipettes are really a little sexy. <br /> <br /> Songs are fun to listen to and some really make you cry or get up and dance, it's also fun to watch visual humor to accompany them. <br /> <br /> The Voice Acting is great without a doubt even though most of the voice is of a high level, but an interesting thing is checked and it is one of the songs of this film, but the slowdown to show the real voices behind them and it's really fun to watch. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in a store or somewhere for rent, check it out which is really worth seeing and it's a perfect family movie it's absolutely amazing, words can't express this movie.
