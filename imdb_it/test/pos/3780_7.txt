Pretty funny stuff. Charlie was still working towards his peak when he made this brave daring about the soldiers in the trenches of the First World War. Dare because, after all, the war was still going on and this was a comedy about a serious business. <br /> <br /> Gags are fun without being hilarious or tearful. One scene of success follows another, while Chaplin and his companions try to sleep in a bunker that is at the knee in the water. (It is from there that we took the term "trench foot" from). Probably the most ridiculous episode has Chaplin disguised as a tree and foiled any number of German soldiers as they try to execute an allied soldier captured behind the lines. Edna Purviance, Chaplin's main squeeze at the moment, is a woman who works with Americans and is saved from execution. <br /> <br /> Chaplin would have continued to do more fun and more ambitious things, but it's better than most of his shorts during this early period.
