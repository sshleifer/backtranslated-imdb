House of Dracula works from the same basic premise as the House of Frankenstein of the previous year; namely the three most famous monsters of the Universal; Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and The Wolf Man appear together in the film. Of course, the film is rather messy then, but the fact that there are all three monsters is usually enough to ensure that the sixty-seven minutes of the movie don't get boring. It is obvious that the idea of ​​creating another monster of monsters has arrived in the writer's head before a real storyline did, since the thread we are given is not exactly without holes. The plot sees Count Dracula arrive at the home of Dr. Edelman to ask for a cure for his vampirism. Thus, what can only be described as a coincidence, sees Lawrence Talbot, a.k.a. The Wolf Man presents himself asking for a cure for his affliction! It turns out that Dracula is hunting for Edelman's daughter, but Talbot is really serious. When it turns out he can't be stopped from turning into a wolf, The Wolf Man throws himself into the sea ... where he ends up finding the Frankenstein Monster. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is not as good as the previous House of Frankenstein. The 1944 film has put together its plot better than this entry in the series, as the plot here does not give equal time to each universal monster. The plot of Dracula is the largest at the beginning, but it soon runs out only to resurface in the end. The Wolf Man is the star of the show, but his story never really develops and is essentially just another version of the plot in which he always finds himself. The Frankenstein monster receives the coldest hand, as it appears in the film simply as an afterthought and an obvious excuse to ensure that all three monsters appear in the film. The story of the doctor who binds all three together is the most interesting, but this is a bit disappointing as it is not the reason why people will see this film. The acting is pretty good, with John Carradine showing his left side and Lon Chaney Jr once again making sure that his character is immersed in the tragedy. Glenn Strange has nothing to do, and Onslow Stevens demonstrates the true highlight as Dr Edelman. Overall, this film won't do much for anyone other than a Universal horror fan; but as a film of stupid monsters, House of Dracula is worth seeing.
