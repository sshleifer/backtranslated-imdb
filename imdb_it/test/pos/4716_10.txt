I saw Beyond Rangoon about 20 times, it was THAT GOOD. In the beginning, when I saw it, I saw the story of Laura Bowman, but later, after several presentations, I realized that this was also a parallel documentary. It occurred to me, a story about Aung San Suu Kyi and women's struggles to stay strong in the face of uncertainty, danger and sadness. I would also put the story and the policy on the list after seeing them further, since I learned a lot about the past and present of Burma, and I could only imagine its future. This film is not just one you will want to see, but it is also one you will surely want to own a copy of. It is a film that could easily be seen by the whole family, although not for children under thirteen. However, the educational benefits of this film cannot and should not be underestimated.
