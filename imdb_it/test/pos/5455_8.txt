*** SPOILERS *** This film describes the brutal bloodbath caused by Johnny Carson's retirement to determine who will succeed him. David Letterman and Jay Leno's imitations are satisfactorily performed by John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck, although the performances were not great. Reni Santoni is the best performer of the "exec" (he plays John Agoglia of NBC), and Warren Littlefield (played by Bob Baliban) is a close second. I was shocked by the way Littlefield passionately discussed dumping Johnny Carson. This was Johnny Carson! This scene shows the world of ruthless television, the one you've done for me lately. Kathy Bates played the best performance of the film in the role of Jay's agent, Helen Kushnick. Another commentator claimed that Leno was portrayed as a simpleton in the film. I respectfully disagree. The relationship with Kushnick bordered on something like domestic violence. She orders him to go around and, when he rebels against her in the end, tries to reproduce the sympathy card (mentioning her dead husband and son); however, when Jay ends their relationship, he returns violently again, shouting "Don't leave me, two-faced bastard!" before destroying a photo on the floor. Overall, the film is hilarious, and I wish it was shown more often.
