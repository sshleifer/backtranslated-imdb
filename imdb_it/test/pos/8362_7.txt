The journey into the past is rather tenuous as an argument. In this episode a man who has thought about the possibility, finds himself at the date and place of the murder of Abraham Lincoln. Try everything you can think of in the short time available to you with predictable results. Sure, it's thought to be pretty crazy. He is arrested and finally sent back to the man who is trying to stop. Serling was bright enough to let him return to the present, but is this the same? This is a sort of precursor of "The Time Tunnel" in which time travelers on a weekly basis received the same task, overcoming what had already happened. Unfortunately, the implications of the distortion of time and the future always negate the result. Unless you have something like Ray Bradbury's "The Sound of Thunder".
