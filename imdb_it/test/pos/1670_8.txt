Du rififi chez les hommes is a brilliant film that studies criminal minds and allows viewers to better understand criminals who are fundamentally no different from ordinary people like us. What director Jules Dassin shows is that criminals have families and care a lot about them. That's why they adhere to a strict code of honor. For them a family is not just composed of wives, lovers and children, but also includes casual acquaintances and close friends. Contrary to what many might find difficult to believe, Jules Dassin has not tried to glorify the crime in his film as he does it by making clear that crime never pays. Show that all kinds of bad activities cause some sort of human loss. Apart from his philosophical position, Rifif is worthy of attention for his technical finesse. As we watch one of the film's brightest sequences on breaking a safe, it would be hard to believe a meticulous precision with which criminal minds execute their plans. This is a scene that no one has dared to copy in Hollywood.
