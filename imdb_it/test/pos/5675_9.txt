If you've ever seen Open Water, this is the same kind of gritty, edgy and indie film. I liked the action, the suspense. the slow construction of all this, I just hope they don't do this to what they did at Open Water, with that sequel .. but anyway, the only thing I didn't like was the annoying little sister ,, I did the cheering for the crocodile all the time .. the film starts practically as it should, the children pack up for a trip, take on a guide who mysteriously leaves 5 minutes. before they got there, so I guess his assistant brings the two sisters and the boy into the water, now mind that this is the second day of their adventure, strangely the first day they spent guessing, hmm a crocodile farm .. so I'm out there and all is well for a while, then bang, crocodile time ... very intense, you know something in this movie that you don't see the crocodile, a heck of a lot, but when you do, God is very scary, I love the face and eyes of the crocodile and the shroud of mist that seems to wrap the crocodile every time it raises its head above the water, very very disturbing, but good, overall this is a great film, if you can overcome the annoying little sister.
