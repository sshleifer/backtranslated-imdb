A type of western that I really appreciate is when the seemingly weak, who is reluctant to fight and responds to the challenge of the strong, finally decides that there is no other way. There is a big moment in this film when John Parrish (Glenn Ford) enters the salon and decides to oppose the Wade Matlock gunslinger. It's the kind of scene that makes the audience applaud. In my opinion The Violent Men is a great western, I would rate it among the best. It makes great use of the large screen, a spectacular mountain scenery. Women play a crucial part. Caroline (May Winn) is engaged to Parrish, but you feel that she is only using him as a means of getting out of there and moving east. He wants him to sell the ranch regardless of the price. Martha (Barbara Stanwick) is tired of helping her crippled husband Lee (Edward G. Robinson) but will do everything to have an increasingly larger ranch and more power. Meanwhile he is cheating on her husband with his brother (Brian Keith). His daughter Judith (Diane Foster) is seeing everything that happens but feels powerless to react because she doesn't want to hurt her father. Parrish unites all the small farmers and uses the strategy he learned in the army to go against Anchor's ranch. As if he had warned Lee, "Don't make me fight because you won't like my fighting."
