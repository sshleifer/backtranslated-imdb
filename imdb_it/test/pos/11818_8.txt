The theme of children who are terminally ill is difficult and saddening, but "The Cure" successfully portrays the idea that it should not be all sad and sad and, if anything, children need to have hope and joy in their lives, if they are to find peace before the end. It is also a film of remarkable bonds of friendship and the innocence of childhood. <br /> <br /> The film sees Erik, a dysfunctional teenager with a distant mother, who moves to a new area where their neighbor is eleven-year-old Dexter, who contracted AIDS with a blood transfusion. After his initial fears and ignorance of AIDS have subsided, Erik becomes Dexter's friend and their almost fraternal friendship sees them embark on a trip to the Mississippi where they heard about a New Orleans doctor who claims to have found a cure for the disease. br /> <br /> The talent of the two young protagonists of Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello, who play Erik and Dexter respectively, is exceptional. Brad was able to portray the harsher side of Erik without understanding the subtle childish innocence inherent in the character while Joseph describes the sense of vulnerability to Dexter's character but injects the right dose of enthusiasm and boyish zeal to point out that his illness does not means he is not yet I am a child who wants to run and play like any other boy of eleven. The couple's interactions create a feeling in the audience that these are two guys who are genuinely close and carry the film well. Annabella Sciorra also offers a touching interpretation of Dexter Linda's mother, who loves her son and delights in seeing him thrive with this new friendship with Erik and eventually become a surrogate mother figure to the other boy. <br /> <br /> Against an excellent soundtrack, "The Cure" is a very bitter-sweet film that manages to flawlessly weave the story of a childish friendship that survives without discontinuity in the midst of prejudice and disease terminals without resorting to sweetened or useless sugary scenes. A very interesting reflection in the film is that adults have the problem of Dexter's AIDS status while children, even the "bullies", come to accept it as they would any other. What is also very touching is the way in which, despite Erik's streetwise nature, he is the most naive in his determination to treat Dexter while the younger boy has the obsessive feeling of knowing his destiny but is swept away by enthusiasm of his best friend for a cure. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend "The Cure" because it is rare to find a film that is both sad and uplifting.
