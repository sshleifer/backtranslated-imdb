Farscape - is the only Sci-Fi Show that has restarted interest in science fiction in me. <br /> <br /> But Farscape is much simpler and simpler than science fiction. Comedy, Drama and more :) The Acting is very good. Fortunately, Farscape survived even the cancellation and showed Peacekeeper Wars that he is not dead yet :) You have to look behind this and you will see what a beauty Farscape is. <br /> <br /> Farscape has set a new standard on television and I think it will be really hard for new shows to prove that they can be the same or better than Farscape. I love this Show :) <br /> <br /> SaphirJD
