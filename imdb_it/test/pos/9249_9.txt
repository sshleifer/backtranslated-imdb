I'm a little biased because I appear in this film but I loved it and I'm only about seven minutes away and I'm not the most interesting part of it. The film is an honest and intriguing tale of a noble independent filmmaker who tries to make a lovable film. It is also a report of inflated expectations and fallen heroes. The interviews are well combined in editing. The different people are all interesting and there is never really too much of a person. Furthermore, the interviews are shot quite interestingly, keeping the film visually satisfying. Definitely a worthy film. I hope he goes around.
