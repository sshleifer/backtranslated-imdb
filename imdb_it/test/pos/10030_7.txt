I blame myself for "Birth of a Nation" - for starting the long tradition of Hollywood disguises of history, of which there may be fewer examples than this. In addition to having the names of Custer and his seventh trooper, Crazy Horse and Sioux and President Grant have written well, the correct geography and the fact that Custer and his men were actually wiped out by a man, the rest just takes the hyperbole and the invention for ridiculous limits. Throws in some trite and trivial scenes of the purest exhibition, (Custer and his wife prove that they are learning the false "Gold Rush" to justify the invasion of the Sioux territory, Custer's testimony to Congress claiming rights of the red Indians and upward all in all, Custer is breaking into the president's office to beg for alms to return to his post), honestly there is much more, some of these scenes almost comical in their horny ... ... And yet, yet, it is still a great actioner with Flynn increasingly unleashed, DeHavilland more and more seductive, the young Anthony Quinn starting as Crazy Horse and the director Walsh as barnstorming as always in his representation of crowd scenes and, of course , the tumultuous action sequences. Ford taught us in "Liberty Valance" to believe the legend before the truth. Here I think we are closer to the legend of the legend but hey, it's just a wonderfully funny movie and classic Hollywood movie!
