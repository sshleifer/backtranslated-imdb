I haven't seen the most recent 'Traffic' based on this, but I'd bet on this as the best creation. I don't know of any other film that has played so well the intricate tragedies of drug trafficking and the "war on drugs". I've seen it at least four times and I'm enjoying it again as part of the Masterpiece Theater 30th anniversary presentations.
