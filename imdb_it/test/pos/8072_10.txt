I have not seen a film of this kind in which the creators put so much of their heart into their work and paid attention to the smallest details for a very long time. <br /> <br /> Everything has been well thought out and perfectly put into reality. Working in the car, editing and compositing worked so well together that it was just great. The titles were so funny and perfectly choreographed. <br /> <br /> This movie simply upset me. <br /> <br /> The "Showdown" could have been reduced by 10 or 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> It is an almost perfect homage to the first film of noir, film, acting, sets and costumes were perfectly suitable and believable to be like the days of silent cinema.
