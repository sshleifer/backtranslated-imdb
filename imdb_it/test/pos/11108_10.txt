I really fell in love with the characters. They were very down to earth, but each of them had a hidden dark side. A sort of mystery. David Graysmark, himself, was an enigma. The secret fears and only the secrets in general that he had. There was an entire side of him that the other characters knew nothing about and left the public to wonder or suppose. There was always a part of that man who would have hidden himself, yet he would have shared a little of himself too. He was the strong male character and I admire that kind of character. Billy Moses himself is an incredible actor who could do almost any kind of part! He is an incredible talent and a good man. His fans love him, respect him and support him endlessly. <br /> <br /> From this show he has gone on many other projects and has extended his acting ability a little more and quite well. Congratulations to him and all the other actors of this show for doing an excellent job! I wish them all well. I would like the series to continue! It's a pity he didn't!
