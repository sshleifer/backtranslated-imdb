I can't believe that I've rarely seen this title mentioned by all of you eighties freaks and I certainly won't join all my fellow reviewers to say that "Bloody Birthday" is a horrible sight. On the contrary, I loved it and was pleasantly surprised by the ingenuity and the twists and turns that it offers. Don't just refer to this film as "another highlight of the 80s" because the victims here are quite unlikely and so are the killers. We are introduced to three cherubic-looking young men who were all born during a solar eclipse. At the time of delivery, the planet Saturn was blocked by the sun and the moon and, because of this, the children are without emotion and seemingly without consciousness. This really starts to show around their tenth birthday as they walk around mercilessly. <br /> <br /> Of course, this stuff is incredibly unbelievable and even slightly offensive but, seriously, who cares? Unlike many other horror films of this period, at least try to bring something original and imaginative. For once, the boys' acting is good and the whole movie has a creepy atmosphere and grizzly music. The sequences of the murders are grim and tense, and it is always strange to see them committed by children with angelic faces. I don't know who hired the 3 children but they did a good job. Especially the girl and the child with glasses are highly memorable. The gloomy images of the heartless trio remind you of the classic attractions, such as "The village of the damned", "The bad seed" and "The children of the damned". This movie is not as memorable as these milestones, but it is great fun and not a horror lover will regret watching it. <br /> <br /> Bloody Birthday was written and directed by Ed Hunt. Not particularly the greatest genius of cinema, but a pleasantly unbalanced guy who also gave us incredibly fun entertainment like "The Brain" and "Starship Invasions". If all this is not enough to convince you, Bloody Birthday has a lot of nudity. And not just any nudity, but a topless dance act by MTV-VJ Julie Brown. Oh, and keep your eyes peeled for a completely redundant cameo by Joe Penny, later the TV series star 'Jake and the Fatman'. Check it out!!
