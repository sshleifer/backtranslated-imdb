This show is fantastic. Not only "Haruhai Suzumiya" is a very well written anime show, but it also reflects things like philosophy, science fiction and a bit of religion. It is hilarious in some places and "cute" (for lack of a better term) to others. Actually this could be the effect of my lack of experience with Japanese anime shows, but it's one of the best of its kind I've seen. <br /> <br /> I must above all give credit to the writers. I've never seen such brilliant imaginative purposes on a TV show after the original Star Trek. I hope the writers continue to add strange new characters and give more information on the already fantastic characters that have been added. <br /> <br /> 9/10
