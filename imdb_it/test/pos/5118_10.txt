If I had to decide which was Ernest's best film, and not behaving like that kind of thing won't always happen, that would be it. <br /> <br /> All of Ernest's films are fun, but the best ones are those in which Jim Varney makes a number of different characters. Furthermore, I am known for enjoying the comic style of Bill Byrge and Gailard Sartain as the Chuck brothers and Bobby Tulip. "Ernest Goes to Jail" contains all those elements, as well as a funny script and a supporting cast that features several beloved characters. <br /> <br /> And that's why I chose "Ernest Goes to Jail" as the king of all Ernest's movies. Disagree with me if you have to, but basically you know I'm right.
