My impression, having seen this documentary, is that Nathaniel Kahn had more questions than he had before making the film. <br /> <br /> It took five years to do it, a job of love and desire. I can only imagine the tumult of the editing process, what to leave, what to take away. <br /> <br /> His father, the famous architect Louis Kahn, presents himself as a man too selfish and self-absorbed to be emotionally available even to one wife, not just three. But like many men of his character, he attracted women enchanted by distance and enchanted by creativity. <br /> <br /> One of her masters said it was "accessible" but that it was never explored. Other comments from people who knew him well suffer the same fate. A shame. <br /> <br /> Even the tension between the three siblings in the room of a house designed by Louis is palpable. The unsaid hovers over the conversation. The only traces left by his father were in the buildings he had left behind, some large, others not so large. <br /> <br /> I was fascinated by the musical ship and the Salk Institute. Grief-stricken by child mothers who have been captured forever by her calloused impregnations never more exemplified than what she told the director's mother after being informed of her pregnancy - "not yet!" <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, beautifully filmed, genuine. <br /> <br /> It seems, in this case at least, the son is not the father of man.
