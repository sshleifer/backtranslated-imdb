This special Bravo is one of the funniest things I've ever seen on TV. Unlike Me First & The Gimme Gimmes (the most important Punk-Supergroup / Cover-Band in the world), the Dan Band must be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> On paper, the Dan Band is just a joke act - boy sings girly songs and inserts swear words for free in the lyrics. If you listen to their "Dan Band Live" CD, that's all you'll get and it will soon become old. (I bought it just because it had some songs that weren't on the TV special.) But what made Dan Finnerty a Hollywood cult hero is his incredible stage presence. This guy owns his audience for every second on stage. And the support singers are also a big part of the visual joke. As for the current band, they remain mostly invisible to the eye, but they are certainly much more energetic and enthusiastic than your typical back-act band. Hopefully a DVD version will soon be released - there have almost certainly been some songs cut off and although heavy censorship adds some involuntary humor, it also removes INTENTIONal humor. <br /> <br /> If there is a sense in the world, Las Vegas casino owners will soon fight over who can build their showroom faster. <br /> <br /> "Re ------- member my name ... FAME!"
