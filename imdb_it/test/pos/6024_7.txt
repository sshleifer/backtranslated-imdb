I own this movie and I love Canadian films, but I hire an actress like Rose I don't understand. It's completely useless in this film, just a name. The rest of the cast is good, good enough to make this little thriller work. I was surprised by the plot which is not the first time it has been used. But those unknown actors did Jergen very well too, I'm not a big fan of his, but I liked it in this movie. If you had the chance to see it go for it.
