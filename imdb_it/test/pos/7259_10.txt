This film has almost everything. The action is beautiful, it's fun, 2 big prominent men and a really bad villain that I REALLY hated. Not many movies have bad villains. Only for the most part baddies of comics. It really deserves a donkey kick. <br /> <br /> Jake Scott really has the talent of his fathers to know how to create exceptional images. The management is impeccable and has an irresistible carefree feeling. Usually I don't like films set in the old days but I liked it a lot because it makes a point as boring as many other vintage films (Sense and Sensitivity, the age of innocence and the absolute worst ... Lady Duke). This will restore your faith. Thanks especially to Craig Armstrong's surprising score. The music is both atmospheric and ethereal and in action scenes it is very exciting. <br /> <br /> The DVD is in Dolby 5.1 and has an anamorphic image of 2.35: 1 very grainy and muddy.
