OK. So it can be done! We have the perfect vampire movie here. Gothic, beautiful. With all the ingredients A realistic vampire. A wonderful story. Take note: I come from Transylvania and I assure you that this film respects the vampire tradition! It's exactly like the stories I heard in my childhood. For a Transylvanian, it's quite ... credible. You have to see it, if you are interested in real vampires, how they were portrayed in medieval chronicles and not how they are made in recent Hollywood movies (as far as I can imagine, the problem with Hollywood is that they mix vampires with nightmare - which is rather fun for me. Vampires are never beautiful or attractive, they can only inspire horror and repulsion. The nightmare - called in my country The Night Flier, is the only demon that kills its victims by loving them. recommend this for any gothic person out there! See also the sequels, they are all 4 very good! And of course, don't miss the shadows of DArk! Something similar is Nosferatu in Venice with Klaus Kinski. I recommend it to.
