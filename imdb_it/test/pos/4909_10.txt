What begins as a comedy drama at home and then halfway turns into a melodrama made one of John Garfield's main stars - and rightly so. But Jeffrey Lynn must not be fired as the object of affection by the four daughters. Lynn is very beautiful and is so charming that it is easy to believe that all four daughters could fall in love with him. Although Garfield received the most compliments, Lynn became one of the main protagonists of Warner Bros. as a result of this film. Michael Curtiz insisted on shooting locations for the picnic scene, making it the highlight of the film film. In all, craftsmanship is enough to inspire awe. A soap opera by Fanny Hurst has been turned into a cinematic masterpiece.
