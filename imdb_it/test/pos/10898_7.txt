This episode introduces us to the ceremonial uniforms worn here by Captain Picard, Commander Riker and Lieutenant Tasha Yar. The plot of this episode concerns 2 groups of separate alien delegates, The Anticans and the Selae who try to catch and eat each other at every turn. The 2 sides really hate each other and it's up to Riker and Tasha to hold them and keep them out of trouble. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile a mysterious space anomaly bypasses the ship wounding and killing some of the team members. But at the end of the episode this same spatial anomaly has a precious member of the crowd. Will they be able to save it so they can perhaps continue with their ongoing space exploration mission? <br /> <br /> Note: this episode marks the second appearance of Irish actor Colm Meaney on TNG after "Encounter at Farpoint". Portrays one of Tasha's "poached yellow" security guards.
