The trilogies are very interesting. Some come out with a bang (Lord of the Rings), some become progressively weaker (The Matrix), some get lost in the dark (Blade, Back to the Future), but some retain the genius, that bright light apparently growing all the time which floats beyond the surface of its impeccable exterior. Case and point: "Trilogy of the three colors". This chapter of the trilogy, being the last, is the most philosophical and stimulating. In "Blue" we had a more visually stunning plot, more based on the characters, in "White" it was more a light story, driven by narration, in which we listen more to what the characters say more than anything else. "Red", however, focuses on "what ifs" and "how comes". It challenges our destiny and focuses mainly on the past and the future with respect to the present. <br /> <br /> This chapter is about a young model who runs over a dog and reports it to its owner. He soon discovers that the dog owner is actually a cynical retired judge who spies on his neighbors' phone calls through advanced espionage equipment. All three films in the trilogies have very simple plot lines, but they bring much more to the plot. Consider in "Blue" the story of a woman who deals with the loss of her loved ones. Ideas about contemporary French society are constantly shown and how this reflects the behavior of the character. "Red" is not just about a young woman who finds shelter in the life of an old man, but also about chance, hope and destiny. <br /> <br /> Irene Jacob plays Valentine Dussaut, who first discovers the old man (Jean-Louis Trintignant), whose name we have never found, extremely egocentric and disgusting. Although through self-reflexive analysis and her voyeuristic intentions, she learns that the judge would be the perfect man for her, if only she were 40 years younger. Irene lives in front of another younger judge, who looks a lot like the old one. This is the "what if" that continues to run in the film. What if Irene was born 40 years ago? The old man would have been his perfect companion. But what if the younger judge is actually his perfect partner, since he looks a lot like the older one. Valentine doesn't know, only we do it, and Krzysztof Kieslowski subtly suggests this in almost every frame Irene is in. We are constantly stunned in his face with his presence, as if to suggest the fate of Irene. <br /> <br /> I mention that the old man has no name for a reason. This is because it is very symbolic for the general theme of the story. We must compare the old judge with Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lorit), the youngest judge, in more ways than one. We find out that the old man once had someone he loved, but she left. In another scene, we see Auguste distraught as the love of his life recedes with another man. There are constant memories if Valentine will meet this man or not. Even if you pass each other without realizing it every single day. There is also the reason for the phone, for Valentine's Day it is a way to stay healthy and update his life, for Auguste it is what leads to his broken heart, and for the old man, it is the only thing left to him. These three elements serve to obscure the psychology of the characters. It's a kind of affirmation about what I am and who I am. <br /> <br /> All three "Colors" films represent a certain principle, the most common in France. "Blue" stands for Liberty (personal being), "White" stands for Equality (being accepted by more than one), and "Red" is Fraternity (for socializing, learning). And although this final chapter is an obvious attention to the principle of the Fraternity, Kieslowski makes sure that he also brings the other two, in order to connect all three stories. For example, we see the old man trying to reach Valentine and illuminate her with his spy gear, which is a reflection of the principle of equality. We also see at the end that Valentine is doing some soul searching and that she is more worried about herself than the others (don't take the phone when Michel calls), a clear example of freedom. And with all three principles established, Kieslowski also connects all the characters, in the final and most heartfelt scene. <br /> <br /> "Red" talks about where you could have been if you were older or younger. It's about whether there is someone completely perfect for everyone and if a person can change your life. The last chapter of the most impressive trilogy ever made, this film breaks the obstacles both in directing and in narration. It is not just about our modern life, but where life could and should be in our modern time. And even if the film is thinner than both "Blue" and "White", it boldly excludes a declaration of love and compassion. <br /> <br /> It is hard to imagine that "Red" was Kieslowski's last film, and that he died at such a young age. However, the trilogy will always be his masterpiece and we will always remember him for his work that fits perfectly with Bergman, Fellini and Wenders as a truly remarkable director who has never been awarded an Oscar. Kieslowski, you've been lost!
