I wanted to see it since my French teacher recommended it to me more than forty years ago. Perhaps the long wait was worth it, since the restoration of the Criterion Collection DVD is impressive. <br /> <br /> In his scheme this film follows the script marked by time: a quartet of men diligently draws a difficult robbery of a bank vault, the robbery takes place, a small seemingly insignificant event leads to the definitive disappearance of all. Although the footage of the robbery is passing away, it occurs rather early and ultimately is not the focus of the film. This film differs from the typical robbery film by giving us insights into the characters' personalities and their motivations: his shows are as dramatic as they are thriller. Relationships play an important role and kidnapping is dealt with, giving us two films for the price of one. <br /> <br /> John Servais interprets the idea of ​​Tony le Stéphanois (always called "le Stéphanois") with such tiredness of the world that he could have just come out of a Camus novel. Tony has just been released from prison and is resisting returning to the life of the crime until he has a very unpleasant interaction with his ex-lover (who has resumed with another man) where, as a punishment, he physically whips her with a belt. Fortunately, that scene occurs from the camera, but you are not likely to forget it. After this sobering event, since there seems to be little hope of reviving that relationship, Tony meets two of his old crime partners, Jo and Mario, and decides to join them in one last big shot. They use the services of Cesar, a secure Italian cracker - played by director Dassin himself - and we're out for robbery. <br /> <br /> The robbery goes off without a hitch. But the feminizing inclination of Cesar is a trait of personality that turns out to be fatal for all concerned. However, we can understand his attraction to the nightclub singer he fell for, since there is a brilliant piece in which he stars in a sexy and cinematic nightclub - it must be one of the most memorable scenes of any film noir. <br /> <br /> It was quickly established that Tony has a close relationship with Jo and his family; in fact Jo's son refers to him as an uncle. I think it's partly to help Jo's family that Tony agrees with him. The final scenes, in which Tony saves the life of Jo's kidnapped son, partly redeems his most brutal and amoral actions. But only partially.
