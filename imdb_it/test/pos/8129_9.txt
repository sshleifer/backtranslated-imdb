Bedrooms and Hallways was one of the most entertaining films of the Melbourne Film Festival of 1999. From the United Kingdom, it is a young crowd of roommates and their various relational dilemmas. Much of the humor is centered around a self-help group of new age men where they pass on various tools like the "rock of truth". They also participate in a weekend of gathering hunters with hilarious results. Trust me, you'll laugh with clenched teeth.
