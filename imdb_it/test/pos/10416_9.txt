I was enchanted by Niami's debut. I hope we will see more of his work soon. I was lucky enough to take the film during his short run in New York and he struck me as a worthy successor to downtown films like Desperately Seeking Susan and After Hours, but with a sweet European whimsey that made him fresh and funny. A strong cast of actors who played mainly against the genre was a pleasure. And I thought the complex interrelated plots were right. Sandra Bernhard puts on her best performance as King of Comedy, while Peter Stormare is hilarious and Ling Bai touches. Watch it.
