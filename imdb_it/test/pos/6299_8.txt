Someone on these forums predicted that everything was dreamed of by the protagonist's best friend, even if a friend he hasn't seen for about 20 years. I am reluctant to reject this off-screen but it raises some valid questions. Why would he be a telephone engineer - or a shoe salesman or a butcher? - YOU WANT to create a mythical world and weave it around a friend who populates it in the process with a series of equally legendary supporting characters. With such a good imagination the friend should be WRITE not Dream. Dream or not SOMEONE, and the obvious candidate is the director Paolo Sorrentino, he created a very watchable world where Tony Servillo makes immobility an art. We are asked to believe that Titta La Girolomo (Servillo) "upset" the mafia some years before our meeting and, as a penance, is a virtual prisoner in a small Swiss hotel from which every week he arrives in a local bank with a suitcase containing nine large mills in used banknotes. In addition to this weekly trip, he is free to do whatever he wants and what he likes to do is smoke, play cards with a cheating man and a wife who reminds her husband how far they have fallen socially, and ignore Olivia's friendly openings Magnani, who spent two years trying to get a smile and / or a "good evening" from him. For reasons better known to himself and which are not consistent with a man who has no interest in anyone or nothing, Servillo spends a certain amount of time each day applying a stethoscope to his bedroom wall and listening to private conversations of his card-playing partner. In the end he responds to Magnani - he must do it or it wouldn't be a movie. This is the 6f plot: the one about Destry, who never wears a gun, or Sean (Duke Wayne), the 'Quiet Man' who refuses to trigger provocations and fights to the obligatory scene where the gun is tied and fists raised - but instead of settling for a polite as you are today, he removes 100,000 from the suitcase and buys her a car. The final inconsistency occurs when Magnani tells him that he will take it the next day at 4 pm in his car and they will go to the mountains to celebrate his birthday. We have established that he lives locally, so because he is seen somewhere far away, ignoring a police roadblock to clear the road and overturn the car, nobody knows. This inconsistency aside from this remains a beautiful piece of film with excellent lead performance and excellent support.
