I'm a big fan of big, noisy, scruffy, completely stupid action movies like The Rock, Con Air etc. All of these are very fun to look at but, thinking about it, extremely stupid. IN THE LINE OF FIRE tells a story and tells it well. With plausibility, excitement and suspense he has also addressed several important moral issues that really make you think. The last scene of the film is Eastwood and Russo sitting together on the steps of the White House watching the pigeons in sweet and peaceful music and feeling a deep feeling of satisfaction. This is because I cared about the characters and I was happy for them that their story had come to a happy conclusion. It seemed like a true story. While the old secret service agent tormented by not protecting JFK on that fateful day in Dallas, Clint Eastwood is fantastic. He brilliantly transmits his paranoia and his personal need to stop his opponent. On the other side of the spectrum is John Malkovich, like the gruesome predator that tortures Eastwood over what happened in 1963, openly communicating his plan to kill the current president. This Oscar-nominated performance really hits you. Throughout the film, Malkovich talks to Eastwood as if they were friends. He does not threaten him, does not lie to him, does not laugh at him, but tortures him with his unbearable friendship until the last moment. In addition to this thrilling storyline, there is a fascinating love story that involves Rene Russo, another agent and Eastwood. Despite the age difference, they have a superb on-screen chemistry and the director wisely doesn't let this dominate too much, but keeps it as part of the background that works well. To sum up, I love this movie because it has a mind.
