This is an excellent film and I would like them to publish it on DVD for people to buy. It's hard to try to capture it on TV all the time. How do you not know when one of the stations decides to send it on the air. Can anyone tell me which file company does it, so I can write to them and see if they will publish it? I only took the last hour and a half yesterday and saw it only once last year. My sisters and I are looking for it in all the stores that sell any video. John Denver is an excellent singer and actor and the plot is fantastic. They release some much older films and I think it's great, but there are a lot of them that haven't published and I think if we could contact the producers and give voice to our requests we could have them published on DVD.
