I saw it the week it was opened four years ago and I really didn't know what to expect not to know Sorrentino's work at that time. He created a very intriguing tale and at the touching end of a strange character, one for whom the phrase "life is for living" no longer applies. He overtook me at every turn and I was constantly surprised by the story. I really liked the rhythm and the way the pieces were gradually given to me to understand what was happening. Tony Servillo is superb, as is Magnani. It opens with a wide and elegant shot and ends with a very moving image that takes the film into a sublime territory. I thought a long time later about the main character and the position he was in and his final fate and I didn't shake him for weeks. I recently bought the movie and that final scene where he thinks his friend finds me every time. I still have to talk to anyone who has seen this. It is a pity that it has not reached a wider audience as if this were the direction of Italian cinema, it can only be a good thing.
