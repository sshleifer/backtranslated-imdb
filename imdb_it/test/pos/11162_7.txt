Hey, this Ralf Westhoff seems to know a lot about people! We have nine women and nine men attending a speed dating event, each person has five minutes to talk to each other. A good idea to make a movie out of these conversations. And even better: it works very, very well! The dialogue is witty, original and authentic, each person is subtly characterized, without falling into the trap of clichés, something unusual for German films, he recalls: all these years, we Germans were tormented by stupid zeitgeist comedies like "Workaholic" or " Stadtgespräch ". <br /> <br /> But now the time has come for young German directors to do their own thing and run the risk of producing fun, funny, intelligent and at the same time sensitive films. Also the timing of "Shoppen" is good: although it presents mainly dialogues, it maintains tension and interest. After a while, you're really curious to see how this man and that woman would do it. Some of the participants will meet later for a two-some, it's fun to see them interact together in "real life". Of course, the film has some drawbacks: isn't it very cinematic (but can it be such a film?), The musical soundtrack could have been better, but all this is only marginal. <br /> <br /> The most important thing about this movie: we have some damn good actors here. Imagine this: all are still quite unknown even here in Germany (most came from the Munich theater or the Bavarian scene). But I foresee that among the 18 main actors, at least 11 will soon become well known in the film and in the television scene here. It's nice to see so many fresh and at the same time talented faces. Well done! <br /> <br /> For those who want to learn more, here's a rundown of all 18 actors: (spoiler!) <br /> <br /> Sebastian Weber: The silent waters are deep! Memorize his monologue "Flower garden", you can win the heart of every woman with this. <br /> <br /> Anna Böger: An infernal woman! Every time you open your mouth, you can't help but laugh and feel good. Listen as he pronounces "asshole" and calls the pink shirt guy a "Bürscherl"! <br /> <br /> Felix Hellmann: The "Bürscherl" from above is fun to watch. The inconvenient truth is that there are too many of those guys around. His looks remind me somehow of Flo Weber of "Sportfreunde Stiller". <br /> <br /> Katharina Schubert: This woman has everything: love, hope, despair, beauty. His "do you want want" scene is a classic. A great actress of which we will hear again, no doubt. <br /> <br /> David Baalcke: Now is this guy a loser or not? Almost as authentic as Paul Giamatti in "Sideways". I hope this is NOT the way to act. <br /> <br /> Julia Koschitz: The "good-looking" woman in the circle. Julia played theater in my hometown, congratulations! I think it will appear on many TV series to come. <br /> <br /> Martin Butzke: The revolutionary type captures the prettiest and most conventional woman in the end. Would you like to share a taxi with this guy? <br /> <br /> Kathrin von Steinburg: She gave a wonderful performance in "Tatort" last year. His trance performance in this film is no different. SEE her pretty face and FEEL her dirty laugh. The best scene in the film belongs to her. <br /> <br /> Matthias Bundschuh: I know that these "write everything", they come back from school. I'm not sure the hot blonde had his allergic reaction because of him or his cat. Matthias's portrait of such a chicken is exceptional. <br /> <br /> Mediha Cetin: The sister-in-law of my ex-girlfriend was the same speaker as you. The day I met her was the only day in my life when I needed tranquilizers, such bad memories here. <br /> <br /> Thomas Limpinsel: The "handsome and desperate boy" in the circle. Limpinsel has a comedic talent that is much better than most so-called "comedians" on TV. Lisa Wagner: The victim of the metaphor of Sebastian's "flower garden". Lisa's face is funny and full of melancholy, her story made me feel good and sad at the same time, wow! <br /> <br /> Oliver Bürgin: The "good-looking" man in the circle. No wonder he finally captures Julia. These two are really in tune. I think it will appear on many TV series to come. <br /> <br /> Julia Heinze: The "pretty, conventional" woman. I hope you will not be underestimated: Julia's face changes from naive to wounded and furious are great! <br /> <br /> Stephan Zinner: The "nature boy" from Partenkirchen loves to cook, eat ?? and good sex. Look at the body language between him and the hot blonde! Zinner usually plays the CSU Söder politician on stage! <br /> <br /> Anja Klawun: The "business girl" has a good time, but, sorry, she (like most actors) fails to stage a drunk on the screen. br /> <br /> Christian Pfeil: Reproduces the arrogant and narcissistic boy. I could not believe that this same actor owns two arthouse cinemas in Munich. <br /> <br /> Tanja Schleiff: Reproduces the sleeping girl with every man around. I am sure that many male visitors will go to pick it up. I've heard that she too can play dramatic roles, so I'm curious.
