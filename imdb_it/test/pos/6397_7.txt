This show was a crap when he first entered. The first actress who played the daughter did not fit the role, the writing was inconstant, and Damon Wayans was not comfortable making a family friendly show. The chemistry between him and Tisha Cambell (they are longtime friends, as are all the Wayans clans with Tisha's husband and Will Smith and Jada Pinkett) worked, so they reorganized the show. Once back, they rebuilt their daughter, made their son much dumber (an Eric from "Boy Meets World") and turned their youngest daughter into a genius ... (later they gave her a little genius to make appearances comedies). The show, although often the roller coaster from beyond the highest antics to becoming mawkish, the row is enough to keep it as a show that you can see Damon Wayans feeling comfortable on the set (especially by the main writers, directors and consultants ALL members of the Wayans family) And in his character. Once everyone had been on the show for a while, they worked for all the strengths of the dies and were able to create a show that was always fun on the air. <br /> <br /> However, there is too much buffoonery, too many over the antics, and often too much chaos occurs in the life of the Kyle family. They made Junior TOO STUPID, they also made the eldest daughter an attractive and clumsy idiot from time to time and the younger daughter was not even spared by the writers. I feel that they jumped the shark and signed the show sentenced to death when Junior got her girlfriend pregnant, she moved in and got married to her and her parents were introduced (the character of the father of Junior's wife makes me believe to WINCE). The show remained fun ... but it was a UPN show on ABC if it makes sense to the reader. <br /> <br /> Replicas are pretty fun, but I'm relieved it's over ... there was no place left to go with it. When it is bad it is REALLY BAD. He usually tends to be a little cornball, but at least he was a black man who had a sitcom that led him to spread on a large network. Who can say it now? (Given the CW merger and the "brownout" on television networks lately, this is). One.
