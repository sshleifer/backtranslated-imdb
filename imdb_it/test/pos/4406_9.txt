As someone who spent hours wandering around the back streets of north London in an attempt to avoid the horrendous congestion, this film immediately appealed. I throw my interest in what was London in the late 1970s and you have the basic premise for my version of TV paradise! On paper, the film marked all the right boxes and, having just seen "The Knowledge", the real film was up to, if not exceeded, my expectations. <br /> <br /> Visually, I was surprised London looked back (I lived in Islington in the 1990s, long after gentrification had transformed the area). It really came out as filthy, shabby and down heels. London may still have bad real estate, but the general atmosphere of the place is much cleaner, brighter and more pleasant today (based on what this film shows rather than my memories). <br /> <br /> As for the story and acting, the best grades obviously go to Nigel Hawthorne as The Vampire. Absolutely brilliant! He acts deliberately in an unpredictable way, alternating between total severity and surreal mental games to excite the Teens of Knowledge as he tests them after tests. <br /> <br /> All in all it was an excellent journey, really enjoyable again at a very specific time and place that I find infinitely fascinating. But even if you're not particularly interested in London in 1979, you'll still have fun following the witty dialogue and the friendly characters of "The Knowledge".
