A chick that still likes Ragazzi - Yes! Wonderful. Now I can have fun, enjoy the company of my girlfriend, and not feel like I can't wait until the end of the movie! Light - but fun. Big things. What ever you do not miss the extra DVDs. This is also a big "blind date" file. Will Smith does well in this - even if it is light acting - he pulls everything very well. The film is a bit slow in pace - don't expect too much action - laughter is there - and so is the message - but times are a bit slow. Use the low moments to whisper or kiss - it will take over. The finish makes the feeling of good moments worth it. Most of all expect a light-hearted entertainment - and watch a bit of awe from the secondary actors - they make the movie. The twists and turns are predictable - but it's a given move, so get the popcorn refills from the kitchen - and don't let it pause. Count on more dates after this movie - you will want to see which one will be next in line. Remember Hitch's advice !!! <br /> <br /> Enjoy yourself.
