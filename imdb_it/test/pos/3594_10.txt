What I liked most in this film was the scenery of Corfu, being Greek I love my country and I liked the point of view of the flattering director. Based on a true story during the years when Greece was struggling to stand on its own through war, the Nazis and the difficulties. An Italian soldier and a Greek girl fall in love, but times are difficult and they have many sacrifices to make. Nicholas Cage, who looks handsome in uniform, gives a passionate account of this unsatisfied love (in the beginning). He adores Christian Bale who plays Mandras as the heroine's future husband, he looks very good as a Greek, his personality has matched that of the Greek patriot! A real fighter in there, or what! One of the movies I'd like to buy and keep it in my collection ... forever!
