Ben Marshall, a teenager of religious origins, is made aware of the mother's internal financial situation, the dominant mother. She suggests he find a temporary job to contribute to the family. In fact, the family was widowed on board with them. Robert Marshall, the father, is a pastor of the local church; would much rather be in the country watching the birds than taking care of the souls entrusted to his church. <br /> <br /> The job that Ben addresses is with an older actress, Evie Walton, who wants him to do things for her around the house. "Dame" Evie, as she defines herself, is a woman of a certain age whose career has died perhaps because she was not so exceptional. In fact, the only memorable appearance seems to be in a soap opera that was popular, but she preferred to forget about it. Evie, who is a compulsive liar, tells Ben that he is dying, just to conveniently forget her, later when the boy gets clean. <br /> <br /> Ben is obviously intimidated by the larger personality of his employer's life. He took driving lessons. Evie asks him to take a camping trip, which he does against his best judgment. He knows he will provoke his mother's fury. Not content with this, Evie decides to go to Edinburgh, where she was invited to read at an arts festival. It is this journey that solidifies their bond. Ben meets and savors the pleasures of meat with a nice Bryony. <br /> <br /> When Ben returns, everything collapses at home. His mother, who had an affair with a parishioner, decides to leave the family in favor of the young man with whom he had an affair. The relationship between Ben and Evie survives the test of time. He also begins to see his father in a different light. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Brock, the writer of "Driving Lessons" and other memorable British films, makes his first job as a director with this compelling comedy. The mix of show business and religion, loyalty and friendship, are explored in his cinematic treatment making it a fun time in the cinema. We saw the similar situation first as in "Billy Elliott", where Julie Walters plays an educational role with a younger man. We had read that the film was based on Mr. Brock's experience while working with Dame Peggy Ashcroft when he was young. <br /> <br /> Julie Walters, who plays Evie Walton, is perhaps the best excuse to watch the movie. She always delivers. Mrs Walters is a welcome presence in every film that appears and performs wonders with her false "lady". Laura Linney, herself a brilliant musician, doesn't like her cold mother enough. Rupert Grint, famous for his Harry Potter films, plays Ben, the young man who sees Evie as a kind soul. Nicholas Farrell is the betrayed father. Michelle Duncan has a small role in which she shines.
