The "old dark house" subgenre that dominated the first talkies rarely fails to disappoint when we see the old men again today. Here is one that provides so many suspicious characters that you have to ask yourself how they will be able to tie all the free sides into 6-roll marching time. <br /> <br /> Crooked Circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to take revenge on Col. Walters (Berton Churchill) who sent one of their ranks to prison. They decide he must die that same night. Meanwhile, the Colonel's group, The Sphinx Club, is determined to protect him at all costs. This does not go well with the girlfriend Thelma (Irene Purcell) of the member of the Brand Osborne club (Ben Lyon, late compared to HELL'S ANGELS (1930), who has a limited budget that wants him to leave the club and stop putting in danger his own life. The brand promises to resign after saving the colonel's life. Everyone heads for Walters' newly purchased home on Long Island to await the killer. <br /> <br /> The colonel could be the new owner of Melody Manor but it's a dark old house with quirky neighbors (like Raymond Hatton as a local hermit) and maybe even a ghost. Zasu Pitts, top of the turnover, is Nora, the housekeeper who expects to see a spirit around every corner Throw a policeman (James Gleason) who is certain that Brand is a criminal and we have an image that is full of action and surprises. <br /> <br /> You will immediately notice that the writer was at a loss to create too many windows of dialogue because molt the characters repeat the same lines several times. Yoganda (C. Henry Gordon) a Hindu mystic (whose films of that time were loaded) says "Evil is coming". many times and I lost count of how often Mrs Pitts says "Something always happens to someone!". There are many suspects and two characters (Mr. Gleason as the stupid stereotype policeman and Roscoe Karns as a friend of Mr. Lyon) who serve as relief from the comedy. The house itself is rightly disturbing (in fact I think the same set was used in THE PHANTOM (1931)) with a lot of secret passages and violin music coming out of empty rooms, but somehow you never really feel the feeling of danger. Maybe it's because no one in the movie, and I mean no one, is all they seem to be. In the end everything comes to an end; but going into every extra detail would ruin it for you. <br /> <br /> Watch carefully Robert Frazer (from WHITE ZOMBIE) and Frank Reicher (better remembered as Capt. Engelhorn of KING KONG) to appear among the suspects. <br /> <br /> THE CROOKED CIRCLE is a fun movie. Some aspects of the plot are predictable and therefore others are not. I suspect you'll like it.
