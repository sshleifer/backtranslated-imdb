Having dabbled in the modeling industry (as a model), I watch this show with a slightly different view than most people. While I admit that the ANTM can be a fun and entertaining show, with the passing of the seasons it seems to continue to move away from any reality. <br /> <br /> The show seems to be almost pure publicity for its competitors, as none of the show's winners (or its mates) made a name for itself from under the show's umbrella. Perhaps because the truth is that any girl with a real potential to be a haute couture model shouldn't have too much difficulty showing up to the agencies (you can do it by email or regular mail if the distance prevents you from participating in an open call of the agency ), sign an agency and start a modeling career. Yes, the process does not guarantee success, but ANTM apparently does not. And participating in a reality show seems to give less impetus to the business of modeling, rather than joining a top or decent agency (which only a competitor each cycle still has a guarantee). <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the show can't hurt, it certainly can be fun, and it has a kind of magic that works especially for teenagers, I found. However, I must add, ANTM can get a bit tiring and boring, after seeing several cycles, as it has become for me. And besides some unrealistic situations (each more outrageous than the previous one) the only other annoyance, is the excessive use of "Tyra, Tyra, Tyra!" Tyra seems to really want to guide these girls towards success, but it is necessary that each of the time models of models be covered in the images of Tyra; for virtually every panel and challenge, include a story or scenario that "Tyra" has experimented and passed? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, you pull out a bit of Tyra, get a little more reality, and ANTM could be a 10-star show instead of a 7.
