"Ideas are dangerous." Comment by an interviewee. <br /> <br /> DVD Classification: B + / 4 on 5/8 on 10 / Worth the time. <br /> <br /> A great story for adult navigators, but not for children. None of the stupid things about violent crime so often mistaken by Hollywood these days as "quality work". And, it can be used as a film for coaches on what is appropriate navigation preparation, or not, before "navigating the seven seas". The film starts a little slowly to develop the story like most documentaries, but as it draws the viewer into the saga, the emotions begin to seep into the head! Emotions include anger, sadness and disbelief. The era: the end of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> That solitary world-wide is dangerous is not surprising. What is surprising are all the turns that viewers would not expect. It's not an average group of guys in a sailing competition! Each boat was different as allowed by the rules of the race. Each lone sailor had different skill levels as allowed by the rules of the race. There were well known sailors among them and some not so well known. One was considered a mysterious man because no one seemed to have any knowledge of his abilities. Every boat was authorized to leave at will as long as everyone was on course by a certain date. And this was, of course, before modern electronics that allowed mariners to communicate with the coast about violent storms, etc. <br /> <br /> Actual video and audio recordings are interspersed with interviews with family members and other people involved. The mood of the interviewees is always grim despite the past years. <br /> <br /> The main character, Don, is the center of attention and how his journey relates to those who not only wanted to beat but, due to circumstances of his own creation, he had to beat. He had to win. The story was about what this circumstance did to his life when he moved south-west across the Atlantic ocean for a period of time alone in the water. <br /> <br /> The "special features" section of the DVD is NOT missing once the movie is finished. The entire saga is not completely understood without displaying the "bonus" material. <br /> <br /> In the end, once you've seen everything on the DVD, you probably shake your head and exclaim, 'Wow.' And remember: that's why the story has been alive for the last 40 years. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: DO NOT see the "special features" section of the DVD once the movie is finished. A sailor who returned to England after circumnavigating the globe decided on the fly that, no, he was about to do another round and the film records his wife's opinions on that decision. The opposite story develops while another sailor wants the race to allow two on board to bring his wife and their photos show a very warm union between them. The interview with a former burley paratrooper who had actually driven a boat across the Atlantic with a friend before the solo sailing race was incredibly fun as he described not even knowing how to set sail and who thought bad things that happened to him were normal . 'Too many people think that sailing offshore can be a romantic adventure without misadventures. Don't be one!
