Where the hell is Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly? Paradise? Hell? A parallel universe? When the annoying man gets off the subway platform and meets a running train, his next conscious moment occurs on a bus; ride the solo, the latest arrival, in a hellish world where all suicides go. Dressed as he was at the time of his sudden departure from the body's biosphere, Andreas is greeted by an official man, who processes and transports the annoying man from the desolate plains to a city, if the eyeballs work, it is a dead ringtone for the one sort of urban landscapes that once lived, if the memory served him in the right way. Andreas maintains the appearance of a somnambulist in a trance, a stranger to people and objects, struggling to find his orientation; at home, or rather, his assigned apartment; or at work, where the annoying man is randomly designated as an accountant for an independent contractor. Havard (Johannes Joner), his boss, tells him "you'll get used to it", which covers more than just numbers, we suspect, in this world, like the old world. <br /> <br /> If life has no meaning, as the French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Satre said, the same applies to death. The subculture of office life could be heaven for a man, but to us it seems like hell, in the context in which "Den Brysomme Mannen" operates. Working in the afterlife, in essence, is working for the rest of your life. The social relationship between Andreas's office mates can normally pass into the physical world, but death is a variable that creates estrangement in the viewer, as he now recognizes the thankless work of white-collar workers performed by white workers, who kill hours with their irrelevant speech of small dimensions and the designated jobs that they perform during the course of the day like the automotons, every day, seem irrational in its absolute self-absurdity. To see everyday life replicated in a speculative light, "Den Brysomme mannen" makes normal human interaction like an impassive comedy, while everyday life becomes a performance, which transforms Karl Marx's meaning of the word "alienation", because here, men and women in the office "identify" with their work, as actors in a theatrical work that conspire to make their romanticized selves appear real. But the annoying man never fully participates in the facade. He is always aware of the cracks. <br /> <br /> From a wooden bench, Andreas is witness of the consequences of a jumper, who impales himself on an iron fence while the people in their lunch breaks walk beside, indifferent to his intestines that run away creating sketches red on the clean pavement. Andreas faces the same impassiveness of his own collaborators after he has deliberately cut his finger, with the hope that he will feel pain, on a sheet of paper. Not him. It's just another feeling, besides being able to taste and smell that is lost to the annoying man. This inability to be able to become familiar with simple pleasures amplifies the annoying man's need for love, where simple pleasures compensated for his loneliness in the physical world. At a dinner hosted by his boss, Andreas meets Anne Britt (Petonella Barker). They hit him. He takes her back home. She invites him to enter. They become a couple. He moves. When they have sex, however, it is not good for Andreas, nor for Anne, who seems to get more pleasure from interior design. Love is an abstract concept, another unattainable feeling in this world, but love is important for the annoying man, so try again with Ingeborg (Birgette Lagen), a girl at work. "Den Brysomme mannen" deconstructs love by presenting its foundations as a series of gestures that require performance from both men and women. When Ingeborg does not arouse the same tender feelings for Andreas after his hyper-romantic gesture of leaving Anne Britt for her, this Norwegian film reveals its secrets about the prosaic, but strange city, with an open-ended that is solvable and offers interpretations multiple. <br /> <br /> Wounded by Ingeborg's apathy towards his declaration of love for her, the annoying man wanders in the same subway station, stands on the same platform, smiles at the same couple who aggressively does out and jump. This time, he can't die. How can you die when you're already dead? Hit repeatedly by train after the train, Andreas's face turns into ground meat; his body writhes in angles previously seen only in art. When the annoying man realizes that love and death are beyond his reach, look for the club man, who is willing to say what is not said in this city of the living dead. That is: death, not life, has no meaning. <br /> <br /> Getting to the bottom of the mystery behind the place where Andreas moves the narrative, and the merit of the filmmaker, this enigma is addressed satisfactorily, in a scene reminiscent of "Being John Malkovich" by Spike Jonze , when Andreas crawls through a tunnel to cross another world, like a baby, reminiscent of Malkovich's brain portal that Craig Schwartz charges people for crawling. Andreas' attempt to cross the great rift presents a seductive paradox. Since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall, this vulnerable border serves as a perfect encapsulation of the atheistic belief that "heaven is a place on earth". But at the same time, heaven is proved by the reality of hell; the place where Andreas is sent after being banned from the destination city.
