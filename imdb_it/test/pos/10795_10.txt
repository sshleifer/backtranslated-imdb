I've seen it a couple of times and I'm completely glued to it every time. It is very full of suspense and intense. Describing sounds boring, but it's surprising. It's the kind of movie you need, you can't miss anything, but if you immerse it in it it will stick to you long after it's finished. Now thinking about it, I don't even know what Stone is trying to show us. Just the story of Alan Green? I don't think so. It was a look at ignorance, stupidity, self-absorption and a boy who was simply losing his grip. Perhaps he had more grip than the listeners. I didn't like Barry, but he still seemed worried about him for some reason. I was puzzled as to why I couldn't get it out of my mind when the movie ended. I wish I could see inside Olive Stone's mind for this.
