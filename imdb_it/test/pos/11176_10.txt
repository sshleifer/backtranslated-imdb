What can I say? The curse of Monkey Island is fantastic. The story is good and solid, but appropriately silly, the jokes are hilly, the puzzles are puzzling ... you couldn't ask for more in an adventure game. The "You don't need to see my identification" bit is in itself worth buying the game, not to mention Murray, which has become the hot topic among many of my friends (only some of whom have played). You will love this game. And if you don't, it's a pity!
