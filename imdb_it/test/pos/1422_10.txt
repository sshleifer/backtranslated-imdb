Robert Jordan is a television star. Robert Jordan likes things in an orderly, punctual and properly executed way. In his world children must be seen, not listened to. So why does Mr. Jordan want to become the master of a rowdy boy scout band? Ratings. His staff thinks that if he learns to interact with young people, they will be more inclined to watch his show. Of course watching Jordan Cope understands most of the fun. <br /> <br /> Like Mr. Belvedere and Mr. Belvedere going to college, this will surely please you. <br /> <br /> ANYONE INTERESTED IN GETTING A COPY OF THIS FILM, PLEASE WRITE TO: IAMASEAL2@YAHOO.COM
