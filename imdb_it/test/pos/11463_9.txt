At first I saw this movie in a Times Square cinema in the late 1980s. Who would have thought that this film would have generated two sequels and would have followed this cult. Nights of the Demons was like most other movies released at the time. A group of horny teenagers find themselves trapped in an isolated club and then killed by one at a time in various gruesome ways. Come to think that the formula is still used and seems to work as demonstrated by the Saw II that I saw recently. <br /> <br /> I saw Mimi Kinkade at a Fangoria convention over six years ago and she was so kind from the heart! I suppose she's a good actress if she could make a career out of playing this demon-possessed woman in all these horror movies. However, I have just finished shooting this film on a VHS tape and this still holds. A little slow in the beginning as I remembered when I saw it for the first time, but then quickly resumed the rhythm. One of the horror classics of the 80s and worth a look!
