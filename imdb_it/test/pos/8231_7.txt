It is a modest and modest traditional West with a terrific plot on the opposition between farmers and farmers around the city of Liberal, Kansas. History is essentially routine and presents a series of classic Western conflicts. There is the farmer against the cowherd; there is the clash between the cultivated land and the "civilizing" tendencies on the one hand and the desert / border ethos on the other and what it ultimately represents is the opposition of two systems of values, democratic and community values ​​as opposed to each other to harsh individualism. /> <br /> Randolph Scott plays the legendary man of law Bat Masterton who rides in liberal for want of a ground agent (Robert Ryan) to help him solve the bad guys who are the hard drinkers and thugs. The two men fight but get together to deal with the problematic elements of the city. <br /> <br /> The script is a cliché but the action is vigorously pushed by director Ray Enright and there are solid interpretations all of it. In addition to the robust performances of the male protagonists, there is a comical relief provided by George Gabby Hayes, a greasy villain played by Steve Brodie and interesting contributions by Maggie Meredith as a real oriental, courted by Ryan and Anne Jeffreys as a singing sedan Until the originality is appreciated, this is good entertainment for Western lovers
