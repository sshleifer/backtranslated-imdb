A talented senior graduate with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state-of-all-high-school football game. When she meets and falls in love with an attractive local girl, she helps him understand that he has a chance to get a "full ride" scholarship if he plays well. <br /> <br /> Too often, these dramas fall into the same old story of a troubled and confused teenager. Matt Sabo of FULL RIDE certainly fits this profile, but below the surface he is a much more unique individual than what we usually see in this genus. Matt is the center of the action and is a realistic teenager, both too confident and vulnerable, optimistic and cynical in turn. Influenced by Amy, Matt becomes a man of character and heart. He, in turn, forms friendships with his teammates, which influences his growth as an athlete and as a team player. <br /> <br /> FULL RIDE has all the elements we love to see in a movie - great acting, admirable characters, exciting sports scenes, dramatic drama and a love story. However, while one may have seen these elements in other films, FULL RIDE is assisted by sincere and occasional performances, even in motion. Perhaps the most impressive thing about FULL RIDE is its sense of reality. Although the author of the previous comment seems to disagree, (clearly a dissatisfied student who, for obvious reasons, received a poor grade in his film class), director Mark Hoeger bases the film in a situation and position credible and does a great job of getting down to the grit of what life in a small town is like. These characters are real people rooted in realistic situations, which often create the most compelling entertainment. At one level it is a love story, in another it is a study of the characters, and yet another is a simple soccer film. All these ideas come together to form a cohesive vehicle.
