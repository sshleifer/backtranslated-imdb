This movie could be the best ever if you like watching movies, laughing and then having your friends watch those movies too. If you are like me, and probably you will be, you will laugh for the coming years at the jokes of this movie. One of the funniest parts is when Gus makes money with a boy with children and then the boy brings those kids to the forest like Hansel and Gretel, then he and his wife go home with them. The kitchen of the soup scene is full of comic buffoonery genius: "Control officer - Here!" and the lines to follow will probably remain in my mind forever. When I showed this film to my friends, they usually say "What was that?!?" so if you're in the mood for one of those types of movies, yes! This film is so OOP that it is no longer fun, so probably the easiest way to do it would be online auctioning. The first time I saw it was from a rent.
