Jingofighter I agree with some of your comments, but I disagree on a couple of things. First of all, this film doesn't look like THE CARS THAT ATE Paris. Not IMHO. Nothing like it. <br /> <br /> I think the film has elements of surrealism, but I think the director's basic approach is not "surrealistic" per se. so it's not very similar to CARS Paris, I think more of a strange work in euros, with some scenes that bear the not surreal "wierd" mark. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I think Heuzenroeder's music is brilliant. They used the whistle, that old country and western record sound, and its waaayyy better than most Australian movies that usually team up with an indy-sounding band that the company wants to push. <br /> <br /> As for the name of the movie - I don't know why it's called Modern Love, I was hoping in a sense that David Bowie appeared dressed in drag and lipstick ... opps I'm starting to show my age.
