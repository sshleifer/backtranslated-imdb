This is without doubt one of Neil Simon's best films turned into a movie. It is full of great characters and memorable dialogues. Johnathan Silverman does a great screen version of the young Eugene (he was played by Matthew Broderick on stage). This is the first of Simon's autobiographical trilogy, followed by the wonderful "Biloxi Blues", and ends with the TV movie "Broadway Bound". If I had to say that the film has some flaws, perhaps it would be that the characters sometimes usually speak in an obvious dialogue, but that's okay because it's a great dialogue. Rent this little gem, you won't regret it!
