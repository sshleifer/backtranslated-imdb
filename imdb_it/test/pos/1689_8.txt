The film was certainly true to the true story of life on which it was based. It was hard for me to find newspaper articles about real facts, but when I found them, I could see that the truth, in this case, was stranger than fiction. Judith Light was frighteningly evil in her role as a mother in this film, so much so that it was difficult to separate her from the role, the brand is thinking of an excellent performance. Rick Schroder was rightly unaware of his son, who also defended her in court, an example of how difficult it can be in some circumstances for a child to accept a parent's actions, no matter how criminal they may be. You can find fault with the film, but not with the way it treats the reality on which it is based.
