Shohei Imamaura's Black Rain was published in 1989 right at the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, a fact that gives the film the slow deterioration of Hiroshima radiation victims. The black rain in the title refers to the combination of ash, radioactive fallout and water that fell one or two hours after the explosion. There have been other books and films about the atomic bomb launch, but none as unique and powerful as this. Based on a novel by Masuji Ibuse that collected information from interviews and diaries of victims of real bombs, the film describes how an entire family is psychologically and physically influenced by the bomb years after the original explosion. It is a terrifying vision but it resonates with deep compassion for humanity. <br /> <br /> The film begins in Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, when soldiers and civilians do their normal daily activities. Suddenly a blinding light flashes and you hear a thunderous burst. Almost every single building is destroyed or irreparably damaged. The first atomic bomb ever fallen in a city is now part of history. The survivors must somehow start their lives again, unaware of the devastating effects of the bomb. Shot in high-contrast black and white, the story centers on Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka), a young woman who is caught in the radioactive rain as her boat returns to the city in search of friends and relatives. In Hiroshima, Imamura shows us indelible images that remain with us: a boy with the skin hanging from his body begs his brother to recognize him, an older man cries for his inability to free his son from piles of rubble, a mother is tormenting as he strikes his son's blackened body. <br /> <br /> When the family returns to their rural home, Yasuko's life has changed forever. He sees his friends dying around her and waits for the inevitable attacks of radiation sickness that have already struck his uncle Shigematsu Shimuza (Kazuo Kitamura) and Aunt Shigeko Shimuza (Etsuko Ichihara). Pretending that there is only business as usual, the family denies that the bomb hit Yasuko. "He has forgotten how Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed, everyone has forgotten it, they forget the hell of fire and they go to the rallies like an annual festival, I'm sick of it," says a friend Katayama (Akiji Kobayashi). Yasuko internalizes the tragedy, feeling ashamed to be different from others and guilty of being contaminated. <br /> <br /> When his aunt and uncle try to find her a husband, the eligible men refuse to marry her due to suspicions about her health, even though Shigematsu copied his diary to prove that he was not directly exposed to the bomb. The only suitor with whom he feels at ease is another injured man, Yuichi (Keisuke Ishida), who has a panic attack every time he hears the roar of an engine. In the end, the beauty of life always shows itself so fleetingly when Yasuko goes to the pond and sees a show he has always wanted all his life, the carp king jumping into the water, jokingly as if to say that beyond despair there is still joy. We sadly hear in the radio statements by politicians about the use of the bomb once again in the Korean war. "Humans don't learn anything," says Shigematsu. "They strangle each other, unjust peace is better than a war of justice, why can't they see?" We hope that Immamura's Black Rain has allowed us all to see more clearly.
