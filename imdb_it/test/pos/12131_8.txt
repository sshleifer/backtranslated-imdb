I agree with Vince, this film paved the way for Goodfellas. The scene in which Pisces was throwing peanuts at the pianist reminded me of his "How am I funny?" routine in good guys. This is an undervalued film and deserves attention. As with many other mob movies, the theme of The Death Collector sounds true: always respect the Don.
