Well, I could be a prejudice while I grew up watching a VHS copy of this movie that is now ready to shoot and I just spent the last couple of hours tracking down a DVD copy like a birthday press for my dad. The film is so harmless and harmless suitable for all ages .... much better than anything else that Disney has ever done in my opinion (and I worked in the Disney Store !!!). The characters are fun and the prize for the best scene is a link between the broken marriage (especially the musical talents of Swat, the fly and Smack the mosquito) and the night club scene. The musical numbers make me buzz again 20 years after I saw it for the first time. there is no other film that I can recommend better while I'm babysitting, and in fact every child I know (thanks to my loving parents of Hoppity) has seen this movie, many times. He will always get top marks for his fabulous love story, a brilliant madman and above all for originality.
