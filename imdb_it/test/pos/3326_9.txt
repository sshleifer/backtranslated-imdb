I can't help but notice the negative reviews obtained from this film. To be honest, I saw the preview of this movie, and the premise intrigued me. Yes, I rented it after reading the comments of others. They are right in the sense that some aspects of acting leave much to be desired. They are also right in saying that one of the best interpretations of this film was that of Dr. Graves. <br /> <br /> Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant, the boy in the wheelchair. I identify with the character he played, maybe because I'm in a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> This film certainly deserves to be seen.
