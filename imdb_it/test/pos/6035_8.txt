This episode of Columbo is one of the best and perhaps one of my personal favorites. The cast includes Rosemary's Baby John Cassavetes as master, his wife played by Blythe Danner (Gwyneth Paltrow's mother) and her mother-in-law played by Myrna Loy (one of the greatest American actresses in the cinema of our time). However I don't agree with those who criticize this film. This episode is one of my favorites because you have an excellent cast that does a great job in the show. I love watching Columbo with his beloved dog he never mentioned in the series. This time, the episode focuses on classical music at the Hollywood Bowl, one of the attractions of L.A. Of course, Columbo becomes interested in classical music as does anything else related to a crime.
