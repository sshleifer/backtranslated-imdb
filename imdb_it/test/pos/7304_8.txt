I really enjoyed this film, but the feeling that came to me most was the memory of how much I enjoyed the novel. The film features two of the best actresses working today - Jessica Lange, who is fantastic here, and divine Jennifer Jason Leigh, who does the best she can with the little-by-bit character she is given - as well as a surprising surprise Michelle Pfeiffer and a constant Jason Robards. Adaptation is fundamentally true to the book, at least as faithful as it can be in an hour and forty minutes. The film is not really amazing, except for some scenes between Lange and Pfeiffer, but it does a very competent job in visualizing this wonderfully tragic story. As for the films adapted from the novels, this was certainly among the best. If nothing else, he sent me back to my shelves to rediscover favorite passages from Jane Smiley's excellent novel and return to King Lear to brush up on the minor characters to see how deep the parallels are. Definitely worth your time as a film, surely, and I hope enough to make you remember that reading great literature is also a joy.
