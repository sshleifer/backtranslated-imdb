Here is one of the nicest scuzzy items for blaxploitation grinders of the 70s; is a pervasive low rent brochure that looks like a more unfair version of "The Mack". John Daniels, the feminist and captivating hero of the hairdresser Mr. Jonathan in the immortal "Black Shampoo", gives an excellent representation of the Baron, a ruthless, business expert, forever about making the almighty meat vendor who to his dismay rough and brutal Italian rivals reign supreme on the Sunset Strip. When he's not closing his horns with his criminal friends without counting or doing his best to avoid being caught by local cops, Daniels is conducting a mildly average existence like the typical suburban guy of garden variety (complete with caring wife and loving children!) in a typically wet small California town. <br /> <br /> The incredibly absurd premise alone promises the highest quality trash of a variety of decidedly Grade B pictures (George Theakos deserves kudos for his hilarious script). Matt Cimber's laudably tactless and insipid direction carries the loose goods out of annoying anguish, making this film an extremely enjoyable service of celluloid filth. Among the squalid assorted delicacies to be enjoyed here are abundant free female nudity, vulgar dialogues, wonderfully gorgeous Me Decade strands (halter tops, felt hats, sparkling Day-Glo jewels, noisy seersucker dresses), an intensely R & B score funky Smoke, some hopelessly pathetic acting (the little old woman who lives next to Daniels is tremendously shrill), a memorable and bad turn of Patrick Wright as a sadistic madman, a couple of fantastic action pieces (the resounding massacre of bartenders that moves seriously seriously), another travel movie of the Sunset Strip of how much you can shake a feather boa (the movie presumably includes "the real prostitutes and the blades of the Hollywood Sunset Strip"), in reality obscure cinemas of Ken Gibb, some sick sexual tableaux fetish, some explicit violence (a prostitute has cut off one of her breasts!), And fun performances of support of famous perennial plants Richard Kennedy and George "Buck" Flower as a pair of racist, corrupt and intimidated police detectives. Of course, this film is not art, but it is certainly artless to qualify as a deliciously grungy piece of exquisitely fun sordid film.
