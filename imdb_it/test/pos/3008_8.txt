I give this movie a total of 8/10. Visually, much of it is nothing short of stunning: the dream mix of an art director of Hieryonomous Bosch, Salvador Dal√¨, Frieda Kahlo and Georgia O'Keeffe - and a valid testament to the power of the film as a serious art form. Beautiful use of color, shape, images, the environment and a fabulous setting decoration, combined with cutting-edge computer graphics. So, 10/10 for that! Wow! <br /> <br /> The plot is, well, more predictable. You know they will save the girl and eventually get the killer, but the story is still interesting and sharp enough to drag you in and keep you there. 6/10 for that. <br /> <br /> Squirm factor ... I will not give this rating, but the film definitely made me falter, and I was watching it on video on a TV screen. It would obviously have a greater impact on a big screen. The graphic violence of a twisted and erotic nature in a surreal landscape - even if beautiful - is highly unpredictable. The world inside the murderer's head is not - thank goodness! - my world. Since I watched this movie on video, I was able to play a couple of sequences and found a lot to admire the second time when I wasn't so nervous about where the scene could go, and I suspect the whole movie would go to see a second time, only for "visual art". <br /> <br /> General suggestion: do not bring conservative children or grandparents to this, but if you are passionate about the visual aspect of the films, like surrealist art, it does not matter a little vicious blood, and I just want do a little "mental journey", this is a winner. Oh, and if you're fond of girls, Jennifer Lopez is pretty sexy. <br /> <br />
