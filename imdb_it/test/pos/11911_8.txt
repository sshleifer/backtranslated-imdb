Being raised at the time this film was released has probably influenced my superficial mind, but still, this is not a bad movie at all. It's a film about a hostage situation that involves a school of preparation populated to some extent by endearing teenagers who can't get out of trouble. What's wrong? It doesn't have great special effects, but then? Who needs special effects? The decline of cinema began at the same time that special effects were popularized. A coincidence? I do not think so. He transformed the films with a potentially good plot and sensations and turned them into a great light show without substances for innocent and self-medicated children. Well, you know, not all movies need special effects. About three quarters of the movies on the IMDb Top 250 have no special effects, but almost all the most successful movies of all time have some special effects. Think about it: Star Wars, E.T., Ghostbusters, etc. All good films, but the rest of the films that collect the most is usually a triple clich√© with non-sensory textures and a lot of eye candy. Well, some movies don't need ny of that stuff. <br /> <br /> Sorry for making a bribe, which I normally do, but I'm so fed up with that garbage of special effects. Coming back to the point: Toy Soldiers is simply a great film. I admit, some of the content is a bit trivial and torn, but then, every film tears another to some extent. Think of Resovoir dogs. Countless sites of "appreciation" dictate the fact that the beloved Quentin Tarentino, whom I admit I like, has copied many, many, many films in the making of his first major film "Reservoir Dogs". Many say that the whole plot was almost torn away from scenes of Japanese and Chinese gangsters that Mr. Tarentino loved so much and probably still does. Sorry again for the bribe. <br /> <br /> Toy Soldiers is fun. He has all the insubordination of adolescents towards unwanted members of authority, that is, hostage takers. It's fun to see children take over when they're held in something they don't want to do. Hell, the adolescent rebellion inspired by anguish was the key topic of a large majority of the 80's comedies. Also there is the tension and the thrill of having the characters use firearms and knock out the bad guys, etc. Furthermore, there are some emotional points in the film. When one of the characters dies, the others must adapt and adapt. It's not perfect acting, but it beats most of the other tripes out there. <br /> <br /> In short, Toy Soldiers is exciting, interesting and fun. How dare you disdain fanatics consider this movie bad? Shame on you all! <br /> <br /> Personal rating: 8/10
