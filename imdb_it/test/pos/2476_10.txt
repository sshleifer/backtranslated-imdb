I saw pp the other night. I must say that I was very impressed with the real appearance of the film. It looked very much like a documentary. I also think the film presented realistic possibilities. In the film, the war in Vietnam intensified to the point where China was involved. What if it happened? I think the scenarios would be similar to those portrayed in the film. We've had camps before in this country ... and we still do it ... <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for everyone ... especially the radicals ... <br /> <br /> I continued to to say that if I was in the position in which those kids were there I was just stretching my ass. I love America and its great wars (the wink winks)
