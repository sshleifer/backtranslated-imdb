I watched this movie with my family during a long Thanksgiving weekend. I am grateful that someone insisted that we look at him, even though I didn't pay much attention until the end of the film, when a head cut seems promised, but unfortunately, it doesn't happen. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I watched this film a few years later and loved its liveliness, absurdity, twinkle and fun. I think the film has a feminine tone. Women are not exploited in it, although I am sure that someone might think that the film is pure exploitation. I think the movie plays with the tropes of the period. I keep thinking that someone should do it again. And embody some of the implications in the original.
