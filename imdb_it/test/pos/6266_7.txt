The kind and brilliant film seems to have been overlooked as a banality ... and to be honest, the narrative is a bit tenuous and light as a drama ... but I feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes that portray the first impact of a film the new art on an alien and skeptical society has a radiance and a naturalness that capture a century-long love story between cinema and the public better than any other film over the years. Immensely nice show by Jared Harriss (who seems to have inherited all of his father's charisma ... hopefully without poor Richards inclined to the hellish and itchy) ... and the fascinating unusual sweetness of the Yu Xia costars come together to make this a real warmer. The radiant photograph of locations (including wonderfully beautiful scenes of the Great Wall) and the sensible direction of Ann Hu give the film an added impact. In short, a must for anyone who is ever enchanted by a shadow that turns life ... and that makes magic in the dark.
