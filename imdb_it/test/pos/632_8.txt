I don't know how this film went unnoticed for so long. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on TV, I was browsing through the channels and I found this film unexpectedly well done. I lost the first one, probably 10 minutes, but it doesn't matter ... this movie literally made fun of me, it's a real chiller of thorns. <br /> <br /> The absence of famous actors in the film adds to the effect, you don't know what to expect from the actors because they are new. You never know when they will be killed or what they are doing. so it's even more tense. Although there are many new faces their performances have been first class. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers play with your mind, revealing enough blood to make the rest imaginable. Shock, fear, horror and powerlessness are also highlighted by the characters in the film. <br /> <br /> Well-written situations, fast camera movements, slippery editing and superb direction make it an excellent suspense. This film actually switches between genres - horror and suspense, leaving the viewer in the dark and tense. Undoubtedly comparable to Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> I wasn't even able to move off the TV even during commercial breaks ... I was the powerless MUTE WITNESS to this superb film.
