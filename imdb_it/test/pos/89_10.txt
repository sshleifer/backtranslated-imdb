This is a piece of cinematic beauty, and shows more of the Quebec culture to others than probably any other work that comes from the province of La Belle. Bring everyone into a first-person experience of culture, to the point that you want to stick your hair and live, breathe and eat everything Maurice Richard. The book does this and the short, and I'm glad that in all the time I spent studying French in high school, it was necessary to read in both languages. <br /> <br /> I thought it was brilliant to have Roch Carrier telling this story. Its molasses accent gave a lot of realism to the story. Even the animation was good, very surreal, which draws attention to the idea that this is an extravagant dream, fantasized in the past days. <br /> <br /> Again, as a symbol of the Quebecoise culture, this is unsurpassed. You can almost smell the tourtiere that is slowly cooked over a wood stove. The entire film deserves endless praise to make people proud to be Canadians and encourage us all to appreciate the most beautiful things in the family and our roots. I come from Ontario and this film made me fall in love with Quebec. Maurice Richard goes toujours vivre dans nos coeurs.
