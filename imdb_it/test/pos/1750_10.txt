When HOPPITY GOES TO THE CITY, it finds nothing but bad news for its little neighbors of insects in the Lowlands. Can this honest and good-natured grasshopper save his sweetheart, Miss Honey Bee, from the machinations of the evil C. Bagley Beetle - and bring his friends to a new safe home - before it's too late? <br /> <br /> Although not one of the great animated films (a very new art at the time this film was created), HOPPITY is a funny film that should bring pleasure to uncritical viewers. Technically it is well done, with generally high quality animation. The main drawback of the film is that none of the characters really has a "heart" - they are not "alive" on the screen the way Jiminy Cricket did a year before in PINOCCHIO. <br /> <br /> However, it is ultimately unfair to compare the output of Fleischer Studio with that of Disney. Max and Dave Fleischer had their star to follow; their contribution - and it would be considerable - would be in the realm of a cartoon reel. With their series, POPEYE and BETTY BOOP have created alternatives as valid as those produced by other comics studios. HOPPITY was their second experiment with the animation of the feature film (after GULLIVER'S TRAVELS in 1939), and from that moment on they would have spent their energies again on the short comic strip. In fact, the first of the very famous SUPERMAN series was already out. <br /> <br /> The story of HOPPITY owes much to Frank Capra, with his energy, going to look for a hero against powerful forces of society. In fact, the original title of the film was MR. BUG GOES TO TOWN, which immediately brings to mind Gary Cooper or Jimmy Stewart and their capraesca adventures. <br /> <br /> Jack Mercer, famous as Popeye's voice, speaks of two very different characters here, the old Mr Bumble & Swat the Fly. Filmmakers should be able to capture veterans Pinto Colvig and Mae Questel, both in non-accredited roles. <br /> <br /> The film contains some nice songs provided by Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser, of which `Be My Little Baby Bumble Bee 'is the most familiar. `We're The Couple In The Castle 'is a romantic melody that deserves to be rediscovered. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that the initial animation of the film, with its swept from the sky and beyond the depth of the New York skyline, is obscured behind the headlines.
