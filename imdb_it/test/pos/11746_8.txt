This film immediately catches the eye, with the striking aerial views of a very pretty Hong Hong. Shot in those rich colors of 1950s movies that modern blockbusters never seem to capture. Probably a sign of those times, because this is not a great power, seen everything before the film, full of devastation and violence. But there is chaos and violence in the background, with thousands of refugees trying to get out of China. This is a very moving and compelling story, full of hope and love in a tragic period, in recent history. The story of two people from different cultures who fall in love. And the accumulation with them trying to overcome this is the heart of this very beautiful and moving film.
