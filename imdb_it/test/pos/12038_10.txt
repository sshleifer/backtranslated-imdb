In the United States this is a difficult film, but if you can find it - and you're interested in the life and music of Percy Aldridge Grainger, you're ready for a surprise. It is quite historically accurate. Grainger of Richard Roxborough looks incredibly similar to Grainger in this historical period. Emily Woof's Karen Holten is a little prettier than the real Karen, but that was an inaccuracy that I was happy to find out (!). I think what really struck me was how Roxborough captured Grainger's outrageous personality. Barbara Hershey's rose was also a treasure. If she looks much younger than Rose at the time, she is more than compensated for the way she caught Rose's obsession with Percy. It is an easy film to recommend. (I should note that when she saw "Passion" my wife had no particular affinity for (or knowledge of) Grainger and her music, but she was totally fascinated by the movie.
