I saw this movie in Santa Monica on August 23 and stayed with me. I want to thank the directors for delving into the details of Harry's enigmatic, eccentric life. And also to show the defects and shortcomings of Nilsson the man. Thank you for showing the good and the bad, the ups and downs, and for discovering that extraordinary BBC video. The film is also a great showcase of a great deal of Nilsson's music, very well positioned during the film. I recommend this film to anyone who loves good documentaries, especially if you are interested in Harry Nilsson or the early 70s music scene. Some reviewers on the Is not It Cool website have written that this was the best movie they saw at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, and I believe it. The film is informative, fun, sad, touching and full of fantastic music. It happens on all levels. Really, really good.
