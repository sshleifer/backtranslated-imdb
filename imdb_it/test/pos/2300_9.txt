this particular title is very interesting. the whole movie was like watching a ninja RPG, which is really cool. three magic swords, three clans, a horrible demon, a political power, yotoden has it all. the animation is decent, but a little grainy, the story is top notch and the fight scenes are really fantastic. one thing that looks really nice in this movie is the monsters. they are rather bizarre. if you enjoyed the realm of blood and the ninja scroll, the yotoden is the one to see.
