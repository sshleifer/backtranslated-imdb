Whoever plays the part of J. Douglas Williamson in the poker strip scene does a great job. Apparently he did not receive any credits. Sin. <br /> <br /> All Dead End Kids do their work beautifully in this 1939 entry. It's strange to see them in a western setting with their Brooklyn accents (I guess it should be Bowery). They also show some swimming skills. <br /> <br /> I think there are many special scenes that can stay with the viewer of this boxing / love / crime story. My favorite is now in the fight scene towards the end of the film. Busby Berkeley shows his experience in dance cinema when John Garfield shifts his feet and as we watch that move, the camera rises in the face. I don't want to reveal why or when, but the appearance of his face at that point probably caused the 1939 audience to rise in theaters. <br /> <br /> Some will think that John Garfield looks a lot like Frank Sinatra in many scenes. Just his face Actually, Frank wasn't even making movies so maybe Frank looked like John. The boxer named Smith in the film looks like a clone of Ed Begley, Jr. <br /> <br /> Now I have to tell you something that is not a spoiler, but if you watch the movie, look at Grandma's hands. May Robson does her part well. Seems to have hands that wander a little. In a scene where she and a crowd go to the boxer's locker room (John Garfield), look where the reclining John touches while wearing only his trunks. <br /> <br /> A fantastic ending. Lots of wonderful characters. <br /> <br /> The best line could be at the gas station, "... eight liters, it's a twenty-eight dollar ..." Tom Willett
