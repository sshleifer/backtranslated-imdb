I have always loved Brenda Blethyn and "Undertaking Betty" was not a disappointment. I saw it on Satellite on the sad Sunday morning. Life was stressful and this movie made me laugh and see things that we usually consider terrible. I would like you to make more movies like this and "Saving Grace". Brenda Blethyn is a great girl for us as we approach 60 to see it in action. She is pretty, beautiful and full of life without appearing plastic and false. Not many actresses are out there to make us relate in a realistic, but comic and / or serious way. Brenda - if you see this - continue with gems like this. We need more Mrs. Bennetts, Bettys and Thanks.
