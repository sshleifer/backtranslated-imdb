We bought the DVD of "Walking with Dinosaurs" and we were almost ecstatic about the things that are done very well on it. <br /> <br /> Many DVDs today offer the bare minimum ... functionality itself, and perhaps another language (which does not help the viewer at all, but makes it easier for the company to see the DVD in more markets ). <br /> <br /> Not so in the case of WWD. There are so many wonderful extras and well thought vignettes that even looking at the * navigation menu * is interesting. The introductions to each chapter of the DVD of "The Making Of" are fun and entertaining. The sound and video quality is exceptional. And of course the story and the content ... what else could a dinosaur lover ask for? <br /> <br /> I watched most of the version broadcast on TDC (narrated by Avery Brooks) and then watched about half of the DVD (narrated by Kenneth Branaugh). As far as I can tell, the transmitted version has slipped into a series of slang mainly American narrative (ie in a section on the coupling of T. Rex, Branugh says "the female is tired of the attention of the male" and Brooks says The honeymoon is over ") and cut out some of the works of puppets closer. I prefer the Branugh version simply because it's more complete. <br /> <br /> In general, great value and a wonderful production. many compliments to the BBC and the crew that made this jewel.
