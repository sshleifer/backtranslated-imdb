At the first glance of this movie the camera angles make you immediately think that this is a low-cost movie that will bore you to tears or make you press the stop button. Surprisingly, the plot comes forward and is reproduced across the screen in a way that I feel more connected. I scored this movie at 7, but as most would like, I felt it should be a 10, you'll understand as you watch it because it's rare for a movie to be in touch with a person's feelings and how life should be shown a TV set. Most films try to leave you amazed by their special effects, twists, etc., This real-hand treated film showed a good movie backed by an Alabama-style plot that most would have been a good loss of a couple of hours. I wish I had put the popcorn maker after all well done!
