I just watched this movie at the Children's Program of the Berlin Festival and it just killed me (and pretty much everyone else in the audience)! And make no mistake, this film is part of the 250 of all time! Let me tell you that I am in no way associated with the creators of this film, if that is what you come to believe by reading this. No, but this is actually IT! The "children's film" label on it, "Klatretösen" ("Climber Girl") is practically a classic (as in "biblical")! The story concerns the twelve-year-old Ida (magnetic: Julie Zangenberg), who is devastated by learning about her father's terminal illness. Special surgery in the United States would cost 1.5 million and, of course, nobody could afford it. So Ida and his friends Jonas and Sebastian do what all good guys would do - and rob a bank! Does it seem trivial? Don't forget: this is not America and "Klatretösen" is not at all the extravagant Robin-Williams-multiplex-plat-du-jour that nobody takes seriously anyway. The director Fabian Wullenweber has set out to create an action comedy for big-budget kids and, boy, he did it! Let me tell you this: this film does not look like a children's film and few others have done it before. And there's more to it than just "action". After about 20 minutes of exposure of the numbers (well, discounted) it accelerates into a monster that: <br /> <br /> - makes the "impossible mission" uncomfortable (the numerous action sequences are masterfully staged and sounds really expensive - take that, mom!) <br /> <br /> - almost all other suspense-wise (not easy-are-just-kids-antics here) dwarfs <br /> <br /> - easily laces a dense story with enough laughter to make Jim Carrey look like alternatives to the career <br /> <br /> - he nods to both Damon runyon and karate kid in the same seconds <br /> <br /> - comes to mind so much wicked humor that side of the pc that I can hear the American charts wetting my pants down here <br /> <br /> - can actually be tender and serious and sexy at the same time (oh my God, what am I saying? "they are children! they are children! - no matter, look at the last scene!) <br /> <br /> - stars Stafan Pagels Anderson, who from the past "Mirakel" is the favorite actor of all children <br /> <br /> What a giro!
