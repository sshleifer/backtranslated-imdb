The theme of religion in Buñuel's films is a point that one, as a movie eater, as an art eater or as a person needs to barely analyze. You can see a satirical Buñuel in "La Voie Lactée", "Un Chien Andalou" or in "L'Age d'Or". It is very difficult and effective in his critic, but when you saw this and then you see a film like "Nazarin", after seeing this work he starts to be questioned about its author. And many have wondered about what appears to be a contradiction to Buñuel, but it is better not to be called that way, I think there is no contradiction in his work, only that the point of view of Buñuel's religion is very different as unique in the movies. <br /> <br /> This beautiful film is based on the novel by Benito Perez Galdós, which told us the story of Father Nazario, who lived a humble and simple life, dedicated to God and to help everyone. He lived in a simple and poor region. There also lived Beatriz, who is an abused and abandoned wife. He finds no meaning in his life without his violent macho man. You have a kind of rejection for him. On the other side is Andara, one of the prostitute cities. Father Nazario was stolen again, he blames the cousin of Andara. Andara listens to this and tries to fight unsuccessfully with the priest, who does not believe in violence. That night, Andara discovers that his cousin is actually a thief, he stole his bellboys. Andara fights with his cousin with terrible consequences. With this, Andara seeks mercy from the priest. Nazario decides to help her, knowing full well that this could be against her church, obviously this will have consequences. Since then, Nazario will be a pilgrim. Without anything, even without shoes, but with spirit and faith. But Andara and Beatriz want to be with him, and be like him, to serve God. <br /> <br /> If it's Buñuel's sweetest film I've seen so far, it's also the most spiritual. Here it is clear that the thing that most confuses people with the contradiction is that here, we do not see a Buñuel against the power of the church, we see a Buñuel whose film speaks of church but not in the typical - and large - satirical way. As far as it may seem, I don't think the right word is a contradiction, in reality I find it pleasant and well made and although it contains religious themes (like his "Voie Lactée"), I found more a spiritual film, but don't try to touch in the diversity the Catholic religion as perhaps he touches, and laugh at it in another film. "Nazarin" is from Father Nazario and his perspective front is God and the same religion, but all this is in the end, analyzed in the spiritual life of this man. <br /> <br /> The other two women are, not a contrast, but two other perspectives of faith. First we have Beatriz, the abused woman, who loses all faith in life, first with her husband and then with a child who was in her family. This child was very sick. At his side was also Andara, the prostitute who runs for justice. In the child's family, only religious women, there is great pain, but faith becomes in the father Nazario when he arrives with nothing in this city. He blesses the child, a saying later she is fine. The priest wants to walk, but Beatriz and Andara have recovered faith in life and want to dedicate their lives to God with Father Nazario. After some complaints, Father Nazario decides to stay with them, discovering with some things until the end how he feels about faith, God, religion and the person in need, the people who have to ask the charity to survive. This last problem must therefore be considered as a possible explanation for the pineapple ending. This ending we listen to the drums (similar to "L'Age d'Or") and a father Nazario, who walks asking for these things, when he rejects the fruit the first time and in the end he decides to receive it as a symbol of necessity or perhaps, as a response to his spiritual journey that begins to be a priest. Meanwhile, the two women have to take away their father, Andara for his crime (Bella scene in which he thanks a man who helps his father Nazario in prison and then she curses the man who hit the priest in prison) and Beatriz because he prefers to be with his macho man, although he treats her badly, just because he doesn't accept that he falls in love with the priest. Father Nazario - and here perhaps is the unique place in the film to criticize the church - walking to contradict the church, the religion that serves. <br /> <br /> Father Nazario is that then, he is a (soft for a long time, but not for me) critical for something in religion (Father Nazario helps a woman who is guilty of a crime, of a sin) but above all it is one of Buñuel's analysis of faith and life, and he really understood it, with a beautiful, tender, sweet and unforgettable film, which is, without doubt, one of his best. <br /> <br /> * Sorry for the errors ... well, if there are any.
