I channeled the surf over so many times, mainly because the synopsis sounded so bad, so "Love American Style". However, it turned out to be quite good, very well done. The two main characteristics are dialogue and acting. Great cast. The premise is actually well executed and there are not too many weak moments. I guess what surprised me the most is how often you thought the wheels came out of the cart, and instead, the cart just turns, so to speak, and the film keeps flying. There are some little tricks, in particular the relationship that develops between the character played by Conan's former partner Andy Richter. Furthermore, I want to say that the music that accompanies it was good.
