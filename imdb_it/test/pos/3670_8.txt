Yes, sometimes "Unconditional Love" overwhelms as it bounces - no, as it bounces - from one element of history to another in the unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it wasn't until I saw the film for the second time that I began to understand what I think P. Jogan could have tried to do with this eccentric and unconventional film. Perhaps the entire film itself is a metaphor for unconditional love for which Grace (Kathy Bates) yearns and describes in the last part of the film. Grace insists that unconditional love is only that, without conditions and without qualification. So I looked at "Unconditional love" again with this in mind. I laughed a lot more than I did the first time, I became more involved with the characters, I started to understand the sometimes absurd transforms the story takes. Executions are often exaggerated, but no more than they should be to adapt Hogan's strange and distraught vision, a vision that moved me to tears, desires and bursts of cracking laughter. Yes, Hogan is asking a lot about his audience. But I was the first to really love his movie - unconditionally.
