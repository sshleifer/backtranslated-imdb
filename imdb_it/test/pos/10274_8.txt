So here's a little background on how I got to see this movie. As you probably know, this is the original French film, which was then redone (the surprise ones) by Hollywood as Wicker Park. Well, I avoided that movie as the plague when it was released, simply because, a) I knew it had absolutely nothing to do with Wicker Park, and living in Chicago, I didn't understand why they called it that: it was filmed in frick the Canada to begin with! - b) I really enjoy disturbing with unnecessary reworking, done just because Hollywood thinks we're too obsessed to read some subtitles (I'm afraid the remake of Infernal Affairs by the way) and c) I can't be with Josh Hartnett, "the voice said. <br /> <br /> However, I came across WP on TV the other day, probably about half an hour, and I have to say initially, it didn't make any sense, until about half an hour from the end, when it started to come together. In the end, I was really surprised to find myself really involved, and then the ending seemed so beautiful to me - a perfect combination of history, passion and end with maybe one of the best music choices I've ever seen (heard ?? ) Since then I have heard a lot about the topic L'Appartement vs. Wicker Park and looking at WP, I keep saying that it has to do with Chicago, but there seemed to be something in what I liked, so when it is again in progress, I looked at it again - unfortunately, m i still miss the first piece (I have yet to see it!), and I still thought it was good enough. Hell, even Josh Hartnett looked good! But I was curious about L'Appartement and wanted to see what it was. So I waited and waited to take the Appartement somewhere somehow. Netflix disappointed me, so I ended up getting a copy from a website in Ireland. And I just saw it. <br /> <br /> It's really weird, but it's a little weird. A classic French film. Fantastic acting, Romane Bohringer is an absolute gem - I'm sorry, but she plays Monica Bellucci off the screen in every scene. Vincent Cassel was a strange choice for the command but it worked out in the end. And I saw Jean-Philippe Ecoffey in many movies and I love it - the scene where Alice throws it in the restaurant and it looks like someone told him that his puppy was hit by an unbearable pain! But, I can honestly say, having seen WP and almost expecting it to have been a scene to copy the scene (like about 75% of the rest of the film had been - perhaps in a different order, but come on, the scene with coffee in glasses ?? Word for word !!), you can imagine my surprise when I saw the finale of L'Appartement !! I can literally say that I was blown away - hmm, a bit like poor old Lucien was really out of the coffee window! So, be prepared, if you've seen Wicker Park and you want to take a look at the original like I did, don't make the mistake of expecting an identical movie, because you'll be disappointed or enhanced by a piece of The history of cinema French - a striking example of how you can watch a movie, think about watching a happy ending, and get the whiplash from the total spin in the opposite direction at the end. Definitely capture this movie. Oh, and while you're at, maybe not too close to the same time, but along the way, take a look at Wicker Park, it'll surprise you too.
