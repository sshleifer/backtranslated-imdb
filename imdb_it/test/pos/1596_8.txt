Man's greatest tragedy is that, being so often capable of the divine, he is satisfied with the banal. So great tragedy emerges from this. Death in Venice is one of the very few films with the patience and courage to face this fact. Face the human eye with beauty and inspiration in their two most inevitable human forms: self-denial and decadence. Undoubtedly this is the greatest film that has no perceptible influence on mainstream cinema. Its austere appearance, the sound of the echo, the combination of untested languages ​​and highly challenging themes are impossible to copy: both an accident of its peculiar production and the vision of its director. The central performance, at the same time rigid, excited and vulnerable in the face of expression and decadence, highlights Bogarde as if he were not the best British actor of his generation, therefore certainly the most adventurous. Able to resist sympathy while his desires take him in hand and interesting despite the endless close-ups and Mahler's score playing above him. Not one for a Friday night with your girlfriend but definitely OK if you want to explore the limits of human spiritual limitation.
