I have this movie about a collection of cheap B movies. It was not restored, in fact, the audio was difficult to discern for the first few minutes. <br /> <br /> At first it looked like a typical haunted house movie, and it looks a lot like the precursor of Clue, Murder of Death, House on Haunted Hill, etc. <br /> <br /> About half an hour in the film, the plot takes a really interesting turn - and it goes from being a clich√© melodrama to something completely different, and far more fun than I initially thought. <br /> <br /> Take a look, it's very funny, even if the long clips and the wider shots (and almost the lack of score) make it feel a little creaky standard today.
