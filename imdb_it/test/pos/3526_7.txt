Well, unfortunately, I can't help feeling a little disappointed after my long-awaited vision of "Just Before Dawn". Jeff Lieberman is a fantastic director and can undoubtedly do great things on a limited budget, but I still expected to see a much more sad and macabre slasher than the 80s. But actually I'm starting to think that Lieberman is not the person to blame for this, but we are raw! It is more than obvious that Lieberman intended to make his version of the backwoods-slasher as "Deliverance" and absolutely NOT as "Friday the 13th", which made the subgenre immensely popular a year earlier. The horror and constant feeling of threat does not come mainly from the demented maniacs with their machetes, but from the genuinely threatening and isolated Oregon forests in which this film was shot. In case the film seems slow and devoid of events, this is only because Lieberman takes his time to present the dark woods and mysterious mountains as extra characters in his film. We almost never see the killers in person, but it always seems that someone is attracting from behind the trees or from under the mountain lakes. With this in mind, "Just Before Dawn" becomes a very admirable horror effort and actually much better than his blood-soaked contemporaries. Among an almost endless selection of bloody and disgusting cuts, Lieberman successfully reiterates the emphasis on tension and character development. The plot revolves around five 21-year-old friends headed for a camping holiday in the Oregon woods, where one of them owns a small piece of land. The woods are deserted and, of course, campers ignore the ranger Roy (George Kennedy!) Advised to return to civilization. Shortly thereafter, they brutally encounter an innate family whose twins have deadly tendencies. All five main characters are surprisingly nice and convincing! No irritating stereotypes that you don't like, like sluts or football athletes. As a result of this "natural" character, you automatically rejoice for them, even when they eventually turn almost into savages. The sublime camera-job provides the film with an sometimes unbearable level of tension and Brad Fiedel's chilling electronic score only adds to this effect. "Just Before Dawn" is a big slice of the horror of the early 1980s, provided you don't want the blood to drip from the TV.
