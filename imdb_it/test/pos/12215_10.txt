Someone asked me why it was canceled. I tell you why Because "reality" makes money. the surface of the show was canceled so that they could replace it with a "reality" show, this will haunt NBC, me and about half of my high school, about 1000 people in total promised to boycott the NBC, until they reported this show. in my area (I don't know of any other places) but they had a great thing going with the Sci-Fi channel where the Sci-Fi channel would show last week's episode at 7:00 and then NBC will show the new episode of the week at 8:00 this was great because it gave you a little review of what happened in the last episode. I was so angry when I learned that the show had been canceled and that they would simply leave them on top of the church like that!
