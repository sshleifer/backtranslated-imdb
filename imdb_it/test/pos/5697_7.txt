<br /> <br /> As a teenager, I have about a hundred years of film to discover. I try to see a mixture of classic, mainstream, art-house and other films. The 70s are one of the most important decades for films: it is when average, common and classic films have changed into anti-social messages and behavior. It has become like nothing anyone has ever seen before. What shows A Decade Under the Influence shows in practice how important all the films from The Graduate to Star Wars are. <br /> <br /> Richard LaGravenese and the late Ted Demme are the main interviewers of this documentary, interviewing such people as Dennis Hopper, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman and Jon Voight, among others on how those a few years have changed cinema forever. It is a very professional and refined documentary, and is even funded by IFC movies. However, since he is very professional, I would think that at least they would have modified the sound of someone behind the laughing camera. For me, this brought out a lot of how beautiful and clean everything was. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is a very interesting documentary about the film of the people who make it. Sure, they're not hitting their movies or something, but they're interpreting honesty about what they thought of the movies and what they meant. I don't know much about the movie (but I want to be involved when I become an adult), so I feel like someone like me, this movie is a big advantage. I have seen a number of films that they have mentioned, such as Chinatown and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but a little more intuition in those films have been very instructive. <br /> <br /> The main reason, however, I didn't love Influence is, as corny as it was modified, it seemed to take its time at the beginning and be quite relaxed, so not having enough time to get to everything they wanted to show. They were crammed into Star Wars and Jaws in the last few minutes, when they were two of the most important. It seemed like they were trying too hard to show a lot of clips, and that's fine, but some of them weren't important, like one extended from the net. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, Influence is a very compelling, informative documentary that has helped me, at least, learn more about a second "golden age" in American cinema. <br /> <br /> My assessment: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Vote R for the language, and images of sexuality, violence and drug use.
