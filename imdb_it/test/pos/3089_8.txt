Fata Morgana, the 1971 documentary film by the famous German director Werner Herzog, shot for several years in the late 1960s, is one of those rare DVDs that should be heard with the comment turned on. It is a timeless visual feast of North African (mostly Saharan) images. You simply cannot say that it was made more than thirty-five years ago. The soundtrack of the film, including German classical music (Mozart and Handel) and rock music by Blind Faith and Leonard Cohen, also gives it its timeless quality. The narrative of three different German storytellers (the German film historian Lotte Eisner, Eugen Des Montagnes and Wolfgang von Ungern-Sternberg) is solid, and Herzog goes back and forth to Eisner to import this project, himself, and the history of cinema , but the English The speaker of the translation, James William Gledhill, has a voice that seems decidedly deified, which lends itself much more perfectly to this project, even though much of the text, in both languages, is rather superfluous. Yes, the false biblical sounds of the myth of the Maya creation of Popul Vuh in the first part of the film, Creation, are interesting, but the text written by Herzog for the remaining two parts (Paradise and The Golden Age), together with the quotations of a poet German Herzog Names like Manfred Eigendorf, it almost seems a satire of the dark tone of the first part. The film seems to have been put together during the filming of several other Herzog projects simultaneously - the fictional Even Dwarfs Started Small, and the documentaries The Land Of Silence And Darkness and The Flying Doctors Of East Africa, but the rejected material of these projects adds only to the beauty of this film, like the aerial scenes of a far flamingo mating lake, which give a strange supernatural sense, which Herzog sings in his comment. This otherworldly feeling is present from the beginning of the film of several airplanes landing on a desert track, with their images gradually fading away as the heat from the ground increases and the distortion waves that ruin the images increase. That this film was influential in Godfrey Reggio's Quatsi films is an understatement. But, considering that Reggio limits itself to launching images, Herzog has an ability that only the American filmmaker Terrence Malick also has: to make a completely autonomous vocabulary out of the juxtaposition of images and words, and one dependent on an emotion - first push. The analysis can fail if brought to such efforts. Herzog often doesn't even understand why his art is great. The best he often does is totally unconscious and mesmeric. This is why his contempt for the lowest common member of Hollywood is explicitly stated in the comment. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best illustration of this comes in a scene that, in the commentary, Herzog tells us follows a drought in Cameroon. It shows the carcasses of cattle that move and Herzog describes the unbearable smell. However, the viewer can perceive all this from the images, from the darkness of the portions of animals dried in the sun and from the bleached bones. Yet even in that comment, Herzog focuses on the smell, not on a deeper meaning. He is content to let you absorb and interpret what you want and his work, like the almost erotically feminised forms of sand dunes, reminiscent of a scene from The Hour of the Wolf by Ingmar Bergman, where Max Von Sydow passes the Belle curves of the nude body of Ingrid Thulin. But the archetypal image of this film, which symbolizes much of Herzog's career, is the mirage of a distant machine that drives back and forth on the surface of what appears to be a lake. He is deep, hypnotic, illusory, elusive, supernatural, but real, just as Herzog is, the believer who came from a family of militant atheists. But then, like everything else, it ends.
