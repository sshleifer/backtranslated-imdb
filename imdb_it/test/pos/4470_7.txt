This is another film in which cinematography is the best thing to recommend. It would be nice if the film was a travel diary, but like a dramatic exercise in film art, it's not good enough. The theme of interspecific respect and cooperation timidly ventures into the forbidden world of love between species, but its approach is stereotyped, indicating a lack of understanding of the behavioral reasons of both species. As in many films, one always wonders what could have been achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative screenwriter. Alas, we'll probably never know.
