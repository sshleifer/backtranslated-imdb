Society heiress Susan Fletcher (Hopkins) and wealthy father Simon Fletcher (Henry Stephenson) are upset that their young niece Joan (Betty Philson) and Katie (Marianna Strelby) are living a bohemian style in Greenwich Village with their artist uncle John (Milland) after the death of their parents (Susan's sister and John's brother). Simon gave up trying to convince John to allow him and Susan to take care of children and they resorted to private detectives to capture him in dishonest or unemployed behavior and therefore unable to take care of children properly. Eventually Susan decides to take the situation in hand and goes to Greenwich Village, posing as an actress, to try to get information and / or persuade him to see the reason. What he does discover, however, is that not only does he love the free and artistic lifestyle that John and his friends live and that girls are raised well, but that he is quickly falling in love with John. Inevitably, his true identity is discovered and he is faced with the task of convincing everyone on both sides of the custody debate that should belong to whom. I really enjoyed this movie and found that it's a very short run time (70 minutes) it was the perfect duration to shoot this simple but captivating story. Miriam Hopkins, one of the great actresses of the 30s and 40s, is delightful in this film. Her energy, her style and her healthy beauty lend themselves to creating a captivating character, although you know that she is making a quick decision about the people she quickly becomes friends with. This is the first film in which I saw Ray Milland, and he was actually young and non-patrician looking. (And apparently three years younger than her co-star) Her energy and carefree way in "Wise Girl" was a refreshing change to her behavior in her usual obscure films. Honestly, even though I'm not usually a fan of child actors, I really enjoyed the two girls who played Susan's nieces. They were captivating and precocious, and they really were the jewels of the film. Unfortunately, I can't reconstruct any other films in which one of them was subsequently thereafter, which is a shame as they both exhibited a great deal of natural talent. <br /> <br /> "Wise Girl" was a film that was made three years after the introduction of the Hollywood Code, and to a certain extent this was abundantly clear for the fast, happy ending, and for the cake in the sky of loftiness and ease with which the characters lived. The alleged Bohemian cooperative was indeed a wonderful cul-de-sac where artists lived for free or for commerce, and everything is very well linked. Fortunately, this was a fairly light film and the characters were fascinating enough to take into account its softness and scarcity and I was able to simply take "Wise Girl" for what it was; a good old fashioned love story that was as much fun as it was captivating. Unfortunately, the films of the romantic comedy / drama genre today are considerably less intelligent and amusing, otherwise I won't find myself returning to the classics. 7/10
