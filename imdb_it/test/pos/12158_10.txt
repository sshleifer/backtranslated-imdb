Has there ever been an angel of death like MIMSY FARMER in Barbet Schroeder's 1960s heroin work? A sort of Jean Seberg with a hypodermic. Score Pink Floyd. Despite some insignificant weaknesses, a classic, shamelessly robbed by Erich Segal / Noel Black for their inept JENNIFER ON MY MIND (1971), although Tippy Walker, who plays a similar character, is herself very sticky in the last mess. MORE, however, it is fantastic, a drug film of the 1960s and, simply, an important document of its time. Very much a cult film so join the cult. <br /> <br /> No American film so, as far as I can remember, it traces the same territory. MIMSY is a surprising archetype, which elevates it to mythical realms. Not for the faint of heart. Great sex scenes too.
