Some time ago I was watching a video by Paul Thomas Anderson in which he expressed his great interest in porn movies and how this sector could have produced better films and consequently a complete genre and not just sex on video. Paul Thomas Anderson has put his convictions on the porn industry into the fantastically played character by Burt Reynolds. His name is Jack Horner, a director whose biggest dream is to make a "real" film that can keep the viewer in suspense because of the great dramatic story and, at the same time, exciting with beauty ?? and with the "big cocks and tits". As soon as he meets Eddie Adams (Mark Walhberg), he believes he has found the new star for his films. And that's how young Eddie's story in the porn industry begins. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a sequence inside a night club where we can see all the people who will be part of Eddie's life and then they can see them outside the porn industry, living their daily routine. But soon we can see them in the porn industry and, after a single party, the story of the new Eddie begins, the story of Dirk Diggler. Everyone will appreciate real success with Dirk as the main protagonist, winning many awards and helping Jack achieve his biggest dream with a series of films about Brock Landers, the new character of Dirk. This type of exploitative film is an incredible success and Jack is his first "real" film. But here is the beginning of the end and the beginning of the "horrible 80s" when there will be $ ex, DRUGS and Rock & Roll for Dirk and friends. But we all know that excesses can destroy any person and erectile dysfunction can destroy any porn star and here the film is concentrated in their lives after total success and like everyone is having a bad time with many problems due to the bad appearance of the industrial society of porn and at a time with many excesses. In Dirk's decadence, after trying and failing in the music industry, there is a brilliant sequence that can perfectly resume how things are going for Dirk and his friends. That sequence is that of his first drug affair, with the appearance of Alfred Molina, who ends up in a total mess. It's fun for us and a terrible experience for Dirk and friends, but there's always a solution if you go back to what you know and when Dirk is back, Brock is back. <br /> <br /> Well, I didn't mention most of the characters in my kind of summary, but I have to say that all of them are surprisingly well developed. The cast is simply outstanding with the best performance I've seen of Mark Walhberg. Julianne Moore has a powerful performance in a truly moving character; Reilly, Macy's, Hoffman, Heather Graham, Guzman, etc. are simply memorable, all their characters with funny and sad moments. <br /> <br /> Finally, I love Anderson's fantastic cinematic style here with a unique view to the porn industry of the late 70s and early 80s. I said that "Magnolia" was my favorite of Anderson but now, after seeing everyone but "Sidney", I can't say I have a favorite because I love them all! <br /> <br /> PS: somewhere I've read that this movie is Anderson's "Scorsese movie" so I'm more than sure that if you love "Goodfellas" and "Casino" you'll love it too. I fake love "Boogie Nights"!
