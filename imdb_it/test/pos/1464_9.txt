The first episode of "Man to Man with Dean Learner" just aired was at least at the height of most of the "Garth Marenghi's Darkplace" episodes and recorded me at "My Maisonette". I hope you continue the good work of "faux terribles" on my TV. Richard Ayoade is one of the best in the new generation of "alternative comedy" (I hate this sentence, but I'm too lazy to think of another.) Comedians on TV today. I'm glad that on a journey of local DVD retailers today "The Dark World of Garth Marenghi" has been sold out across the board. Even from his brief spell in Nathan Barley I knew that Ayoade was a serious talent and I'm sure it would be great as Dixon Bainbridge in 'The Mighty Boosh' For continuous success! In the vein of these programs I also considered it necessary to extend my review in order to guarantee a place in this public domain.
