Now, being a science fiction fan, the trailer for this movie seemed a bit too much, so to speak, hollywood. But after seeing it I can say with pleasure that it struck me a lot. Jude is a class actor and Miss Leigh brings him out better than she does in Delores Clairborne. It features films like The Matrix, 12 Monkeys and The Cell, which may not seem so appealing, but it's really one of the best movies I've seen.
