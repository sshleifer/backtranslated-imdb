Not since "Harold and Maude" committed suicide, it has been used successfully as a theme for a love story. The acting, with a first-rate cast, is exceptional. With a well-structured script, things progress at a pleasant pace. There are moments of black comedy, but I would rate "My Suicidal Sweetheart" as a unique romantic comedy, with a touch of dark humor. The relationship between two psychologically challenged lovers is both touching and engaging. The film really asks you questions, what is a normal relationship? I highly recommend "My Suicidal Sweetheart". Look for it on DVD with the title "Crazy for Love". You will not be disappointed. - MERK
