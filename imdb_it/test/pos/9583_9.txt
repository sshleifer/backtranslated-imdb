It is a pity that an important film like this is practically unknown. <br /> <br /> I don't think Alan Bates has made a better film than this. <br /> <br /> It was never shown on television. The only time I can remember that was broadcast on British TV was in the summer of 1998. I recorded it on tape, but unfortunately the quality is not great due to a dubious antenna at that time ... <br /> <br /> I remember wanting to see this movie for a while before it appeared on TV. It was shown on Channel 4 early in the morning, ensuring it was still invisible except for a very small audience. <br /> <br /> I was living in Bristol at that time and it was ironic that when I finally saw the movie, I realized that I had passed the VERY house where it was filmed several times before !! The film tramples a thin line; a married couple who try to highlight their tragic situation of coping with their severely handicapped daughter laughing and even involving the child in their lines. <br /> <br /> Direction and acting are so superb that the film is always compassionate and moving and is never in danger of falling into bad taste. <br /> <br /> A couple of years ago I saw a clip of the film production with Eddie Izzard playing Bri and Victoria Hamilton playing Sheila. <br /> <br /> He showed Izzard improvising and larking and Hamilton jokingly told the public to ignore him when he did. <br /> <br /> Maybe I keep it out of context I've only seen a short clip, but having read the script and seen the film, this is clearly such a delicate subject that such an approach is insensitive and disrespectful. <br /> <br /> Izzard was praised for his performance but I felt uncomfortable what I saw. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is surprising that such a successful game failed to find an audience when it was finally filmed. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best British films of the 70s and I hope one day it will be released on DVD.
