This film is hilarious. I would say much more painful and disgusting than the previous film. The entire cast of the previous film and series is present. <br /> <br /> These films are fantastic to watch in the Movie Theater, because the whole audience cries with laughter, especially in the terrorist part that was damn disgusting. I wish they did more of this kind of film. <br /> <br /> Strong stomach required! They had crazy acrobatics this time. Attention: includes many snakes! I'd like to write it but I can't spoil the fun. Go see it !!!
