Apart from the work of an amateur camera, I thought that this film was very different and, unlike all the blogs and posts I read, I got something totally different from the ending than others. The premise of the story revolves around a very religious family and their ties to their church. How they must adhere to all the strict rules and regulations, but the daughter seems to have trouble staying on track, with the bad thoughts of others and her use of bad language. Yet he prays a lot, as does his family. Then one day they are headed for a picnic at the church and are in an accident. From there the parents and his brother change; what to be thrown down and "saved" by Jesus. ATTENTION: MAJOR Spoiler ALERT. Or so we are led to believe. I think if you watch this movie only from the point of view of the daughter, then pay attention in the end you'll see that what we, the public, think is a real event with the parents and the child, is actually a dream, and from the view of the daughter. This would explain many of the actions portrayed by parents and son, which were totally opposed to how they lived before, especially sex, and would also explain why Peggy coped with murder, etc. Look how perfect that cake is, but go back and look at the cake that Betty makes. This unless Caroline removed all the evidence that the cake was sewn. And also the fact that the scene in which he sees his dead parents lying there in each other's arms and his brother, all those who seemed to die in peace, even if poisoned, adapted to a dream sequence.
