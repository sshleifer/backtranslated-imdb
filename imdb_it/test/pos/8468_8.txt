This is a rather interesting experiment to watch. It is the first attempt, still existing, to combine sight with sound. It features two men dancing on a violinist (probably William KL Dickson himself), who is standing next to an Edison recording cylinder, which is capturing the sound. <br /> <br /> The sound and images were not connected as one yet. And it wasn't until recently that the sound and the image were technically added together. Probably the reason why people hesitate to call this film the first sound image ever. <br /> <br /> The film is produced by William K.L. Dickson, an assistant of Thomas Edison himself who ordered him to invent a way to combine images and sounds. The answer he gave was the Kinetophone, a Kinetoscope (basically a large wooden box with a peephole, so that people could watch the moving images) with a cylinder phonograph inside, for sound. This is the first, which we know, survives the cinematic experiments that present this technique. All subsequent films using this same technique were shot as silent films and the sound effects were recorded later and separately. So the Kinephone was not an attempt to synchronize sounds and images, but more an attempt to have images accompanied by sound. In some cases, people could even choose between three sound cylinders, with 3 different orchestral performances to accompany the images. Only 45 Kinetophones have been made in such a way that it is difficult to call the Kinephone a success. Even after this experiment, the focus shifted to other film techniques, mainly with regard to cinema projectors. <br /> <br /> So the experiment itself obviously didn't become a success, also because it took more than 30 years before the first sounding films were made and commercially released. They were not yet able to technically synchronize and put together the sound and images at that time, and even if they could and techniques would have been available, it would have been a very expensive job to do so. So it's not really the most influential or historically important film in the history of cinema, but it's very interesting to see how people have constantly tried to improve the quality and techniques of cinema and cinema. <br /> <br /> 8/10
