Do you ever miss the good old days when Disney was actually making great movies that really moved you? Growing up with Disney, I always found myself fascinated by the characters. Everyone seemed really talented and knew how to make their way through a movie. I remember Friday night and ran to turn on the TV just to watch their new movies. Susie Q was one of my all-time favorites. I never forgot this movie. Even up to this day when the song "Susie Q" is mentioned, I always remember the film. If someone is thinking of watching this movie, I promise you, you'll love it. I don't think I'll ever forget it. You will not regret looking at it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately it is sad to see Disney movies like "The Hannah Montana Movie" come out. What happened to Disney?
