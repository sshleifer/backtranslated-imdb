A very interesting plot of the film based on the novel "Waltz into Darkness" by the writer Cornell Woolrich. It is a drama rather than a film noir, which tries to send a message that love changes your life, that is your love for each person and the love you received from him / her. A wealthy man really changed his life for love, while his partner finally realized that he was the only one who loved her. Belmondo played well as usual, while a young Michel Bouquet, a bit young, played his eternal role as a detective or police officer. Frankly Bouquet was not so impressive in this film, but less than that was Catherine Deneuve's performance. She was not so convincing in her role as a prostitute of the lover / wife of Louis Mah√© (Belmondo). For those who like to visit the world, the film offers the opportunity to see part of the Ascension and also the city of Lyon in France.
