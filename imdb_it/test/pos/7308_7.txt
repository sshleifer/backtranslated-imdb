Norma had spent most of the '20s playing beautiful songs, but her first talkie had chosen her as a brass showgirl in "The Trial of Mary Dugan" and came out with flying colors. From that moment on her sweet and lovely tricks were put aside and she sizzled into parts that launched her as sophisticated women of the world or girls of society in search of emotions. "Let Us Be Gay" was released earlier, but was released after "The Divorc√©e" and was an unusual twist in the upper crust dramas that Shearer made her. <br /> <br /> Norma appears for the first time without make-up as the clumsy Kitty Brown, which is the main purpose of life, is to pander to her not-so-attractive husband Bob (Rod La Rocque). He is running to take him to play golf, but in reality he will see his lover. When Helen, the lover, comes home for a showdown, Kitty faces the situation with courtesy, but behind closed doors is a mass of emotions and Bob leaves forever. <br /> <br /> Three years later Mrs. Courtland Brown (Kitty) came to stay as a guest of the eccentric Mrs. Bouccicoult ("Bouccy") (Marie Dressler). Kitty is now a knockout and "Bouccy" has a job for her. He wants Kitty to fall in love with a guest friend, who in turn is making fun of his niece Diane (beautiful Sally Eilers). Shock!! Horror!! - the man is none other than Bob, his ex-husband !!! Kitty carries out the meeting with refinement and witty remarks - "it seems that there is something strangely familiar in that man" !!! - and nobody is wiser. <br /> <br /> The film then establishes itself in one of those very boring first "talkie" comedies. Kitty casts a spell on all the men and Bob is desperate to start over. Women have all the strong roles in this film - men are just puppets. Raymond Hackett seems to be in the film as an extra butler - "pass me a pillow", "take me a drink", "move this chair" instead of Diane's tormented boyfriend. Norma Shearer is obviously the whole show, Marie Dressler adds "Bouccy" to her list of eccentric portraits and Sally Eilers is a real attraction like the beautiful Diane.
