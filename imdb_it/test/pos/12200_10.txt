Surface was one of the few truly unique shows on TV last season. I can honestly say that I modified my program so that I could be at home watching every episode. Tons of action, suspense, science fiction, etc. <br /> <br /> The story was of a boy who found an egg that hatched in a sea creature. The same sea creature that had killed the main character's brother and the female character (oceanographer) had seen. Most people think it's a deadly war machine, but the one raised from the egg has been very friendly. <br /> <br /> The only problem was canceled by NBC, so now we will never know what will happen ... We hope that Sci-Fi or some other channel will collect it.
