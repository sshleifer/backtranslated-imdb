While I report the film at 7, I must also point out that it is both interesting from a historical point of view (since he plays Mae Marsh, Lillian Gish and Lionel Barrymore when they were all younger and less known) and presents a rather exciting action for his day. . <br /> <br /> The plot is strange for a Westerner, as the whole problem with the Indians starts for the strangest reason I've ever seen! The Indians decide to organize a giant banquet for dogs (no, they are not feeding the dogs, but they are feeding with dogs) and when two Indians arrive late, there are no more dogs! So, they steal two dogs belonging to two orphans from the nearby white settlement and this actually takes away an all-out war !!!! Not only is he foolish, but he seems to play on the prejudices of the public. I don't know if the American Indians really ate the dog, but it sounds like the kind of stereotype that was later applied to other ethnic groups. All this on dogs! The film has some excellent battle scenes and exciting moments - like when Ms. Marsh crawls across the battlefield to save a child! Exciting stuff! But also STRANGE!
