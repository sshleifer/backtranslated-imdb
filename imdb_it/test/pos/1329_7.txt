Ocean's 12 <br /> <br /> 'If you steal fifty million dollars, they will find you.' (Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber, Die Hard) <br /> <br /> This adage certainly sounds true in this sequel. Terry Benedict was informed that Danny Ocean and his cronies were the ones who robbed him and now he wants everything back. The Ocean band needs a lot of money and fast, but it can't work in states like Benedict made it impossible for them. So it is in Europe to perform acts of death that defy theft, while trying to avoid the super-cop of Catherine Zeta Jones, an old flame from Rusty's past (Pitt). <br /> <br /> In their first robbery in Amsterdam they discover that whoever played on them was the "fox of the night", a super astute thief with a set of legends. He issues them with a challenge that could completely obliterate their debt or bring them into a sort of sequence Uma Thurman-Kill Bill II-buried-alive. Interesting? Well ... yes. Slow? A type of. Funny? Mostly. Unnecessary scenes of character development? Plenty. <br /> <br /> Ocean and his band of cheerful men are charismatic, if nothing else, and since this is a sequel and we are all old friends, we see many more "pally" situations and conversations. Too many. Damon's Linus is more nervous than before; the cousins ​​are fighting as we knew they would; Bernie Mac talks too much and Don Cheadle's cock-eryne accent is uglier than ever (I really like Cheadle, but I can't stand him). Pitt and Clooney talk like old friends, fill their glasses and read each other. However, what worked so well in the last film was the lack of character development compared to what the whole damn operation was mushy. And though these actors work well together, Zeta Jones fits into this film like a big square peg in a narrow 11-sided hole. It just doesn't fit and his chemistry with Pitt is non-existent. <br /> <br /> The stars of this film for me, however, were Vincent Cassel as the Night Fox and Soderbergh's choice of location. Cassel plays pomp and wealth as if he were born in both. His fox of the night is arrogant, "terribly riding with other people's life" (Danny Ocean) and a total contrast with the ocean band. This is where I think the film loses its way. Cassel and the European locations offer a too realistic contrast with the American actors and the style of the first film. We want to be clear, bold and intelligent; not gritty, considered and intellectual. This is where the film doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Let's face it, it is not possible to repeat the same formula twice literally, but going to the left or right usually does more harm than good in a mainstream film like this.
