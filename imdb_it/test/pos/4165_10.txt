I'll do this short. This was a joy to watch. It may or may not have been more effective if the characters had resembled their real counterparts, but apart from this little observation I found that fantastic animal characters were the most fun. The images were more beautiful except for the second-class CG scenes, which could have been left out. However, I don't like computer-generated animation, it defeats the purpose of a biographical film like this. Look at it, you'll appreciate it too!
