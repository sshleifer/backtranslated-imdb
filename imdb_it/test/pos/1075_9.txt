I just watched this movie 2 days ago. A very interesting look at people and our world through the world of wine. I have no particular interest in wine, yet I found this very enlightening. The director gave me the impression of having the ability to show people the way they are. While exposing many things that are below the surface, he manages not to take a position and leave it to the viewer. It shows a lot of compassion for people (and dogs) and sympathy and allows people to tell their story and at the same time expose what they don't want to tell. <br /> <br /> The film shows us where our world is going, what are the advantages and what is the heavy price we pay. It is a film about love for wine and love to make it big, personal and global, character and formula. <br /> <br /> For me the real protagonists of the people are the old wine producers with their disillusioned appearance to the world and themselves. <br /> <br /> It takes some time to get used to the camera's lively moves and editing, but it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
