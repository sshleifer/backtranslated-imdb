A touching film about a talented woman who struggles with a society and a love that structurally underestimates her. The issues are tackled in a subtle and timeless manner, since many of the difficulties illustrated between man and woman still exist today in Dutch society. This film is a tribute to all modern women without dwelling on feminism. Not only is the plot well told, even acting and scenery are fantastic.
