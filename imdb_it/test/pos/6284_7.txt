I think this is Pauly Shore's best stuff, he played the perfect part. I really enjoyed this movie, Patrick Renna is really funny like Zack, the annoying little brother. Son In Law is a good comedy that is worth your time, but the only thing I would like to be Tiffany Thiessen was the farm chick instead of what they had.
