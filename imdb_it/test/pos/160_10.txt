Not for the picky, but the number of twists, inventive uses of situations that use vampire mythology, magnificent visual extremes, along with interesting and extravagant characters make this one of the most incredible horror movies I've ever seen. He descends into total madness along with the characters, but never seems exploitative or horrible without purpose. There are abundant amounts of bloodletting accompanied by ugly sucking and squeaking sounds, but also delicate moments in which you laugh aloud. As he tends to do, Chan-wook Park keeps you away from the center with leaps in time and plot and situation that you must complete for yourself by forcing your involvement in the story and the characters. <br /> <br /> And there's a lot of literal jumps. Keeping the vein of the myth of vampires (pun intended), they have superhuman strength and can almost skip tall buildings in a single limit (to coin a sentence). The first time our heroine is transported through the tops of buildings by the struggling vampire priest, she has all the magical love story of Lois Lane and Superman - but this love story gets more and more disturbing - but driven by a strange and conflicting "love story" not out of pure horror. <br /> <br /> The acting is superb, in particular OK-vin Kim, the stunning female lead actress who, at 22, shows a range that is remarkable. The character confines with a kind of noir-type black widow film. He falls in love with the innocent to implore the fox to the devil with total conviction. This is a really smooth and nervous performance. <br /> <br /> If you love the real horrified art, or you're a fan of Oldboy - don't wait for the video, watch it now.
