The weakness of all this comes from the confused narration, plots that often emerge from nowhere. But it didn't really matter because I still liked it for its length. Once you've actually accepted that this movie isn't taken too seriously, you'll like it even more. It's basically a love story, a confusing one at the beginning, but as it evolves it's really something worthwhile. Of course it has already been done so many times but the complicated version of this is rather challenging and moving. <br /> <br /> The fantasy and the CGI were overwhelming at first, but I still appreciated its purpose. And people stop complaining about how they borrowed from other movies !! Guess what we know !! And it doesn't really matter because his purpose was to humor and entertain. Sometimes people have to stop being so critical and think for a moment before they start getting drunk. Comparing this with Hollywood standards is absolutely stupid and ignorant, it is a completely different style and a target audience. As far as I'm concerned, some of the best films I've exchanged my eyes are from producers and directors from the East. There is your story about the Police 4, shaolin football, kung fu hustle, dragon tiger gate, handful of legends, hero, crouching tiger, etc ... I for one like this film and coming from the Philippines, from the States United, from England, from Libya and now from Australia, I will always be interested in these types of films. Now try to judge my perception, but I warn you that I see things from the point of view of those 5 countries where I lived. So it is better that you have the same experience and open-mindedness.
