For a long time, I, a fan of the TV series "The Monkees", refused to look at "Head" because it wasn't the characters on the TV show, which were warm and wonderful. "Testa", on the other hand, was said to be a cynical and obscure film. In the end, curiosity made me collapse. I have not, of course, found a new episode for the TV series, but a fascinating film that attracts my dark side. <br /> <br /> I've always been fascinated by dreams, and "Head" was very similar to looking at someone else's dream, with incomplete hints of stories, and a small detail at the end of a scene that brought the film to vanish in a new direction, very much in a dreamlike flow of consciousness. The unfinished stories really make my imagination wild, always and again! <br /> <br /> The film also features an extraordinary and beautiful cinematography, whose epitome is the white on black look, white on black by "La canzone di pap√†". The music is disturbing, especially the lush arrangement of "The Porpoise Song". ("The Porpoise Song" is the favorite song of my dark side, while my positive side prefers "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah".) <br /> <br /> In the end, I think the TV series could have used some of the dramas, intrigues and intensities of "Head". But "Testa" could have used some of the warmth, humor and friendship of the TV show.
