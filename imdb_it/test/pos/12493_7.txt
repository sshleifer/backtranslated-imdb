Quai des Orfevres takes too long to move forward, with Clouzot so in love with his backstage environment that he is almost in danger of forgetting history. However, once done, Clouzot is at its best. Bertrand Blier (father of Bertrand Blier and co-star of his Buffet Froid) is the worldly pianist who got married under himself and intends to kill the shabby tycoon in the studio with drawings on his wife only to find out that someone has beaten on it. Not only that, but his carefully planned but clumsy alibi is torn to pieces, not least when a thief steals his car at the crime scene ?? <br /> <br /> The film really comes to life with the arrival of Luis Jouvet police inspector, a rather wonderful creation for half of Alistair Sim in Green for Danger and half Maigret tired of the world with a better dialogue. In a clean gag, his investigation is constantly conducted to the maximum of his voice against chaos and noise, whether it is the noisy typewriters of the police station or a rehearsal. The police station itself is a wonderfully realistic creation, a wealth of small chaotic and narrative details that make Steve Bocchco's former American cops once revolutionaries of the 80s, like old-fashioned museum pieces compared. <br /> <br /> If Suzy Delair is a rather unconvincing femme fatale, the supporting cast more than compensate, with the beautiful Simone Renant a standout as the lesbian photographer in love with her and constantly mistaken for Blier's lover of Delair and other interested parties (only Jouvet, similarly unlucky with women, sincerely understands and sympathizes). With the great black and white photography of Armand Thirard, this is a fantastic little thriller with a nice final turn and an adorable scene with a taxi driver who reluctantly identifies Renant at a police station. (Note Trivia: Pierre Larquey, who played the playful philosophical Dr Vorzet at Le Corbeau, appears in minor roles as a taxi driver in both Quai and Les Espions.) <br /> <br /> The Criterion DVD is really superb - Excellent image quality as well as an illuminating excerpt from a French TV show presenting interviews with Clouzot, Blier and Renant.
