I found the movie good enough for what I expected. Even though I'm tired, because I'm afraid of injection needles, I almost expected when they would arrive. So if you don't like needles, blood, the human body and some good medical fun, put this film back and rent another one. As the other user commented, I was also pleased with the German attempt at a slasher movie. I'm an American who just moved to Germany to be with a family and saw this lying on the shelf. I love psychological thrillers, and I'd say he's somewhere in this direction. A character falls into places and feels misinterpreted. While trying to dig his way and find some truth in a situation, things get a little sticky and others are not so sure that he is on the right track. So, throughout the movie, keep in check who the anatomy you might see and who's turning the next corner.
