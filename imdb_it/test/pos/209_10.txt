1956 was the 20th Congress of the Communist Party and Soviet Prime Minister Krushchev made a speech denouncing Stalin and the Stalinist purges and gulag labor systems, revealing information that was previously forbidden, publicly revealing horrific new truths, which opened the door to a new Soviet Cinema led by Mikhail Kalatozov, once head of Stalin's film production. This film presents a Red Army that is NOT victorious, rather they are surrounded, in a retreat mode, with many people dying, including the hero, in a movie set after 06-02-41, the German invasion of Russia when Germany introduced the Barbarossa Plan, a blitzkrieg invasion destined to provoke a rapid victory and the definitive slavery of the Slavs, and almost succeeded, arriving 20 miles from Moscow in what was a red army, a devastation of losses human, 15 to 20 million Russians died, or 20% of the entire population. Historically, this was a time of great trauma and suffering, a psychological shock for the Russian people, but the Red Army maintained and prolonged the war for another 4 years until they were finally victorious. <br /> <br /> During the war, Stalin used the war genre in movies for obvious boosts to morale, introducing female heroines who were ultra-patriotic and strong and idealistic, suggesting that if females could be so successful and patriotism, then Russia I could expect at least from their soldiers. Stalin eliminated the mass hero of the proletariat and replaced it with a bold individual leader who managed to kill many enemies, an obvious reference to Stalin himself, who has always been portrayed in the film as a bold, wise and victorious leader. But Kalatozov changed this representation, since THE CRANES ARE FLYING was created after Stalin's death, causing a political thaw and creating a worldwide sensation, winning the Cannes Film Festival Palm D'Or, as well as the best director and best actress (Tatyana Samoilova), awakens the West to Soviet cinema for the first time since Eisenstein IVAN THE TERRIBLE in the 1940s. <br /> <br /> This film was characterized by brilliant, breathtaking and extremely mobile camera work by its extraordinary cinematographer Sergei Uresevsky, using spectacular cranes and dollies, images of war, battlefields, Moscow and streets crowded they are extremely vivid and real. Another brilliant scene starring the heroine protagonist, Veronica, who has never heard from her lover, Boris, in the 4 years of war, so he is presumably dead, but she continues to love him, expressed in a scene in which he runs towards a bridge with a train that followed them, a moment when the spectator wondered if he could throw himself in front of that train, instead he saved an old 3-year-old boy named Boris who was about to be hit by a car. Another scene captures the death of Boris on the battlefield, who dies of a senseless death, and his thoughts turn and turn in a beautiful photomontage of trees, sky, leaves, which rotate in a kaleidoscope of his thoughts and dreams, including an imaginary marriage with Veronica. This film presents the famous phrase: "You can dream when the war is over". In the final sequence, when the war is over, the soldiers are returning to a mass scene in the streets, Veronica discovers that Boris is dead, everyone is happy and excited about the soldier's return, but Veronica is desperate, handing out flowers to the soldiers and strangers in the street in an extreme gesture of generosity and disinterest revealing "white and gray cranes floating in the sky". <br /> <br /> The film was published in Russia in 1957 and, according to some reviews, "the silence in the theater was profound, the wall between art and living life had fallen ... and tears opened the doors . "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
