"Fame" has been one of my favorite movies for years! It's not just a musical movie from the 1980s of "that" New York high school, it's LEGENDARY - people no longer refer to the High School of Performing Arts but to the "school of Fame" !! <br /> <br /> The characters are real, they are not "Hollywood" and their stories are real. The film follows them during the four years of school, starting from a powerful monologue of an Auditions student and ending with a spectacular graduation show. <br /> <br /> Apparently some find the Broadway show better, however it is my opinion that you should definitely watch this movie, and then have your own point of view. For all those who love watching movies and want to have "classics", this is definitely one of them. It is an example of one of those films that was really fantastic, with actors we loved for those 2 hours, and then we didn't see them anymore ... they are the classic "famous students". <br /> <br /> make FAME live forever.
