My two daughters (aged 11 and 13) and I was lucky enough to see a screening of this film last night. We were pleasantly surprised to see how funny and fun this film was. David Duchovny was very attractive as a male protagonist and Minnie Driver usually gave her a competent performance. Some scenes are ridiculous aloud - especially a scene that Minnie Driver has with a "transplanted" colleague. I liked the fact that it was a movie I could watch with my children and I wasn't embarrassed by any scene. Everyone in the cinema laughed and enjoyed themselves. Congratulations Bonnie Hunt!
