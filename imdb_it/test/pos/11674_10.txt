The debut with Spheeris must be one of the best musical documentaries of all time. And as far as I know it is also the only one that focuses on LA. Punk Explosion of the early eighties. It's all there: not just big, big bands like Black Flag, Fear, X, the Germs, whose names may not mean much to you today, but whose influence on today's alternative rock music can't be overstated, but also the promoters, the media and first and foremost the public - the punks - all portrayed in a way that makes you laugh, shudder and wince with the wonder of the energy, anger and fury that these young people put into their music. Where is he today? The Eighties may have sucked in great moments when it headed towards mainstream music, but the underground was swinging. If you need proof for this, look at Fear's performance in Decline. Unparalleled. Great movie! Why is it not available on vid, LD or DVD? Post scriptum The follow-up Pt decline. Also II is hilarious
