After the release of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937), "Walt Disney Productions has continued to produce children's feature-length animated feature films, many of which I have not yet had the pleasure of seeing." The AristoCats (1970), directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, it was the twentieth film in the official Disney canon, and is a romantic musical comedy that revolves around a family of aristocratic cats living in Paris, France in 1910. In the villa of the elderly Madame Adelaide Bonfamille (voiced from Hermione Baddeley), her loving cat animals including Duchess (Eva Gabor) and her three young kittens are the most important residents, and when the clumsy butler, Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby), learns that the cats are inheriting the entire fortune of the old lady, decides to get rid of pets, dumped them in the countryside far from the big city, lost and confused, Duchess and her children reach an acquaintance with a sweet alley cat, Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who agrees to show them the way home. <br /> <br /> Animation-essay, "The AristoCats" is nothing particularly noteworthy, with previous Disney films like "Snow White ??" and "Fantasia (1940)", which demonstrates a similar or even superior visual style. However, is the story interesting and exciting ?? especially for the younger audience, I bet ?? and the musical numbers {which I wish were more numerous} are fantastic. For banal reasons, I'll call my two favorite songs like "Thomas O'Malley Cat" and "Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat", the last of which is a psychedelic comeback in the late 1960s, with a swinging jazz band and delirious flashing colors, led by a fashionable cat called Scat Cat (Scatman Crothers). The journey back to Paris is hectic and adventurous, and we meet friendly characters like Amelia and Abigail Gabble {two talkative geese}, Uncle Waldo (the couple's drunk relative), Georges Hautecourt {Madam Bonfamille's ancient but lively lawyer} and Napoleon and Lafayette (two dogs who were dull-looking and hungry for the butler's tail).
