Shot entirely in Bulgaria, The Man With The Screaming Brain is a hilarious love story between two rich, ugly American guys and a deadly ginger waitress. <br /> <br /> William Cole and his wife Jackie arrive in Bulgaria on a business trip and take a taxi driven by the bully Yegor. Things start to go wrong when Tatoya, the maid, kills Yegor and William and a mad scientist implants a piece of Yegor's brain in William's head. The robots end up being involved, as are the gypsies with broken fingers, head injuries, Bruce Campbell riding a pink Vespa with effervescent streamer, and the All-Of-Me-style comedy of a character at war with a voice in the brain that controls half of his body. <br /> <br /> The Man With The Screaming Brain is an incredibly fun movie. It has the most exhilarating twist I've ever seen (when the Bruce Campbell character, fresh from the lab and complete with scar on his giant forehead and blue hospital pajamas, runs into a square and scares a crowd of people) and a fall down - scene of the homicide that saw the entire test audience laugh. The whole thing is a damn revolt from beginning to end and I would recommend it to any fan of physical comedy, Bruce Campbell, or B-movies in general.
