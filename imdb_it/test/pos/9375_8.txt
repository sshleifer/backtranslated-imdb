A bigoted soldier kills a man to be a Jew and tries to attack him with another soldier. Not as good as the novel on which it was based ("The Brick Foxhole") in which he was a homosexual who was killed ... but Hollywood would not have touched him in 1947. That said, it's still a great film. Anti-Semitism is managed very well, but the fact that bigotry is bad is hammered in the audience ... well! But this was 1947. The film is well played by the entire cast (in particular Robert Young and Robert Ryan) and the tone is very dark ... as it should be. Very impressive too. A great success deserved in his time ... worth seeing.
