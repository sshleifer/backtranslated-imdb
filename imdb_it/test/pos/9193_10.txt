Someone has reviewed this film as a "waste of time" because it expected "the beautiful scenery of Brazil and Portugal", but then everything seemed "faded" or dark, or something like that. I think this person lost the whole part of the movie. This is reality. The purpose of this film is to show that life is not the ideal and to show what people go through in their lives for family, love and survival. A young man leaves his slum in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, to go to Portugal to visit his mother's home after his death. He discovers that not everything is free, and that Brazilians are despised by the natives of Portugal. In the end he finds a life, a love, but the story does not end as planned and this is not a "fairy tale" story. The part that struck me most was the final song, "Zeca Bailero (Honey Baby)" by Gal Costa. It adapts very well to the film; especially the ending.
