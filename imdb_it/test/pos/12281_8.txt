The whole town of Blackstone is afraid, because Bret Dixon's brother has lynched - and he's coming back for revenge! At least that's what they think. <br /> <br /> A great Johnny Hallyday and a star of Mario Adorf very interesting at the beginning of this Italian-western film, obviously filmed in the Alps. <br /> <br /> Bret Dixon is returning to Blackstone for investigate why his brother was lynched. He is a loner and a gunslinger par excellence, everyone is afraid of him - the Mexican bandits (who fight the Gringos who have conquered their land!) As well as the "decent" citizens who lynched Bret's brother. They lynched him because they thought he had stolen their money instead of bringing him to Dallas for bank security there. But this is only half the truth, as we discover in the course of this psychologically interesting western. <br /> <br /> But beware, it is a depressing film since everyone turns out to be guilty in some way and surely everyone is ugly to the bone ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, I liked it very much and I gave him an 8/10. Strange, that less than 5 people voted for this film starting January 12, 2002 ....
