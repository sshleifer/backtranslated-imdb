Not bad, but it could be a better load, it also seems to follow a basic diet for dramatic crime. You have Sandra Bullock as the cop who has difficulty working with others, you put her with a new partner. There is a closed case but a cop who works there anyway, and there are so many lines of corney in the movie that make you want to scream. <br /> <br /> However, if you can look past the formula elements, there's a good movie hidden underneath. It's compelling and the subplots worked for me. It is worth a rent but maybe not a purchase.
