So I guess Bud and Lou just wanted to joke around with classic stories (although they had interesting results). In this case, they are babysitting a bad boy, and Lou tries to read him "Jack and the Bean" but falls asleep and dreams of being Jack and Bud the butcher, and they climb on the bean branch to save the prince the princess with the giant (Buddy Baer). I think my favorite scene was when Lou was trying to make the giant an omelette, and ... well, I'll show you what happens. Since this was an Abbott and Costello movie, they had some useless songs, but other than that, it was pretty funny. For other interpretations of the classic story, "Bewitched" and "Gilligan's Island", both had episodes that portray him.
