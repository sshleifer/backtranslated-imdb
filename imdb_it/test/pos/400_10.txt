A lot of movies that should have had a wider distribution. Ian McShane is at home playing the soul-loving DJ who is boxed because he doesn't "get along with the program" and aims to let the world know what they're losing. The supporting cast is also great and the music is the "Soul" of the film. I just hope the movie is released so that I can get a copy for my film library.
