I'm new to this, so be patient for me. I'm a big Surface fan. I thought the script and computer graphics were great, like all the science fiction movies I saw at the theater. In February the TV guide declared Season Finale, the show's announcer said something about the effect of "... and now for the season finale of Surface". Season Finale, not the series finale! I was looking forward to autumn, to see what happened next. So autumn comes here and it is nowhere to be found! If NBC isn't going to pick it up, what do you think about Sci Fi or the United States? It seems to me that Bay Watch didn't last long on ABC and then in the United States, and that it went like hot cakes! (I bet the ABC was choking) Ha! If not a series, then at least a mini series, to give all of us faithful fans close. What happened to our boy trapped in the church tower? Was it the creature in the chaple Nim? Had a grouth spert? Does the cloned boy come to our side? There are so many unanswered questions. Thanks for listening to me stutter!
