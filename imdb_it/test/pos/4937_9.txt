Over the years some of the funniest films were about dysfunctional families. <br /> <br /> Bonjour, Monsieur Sholmi is a film like that <br /> <br /> This is a film by Isreali about a Moroccan Jewish family. <br /> <br /> This could affect any family, in any culture. We all know or would like to meet people like those of this comic gem. <br /> <br /> This delight of 2003 was written and directed by Shemi Zorkin. We hope he has a long career. <br /> <br /> The film is seen through the eyes of the 16-year-old son, who seems to care about all the family members. Heis was brilliantly portrayed by Oshri Cohen (he was 18 when he shot the film. <br /> <br /> He has been on a bit since then and I know I will hunt them down, hoping this young man will become an international star. br /> <br /> The whole cast is great, I hope to see them again. <br /> <br /> I loved every person in the cast to some extent. I think everyone who sees it will agree . <br /> <br /> He has been nominated for many international awards and won 8, he deserved one. <br /> <br /> Now being a film in a language other than English, he had a very limited race in the United States, which I deem regrettable. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie, you'll be glad you did. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** 1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> NOTE: Since the story is not new, this is the highest rating you can get.
