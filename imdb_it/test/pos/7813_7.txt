I found this an underrated Spaghetti Western, silently convincing (also known as DEAD OR ALIVE). Despite the modest credentials (apart from the multi-purpose co-writer / producer Albert Band, the only noteworthy crew member is the composer Carlo Rustichelli), the film clearly benefits from the presence of its three American stars (newcomer Alex Cord is an ambiguous anti-hero, while veterans Arthur Kennedy and Robert Ryan confer a mythical quality on the acts) and the unusual plot (which involves a paralyzed protagonist, a cunning of amnesty that covers a strategic cleanliness of the city, and that finally has law sided with the gunslinger against a horde of Mexican bandits). <br /> <br /> Are there any difficult action scenes at hand? the film is crowned by a terrifying climax in which the trio of stars is besieged inside a burning cabin ?? plus a couple of scandalous moments that are something of a Spaghetti Western brand: from the center of the street, Cord sees a gunslinger hidden in a window reflected in a bottle of whiskey; a man who helps Cord escape is repeatedly plunged into a pool of oil from the bad guys. Also Nicoletta Machiavelli makes a good impression as a girl from the village with whom Cord is staying; the supporting cast, therefore, is dotted with familiar faces (although largely anonymous) ?? all essentially gender projectors. <br /> <br /> I was not aware of the fact that the English version of the film on the MGM / UA DVD R1 was cut: I was fooled by the wrong execution time being listed on the back cover; the film was only 99 minutes long and not 118 ?? apparently, the character of Cord is killed in the longest Italian version!
