This was a random rent in the video store. But I was struck from the beginning. Wooden Camera is a jewel of a second feature of an engaging director. The film captures deeply penetrating moments and many often frustrating and complicated social interactions that young interracial friends would experience in a modern post-apartheid South Africa. The young actors are pretty good and well oriented in their approach to the basic material and the dialogue is natural and interesting. The film is very rich in visual elements and offers a frame by frame study of deeper understanding and realization without falling into iconic stereotypes and clich√©s. The film's soundtrack adds body to the film without being intrusive. After looking at it for the second time, I tracked the DVD on Amazon and I've been happy ever since.
