Night of the Demons (1988) was another in a long series of "teen" horror films that were released on video and pay-t.v. during that 80s cinema mecca. But unlike most of the crap that was passed off, this was actually a decent watch. A group of bored "teenagers" decide to celebrate Halloween night with a pair of bizarre sisters (Mimi Kinkade and Linnea Quigley) at the infamous Hull House. Your usual cast of stereotypical teenagers is invited to the party. But an average teenage bash turns into a night of terror as they try to survive the night of Halloween when the undead inhabitants of Hull House decide to bring down the party. Who will survive this night of bloodshed and horror? <br /> <br /> A beautiful horror film that is best seen in the unrated version. If you look at the R-Rated cut, you will lose all the splatter and nudity effects. Stay tuned for the fun epilogue! A gory movie that was followed by an equally funny sequel. Only for horror fans! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
