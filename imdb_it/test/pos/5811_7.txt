As a big fan of Hammer Studios and an enthusiastic observer of their gothic horror movies, I wonder what it took so long to start watching their television series "Hammer House of Horror", which lasted only for a season in 1980 Now that I have seen the first four episodes of the show, I can say that it easily meets my expectations so far. Although this first episode "Witching Time" is perhaps not the most imaginative horror story ever told, and does not convey the wonderful gothic atmosphere that I love Hammer films from the 50s to the 70s, it has undoubtedly success in telling surprisingly spooky tale and create some genuine creepy within fifty minutes. The soundtrack composer David Winter (Jon Finch) is tormented by the 17th-century witch Lucinda (Patricia Quinn) ... While the story may be simple, but for less than an hour of execution, it is effective and offers many gruesome moments. Northern Irish actress Patricia Quinn, who is probably best known for her role in "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" (1975) as well as the fantastic comedy Monty Python "Monty Python's Meaning of Life" (1983), is wonderfully mischievous in her role that fits her like a glove. Jon Finch is also quite as good as David, and while Prunella Gee, who plays his adulterous actress wife, may not be the best actress ever, she's definitely pretty to look at. The episode is accompanied by a nice score that sounds good with the atmosphere. Overall, "Witching Time" is a very entertaining episode with several truly gruesome moments, and decent opening to the series.
