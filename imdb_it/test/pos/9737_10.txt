I loved "Flash Gordon" as a child and watching the series on DVD again brings such fascinating memories. Each 15-minute episode presents the adventures of our hero Flash, the adorable Dale Arden and the intrepid Dr. Zarkov on the planet Mongo, with Flash escaping death on every corner: the Shark Men almost drown him, face the Fire Monster in the Tunnel of Terror, and is in mortal danger in the Static Room! <br /> <br /> The characters are still funny: Buster Crabbe is a bit like the blond hero of dreams and Jean Rogers is a delicate and beautiful Dale Arden. Princess Aura still plots to steal Flash for herself, the Vultan King of Falcon Men still has his explosive laugh and angel wings, and Ming the Merciless, the Emperor of the Universe, is still giving everyone the eye evil and chills. <br /> <br /> This serial would probably not interest today's children with its hockey effects - oh, that spaceship! - but it's a bit of nostalgia for those who liked it the first time. The actors interpret it well and don't mess around with children. I realize that the young spectators should have read the synopsis of the chapters that contained rather large words. <br /> <br /> I'm glad it came out on DVD. It's very fun to revisit this classic science fiction serial.
