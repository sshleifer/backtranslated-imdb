Well, this episode teases Al Gore. I'm sure he'll take out a few liberals. The fact is that South Park makes fun of everyone, just like the Simpsons. If you offend yourself that a politician likes you is teased then maybe you need a better sense of humor and you're taking the show too seriously. That being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best. The portrait of Al Gores is hilarious, the Cartman scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will make you roll on the floor laughing. It's pretty much everything you'd ever want from an episode of South Park and it's easily one of my favorites. I won't comment too much on the plot because I don't want to give anything.
