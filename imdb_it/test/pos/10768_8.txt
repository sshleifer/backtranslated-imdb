In 2 of his historical martial arts films, Chiba portrays his true sensei Mas Oyama. The film also recreates Oyama's incredible feat of killing an angry bull with his bare hands (Oyama made this feat over 50 times in real life). Dynamic fighting choreography with authentic Kyokushinkai techniques. Ironically, this is one of Sonny Chiba's rare films in which he doesn't tear or rip off parts of the body of the opponents. A must see for Sonny Chiba fans, certainly one of his 5 best films
