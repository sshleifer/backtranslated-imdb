This strange and hypnotic drama by Don Siegel / Clint Eastwood was left on the roadside in 1971 and what a pity. A fascinating study of the character with some great women for Squint to face. Geraldine Page was one of our supreme actresses and is perfectly expressive. The young Jo Ann Harris is a blatant flirtatious, and Elizabeth Hartman (who died too young) is undeniably repressed. <br /> <br /> A 7 out of 10. Best performance = C. Eastwood. Released the same year as DIRTY HARRY, this one did nothing, besides having good reviews. Search for this unless you are alone in the "Explosion" movies. Very thin and scary, this piece will stay with you.
