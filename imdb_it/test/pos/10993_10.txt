In the wasteland that Hollywood Productions has recently become, this film - in itself - is truly "MANNA DAL CIELO" !!! <br /> <br /> In what could best be described as a "cute" film, about 350 years of cinematographic acting experience (all things considered - giving or taking 100 years!) joyfully illuminates the screen to tell a story of deception, remorse and redemption on a Catholic family in Buffalo, New York. <br /> <br /> Truly well positioned to take its place in the genre of the "good" movie, this small and independent film from the Burton Sisters FIVE SISTERS PRODUCTIONS COMPANY will leave a smile on your face and joy in your heart, while renewing your faith in humanity. <br /> <br /> From the spectacular opening scenes of Buffalo, New York to the end credits, the film manages to tell a story that could have been told by any family, anywhere. Yet somehow this particular family gathering and "family by association" in a small non-descriptive house in Buffalo is more than adequate for the account. If you've never been to Buffalo, you'll leave the theater with thoughts of "mingling" for a visit! Shots of the monuments and the surroundings of the city contribute to give the film a picturesque and realistic tone, which fits perfectly. The tranquil beauty of the "City of the Queen of the Great Lakes" compliments, rather than diminishes the story being told. If only more films could take advantage of the natural beauty of this country's "second cities" instead of running somewhere on a stage, the final results would be much more credible. <br /> <br /> Great shows by Shirley Jones, Frank Gorshin, Wendy Malick, Jill Eickenberry, and the rest of the ensemble cast show once again that true talent surpasses Hollywood's "flavor of the week" at all times ! <br /> <br /> GO TO THIS FILM! <br /> <br /> You've been wandering in the Hollywood desert for too long!
