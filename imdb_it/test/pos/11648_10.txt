Having read most of the comments I feel like I have a word to say. <br /> <br /> What bothers me most is that most people here think that this movie is for or against the subject of death penalty and if it worked with them. I remember reading an article in 1995 when the film was released (yes, it interested me so much since I knew it would turn out that I didn't forget the articles I read then) that Tim Robbins said he didn't make a film to convince the public neither of one nor the other. <br /> <br /> And I think it's absolutely right. I must admit that I believe that, in the way he made this film, he tended the anti-death side a little, but still people are allowed to make their choice. And this is a very rare thing in American films. <br /> <br /> I have shown this film to many people since it came out and I have seen all kinds of reactions. Supporters of the death penalty became opponents or became even stronger in their faith. And many opponents of the death penalty (including me) have become stronger in their belief that the death penalty should be abolished everywhere in the world. But I've even seen opponents turn into supporters. This and the fact that people here seem to be arguing show me that there are really many ways to look at it. So whatever effect it has on you, the important thing is that it makes you think. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films that really gives you the choice, which does not shy away from a simple path of making the condemned or innocent guilty. This can be a difficult thing for people who prefer to be entertained or teach a lesson. There is no lesson here, you have to find one yourself. <br /> <br /> Everyone praises the acting, the direction and the music, but since this has been said many times I will not repeat it anymore. <Br /> <br /> So, if you haven't seen it yet, do it - if you dare to be challenged!
