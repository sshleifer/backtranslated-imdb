I did something a little daring tonight when I saw this movie. I tried to wean myself from silent soundtracks. Of course, when this film was originally released, a piano score was probably played. Often, the director would have chosen the soundtrack himself (Charlie Chaplin often composed the soundtracks of his latest silent films). But most of the music you listen to on VHS tapes on silent movies is by no means the same music that should have been played when the film was first released. And then again, there were many silent films that were played without a score. I don't know the history of Potemkin's score, so I decided to watch it for the medium with which this artwork was produced within the film. <br /> <br /> Shortly after turning off the music, without help (or should I say without obstacles) from the musical interpretation of the emotions on the screen, I became completely attached to the film. Visually, it is easily one of the most incredible of all movies. Eisenstein was a master of composition. Editing, perhaps the Eisenstein film technique is more famous for (editing), it is extraordinary. The atmosphere of this film is anger, and it sparked my passions violently. <br /> <br /> It takes a lot of effort to enjoy a silent movie, especially a drama, but films like the Battleship Potemkin show that this effort is worth it. Come on! You owe it to yourself to watch this movie! Your education is incomplete without it.
