Dear readers, 2001: A Space Odyssey is Kubrick at his best ... although I can't really say that because Space Odyssey is his only film I've ever seen. But anyway, it's a good movie. Strange, but good. <br /> <br /> The film is in three acts, very similar to the novel ... which is not surprising since the author wrote the script. In any case, let's start with the simple but spectacular opening with even Sparach Zarathustra at full volume on the speakers. Then comes the boring "Dawn of Man" sequence. Then there is the strange sequence "Finding the Monolith" on the Moon, played in Strauss' Blue Danube. Finally things are going well with the Spaceship and HAL scenes going berserk and killing people. After this, things fade and we have the "Entering the Monolith" sequence that has been too long and the ending ultra-strange. Although, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a good movie. It's not Star Wars, Stargate, Terminator or The Abyss, but it swings. My compliments to the chef, Mr. Kubrick. <br /> <br /> Signed, The Constant DVD Collector
