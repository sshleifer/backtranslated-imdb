The basic plot of this film has already been detailed in many other comments, so I won't worry. I would like first of all to praise the producer, the cast, the directors and the crew for creating a wonderfully engaging film on a meager $ 1 million budget, a small part of the standard Hollywood fare that doesn't seem convenient. These people have a drive to do something new and fun without spending a fortune to do it. This is essentially art for art. I know, I know, some of you will decide that this is not art but something less and that's fine. For example, I am pleased that people like these will continue to devote time and effort to our benefit without expecting huge multimillion-dollar profits. <br /> <br /> Now to criticism. I feel that the scenario presented is credible up to a certain point. It's wonderful when everything works and the hero / heroine saves the day and all is well. What strikes me is the blatant manipulation of events so that blind fortune is more responsible for courage and strength. <br /> <br /> When Lee was attacked but not seriously injured, she somehow washed herself on a mud bank right next to the dead guide. Then, miraculously, his loaded revolver is still in his holster and really works (after a little cleaning and fiddling). Finally, when Lee is attacked on the mud bank and jumps into the water, once again the croc fails to kill her. He ends up with his hand in his (her?) Mouth and succeeds in repeatedly pressing the trigger, at the end to blow the crocodile's brains (literally). <br /> <br /> I came to the conclusion that having Lee gape with the croc was just a way to end the film with the human in triumph. Based on what I saw, the croc attack and continue to resist until the prey stops fighting. Croc's will turn around and around to dismember and drown the prey. This happened to the first 3 victims but not to Lee. He had teeth marks but they were not deep. I think the ending would have been better if the croc had won, sincerely, thus demonstrating its dominion over mangroves, its territory for millions of years. But then, how many of us would have been upset or disappointed that the beautiful girl hadn't come out alive?
