To solve a challenging problem, you need to start by asking the right questions. Without these, even the largest information library is useless. This film does just that - where other films guide your thinking along a storyboard, this film attracts your emotions and your understanding of justice and what is allowed. These questions will fascinate you all the time, challenging your assumptions as the characters develop. This film is important. It is important and a must see for anyone informed of current affairs. The fact that it is a lot of fun and includes a large number of movie stars only improves the performance. My advice: watch it with a serious crowd or, better yet, alone, not unlike how you read an editorial from your favorite magazine. In this case there is a difference: the answers will be yours.
