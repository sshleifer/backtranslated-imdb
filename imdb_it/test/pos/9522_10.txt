I have always loved French films because I think they are full of much more emotion and sense than Americans. This film is a jewel. <br /> <br /> Beginning with the wedding that is so fun that you just want to join them and in the end where the little family children tell us who is with whom it is extremely fun. Catherine Deneuve is simply hot and so good that it is absolutely possible for a young man to fall in love with her, and Vincen Lindon is perfect for that role. The best scene (except the wedding party) is in the family reunion in which Antoine got angry and shouts his feelings to Lea in front of the family. It is a pity that I could only buy this film from French and not from English (so I have to learn in French to enjoy the vision) !!
