Terry and June were one of the classic British sitcoms in my opinion. You knew what to expect - and it's not that simple! :) Unlike modern sit-coms with completely artificial textures, this show is still a breath of fresh air. How nice not to see or hear comments on bodily functions or not to see a family PERFECTLY late for breakfast or a family with impossible teenagers. And here is the secret: Terry & June was based on a middle class couple who lived in relative harmony instead of today's plots with the dysfunctional family "de rigueur" (made to look like a hip). <br /> <br /> Personally, I vote the episode "Bridge to far" as one of the best. In a way, Terry's antics remind me of Basil Fawlty - both of which sometimes become almost incredibly embarrassing! <br /> <br /> Terry and June are highly recommended.
