Compared to the acclaimed Hollywood remake, this film is less flashy but much more effective in providing an overview of the drug problem. The remake loses the most interesting of the three threads of the plot, that of a farmer whose meager livelihoods depend on drugs as a cash payment crop and whose greater involvement in drug trafficking in an attempt to destroy himself and his family. Furthermore, the story of the daughter's dependence enters into problems not only of withdrawal but of the high probability of relapse. This original miniseries makes good use of the additional time to delve into the issues and remains stronger on this controversial topic.
