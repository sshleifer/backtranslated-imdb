Peter O'Toole gives a brilliant interpretation in this film. I saw the original version with Robert Donat and I much prefer the performance of Peter O'Toole and the film in general, even if it's a musical. I've never seen anything that Mr. O'Toole has inside that I don't like. He is a brilliant, multifaceted actor who offers shows full of passion and depth. Petula Clark also gave a surprisingly good performance and was perfect for the part. It is a moving film, full of tenderness and bittersweet fun. I will always remember (in para-sentence) the sentence in which Mr. Chips regrets never having given his children, and she replies: "Of course you have, hundreds of them - all the boys". Thank you for the opportunity to vote for this film and to express my opinion.
