Corneal warning. As many other IMDb users already know, I am not a mischievous and fat person. If you don't want to read this kind of review, then go. <br /> <br /> To tell you the truth, you're listening to this from a man who laughed at Titanic and almost broke his parents' tape by continuously rewinding the propeller scene. <br /> <br /> --- Spoilers --- <br /> <br /> One day, I went to the cinema with two friends to see Dickie Roberts: Ex Child Star, last year in August. The boring trailers continued until one started so quietly. It was for the radio. The moment I saw the trailer, I had to watch this movie on the opening weekend. When that weekend ended, Scary Movie 3 also came out so many teenagers were there waiting in line that Friday night. It turns out that the movie is sold out and those teenagers were so desperate to watch a movie, they went and even sold Good Boy and Radio. I couldn't get a ticket and in the following weeks I was busy with more important things. About 5 months later, my friend rented Radio. He let me borrow and I looked at him in my room. I'll tell you this now, this is the ONLY movie I've ever seen that made me cry EVER. When Radio's mother died, she just came out automatically. The next day, I went to Blockbuster and bought the DVD. <br /> <br /> Well enough of my stupid personal story, let me tell you about the movie. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding Jr. star as a mentally challenged man, nicknamed Radio. Ed Harris is co-star and this film is directed by Mike Tollin. Based on a true story, Radio is a teenager who has a life spending most of her day alone. He goes around with a shopping cart picking up everything he can and is always carrying a radio around. He has his collection. At the end of each day, he goes home to his mother. He never went to school until later in the movie. One day, the radio passes from the local high school while the soccer team practices. A balloon flies over the fence and Radio picks it up and continues. Ed Harris plays Mr. Jones, the football coach. They meet and this is the life of Radio. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Radio and Coach Jones spend quality moments together, teaching each other things. It's nice to see how the movie goes to the highest joys, the lowest lows and only to see Radio live its life. Laugh, cry and live the life of Radio with him. This film holds a special place in my heart along with Toy Story and others. This is a must for the whole family, alone, or if you are someone who just wants a great drama. Radio is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. The radio will never be forgotten by me. Never. <br /> <br /> As the character of Ed Harris said very close to the end of the film: <br /> <br /> "We're not teaching on the radio, the radio is teaching us." <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
