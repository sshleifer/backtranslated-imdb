The word impossible has led many to select a particular vision for an incredible task. In 1927, it was believed that no man could fly the breath of the Atlantic Ocean. Many have tried but failed and some have even sacrificed their lives. However, it had to be done as each challenge must be met with equal determination. Such is therefore the heart of this film called "The Spirit of St. Louis". The actor chosen for this historical film is none other than the American James Stewart himself who convincingly plays Charles Lindbergh. Although there are many facets of Lindbergh's life, the segment presented here is his commitment to being the First Man to fly across the Atlantic. The story is interesting and for Stewards fans to say the least convincing. In search of sufficient funds to build a special plane, the fatal decision to start the journey on a gloomy day in May 1927, Luck Lindy, as he was baptized, took enormous risks, which are represented in this wonderful film. Other notables who helped make this film credible are Murray Hamilton who plays Bud Gurney, Bartlett Robinson in the role of Ben Mahoney, Arthur Space and Charles Watts in the role of O.W. Schultz. The sum total of this now famous film is that, despite its poor approval for its debut, it has since become a full-fledged Classic. Very well! ****
