Criminal and criminal career leader, Abel Davos (Lino Ventura) has been on the run for over 10 years, hiding in Milan, Italy. In his absence, he was sentenced to death in his country of French origin for his crimes. Disillusioned with his life in Italy and with the police approaching him, he decides to return to his old stomping ground in Paris. By sending his wife Therese and two young sons to Nice, Abel and his neighbor in command Raymond Naldi make one last robbery to finance their new lives in France. The robbery yields a paltry half a million francs, much less than their sources have suggested, despite this and with the hunting police both arriving in Nice, where they hide briefly. After stealing a pleasure boat from a local, they aim to reach a tourist place in Sanremo where they will mix more easily, but are stopped by armed officers on a deserted beach, a shooting and Therese and Naldi are both killed. A Davos wounded with two children in tow will be easily spotted by the police, so he calls his old friends in Paris to send help, but they have passed since their old friend hid and they are not too inclined to take a risk for themselves themselves, so they send a small thief of time, Eric Stark (Jean Paul Belmondo) to save him. Davos is disgusted by the fact that such a low thief was sent to his aid, despite the fact that he immediately struck him with the charming Stark, he proposes to find out why he was snubbed, but their betrayal does not end there. /> <br /> Class Tous Risques (also known as Big Risk) was written for the screen by former death row inmate and crime writer Jose Giovanni (Le Trou, Le Clan des Siciliens), with Ventura already at board for the project, Giovanniwanted Someone unique to direct the project, Ventura suggested an assistant director who had drawn his attention to a previous project, one Claude Sautet, the best known at the time for assisting Georges Franju on Les Yeux sans Visage. Sautet immediately accepted and the rest as it is said is history. Sautet has created a nice gangster film, which plays heavily on characters and relationships. Davos constantly hidden has plenty of time to reflect on his life, past, present and future, his friendships that no longer seem to be those he believed to be, his now dead wife and what will become of his two young children. Ventura as a leading actor has always amazed me, being at the same time comfortable and convincing both in the police and in the criminal brotherhood, here his world tired of exhibitions is sublime and powerful as his world collapses everything around him, like loneliness and loneliness of a man on the run to kick in. The former profession of Ventura as a professional wrestler is very useful when he throws Parisien's thugs around with a consummate ease. Belmondo in the role of Stark animates the other plot of the film, that of his budding relationship with a girl he meets during the journey. With his sincere charm, his coming clean to this woman in danger that he is just a "Voleur" and that "the only good thing about me is my left" while knocking out his attacker, it is also a joy to see, how she falls for him anyway. Belmondo's performance was neglected at the time, as Godard's A bout de Souffl√© was released just three weeks earlier, Godard got the credit for discovering the new guy on the block, his versatility within these two film, being there to see and admire everyone. Sautet's film is a classy affair, with lots of interesting places, the film also has very little dialogue, Sautet prefers to let the actors do the work with the minimum of looks or enough glances to investigate the story, needles to say that this Noir fan will make him control more than Sautet's work in the future.
