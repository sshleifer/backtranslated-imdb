This is a cult film for many reasons. First because of the phenomenal success as a musical both on Broadway and in London, then as a musical film. The film is close to the show and some of the show's provocations are no longer provocative twelve years later. The anti-Vietnam war discourse is no longer a protest song against the war itself, but a strong song that shows how the youth of the late 1960s managed to bring down the political establishment. Milos Forman plays with some situations in the late 1970s like the narrow justice of the mind, the egocentric umbilical rectitude of the rich or the little ones who have only one degree of power more than the impotent ones. He also plays heavily with the racial element and sexual ambiguity he builds all the time. The film remains pleasant and thoughtful. And of course it is a tremendous thrill to remember those years when we had the privilege, and it was not a possibility, to live them. On November 11, 1969, Nixon ordered the mass celebration for the armistice of 1918, which became the order for teachers of all levels to bring their students to the celebration and march, thus supporting the invasion of Cambodia which was in full swing. And some dare to give democracy lessons abroad. I also remember the long Nixon impeachment campaign in 1973-1974 that eventually led to his resignation and the oath of Gerald Ford, the first Vice President, and finally President, of the United States that had not been elected, since he was appointed Vice President by the Senate after Spiro Agnew had to resign to face trial, sentencing and sentencing for embezzlement. Of course it makes us think of today when in 2000 a president of the United States was not elected by the people but by the Supreme Court, or of a war that was rejected by millions of millions from the beginning and even before departure, and was started against the best judgment of the United Nations and three permanent members of the Security Council. And some speak of a new world order based on respect for others. Modern western man seems to have some problems understanding that the world is changing and has already widely and wisely changed. Modern Western man seems to be out of sync and needs special evening lessons to learn that democracy wants the majority of the world to be the majority, and the West is far from that majority, and that if the Soviet bloc were capable understand that the market economy is not capitalism, but that the market economy can be socialist or capitalist, the Berlin Wall would have fallen, but vice versa, and that China has learned this lesson wonderfully well and is at the foot of wall that they climb over to learn that their socialist market economy must lead to political democracy, but they will, just as Vietnam was able to rebuild itself after thirty years of aggression and vicious war damage. In other words, Hair is a perfect starting point for reflection. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne and University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
