Thank God for this movie. It is a talented document that, thirty years later, seems even more unique and rare in retrospect. <br /> <br /> The music is simply extraordinary, full of talent for writing, performance, arrangement and production which is absolutely infectious. The lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible. Talented performances like Nell Carter and Ren Woods lift my spirits whenever I hear them. Although the film may be different from the theatrical version, I prefer the soundtrack to the cast album, which I find really grateful and underdeveloped. Here the arrangements are completed and expanded into dynamic pieces that could not be produced in a scenic setting. <br /> <br /> But music is not the only extraordinary thing about this film. The juxtaposition of almost hyper-realistic dialogue scenes (reminds me of Altman's films), the interconnection with exuberant numbers of music and dance, really works. All the talent of this film - directing, writing, photography, editing, music, choreography, casting, acting, costume, art direction - blend perfectly into one of the best musical films I've seen. <br /> <br /> I think it's amazing how much we know about the "Hair" characters, based on very little information or plot. They are not designed as caricatures, but as realistic and very human people. We see small glimpses of where they come from, but the portrait is completed with cartoons that draw the characters on the surface through acting, directing and editing. There is a subtle theme of the misogyny of Berger and Hud that colors their characters exposing their reckless macho-hippie ideology. Berger's domestic life scene reveals important details about his psychology, and the brief look at Claude's house tells us volumes about his background through the simple, realistic and genuine interaction between Claude and (presumably) his father. <br /> <br /> I love fashion in this film. It cleverly combines 60s ideas with VERY seventy-year looks (Treat Williams hair extensions should be overlooked ...). It is a document of how very chic the end of the seventies was, contrary to the conventional wisdom that the era was about bad taste. Claude's beige knitted tie was a hot trend from 1979, and the hair and clothes of singers and dancers (especially those in white during the Central Park scene) mix decades in a way that suggests the timelessness of the themes music. These elements merge with the extraordinary choreography of Twyla Tharpe in a way that enhances the artistic ability of both. <br /> <br /> "Hair" is not a film that rewards cynicism. If you come with expectations, then you will most likely be held captive by artists who are not bound by your rules. For me, it has opened my eyes, my ears and my spirit to a penetrating and passionate musical dialogue about war, friendship and the family that transcends its time and is still significant and relevant to me to date.
