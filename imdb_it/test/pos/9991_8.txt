At age 20, Francis Ouimet (Shia Lebouf) as his whole life before him - in a sense. The son of a family of immigrants who lived in the United States between the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the lesson was a very limiting fact in life. If one is born poor, he remains poor; if one is born in the bourgeoisie, one has a minimum of opportunities; if one is born in the wealthy class, in practice he did it in the shade. The British gold champion Harry Vardon and the idol of Francis's golf (played by Stephen Dillane, a criminally undervalued) is the exception that confirms the rule. Born and raised in a poor British family, his golfing skills allowed him to rise from the dirty mess of the poorer slums to the lush greens of English country clubs. He has not forgotten this life lesson. Francis wants to follow in the footsteps of Vardon and similarly uses his great golfing skills to enter the 1913 US Open at age 20. But a difficult course and formidable opponents (including the idol of Francis Harry Vardon) are not all that Francis has to take care of a poorly understanding father and a cruel social structure are in his way of living his dream. <br /> <br /> I know what you're thinking - I thought so too - a movie produced by Walt Disney on the United States in 1913 Open with the irritable Shia LaBeouf has the chance to be fun but it can't be a great movie . Well, I'm here to encourage you to reconsider. Despite what might seem a bit on paper, The Greatest Game Ever Played is one of the best sports films of creation. <br /> <br /> As in every great sports movie, The Greatest Game Ever Played includes many exciting sports scenes but it's not a * on * golf film - it's a character-centered film about using one's talents, about following your dreams and the demolition of class barriers. Where the biggest game ever played works excellently as a sports-themed movie, it also works as well as a period film - the costumes and scenes in the foreground of the film are best for real-time travel. Even the film looks simply * great and virtually unknown, music composer Brian Tyler set the film on a wonderful piece of music. The cast is also great with a subtle but powerful Stephen Dillane in the role of British golf champion Harry Vardon, a hilarious Stephen Marcus in the role of the male golfer Ted Ray, a Josh Flitter hammam in Francis Eddie's pre-teenaged cadet and a surprisingly good Shia LaBeouf in the main role of Francis. Actor Bill Paxton (Apollo 13, Titanic) becomes the director here for the second time (directing a feature) in The Best Game Ever Played. It produces a refined product - which incorporates a lot of heart, ingenuity and attention to detail in the making of the film.
