I saw this film about basic cinema while I was in the Air Force, so my affection for this could be influenced by the reaction of the raucous audience that attended the theater that evening. But I think this film was one of the first popular kung-fu movies and helped to kick start the trends in the early 1970s. It is worth seeing.
