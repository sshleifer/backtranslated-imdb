This is a generally fast-moving funny movie of the early 1930s. When you have James Cagney in mind, these "pre-code" movies are even better: just fun things to watch. Usually, when the films are "dated", it is negative, but not so with the films of 1930-1934. Yes, with jargon and attitudes, clothes, hairstyles, etc., they are dated but this is an important part of the fun. These films have an advantage for them that they are almost always fun to watch. <br /> <br /> They also have a pinch that is attractive and charming. You see people - like the juvenile delinquents depicted in this film and their stupid parents - whom you don't see in any period except this one (early 1930s). At the beginning of this film, the children go before the judge and you sit down and laugh at these crazy characters who appear in court on behalf of their children, one after the other. Yes, we have the stereotype of the emotional Italian father; the Jewish father; the Anglo-Saxon mother and some other mothers who all dramatically claim their is a "good boy". Even if things are predictable in some cases, you don't mind because everyone here is so fun to watch. <br /> <br /> This also teaches you that children were punks 75 years ago, even stealing, stealing, attacking, lying - hey, this is the human condition. This film belies the theory that "people were prettier in the old days". No, people have always been rotten or good. The degree was helped by their environment, parents, financial situation and other things. Here, we have a group of "Dead End" guys that end up in the Reform School. <br /> <br /> The ridiculous and stupidly liberal plot has children who act immediately as angels once they have directed the show to the reform school; he was not punished in any way for dropping a man to his death and setting fire to the institution (the explanation: he was a villain and he deserved it, so much for real justice and reform); and "Patsy" shot a guy without ever being questioned by the police because he is the good guy! Notice the subtle anti-religious excavation in which the only boy seen praying is the evil "guardian". It is not a coincidence, no accident. That sort of negative association has been going on ever since the Hays Code was boxed in the late 1960s and was seen, as can be seen, in the Pre-Code of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Dudley Digges, by the way, is exceptional in his role as "bad boy" of "Mr. Thomson". In particular, his voice was very effective and I could imagine him playing one of those evil roles as head of an institution in a film adaptation by Charles Dickens. Cagney played his normal role, the unscrupulous tough guy who gets the pretty girl, "Dorothy Griffith", played by Madge Blake. Frankie Darro was also effective as the boys' leader, "Jimmy Smith". Only the looks on Darro's face made his character credible. Something was the real protagonist of the film, but I'll still go with Cagney. The rest of the reform school children were not too credible and were indeed ethnic stereotypes, but they were all fun to watch. <br /> <br /> I thought the most interesting part of the film was the first 20 minutes when we saw how bad these guys were and we saw good, bad and stereotyped parents in court after the children were arrested. Those scenes are pure 30's Dead End Kids stuff. They have always shown the boys to be bad news at the beginning of the film, but when the story was over they all seemed to act more like Wally and Beaver Cleaver - the "ugly" thugs. It's very far-fetched, but it works, as far as entertainment is concerned. <br /> <br /> Overall, a fun but very funny movie, typical of Cagney's films and those of the early 30's. Almost everyone estimates at least eight stars for their entertainment value.
