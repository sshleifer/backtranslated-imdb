I had always heard of this fantastic mini-series, but I saw it for the first time this week, in July 2007. I can understand why he started the career of many young actors. The story is intriguing and offers wonderful insights into the previous period and during the civil war. I cared about the characters and how their lives evolved during this time. Some of them were stereotypes, but they helped me see how people thought during the 1800s. Many historical facts have been thrown into history and it was interesting to see the history books come to life. The costumes and sets were fantastic! I really enjoyed watching both parts I and II. Part III is a disappointment.
