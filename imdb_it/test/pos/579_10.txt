This wonderful film captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy fun, funny, sweet and memorable, it's hard to decide where to start. <br /> <br /> From the opening number, "Rainbow Connection", the excellent Paul Williams score sung with taste by Kermit D. Frog, which gives us a prologue of what the whole adventure is, throughout the story, this is a funny movie. <br /> <br /> Essentially, it's a road movie, where Kermit crosses the country with the dream of pursuing a "rich and famous contract" to entertain. Along the way, our green hero meets a series of other aspiring actors, comedians, singers and musicians, who coincidentally, are muppets like Kermit himself. Is this how the Muppets really started? "Approximately how it happened," Kermit tells us. <br /> <br /> Not since "It's a crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy world" the cameo formula has been used so prolifically and successfully. The aspiring stars meet many recognizable faces during their Odyssey; some flash on the screen, but others have memorable cameos. The funny piece of Steve Martin as a rude waiter is probably the best. The puppeteer Jim Henson mentioned his inspiration, Edgar Bergen, is particularly touching. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has ever seen the Muppets television series will see all his favorite characters, they are all here. The puppet work is magnificent; look especially at Kermit riding a bicycle (how do you do it?) In-jokes and references to old movies are everywhere, but the best one-liners are reserved for Kermit himself. An example: when the criminals terrorize Kermit and Piggy, she affectionately tells her short, green and beautiful beau, "I wouldn't give up tonight for nothing, would I?" "Uhhh, make me an offer ..." I also love the shooting at the scene. OK Corral: brilliantly absurd nonsense. <br /> <br /> I have to have "Movin 'now" now, but to summarize: a good film that can be appreciated by anyone, regardless of age or taste of the film genre. Highly recommended.
