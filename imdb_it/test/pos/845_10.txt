I'm sorry to see that it has been rated so low by many people. The series started very well and after the first season it didn't go so well. <br /> <br /> People tend to forget the beginning of something and only look at the end. It's not nice to do, you should look at the total, not the final result. It is sad that many of the "usual" characters are dead but, damn it, we had a lot of nice NEW characters. <br /> <br /> Please don't get attached to some characters but stick to the series, the plot. Please understand that I didn't like it when Boone died, when Augur died, but well ... it has to be done. Can you imagine that everyone continues to live the entire series when they are always in danger? Come on, face it, if they didn't die they would be invincible. In this way you will always keep the tension, will it survive, will it die? I realize that people stick to the characters, I do it too. My favorite character was Augur, the one who could get into every computer he wanted. It was what was mysterious, he could do things with the computer that no one else could do. <br /> <br /> I want to make a statement to all the people who vote in negative, does a series that started so well deserve to have such a low rating? Should we watch the final season instead of the total? Shouldn't we see how good the series was when it started? Shouldn't we see how much fun we've had?
