If there's a good suspense movie, this is one of them. James Stewart stages an amazing exhibition like Dr. American Ben McKenna who, with his wife and son, is on tour in Africa. They run into a murder scene and Dr. McKenna's son is kidnapped hours later. <br /> <br /> Before being able to say "Fasten your seat belts", Dr. McKenna finds out too much about a murder attempt and tries to stop it. However, other people know that it can be dangerous, (dangerous for them, that is) and try to eliminate it. <br /> <br /> In the end, Hank, the son, is found alive and well. <br /> <br /> If you like suspense movies, this is the one to watch. <br /> <br /> My score: 8/10.
