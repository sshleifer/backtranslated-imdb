One True Thing shows that the characters make a movie. Streep will surely receive an Oscar nomination for his role. A beautiful drama, One True Thing is a great example of film production in the late 90s - there are still people out there who are concerned about making and watching movies other than big hits with millions of dollars special effects. It's not the best movie or anything ... don't be silly. But the amount of emotion that was expressed by both the actors and the writer struck me as a shock wave. I cried twice in this film, which says a lot to a 24-year-old man.
