The fact that after 50 years is still a highly watchable movie, he talks a lot about it. It's smarter and more interesting than almost any recent movie of the same kind you can find, and it has a certain captivating feeling of innocence. I'm not a big fan of this type of film, but I could watch it all without getting bored, which makes it a good movie to watch with someone who doesn't necessarily share your taste in movies. I liked the black and white palette, the excellent casting, the clever robbery scene that makes you think about what trick they will bring later and to the end like everyone else. Watching the sequence of robberies makes us understand the power of silence, which unfortunately is so little used in today's cinema.
