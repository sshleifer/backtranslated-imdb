Valeria, an elegant and graceful young lady lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shyness and depression. Even if you can have a lover of one night or if someone lives with you, it makes no difference to be completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can take action to get closer to that special man, Massimo, and at the same time the fear that allows her to answer her questions only with a "yes", "no" or "I don't know". The way to accentuate the loneliness of the character is magnificent. An example would be the distance of both, Massimo and Valeria taking a coffee in the same room, separated by thin divisions and not seeing each other. I could mention several sequences, however, it is better to see the film. It is impressive to note that not a single detail is out of control by the director. Although all actions are performed with slow movements, no cries, no special effects, but only great acting and a touching, well-written story are required. I loved it.
