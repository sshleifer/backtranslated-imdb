I use IMDB a lot. Mainly by reading other people's comments on the films I've seen or not. I thought it was time to write a few words about this film that changed my life and the way I watch a movie. I think I saw him at least a dozen times since the fall of 94, when I saw him for the first time at the theater. <br /> <br /> I feel that Kieslowski is one of the best directors of all time. And I think this is his best. It was his last. I was very sad the day I knew he was dead, because surely we lost the chance to get something more from him. <br /> <br /> RED is only the best Kieslowski + incredible performance by Trintignant & Jacob + Sobocinski's cinematography. If you haven't seen it, look for it !!! If you have it, go back !! <br /> <br /> Red: just a masterpiece. please forgive my poor English! reader
