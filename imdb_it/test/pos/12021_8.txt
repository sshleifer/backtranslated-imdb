Although I saw this film when I was very young, I already knew the story of Wild the Thief-Taker and Shepherd who managed to escape from Newgate prison. <br /> <br /> In addition to the freedom taken at the end, the film follows the true story more or less faithfully. The temptation to bend the facts, which is the hallmark of many so-called historical films, is contrasted in this film and filmmakers must be praised for it. <br /> <br /> Of the shows, there is almost no poor performance, and Tommy Steele is ideally chosen. Stanley Baker is also fine as Thief-Taker and Alan Badel is as good as ever. <br /> <br /> Because the film sticks to the facts, it makes it suitable for the whole family to watch.
