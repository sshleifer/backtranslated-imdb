I hadn't heard much about this film, except for the fact that it was the national award and the entrance to the Oscar. It is a Marathi film, nor can I distinguish the apple from the orange in marathi. But when I saw the movie playing on DD1 late Sunday night, I was pasted. Now I'm not a judge of film techniques and acting skills. But I've seen a good number of films, of various genres, and for an average audience, I will highly recommend this film. The feeling is very earthy and realistic, even if there are some melodramatic moments. Watch it to feel human. I haven't seen any films lately, touching your heart, especially in Hindi cinema. the culmination of the film is when the boy returns home. The camera moves to reveal the child, wears dark glasses, has lost eyes, the child hears the other children splashing around in the water and starts clapping. I was amazed. And the two hours spent watching the movie - it's really worth it :-)
