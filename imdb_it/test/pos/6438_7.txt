Like many, I first saw The Water Babies as a child / young teenager in the late seventies and early eighties. He has stayed with me ever since with his catchy melodies, his memorable portraits, his less successful animations and a story full of heart, coldness and, ultimately, a good defeat of evil. I recently sat down and saw him again after at least two decades, and this time I noticed his amazing similarities to the Wizard of Oz. No, these are not shameless features, but listen to me. In this we have a boy and his dog - who have personal problems "at home", running away from something and in the scene immediately after the escape, changing the substance of their appearance. In this, the boy and the dog come alive. In The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy and Toto are in color. In this, the boy and the dog are told that they must find the Water Babies for the answers and finally the Krackens as guides and he has the ability to allow Tom to go home if he shows courage, etc. Wizard of Oz, Dorothy must also find an authoritative figure who tests her before she allows her to go home. In the Water Babies, Tom meets three characters who will help him on his journey to the Water Babies - Dorothy also has three helpers. When each helper is met, we are entertained with a rendering of "Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello Cockallorum ... We are on the right track." In the Wizard is "We are out to see the magician". Dorothy has a good witch who takes care of her; Tom has a woman with many roles (Billie Whitelaw) does the same. If you look closely at the two, there are many other similarities. That being said, The Water Babies is not a knockoff in any way, I was just commenting on the disturbing loves between the two. This film has some solid performances as bad guys Bernard Cribbins and the ever-charming James Mason. The children who play Tom and Ella are good. The supporting cast of Joan Greenwood (loves his voice!), David Tomlinson, and the vocal talent of John Pertwee and Lance Percival add much to the mix. I must confess that animation is less than sterling even for its time, but it is quite adequate to the challenge. The three animated characters that help Tom get home are all nice. I always have difficulty choosing my favorite between the French swordfish and John Inman / Mr. Humphries as a seahorse. The scene in which we hear this guttural and maniacal laugh from a ship wrecked just to see a seahorse with a huge polka-dot bow tie, always makes me roll! The Water Babies is a lot of fun. Of course, it's more a children's film, but it has always had a place in my heart. Most of the credit for what the film was successful has to go to director Lionel Jeffries. Jeffries is a wonderful comedian and his sense of humor is clearly evident in everything.
