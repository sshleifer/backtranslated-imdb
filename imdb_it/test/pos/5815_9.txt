Although it may not be the best work of Cassavetes, Minnie and Moskowitz are almost perfect in all her efforts. The plot is extravagant and fascinating, and surprisingly dramatic with an impressive range of emotions - much more dramatic than comedy, contrary to IMDb's profile. Yes, the story is fanciful, but not arbitrary; It happens as credible, even if a little forced - to which I will return. All the artistic aspects are of the true form of Cassavetes: the cinematography and the work with the camera are delights and the soundtrack, even if barely present, is free. Also, I think I noticed a few hints about Godard and the like in editing - as I did in some of Cassavetes' other films - (that is, the sharp cutting of a song in a scene), which are interesting. <br /> <br /> I feel that the plot is well built, with the first half particularly pleasant. Seymour's conversation with Morgan Morgan (Timothy Carey) in the restaurant, for example, is wonderfully fun and fascinating, and sets the tone for the philosophical commentary made during the film. This philosophy - a tradition in Cassavetes' films - is what made the film for me. Seymour's amusing and profound monologues instantly eliminate the first impressions that can be had of him as a simple hippie, even if his character is curiously similar to that of his in Faces (1968). This gave me the feeling, however (secondly) of supporting Cassavetes' best works. I acquired an affection for this film that I missed in the first vision. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are several aspects that make this film imperfect. I find the plot unbalanced. As I said before, it piles up well, but fades a little here and there, especially towards the end. Because of the spontaneous style in which Cassavetes worked, and in particular the freedom with which he allowed his actors to improvise, the quality of his product can easily go either way. In this case it is inconsistent. I estimate that most of this film was improvised, and most of it is beautifully. But one or two scenes, unfortunately, don't work. In particular, the scene after Seymour fights with Minnie's co-worker outside her home. During what should be the most intense scene in the film, Cassavetes allowed his actors to run free with dialogue - presuming that some had been planned in advance. This, I believe, was a mistake. One has the impression that Cassel does not really know what to do, given that he has repeatedly tampered with his speech, often meaningless and overacts; all this damages the scene and the development of the character. I understand that Seymour is destined to be a little brash, but Cassel's attempts here have been misapplied. Why did he cut his mustache? These defects derive from: a lack of direction on the Cassavetes side; a lack of understanding and foresight on the part of Cassel; a lack of evidence and preparation; etc. Evidently, Cassavetes did not learn from his mistakes, as he allowed the same thing to happen in his next film, A Woman Under the Influence (1974) - the scene of the commit, and the end. <br /> <br /> The defects I mentioned are not minor, but they do not ruin the film. Simply make some scenes worthy and unrealistic, ruining the flow of the film and compromising its potential. However, I am very, very fond of Cassavetes and all his actors, particularly Cassel, despite the flaws I mentioned. This is a very funny film, even if it shows the precariousness of Cassavetes style.
