This was a very strong vision of group prejudice and mentality. The cast is made up of excellent actors who do extraordinary work. The sets are beautiful and just a little stylized. The art direction is top notch together with the great cinematography. The story is tense and shows how prejudice and fanaticism can easily prosper. It is disturbing because of its realistic violence and protrusion of a fairly typical community. I was very impressed.
