i love this movie !! perhaps it is my generation, but I can really connect with what it is talking about and what it intends to do. it made me laugh for the duration. duration of the film, the next day, and beyond. I think this movie is not to be watched if you are mainly interested in the plot and character development. this film is practically only for the generation that will understand it. there are many things you know to be brought up in that generation that you wouldn't do if you were 40. I think Sacha Cohen sterile was a lot and I meant very well. he is a genius. and the reason he is so idiotic is because he can make people believe he is a complete idiot, and make it fun at the same time !! <br /> <br /> Great movie. strongly recommended!!!! (not so strong if you are over 30)
