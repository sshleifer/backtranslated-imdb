Pulling on 2.6 million viewers, one must ask what everyone's opinions are about the plot / plot. <br /> <br /> Reading the chronicle ended all my life, I was led to believe that this would be a thriller advantage in your place where a single mother is persecuted and finally confronts the stalker. Unfortunately I was wrong. While the main plot is quite interesting - A single mother runs off the road one night, then she is followed by the same boy, the reasoning behind stalking left nothing but a bad taste in her mouth. <br /> <br /> Laura Leighton plays the victim, and she does it well. Whether it was for all those years in Melrose Place or not, she does well in this film, playing a mother who would do anything to protect her child from harm, and at this time she is doing very well. <br /> <br /> Leighton is really the only good thing about this movie. I think a lot of people will identify with the main character, after discovering why the stalker is stalking, it will be a kind of movie only for viewing.
