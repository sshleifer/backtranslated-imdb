Film historians have talked a lot about the ancient epic that has been the interest of many directors since the beginning of cinema. The pioneers of these epics, especially the biblical ones, were D.W Griffith with his "mother of all epics" INTOLERANCE (1916), and Cecil B DeMille with his talent for magnificent performances, costumes and sumptuous scenes. Who can forget his TEN COMMANDMENTS (1923, 1956) or IL SEGNO DELLA CROCE (1932)? However, here comes another epic, created in the 1950s, directed by Michael Curtiz and based on the novel by Mika Waltari, "The Egyptian". Michael Curtiz, already famous for his great classic CASABLANCA (1941), is wonderfully able to adapt his film to the public of that time, to involve the most important ideas and facts of the dense novel and to recreate the lifestyle of the Egyptians who lived in one of the most surprising periods, in the kingdom of Akhnaton. <br /> <br /> The first and most important fact for me in this film is the psychological development of the main character played by Edmund Purdom. Sinuhe, having grown up in a simple family by his step parents, becomes a doctor. All his life, he never stops asking a question "why?" and looking for the answer. The seductive love he finds in a courtesan Nefer (Bella Darvi) leads him to financial and spiritual disaster. He must repair the mistakes with the hard work in the House of Death and start building his reputation out of nothing. First, think that the only cure is revenge. However, in the long term, he realizes that "an eye for an eye" is not a solution. Finally, what is facing him in very strange circumstances is the temptation to be a pharaoh. However, there is a moment when he finds the answer to his questions that touched him throughout his life ... The story of the main character, although based on the book, is so interesting psychologically that every open minded person should consider this aspect in the film. The psychological struggle of the main character has been intensified since the times in which he lived, the times when, probably for the first time up to that point, the power of the sword collided with the power of thought. <br /> <br /> Curtiz's film also preserves a rule to which all the films of his era are held: great casts and sumptuous sets. There are above all British actors and actresses who give very beautiful shows. How is it possible not to mention the cornerstone of ancient epic, Victor Mature. This time, it's not Demetrio, Hannibal or Samson but Horemheb - a fighter, a lover, finally a pharaoh. Jean Simmons appears in a very delicate role of Merit, a woman who loved Sinuhe all her life but it was too late when she realized it. Peter Ustinov, probably more famous for his splendid interpretation of Black in QUO VADIS? three years ago, he did a great job as Kaptah, a friend of Sinuhe. The royalty of the film is also played by two great casts, Gene Tierney and Michael Wilding. Tierney is excellent as a cold, eager to power Baketamon, the pharaoh's sister. Wilding gives a wonderful performance as "crazy" Akhnaton. When I was in the Louvre in Paris and saw the original face of Akhnaton carved in stone, it looked very similar to the actor in the film. Bella Darvi, an actress born in Poland, is quite memorable as a mischievous courtesan Nefer. And there is another actress who appears only in one scene but is difficult to forget, Judith Evelyn in the role of Taia, the pharaoh's mother. This voice, these eyes! <br /> <br /> The sets are magnificent. The director recreated the most probable image of the outdoor temple of Aaton, the god that the Egyptians worshiped during the reign of Amenhotep IV. I also loved the scene of Pharaoh's first entrance. What a glorious image that lasts forever in memory !!! However, there is also an aspect that I would like to attract the attention of all the people interested in seeing the film. The Egyptian is similar to other epics in many respects, but also stands out as a unique film. There are very few films that make such wonderful use of different curiosities as in ancient times. There is a mention of the iron used before by the Hetites. It is also the only film about ancient Egypt that speaks openly about the magnificent healing powers of the Egyptians. It shows in a memorable way the contrasts of lifestyles, in particular the moment of death of a slave for whom nobody cares to follow the announcement and consequently the widespread mourning after the death of the pharaoh. Finally, "The Egyptian" shows an historical fact: there were other nations except the Jews (before Christ) where the spirit of God shone in some human hearts. Yet the only difference was that he did not survive as long as the Jews because he had no solid base. The scene of Akhnaton's death provides you with so many biblical and Christian values ​​that you might think to watch a religious film. <br /> <br /> All in all, I highly recommend the Michael Curtiz film. It's a great multi-level production: entertainment for epic fans, an admiration of wonderful performances for movie fans, a feast of the soul for spiritual people. Finally, it is a beautiful story of extraordinary things that happened thirteen centuries before the birth of Jesus Christ.
