This was a great movie for just 67 minutes. There was one aspect of the film noir contained in this film and I'm glad that Nolan chose to film it in black and white. The plot is simple but fun that keeps you busy. Dialogue was also good along with acting. It reminded me of what would come to Memento not being in chronological order. I liked the way the main character tried to use what Cobb taught him, for example by saying "everyone has a box" in which he put his personal stuff. Also, on the writer's door was the Batman logo that seemed ironic because Christopher Nolan would later direct Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, two other great films. There is a big breakthrough in the end that I'm not going to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it, even though I imagined what would happen when Cobb gave the young man the D Lloyds credit card. I also liked how the writer had a copy of Plato's The Republic, one of my favorite philosophical books. This is definitely a movie that you need to watch more than once to get the whole look of it, as well as being just an hour. There is also a circular aspect that ends where it started, which I thought was pretty bright.
