Charlie Wilson's war is an excellent example of how films should be made. This film is of the highest quality and is perfectly inserted. Tom Hanks is the protagonist and offers exceptional performance. Furthermore, Tom Hanks complimented the unparalleled acting ability of the incredible Philip Seymour Hoffman. I've never seen him in a role that fits him so perfectly. <br /> <br /> The film is witty, intelligent and well written. Julia Roberts is also the protagonist of this film but she is easily overwhelmed by the other two protagonists. <br /> <br /> I voted for this movie 10/10 and I am happy to recommend this film to anyone interested in quality cinema.
