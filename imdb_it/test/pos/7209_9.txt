It is the story of three brothers who unite in the midst of difficulties and losses and learn that the really important things in life are family, love, trust and forgiveness. The entire cast manages to get a powerful performance despite some horrible one-liners. A great movie for fans of real life problems that happen to credible families. It's also worth taking a look at Dermot Mulroney's or Sean Astin's fans. Both do a stunning job, often bringing you to tears. Believe me and rent this today!
