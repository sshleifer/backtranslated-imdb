Much said without words. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent film. It was made in color, not in color like in today's films, but in a special monochromatic use (with nuances) that represented meaning, mood, meaning and time. It should be seen in color, as it becomes a completely different film. The story, by Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerl√∂f, is presented effectively. There is never a clear sense of reality, memory or ghost. The changes taking place in Swedish society at the time are subtly stratified. Highly recommended. Try to rent it or find it online. I saw it in a Swedish film class and I want to add it to my film library.
