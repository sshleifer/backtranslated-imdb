It was a rare pleasure to see "Checking Out". I was touched by the characters, I laughed a lot for the wonderful script and was deeply touched by the genuine emotions beautifully represented by this ensemble cast and especially by Peter Falk. In fact, one of his scenes in the kitchen of his apartment with his children, where he recounts his experience of his life, his deep love for his wife and his decisions about his life ahead is so deeply real that he is at most high level of the best Academy Award winning performances. He is a consummate actor who has performed in this film. The writer offers a combination of literary knowledge, timing, a gift for dialogue and hilarious situations that made me laugh out loud in the theater. I highly recommend "Check Out" to anyone who wants to enjoy superb quality storytelling.
