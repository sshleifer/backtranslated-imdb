I saw part of this film on the Sci-Fi channel, but I lost the finale. I bought the DVD to watch the whole movie, and I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> A young mother and her two daughters move into a home in a backwoods area that they inherited from their husband, who died from an illness. He is very shabby, but the three women do their best. The teenage daughter (Scout Taylor-Compton) is warned by a local boy about the zombies coming out at night. She ignores him, but since she has a nice friend, she joins her group. Meanwhile, the younger daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz) befriends a zombie girl of her age named Mary. It turns out that Mary and many other children died in a mine in 1913 while working as child labor. Now that they are zombies, they attack and kill anyone who is not a relative of blood. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by J.S. Cardone, whose previous films include The Slayer (1981) and Shadowzone (1990), two films that I didn't like at all. This is why I was surprised that I really liked this movie. The film is deliberately traveled, which I liked. This allows you to get to know the main characters, many of whom are nice. Children's zombies have been used at least since George Romero's 1968 classic, Night Of The Living Dead. However, I found the tool that used children's zombies in this interesting film. It would seem that Cardone has finally found the right script and cast. Only the stereotypical scenes of teenagers smoking, drinking and digging in a parked car were boring me. <br /> <br /> Even Taylor-Compton appears in the Halloween remake. Moretz has appeared in The Amityville Horror (2005) and in the horror film Room 6 (2006).
