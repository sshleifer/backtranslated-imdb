In print this is one of the greatest stories ever written, brought brilliantly and poetically to the screen by this father-son team, who works together, sadly, for the first and last time. It is right that John Huston ends his career on an important note by bringing to the screen the work of one of his favorite authors, in what is easily the best adaptation of the Joyce screen. Huston has made a career of adapting great literary works to the cinema, usually quite successfully. It's sad, and somewhat disconcerting, that Tony Huston practically started and ended his career in film by adapting what would be his father's final project and collecting a deserved Oscar nomination in the process. <br /> <br /> I once had the privilege of sitting in the company of the great writer / playwright Horton Foote, who has cited this film as one of his favorites in recent years (at the time it was still a fairly recent version) . Being a rather prolific screenwriter (and a brilliant screen adapter for his works, as well as great authors like Faulkner, Steinbeck and Harper Lee) he was obviously struck by Tony Huston's first effort, and perhaps equally shocked by his lack of production since. If anyone has ideas to share on the subject I would be interested in learning more.
