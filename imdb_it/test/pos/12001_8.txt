or any story that remembers the Leopold and Loeb case, you might find this movie funny. The cast includes Robert Culp, with Stephen Caffrey and Garrison Hershberger as college students. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is his usual self, pretending to be deceived by early students. Caffrey ("Longtime Companion", "Buried Alive") is excellent, and should do more of these menacing roles. Basically the two companions of the brotherhood get tired of their demanding parents, who expect nothing less than academic perfection, attendance at the best schools will be financed only if they comply. There is an excellent scene in which Culp picks up Caffrey on the coals after he gets a low grade, threatens to cut his trusts and Caffrey later tells his friend: "I hate him, I want him dead" ... /> <br /> Everything is not good in Beverly Hills. This is always an excellent topic. I believe this film came out in 1990 right after the Menendez murders. If you look at "Menedez, Killing in Beverly Hills" and then compare it to this film, you might find some interesting parallels.
