NOTICE SPOILER! Don't read unless you're prepared for some spoilers. <br /> <br /> I think this film had a lot under its shell. In addition to the apparent connections with "Oldboy" (and the other Park-wook films), an incestuous relationship in this disturbed me a lot, and also the subtle erotic theme that weighed on all the vampiric and physical actions. <br /> <br /> The main actor, Kang-ho Song, is terrifying in the role of priest Sang-hyeon - coincidentally, "sung" means "blood" in some languages ​​- who truly loved Tae-ju, played from OK-bin Kim. Their relationship reminds me a lot of the one between Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek in "Badlands", where the girl appears psychopathic and the man is basically wrapped around her finger. <br /> <br /> Their relationship is one thing, but the girl's mother is completely different. While it moves, it is rigid, one-dimensional and tense, but paralyzed, it says everything without moving, or with a wink. <br /> <br /> Park-wook has really, really dominated his cinematography in this film, and owes a lot to Stanley Kubrick; there are lots of beautiful shots scattered throughout the movie, some for simple effects and some that require different looks and probably repeated views to capture completely. <br /> <br /> The music is quite orderly, using mainly strings to accompany the main thespian monoreaction; it is a very good thing that the character is withdrawn as it is. While he does very little and loses, he seems to be a person who thinks a lot. Although his love interest says and does a lot, his actions show very little behind it. In my humble opinion. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very disturbing film that is not made for action, which is not even in the same size as most vampire things these days; it is magnificent and repellent at the same time.
