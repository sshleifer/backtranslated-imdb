I can't believe people give bad reviews to this movie! I wonder why ...... maybe because of the book ..... I have to admit, actually it doesn't follow the book ... for sure ... the book by Dean Koontz is much better .. but also the film it's good !!! has the suspense ... the acting is good ... especially michael ironside, who gave a superb acting in this movie !!! <br /> <br /> Come a guy ... give this movie a chance. ... there are still many more films worse than this .... like the sum of all the fears ... the ghosts ... the da vinci code ... this is the worst movie I've seen ... really boring if compared to the observers who really have great elements in the film ... this film contains great suspense and relentless action !!! I'm looking for this movie ... but it's really hard to find it on DVD ... <br /> <br /> by da way ... I've really recommended this movie to everyone ... watch it! !!! you will never regret it !!! <br /> <br /> 10/10 *
