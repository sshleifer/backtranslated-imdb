The Kinks warned about media heroes. Outside of movies, most heroes are also "common people". Society requires some role-playing games, but what happens when it extends to the parent-child relationship? Do some parents try to improve themselves through their children rather than vice versa? How do you provide a role model but not a role? A brilliant swimmer who hates swimming; a brilliant musician who will not play. Offbeat, fun (despite the representation of "serious" problems), an excellent multidimensional acting by everyone. A lot of twists complete the emotional tension. Celluloid heroes never feel pain. I don't remember ever being disappointed in a Sigourney Weaver movie (I also liked "The Village"!).
