I thought this movie was pretty good! OK, so maybe there were some scenes that could make people think of other horror movies, but I saw much more pathetic movies that got much higher scores than this! Many movies nowadays are redone to a more modern version and there is nothing wrong with that, it keeps the story alive. I don't think this movie was pathetic and I'm not saying it just because I'm a big fan of Chad Michael Murray, but because I liked it. I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie and my friends and I really enjoyed it and we were talking about it all the way home! I would like to tell my other friends to watch this movie. I'm not saying it's the best movie that ever hit the box office, but it's much better than anyone is describing it. Everyone has their own opinions so if you really want to know if it's good or bad, look at it and then decide.
