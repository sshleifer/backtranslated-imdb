THE OXESS, also known as THE TORMENTED or THE SEXORCIST, or the ridiculous title THE EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW, is a forgotten EXORCIST scam that contains one of the best horror moments I've ever seen. The scene is when the crucifix comes to life. This fantastic spectral scene is unforgettable and totally effective (great special effects). It is a pity that the rest of the film does not maintain the creepy level exemplified during that scene. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most frustrating movies ever. Imagine that the producers decide to make a copy of EXORCIST but, while they are doing it, they actually manage to create something truly original (a sculpture owned by a crucified man, which is shocking when you think about it) but then completely forget their original idea to do a boring and carefree EXORCIST cheat. If the film continued with the concept of sculpture possessed (with the characters trying to destroy it, etc.), this film would have shaken. But once the girl becomes possessed by the spirit of sculpture, she never tells anyone where the devil comes from. She and the script completely forget the haunted crucifix, which is STUPID !!! <br /> <br /> If you like the so-called "Euro-cult" films, the first 45 minutes deliver differently from any other Euro-cult film. But after the scene where the girl has the vision of being crucified and she gets the stigmata, the remaining 45 minutes SUCK. Boring. He doesn't go anywhere while trying to emulate (badly) THE EXORCIST. So, watch the first 45 minutes of L'OSSESSA and enjoy the fashions of the 70s, the sleaze and the astonishing scene of statues-is-from-alive-for-enchantress-child, but after the first 45 minutes, press stop and expel, and you could and go and cut the toenails.
