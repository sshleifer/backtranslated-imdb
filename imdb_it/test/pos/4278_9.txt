I have to admit that I have a weakness for humor and the narrative style of British films, although not everyone has obviously succeeded. <br /> <br /> This film made me think, and eventually left me with a quiet smile on my face. It's about character development and relationships, truth and lies, and if love sometimes just isn't enough. Some very nice acting of all the participants, in particular the two protagonists, Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of stories about Gosford Park, but with this piece I feel that Fellowes actually produced a better film, even though it wasn't a mainstream version. <br /> <br /> A mature and intelligent story about real people who are undeniably imperfect, but also capable of acts of genuine benevolence.
