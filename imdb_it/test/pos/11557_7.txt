Sometimes I really wonder ?? when I look at the comments here it seems that most people have seen a completely different film than I have. I just saw it ... and I liked it. Not in the way, which made me happy, but in the way of having seen a good movie! <br /> <br /> The film needs a little patience, yes. And yes, the main character is REALLY annoying, but I'm sure it's intentionally. <br /> <br /> Maybe it really makes a difference if you watch this movie at the cinema or at home. Most people watch movies at home as if listening to elevator music. This film certainly does not fit as background noise. <br /> <br /> And no. Good direction does not mean having five laughs or explosions per second. Good direction means following your subject and keeping the story and the actors together. And even if it doesn't work perfectly, at least I think it works quite well. <br /> <br /> I liked the photography and the sets, although sometimes surreal on the surreal. The opening scene is really special. <br /> <br /> Did I also like acting? Guillaume Depardieu is NOT playing Pierre. He is playing the role of a Pierre who plays himself in a role! Pierre is not the romantic hero who tries so hard to be, he is a presumptuous and hypocritical idiot, a real weak person, who tears and damages all the people he claims to protect. That even his love for the truth is simply a pose is wonderfully demonstrated by his ongoing mentality and not even once by asking questions or explaining himself. <br /> <br /> People are wondering where this or that person comes from and other things: No the character that is seen for more than two scenes is left unexplained, there is enough information scattered throughout the film about all . <br /> <br /> And even the strange building begins to make sense as soon as the target is seen: Remember that Isabelle escaped from a war zone - and of course this is a refuge for combatants in a civil war, most probably Bosnia (which was still happening when the film was produced). At least this is what is suggested by the story Isabelle tells Pierre when he first meets him and in the next scene where Pierre shows Isabelle the book with his father on the cover, which is surrounded by books on Bosnia.
