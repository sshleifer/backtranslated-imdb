There is a version of "Nevsky" which is shown with a live symphony orchestra, choir, soloist and the film. If you ALWAYS run within a day of travel, see "Nevsky" done this way. The Oklahoma City Philharmonic did it with the OKC Canterbury Choir (one of the best ever) a couple of years ago. I think I cried for the whole thing, it was one of the most exciting cinematic experiences of my life. I'm listening to "Nevsky" on the radio right now and it still sucks. There are films that I love, and classical music tracks that I love, but there is no combination that I can think of approaching the "Nevsky" impact performed in real time.
