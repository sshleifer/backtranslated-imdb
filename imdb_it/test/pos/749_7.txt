I found the film Do not Look In The Basement very good, with some fantastic characters. This is a young psychiatric nurse called Nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik), who will start working in an isolated mental hospital. While there, he meets various types of different characters including the Dr. Geraldine Masters who becomes the head of the asylum after the hospital owner Dr. Stephens is killed by one of the patients hitting him with an ax. <br /> <br /> My favorite characters in the film are Mrs Challingham (Reah MacAdams), a very funny little old woman, Allison who is a nymphomaniac, and Sam (Bill McGhee), a young black guy who goes around the day and seems to be in a world of its own all the time. The film was a very low budget film but it was still a truly exceptional film. I know he was on the 'Nasties of videos' list in the 1980s, but I didn't think he had much blood, Alothough had disturbing senses in it. GREAT CINEMA RECOMMENDED !!!.
