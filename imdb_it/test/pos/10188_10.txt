I'm not a Disney fan at all, but I happen to be in Orlando for a friend's wedding. So my travel companion and I went to Disney for a few days. I didn't see a good 3-D effect in, well..ever. So I usually try to stay away from these presentations. The 3D effect in this was so good. I am a 38 year old adult man, and I also wanted to try to reach and touch. It's so beautiful! Word of advice. Finally, look at the back of the theater on the wall. Put it this way ... the first time I saw it, the effect didn't work. So I told my friend ... "It would have been nice if ..." My friend said "That's exactly what happens, it doesn't work for some reason". It's a fantastic show. You will not be disappointed !!!
