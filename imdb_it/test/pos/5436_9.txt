This film is a great comic drama. Christopher Walken is huge in his supporting role as a manager, and his comment will make you laugh. Robin Williams plays an important role as a fast-paced "Jon Stewart" spirit and will entertain you if you are a Comedy Central fan. The show is good, because if the viewer has a half brain, they will see it as a very necessary sub-cultural attack on the policies of the current Republican government and a criticism of the American democratic process ..., not to mention the means by which the most politicians are elected. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the sub-plot and I found the film very fast and fun, without any of the usual "oh-brother" that I would like to agree the film is less comedy than commercialized, however, without doubt better than 90% of garbage in theaters at the moment. Just my thoughts ... Don
