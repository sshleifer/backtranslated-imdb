haggard does not even need to be classified, since it was never designed to be classified as an Oscar winning film and was never intended to have won an Oscar (obviously). if you only look at some of the things that Bam and Bran have tried, such as fast-moving shots, this is a film that is more than just a cky or a jackass (even if those are fantastic). For pure enjoyment, I definitely confer this film to 10; almost every scene made me laugh until my parts hurt, like the falcon film. If you haven't seen it, look at it and then buy it. Personally my favorite character is brandon (falcon), it's so smooth, natural and casual that it's exhilarating, it has a fantastic freestyle (with action figures) and composes the funniest things - lol a diamond mountain bike? haggard is definitely a film that in general humor is only rivaled by anchorman and napoleon dynamite.
