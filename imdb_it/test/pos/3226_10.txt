This show is my absolute favorite. This show is intelligent, fun and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is as perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines like the beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is one of a kind like Rory's best friend, Lane Kim. I love witty dialogue, that's what makes it unique on the show. Kelly Bishop is as evil as Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman is as formidable as Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is a joy like Luke Danes and the band members are one of a kind to watch. The Community, Miss Patty, Babette, Mrs. Kim, Taylor Doose, Kirk and others are always laughing out loud, funny, extravagant and interesting that always makes the snappy jokes stand out. This show has changed so much over the years that it will never grow old. Gilmore Girls is an original and intelligent show that keeps you looking. It's so beautiful. I give this show a 10/10 rating.
