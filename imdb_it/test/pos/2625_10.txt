I was a 20-year-old college student who lived with people when I first saw him, and I never forgot him. I'm a big fan of Joan Hackett, and this movie was perfect for his remarkable talent. I'm so happy to see that so many other people have such a fond memory of seeing it. Of course, it is not available on any media! It would be perfect to show in life, but because of his age, they won't. You never see anything before the mid-eighties. I can still remember what he showed me when it was first published: Rex Reed reviewed it in the New York Daily News, and said it was like a return to the great Hollywood movies of the 1940s, and that it was made then , the parts of Hackett and Grimes would have been played by Stanwyck and Crawford. Think about it! Post scriptum So sad that Joan Hackett left us so tragically young.
