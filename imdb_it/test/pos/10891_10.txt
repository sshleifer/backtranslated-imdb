GoldenEye 007 is not only the best tie-in of all time, but it is perhaps the most influential first-person shooter that has ever hit the gaming console market. If you are not aware of the plot of this game it is not a problem, because essential is the same as the popular James Bond movie, GoldenEye, which was released in 1995, two years before the release of this game. <br /> <br /> This is a game that is full of techniques and styles that could be imitated in many future future games, and offers the player a wide variety of difficult goals and challenges. The A.I. it's smart (especially in higher difficulty settings) and the environments are complex enough to offer entertainment and difficulty for any player. <br /> <br /> Introducing logical hit points on your enemies is a great feature. Even the bosses in this game can be shot down with a well-aimed blow to the head. It's this kind of realism that really makes you feel like your James Bond and you can sneak in, sneak out, secretly pick up the henchmen while you go, or trigger alarms and have to go through massive shootings. For this reason there are many ways to defeat the game and unlimited possibilities for the way you perform your tasks. AKA: You can take easy paths or hard ways to beat the levels ... and if you don't have a strategic guide you have to find out those paths alone (which, I might add, is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day away). <br /> <br /> This is one of those games that the more you play the more you can enhance your contributions in the gaming industry. Whenever I play, I notice aspects that have been replicated in many of the following FPS games. So if you have a Nintendo 64 go ahead and dust it off and order a used copy of GoldenEye 007, because believe me, as a Bond fan and a casual player I can say that this game is highly recommended for everyone who wants to take a leap into James' shoes Bond, or simply have an intense and fantastic gaming experience. <br /> <br /> (Also make sure to watch out for his sister game, Perfect Dark, which is also on the N64, following the same controls and uses of very similar weapons).
