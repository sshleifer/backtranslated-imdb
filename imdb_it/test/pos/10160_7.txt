Apparently a story about Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day's baby. The child is kidnapped to keep his parents quiet. They know something about a plot to assassinate the ambassador of a nameless country during a performance at London's Albert Hall. <br /> <br /> The film is full of episodes of Hitchcock. A friendly but opaque French seems to tease the innocent Stewart - an Indiana doctor - a little too intensely to be just lazily curious. Later the French appears under an Arab disguise, with a knife behind him, and whispers some information about the plot of the murder to Stewart. Stewart tells his wife - Doris Day seems really impertinent - but refuses to cooperate with the police and risk his son's life. <br /> <br /> Instead the couple tries to track down the killers, buy them away, and bring back their son, taking them from Morocco, where Hitchcock gave us his usual view of the tourist about habits, places and food , in London. There is a hilarious wild goose hunt involving a set between Stewart and a taxidermy shop staff. The staff is more concerned with protecting their semi-filled specimens than anything else, and they move in a protective manner holding the carcasses of a leopard and a swordfish. During the scuffle, Stewart manages to save his throat from being cut by the swordfish's beak, but is bitten by the hand of a stuffed tiger, the action enhanced by Bernard Hermann's plump score. The scene ends with Stewart running out the door. Hitchcock ends with a lion's head that opens the slammed door. There is also a well-done gag on some visitors waiting around the couple's hotel room in London, waiting for explanations. <br /> <br /> There are two serious problems that are slightly touched. One is the relationship between Stewart and Day, which is not as rosy as it should be, considered as a bourgeois ideal. She has been a star of the musical for some years and is known internationally. And she gave everything to marry a normal guy who seems to be a doc. It is understandable, for example, a nurse or a flight attendant or almost a woman other than an international star with a promising full career. It is not detailed, but the edge is obvious, as it was not in the original version. It reminds me a bit of an exchange between Joe Dimaggio and his then wife Marilyn Monroe, who had just returned from entertaining troops in Korea. "Oh, Joe," she said, "have you ever seen ten thousand people stand up and cheer up?" "Seventy thousand," muttered Joe, a former hero of the New York Yankees. <br /> <br /> The second problem is loyalty. Who has greater social value? Your own little son? Or an unknown ambassador. Do we put ourselves or our loved ones at risk for the sake of national stability? Day faces this dilemma in its crudest form in the Albert Hall. His solution opts for fidelity to political stability, although his reasons are problematic. Do you scream to save the ambassador's life, or do you do it only to release the anxiety that is overwhelming you? (See: Alec Guiness falling on the detonator at the end of "The Bridge on the River Kwai.") The photograph is extremely good and the settings can be threatening, even in a quiet street in a residential neighborhood of London. It's noon, and Stewart is alone and determined, but also scared. There are steps that echo on Gulliver Street from someone, somewhere. Is it followed? Is his life in danger? And where the hell are all those who live on this road? Hitchcock pays so much attention to the details of the position we can distinguish from the bond of the garden wall with the bricks next to him. <br /> <br /> The director had a rare disagreement with Francois Truffaut as he was interviewed for Truffaut's otherwise laudatory book. Truffaut claimed that the previous version of "The man who knew too much" lacked the depth of the later version. Hitchcock replied: "It seems to me that you want me to make films for the art house audience", but in the end I agreed that the thirties version was the work of a talented amateur and this version was the work of a professional . No discussion there. <br /> <br /> This is Hitchcock practically near its zenith.
