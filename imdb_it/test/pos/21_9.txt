"The Dresser" is a small but absolutely wonderful film, brilliantly played by Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay. As in the world this little film has attracted enough attention to get five nominations for the best Academy Awards in 1983 is a mystery to me, but it's nice to know that the Academy can be guilty of a tasteful demonstration every now and then (of course, they assigned the award that year to "Terms of Endearment" - after all, they don't want to be accused of showing TOO much taste. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney is a drunk Shakespearean actor in a production of "King Lear"; "Tom Courtenay is the man who works full time behind the scenes to keep this actor in front of the limelight. He is both exhilarating and pitiful to see the character of Courtenay take a shower to Finney with care and affection, just to see his utterly unrequited and dismissed efforts, even to the end. Finney and Courtenay work together wonders, and even though Finney gets the best moments (Shakespeare recites after all), Courtenay is the heart and soul of the film. <br /> <br/> Vote: A
