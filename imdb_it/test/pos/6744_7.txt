In this Columbia noir thriller that is a combination of Panic In The Streets and The Naked City, Evelyn Keyes is unknowingly The Killer That Stalked New York. Evelyn, who brought some stolen jewels from Cuba into the country, also smuggled smallpox. She is mistakenly diagnosed by Dr. William Bishop and when they find out what the hunt is for her. <br /> <br /> For most of the film the Treasury Department is also on the hunt for Keyes, but for smuggling jewels. It is only at the end of the film that the health department and law enforcement agencies realize that they are looking for the same woman. Evelyn is on a mission too. Her husband Charles Korvin left her flat, the most rude of all is that he was kidding with his sister while he was in Cuba to pick up the gems and contract smallpox. When Lola Albright, while her sister commits suicide for the whole thing, Evelyn is on a mission, gets Korvin or dies trying. And it's not a useless threat given the situation. <br /> <br /> The film was mainly shot in New York as The Naked City and its cast is freely littered with many names and familiar faces. Keep an eye out for Connie Gilchrist's good performances as Evelyn's indifferent hostess, Jim Backus as an unlucky club owner and Art Smith as Korvin's fence. <br /> <br /> A true sleeper in the noir category, not to be missed if broadcast.
