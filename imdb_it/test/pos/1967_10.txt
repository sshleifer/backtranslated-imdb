This is actually the first movie I've ever seen in a theater, where people didn't leave immediately when the credits ended. Instead they sat for a few minutes, gaping at the infinite, trying to understand what they had just seen. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can say: try to go see this movie with the least knowledge about it possible (so I did!). I gave a 10
