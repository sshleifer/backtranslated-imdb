A true South American soap opera in which Spencer Tracy faces the role of an illiterate until the age of 20. He marries the woman who teaches him and his ambition and his guide lead him to success. <br /> <br /> Success but no happiness here. The son of a nerd and a faltering marriage lead to disasters and tragedies. Tracy buys a railway and only manages to suffer a disastrous train accident and the death of 406 workers. <br /> <br /> The film initially appeared irregular but rejuvenated thanks to the excellent use of flashbacks here. <br /> <br /> A double suicide separated here. We know that riches cannot buy happiness, but this is a bit exaggerated. However, we have exciting performances by Tracy and Colleen Moore. Ms. Vinson, as a second wife, is also quite effective.
