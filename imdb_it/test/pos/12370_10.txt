This, unfortunately, is a little-known film ..... I say "unfortunately", because it is placed there with the "classics" of the mute American screen! <br /> <br /> It is a legend of a "ghost wagon" that travels around the world, gathering the souls of those who have died. The legend says that the last person who dies on New Year is condemned to drive the wagon for next year. <br /> <br /> Remember the "Ghost of the future that is yet to come" sequence in Dicken's famous "Christmas Carol". <br /> <br /> Double-exposure effects of ghosts (especially when they interact with "living" people) are EXCELLENT! <br /> <br /> If you love silent movies, you MUST SEE THIS; it will blow you up! <br /> Norm Vogel <br /> <br /> Norm's Old Movie Heaven http://www.nvogel.com/film/film.html
