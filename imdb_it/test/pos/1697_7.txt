Andy McDermott (Tom Everett Scott) is a shy American teenager who spends his holidays in Paris with his friends Brad and Chris. Andy saves Serafine Pigot (the beautiful Julie Delpy) from suicide at the Eiffel Tour and has a crush on her. He doesn't know that she is a werewolf. They go to an underground party and are attacked by werewolves. Andy is injured and becomes a werewolf. It is advised that the only way to return to normal is to kill the werewolf that attacked him and eat his heart. This film is a violent film of black humor. The special effects and the soundtrack are excellent, highlighting the song by the band Bush. I don't know why some readers compare this film to the masterpiece 'An American Werewolf in London'. The stories have nothing in common (just an American teenager, werewolves and a city in Europe). Highly suitable for fans of werewolf films and black humor. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Lobisomem Americano em Paris" ("An American Werewolf in Paris")
