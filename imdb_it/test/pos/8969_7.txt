Charlie Wilson's War, based on a true story, tells the story of a member of the Congress of Texas and a CIA agent who works to get funding for the secret support of the Mujaheddin in 80s Afghanistan after the invasion of the Soviet Union in the country. This conflict played an important role in the last years of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> In terms of film production, Charlie Wilson's War is a definite winner. It is well written, well acted and well filmed. While most of the attention went to Tom Hanks for yet another great performance, I was even more impressed by the turn of Philip Seymour Hoffman as Gust Avrakotos of the CIA. The scenes of Soviet attacks on villages under arms and the refugee camp are effective in pulling the heart. The film also offers a good background on the routes and exchanges that Congressman Wilson faces to get the funding he wants. <br /> <br /> There are, however, two complaints about the film. The first is that there is a subplot that involves a scandal investigation that is not well developed and as such serves only as a small distraction to the plot. The second complaint is that the film lacks some of the context of the war. The film makes the Mujaheddin seem innocent victims, and while they have suffered large civilian victims, the Mujaheddin were actually rebels trying to overthrow the government of Afghanistan. This government, ignored entirely in the film, did not surprisingly fight to suppress the rebellion, later calling upon the Soviet Union for support in their efforts. The film also ignores the fact that the United States was helping the Mujaheddin before the Soviet deployment in Afghanistan. The film suggested the unintended consequences of our secret actions - consequences that we still hear today - but it seems that screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director Mike Nichols are willing to sacrifice a historical context to provide a cohesive narrative. (Not having read the book, I don't know if George Crile made the same compromise.) Despite these complaints, I enjoyed watching Charlie Wilson's War and recommending it. I would have preferred a film that more accurately described the complexity of the situation, as Stephen Gaghan did to Syriana, but the public connected better with the cohesive narrative of Charlie Wilson's war than with the ambiguities present in Syriana.
