I'm not a fan of golf by any means. On May 26th at 10:30 pm the film started with a scene in the late 1800s. I like old films but not golf, however, in the first scene a boy (Harry Vardon) is awakened by men's voices. He goes outside to ask what they are doing and he is told they are going to build something golf ... So, I turned off the television, but something shook me up and came back on. The film is excellent. So let's see this boy now a man; professional golf player who is obsessed with the visions of his childhood. Then we meet the real focus of the Francis film and the decisions it makes for golf. You meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class lesson that is so obvious during the period. Then there is little Eddie Lowery his caddy with encouraging words and little pushes that are instrumental to Francis's victory. I don't want to give too much. I was up at 2 AM This is super please watch the movie.
