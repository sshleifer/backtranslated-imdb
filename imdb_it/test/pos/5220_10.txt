Father Hood <br /> <br /> I can understand why many people hate this story of a father who kidnaps his two children and transports them to America, but I've seen much worse, and - when I saw these years ago - I didn't think that it was particularly horrible. Patrick Swayze is the worried father who takes his children on the run with him for personal reasons, and Halle Berry is the policeman who chases them. <br /> <br /> Overall a decent way to spend a couple of hours of your life. You could definitely do worse: have you ever heard of the movie "Pod People"? <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 of ***** <br /> <br /> Rated PG-13 for some traumatic scenes, adult content, violence and language.
