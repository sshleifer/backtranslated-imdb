The art of the absurd is alive and flourishing in current Danish cinema! Well, at least it's in this movie. No one in this film is amused. They are all bored or shocked, and if they are not yet, they will be soon! It is a story of failures, murders, embarrassments, dignity and ultimately love and redemption. The chilling humorous style is idiomatic and not everyone will like it, but personally I found the right mix between the bizarre and the absurd. Have pity on the characters from afar, even if you don't love them up close and personal. But their story is so tragic that you find the possibility of forgiving them and being happy for them, even when they end with murder. <br /> <br /> This is, in my opinion, the best Danish film of recent years. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
