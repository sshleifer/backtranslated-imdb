This is a classic cult for sure !! <br /> <br /> It's hard to follow at times, but then again, so it's a movie like Jacobs Ladder or even Fight Club. If you want a standard rate, then I'm going to rent the Care Bears movie or maybe a old classic Disney. But if you want to "see the world differently" then I would say to open up to Enigma and, for that matter, to a film that challenges what we see and think. <br /> <br /> For me the key is that the film was original and made me question everything. So while I saw some complaints, all in all I would say take the movie for what it is and enjoy it.
