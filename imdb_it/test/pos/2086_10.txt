This film was full of suspense and was well directed, the black and white effect made it a great mystery. Fay Emerson, (Hilda Fenchurch) married twice to the famous musician Skitch Henderson and also Elliott Roosevelt's son (FDR's Son) fell madly in love with Zachary Scott (Ronnie Mason / Marsh). Ronnie wins the hearts of all the women in the picture, including Mona Freeman (Anne Fenchurch) and proposes marriage whenever she can. Rosemary DeCamp (Dr. Jane Silla) (famous TV and radio actress in the 1930s and 1940s played mostly in MOM'S town) warned the ladies about Ronnie Mason's sick mind and abusive childhood that he had when he grew up, which caused his love / hate relationship with women. Fay Emerson and Zachary Scott would have been great protagonists with more rewarding roles, but their lives were short lived in real life. This film is beyond criticism, it is a great classic of the 1945 cinema to see and enjoy for many generations!
