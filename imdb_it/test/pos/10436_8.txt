I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 12 years old. It was one of my favorites from ... It's so perfect in all its full splendor with an impressive soundtrack, a style dialogues, and it was both exhilarating and terribly sad. The first film really set me up in the end ... I won't ruin it for you guys, but it's a guy who tears tears ... I just remember feeling so sad about Gary! What a fantastic group of characters in this film is brilliant !!! They are all so great even the nerdy girl who doesn't like Gary ... (he still had a nice little body). I can't believe that all the girls go for Rick is such a squalid ball with a handkerchief tied around his neck !!! ha ha ha ... When watching this movie be prepared for a lot of complete sexual jokes of sexually transmitted diseases (almost). But a love story at heart with real problems, which goes from insecurity to life-changing decisions that make you think and feel sincere pain for the cast. I love this movie !!! If you like Valley Girl another classic you always will!
