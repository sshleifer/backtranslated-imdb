Good God ... As it ended up in our DVD player, I'll never know ... my wife thought it was a new version that somehow got lost ... It doesn't matter that she's a couple of years old and is Danish (I think) ... He kept looking for the English soundtrack ... <br /> <br /> All in all ... the film was not bad ... Good production values, better performances and an intelligent story that doesn't Go too far from himself to do in order, dark humorous food from beyond the sea! The ending will make you laugh ... in fact, the whole movie will do it. Incredibly weird characters that we're really interested in making a movie that could be worth it ... Without ruining the plot, the movie title and the DVD jacket give you a good idea of ​​where this is going!
