To make this film summer: beautiful for TV but too small for theater. I enjoyed watching this movie at home, but I won't watch it a second time. The concept is good, but what ends up in the film is just a summary. The end had a "nice" turn, but it is still unsatisfactory. Maybe it was the intention of the director, but it wasn't worked out as it should. But then again, it's a kind of OK movie.
