I can't believe that Bostock's Cup is not yet available on a proper video or DVD. I only saw it once, on a scammable copy taken off the TV and despite not being a huge fan (not at all) I thought it was one of the funniest things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The famous sloping field of wherever he was, the clueless coach driver ("Ponty-this, Ponty-that", "I'll take the next exit"), the useless plot; everything has been added to the painful sides. <br /> <br /> Being stuck in the United States, I am desperate for good British humor, but not enough to spend the amount the production company is asking for. Come on, get it out on kosher DVD ready.
