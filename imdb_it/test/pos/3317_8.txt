Caroline Bender (Hope Lange) is just killing time to find a job. His real ambition is to marry Eddie and have a baby. <br /> <br /> April (Diane Baker) is too innocent to stay that long and falls too easily in love with a dangerous combo. <br /> <br /> Greg (Suzy Parker) is a go-getter and wants to be an actress. <br /> <br /> All three are doomed for the dramaturgy in "The best of everything", a 1959 soap opera / a film about morality / sometimes a solid film that is aging in the second. <br /> <br /> the ruthless world of paperback publishing is not as sloppy as "Valley of the Dolls" but not as vanilla as "Three Coins in the Fountain". <br /> <br /> The men in the mix - Brian Aherne, Stephen Boyd, Louis Jourdan and Robert Evans - are clear, well-dressed and not good for the most part. Aherne is the resident sexual offender - she will pinch anything she passes and make unwanted advances left and right. His character is as offensive as hell, but he has never been played seriously. The harassment had not yet been discovered, I suppose. Even Boyd works there, even if you never see him do something. He's too busy to be older, wiser, and drunk. Evans is abroad, so Diane Baker can suffer with style - she's a rich guy who puts her in trouble so instead of marrying her, as promised, he's taking her to an operation. <br /> <br /> Jourdan is a director who erroneously has a relationship with Parker. They share a fight scene that is quite forbidden, in a film like this, but the scene is ultimately ruined by Parker's histronics. It almost ends up chasing him, and she didn't really deserve such a lousy fate, despite her bad acting. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford breathes fire like Amanda Farrow, the resident "witch" who is automatically rude and contemptuous of any of her legions of secretaries. Well, they're younger, aren't they? Isn't this reason enough to hate a person? Caroline doesn't think so, while she admires Miss Farrow every time she gets the chance. Crawford only manages to run wild once, when she tells her married boyfriend "you can have your rabbit-faced wife go to hell" and hit the phone. You can never see the poor soul that dares to cross it. <br /> <br /> The "plot" of Martha Hyer, so to speak, is extremely weak, and is painfully exaggerated like an unmarried mother. Apart from wearing a huge "W" (for "whore") on her cardigan, she walks around like a pathetic mess for most of her screen time. Even worse, she is not given the courtesy to have everything 'tied' in one way or another in the end. It doesn't matter so much, but still ... <br /> <br /> It is painfully obvious that this all happened in a completely different world. People were nicer to each other for the most part and the job was not a drag, but something exciting for a girl outside of New York. <br /> <br /> An unconvincing drunken scene aside, Hope Lange helps to seem reasonably real like Caroline, who at least has more than a part in her character. <br /> <br /> I admire that women are seen to have an opinion, an opportunity and a choice. Not that it isn't wrapped in a nice bow, but it makes some points for equality. In 1959 it was probably noteworthy and perhaps controversial. 7/10.
