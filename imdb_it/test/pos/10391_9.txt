I saw this movie for the first time last night. I thought about it all night and this morning. I can't say it was my favorite movie, at least not yet. I have to see it again. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is amazing. Every shot has a lyricism that you would expect in a film with the name of Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> It is always a temptation to see de Chirico in any image of rows of arrangements that vanish in the darkness, but in this case the analogy fits. In many respects, the figure of Malkovich walking through the fog and the wind of Ferarra echoes the shadow of the canvas statue that infests Milan in the main works of the Italian-Greek painter. It is a bit threatening, a presence that observes and, in its capacity as director, exerts an influence on the whole affair. <br /> <br /> The passionate Wenders fan cannot help but think of Damiel and Cassiel wandering the streets of Berlin, looking at everyone but not directly interacting with the inhabitants. And, following the metaphor of Himmel Uber Berlin, the angel (or in this case Malkovich the director) interacts with one of the stories. <br /> <br /> At this point I have to give up taking this critical line too far. I need to see the movie again. I'm pretty sure this is the common thread that will bring Malkovich's monologue together. <br /> <br /> Perhaps his reflections and pontifications are pretentious and empty dialogues that seem good but cannot be analyzed in a real communication. Perhaps this is the point. No one can issue that judgment with any degree of certainty or authority until he has done his homework. <br /> <br /> We must be careful when we launch the word "pretentious". It is easy to erase everything that smells of intellect as a claim, but this leads to a terrifying state of mind, in which the only conversation seen as genuine, earthly or authentic is the most trivial. When we avoid all the discussions on philosophy, on God, on existence, on meaning and on all those brain candy, we are putting our culture on a slow, stupid and ugly death. Perhaps this is the warning that Wenders and Antonioni are giving us. Certainly it is not the only theme of the film, but I think it cannot be ignored. <br /> <br /> The other (and more obvious) leitmotiv is that of satisfaction. There is a lot about this, and a thorough review of all the subtleties and consequences of developing this leitmotif would far exceed the 1000 word limit for this review. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch the film. But I offer a warning: it's not a stand-alone movie (at least I don't think so). Some films interact with the intellectual and artistic thought of their times so much that the viewer needs to have a background in the Zeitgeist before approaching the film. Par-dela les nuages ​​is one of those films.
