This was Bollywood's answer to the fatal attraction and this is a classic movie in its own right. Juhi Chawla was good, as was Sunny Deol but it was Shah Rukh Khan who became famous as the stalker. It has since become a favorite of Chopra's (Dilwale Dulhaniya le Jayenge, Mohhabatein, Dil a pagal hai, Veer Zaara and Chak De India). At first Shah Rukh seems to be a villain, but then towards the end he begins to sympathize with him. The script was superb and the songs were chartbuster. My favorites are too samne and Jaadu teri nazar. <br /> <br /> After the dismal failure of the underrated Lamhe Yash Chopra fought with Darr. The dialogues were memorable, the k..k..Kiran dialogue is often repeated. Since Darr Yash Chopra has slipped a little. The dil pagal you've got was bad, but he redeemed himself slightly with Veer Zaara, who was much better. This was Yash Chopra's last masterpiece.
