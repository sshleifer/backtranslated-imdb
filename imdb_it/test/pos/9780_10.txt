Having had a great-grandfather captured and sent to Changi during World War II, I was hesitant to see him when he was first shown on TV. My great-grandfather kept a diary while he was in captivity and when he died there his companions bought him back and I was lucky enough to read it and I feel I have at least some idea of ​​how Changi was, in the first person. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic story of what happened to those poor people who were sent to Changi prison and shows what hardships and cruelty they have seen to protect their country. It is a formidable story of mateship, commitment and Aussie Spirit, which will never cease to pose. It is worth looking at if you like Australian history or something to do with World War II. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this mini and give it 10 out of 10.
