Everyone agrees on the technical excellence of this Jutra film (whose life ended so tragically). As for the content, it obviously makes the difference if you are a Quebecker, and this explains some differences of opinion. For me, it is for the cinema what "Mon pays, it doesn't matter a penny" is for the song. Furthermore, Jean Duceppe was part of the legendary Quebec. <br /> <br /> This film can be contrasted with "CRAZY", a current version of Quebec that has enough success to show here in Spain and also concerns 1960. Urban Quebec (Crazy) against rural Quebec (Antoine). But also a film that must be something very different for foreigners and for people who know Quebec from within.
