In moments of despair they were willing to do whatever was necessary to win. I liked how the futility of maple leaves was used as a metaphorical basis for Bobby and Tessa. The acting was far more accurate than the hogwash consumption of the film industry. <br /> <br /> Great editing! At the end of the short I felt that it was a bit incomplete, but so was life and this was waltz life and art in a cinematic masterpiece. Excuse me while rinsing the cheese wizard, but I think it's acceptable at certain times. <br /> <br /> Two scenes that I have to emphasize are: the bathtub and the sofa scene. <br /> <br /> The Tessa sofa scene was a defining moment in the human condition. In the short term I saw her as a beast, but now we see her true reality. His mind spoke to his heart. I have to say more about the bathtub scene.
