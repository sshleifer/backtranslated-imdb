The only way to truly understand and relate to the characters in this film is to have experienced situations alone. For many people this film is almost fake-biographical, a sort of snapshot of a weekend in our lives. (I did about 85% of the stuff in this movie and saw the other 15%, usually all on the same weekend). For me and the others, I know it's nice to have this movie to look back because in addition to a few photos of people we remember and nights that are patches and blurs, this film is the Studio 54 of our generations, a piece to add to our books waste to look back and smile. Personally I'm glad those days have passed but it's nice to watch this movie and say "I remember when ........." Thanks Justin for making this fake biography of a weekend of my life.
