I saw this movie for the first time when it came out and I even bought an LP recording of the soundtrack. I liked it so much, I went back to see it several times ... I don't understand why it was considered a flop. Julie Andrews was adorable in this movie, her voice was in top form and the costume was beautiful! <br /> <br /> The film contains a bit of everything and although some scenes were a bit heavy, they were still fun. <br /> <br /> I recently found that I could get a copy in DVD format and ordered it ...... I was disappointed that a couple of songs and sequences in the movie were not included in the version of the DVD I ordered.
