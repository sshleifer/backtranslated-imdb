Right here. Good, fun and accurate feeling of the era to most scenes. Enough personality variations to cover real people in those days with no history distractions with exceptions. The credits show Peralta from Mar Vista, in California ... on the hill from Venice and south of Malibu. I lived there in the days of Heartbreak Hotel, pre-Beachboys, next to that surfer boy Bob Cooper on Wasatch Avenue, where the alley was used to burn surfboards that didn't work. The old skate skate wheels were used on plywood cutouts to roll down the waves of the sidewalk. Things were different in each subsequent decade, while the cold innocence of the 1950s burst into the Caldo del Sole with the freedom and euphoria of the sixties and then into the absolutely innovative playing time and inventive evolutionary madness of the seventies. The film gives you a piece of that kind of magic moment over time; in a place where the imaginary wave was real ... the source of culturally significant influences. And by the way, there's another film that has an equally graphically American street, and has the same genuinely unique goodness with relaxed reality that helps redefine that elusively eternal sense of cool .. "Two Lane Blacktop" (with one of the best examples of freesould-it attitude in the history of the West Coast in California .. Dennis Wilson). Like Monte Hellman did with that, thank you, SP, for being right there with that. GWR
