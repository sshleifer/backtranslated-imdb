I really liked the movie, especially the exceptionally beautiful Gong Li exhibition as a concubine. <br /> <br /> It was a bit of a distraction, however, to have a Chinese PLUS subtitle dialogue in English PLUS voice-over with an American accent, although the voice out was very well synchronized. <br /> <br /> The family name of Qin shi huiang of (The First Emperor of Qin) was Zheng, and his first name Yiong in English should have been referred to as "King Zheng" or "Emperor Zheng ", and NOT as" King Ying Zheng "as in those days the two familiar names / data were not used together. <br /> <br /> The state of Qin is pronounced "Chin" not "shin" - a pity that the researchers did not understand correctly. <br /> <br /> I forgave him, but in the end he was dismayed when the comment announced that he was buried in "Zai-an" along with his terracotta warriors. The city of Xi'an is pronounced "See-an", never "Zai-an" - surely the American voice-over speakers could have done it well!
