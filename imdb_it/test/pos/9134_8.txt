Although it is not the masterpiece of "Le Samourai" (I have now accepted that Jean-Pierre Melville has never managed to overcome that classic), I find that "Le Cercle Rouge" is much better than "Bob le flambeur". I felt that "Bob le flambeur" was a b-film above the average and influential, but still a b-film. "Le Cercle Rouge" demonstrates how filmmaker Melville has improved while continuing. John Woo is a big fan of Melville, even though their film style is different. While Woo uses fast movement for shootings and a sense of operatic violence, Melville has a minimalist style that suits him very well. He was not interested in creating fast-paced action films, but in more meditative criminal thrillers. In that department, he was one of the best. <br /> <br /> "Le Samourai" is still his best work, especially because he has more character development than this, but technically they are probably the same. Furthermore, while "Le Samourai" had a great main performance, this one has four. Alain Delon is once again an ultra-cool gangster in search of prey: this man's silence is fascinating. Bourvil is superb as the police inspector on the robbery and escape case with. He steals every scene he finds himself in and proves to be a skilled dramatic actor (in France he is best known as slapstick comedian in Buster Keaton mode). Yves Montand is also great as an expert in paranoid and paranoid firearms. Gian Maria Volont√® (a regular in spaghetti western) is overshadowed by his three co-stars, but he still does an adequate job. <br /> <br /> Once again, Melville's production is superb. Taking equal influence from both American yellows and the French new wave, man always seems to know the best shots and angles to choose. This is slower than most caper films, but in the end it succeeds. "Le Cercle Rouge" is a bit of a classic, but it is still one of the best robbery films ever made. Tarantino must have seen it before doing "Reservoir Dogs". (8/10)
