Look at it with an open mind, it's very different, nothing is taken for granted. Tarzan's very well made realistic tale. Animatronic chimpanzees are well made for 84, Christopher Lambert was brilliant imitating the language and behavior of chimpanzees. I wouldn't be surprised if he took lessons from Jane Goodall.
