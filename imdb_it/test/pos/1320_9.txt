There are very few films that can tell such a complicated story on so many levels as well as Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters. One of the most difficult aspects of storytelling is the ability to perform flashback and advancement without losing the rhythm of the film. This film not only goes back and the fourth with the largest of easy, but also flows through some of the greatest stories of Yukio Mishima. This film overcomes every aspect and is a joy to watch. Not to mention the incredible soundtrack by Philip Glass.
