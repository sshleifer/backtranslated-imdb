This is a well-made action movie. There are many fighting scenes, the acting is convincing (for this genre) and RS1 is fantastic. I don't know why people feel compelled to ruin RS1, I thought its effects were performed very well and its design was fantastic. The plot was acceptable for a martial arts film. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I must say that Richard Sun is one of the worst Hong Kong actors I've ever seen. At least RS1 had the right idea by killing it. Now, for all of you who thought that Sam Lee (Alien) was a bad actor ... it was not to be taken seriously! I just had the pleasure of watching Gen-X Cops (prequel) and Sam Lee played the same character the same way! <br /> <br /> Now, please, all of you guys who look at the winners of the much appreciated Oscars: DO NOT JUDGE, THIS IS A THOUGHT MAN FILM! IT IS NOT SUPPLICATED TO REQUEST THE THOUGHT! I just wanted to enjoy it, that's all. I hope they make another one soon.
