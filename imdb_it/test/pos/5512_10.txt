Dee Snider was inspired to make a song in two parts of a horror movie. This film has written / directed / produced and performed in detail the subjects of those songs (Horror-terria, from TwistedSister / Stay Hungry). People commented that he must have a sick mind to put something like this. I don't hear anyone like that commenting on Stephen King, Wes Craven, Dean Koontz, or Alfred Hitchcock in his time. The film represents a modern psychotic created by current trends in society. Personally I thought it was pretty well done by imagination and inspiration, even without the benefit of a large budget and interviews with victims / criminals. This movie is perfect if you want something that will make you nightmares and make you shiver on the possible and probable. IT COULD HAPPEN!!
