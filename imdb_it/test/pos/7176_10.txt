This is a documentary unlike any other. It has so many levels and shows us so much that it's almost impossible to try to analyze it all at once. The documentary filmmaker William Greaves shows us the process of creating a film from a different perspective. We see the struggles of the actors, the director, the sound crew and all the others who try to resist and make this film successful. If it were a movie, it would be normal. What Greaves does is make it more complex by making the actors shoot a movie, and then this will be shot by another troupe, just to get another team back to film it all. Three cameras, each with a different lens. It has an almost dizzying effect but at the same time it is exciting. I like the parts where the crew organizes and discusses what's going on. They too are somewhat obscure about what Greaves is trying to do. Mezzo sees this as an experiment while the other half sees it as a chaotic and confused failure. Regardless of which side you choose, you can't argue that Greaves doesn't involve you in this process.
