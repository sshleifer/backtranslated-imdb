I have to admit that I'm a fan of 80s cartoons, but this is among the best. Rainbow Brite and The Star Stealer are one of the most watchable and fun of the Rainbow Brite comics, and it's much better than the TV series. I especially like the relationship between Rainbow and Darian and I find it very funny. My favorite character, though, is Starlite, which is certainly the most "magnificent horse in the universe"! <br /> <br /> I also recommend Rainbow Brite: New Beginnings, which tells the story of how Rainbowland became. Have a rainbow-day!
