This film contained all that could be desired by looking at it originally in the late 1960s. It was immensely fun, and provided a contemporary view of the many changes that occurred during that period - and they were still ongoing - in terms of the Black Power movement, Vietnam, and the volatile movement that followed the quieter, before the post-1950s. br /> <br /> All this is one of the funniest films, then or now. <br /> <br /> Viewing it for the second time recently, I was surprised to find it as compelling as when originally seen. His humor is fun and his message is strong. <br /> <br /> And now, seeing it, you get all this, while at the same time you get the pleasure of being a "vintage piece" and a superb chronicle of this turbulent historical period.
