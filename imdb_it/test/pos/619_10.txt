If you want to see a real thriller, rent this one !!! It is not from the director or screenwriter of "Scream", it does not present exaggerated and overpaid "TV" actors who pass as "stars", and it is not a race to the mine of special effects of the mill. Instead you will get a top quality nailbiter, angular, very strong (in violence) but electrifying.
