My wife and I saw this movie once in 1989 and we liked it so much we wanted to see it again. It was so moving that I was calling it a tear-jerk. The mystery that Billings was sent to actually report is not at all a mystery. Corners !! It seems that at any time something turned around happened to him, all right, and I think he scared George a bit, considering he didn't realize what he had got himself into. This shows that even the cold heart can change with the right attitude around. If only we could treat all others equally, the world would be a better place. To date we have searched the net for a copy of it, now I finally have a connection to it, as soon as I can find a copy to buy I'm going to grab it.
