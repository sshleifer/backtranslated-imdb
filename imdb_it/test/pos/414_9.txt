Ugh, what an embarrassing episode last night! It was a failed script for "ABC Afterschool Special", or the product of a serious rookie writer, just out of college, paying homage to the classic PC anti-gun homily of 1974, "The Gun". In fact my husband and disappointed that the final blow did not concern the fact that The Gun was melted as in the movie! No, I'm not an NRA shield. It's just that when the producer of an intelligent and nuanced series gets it into his head that I should be subjected to an educational dramatization of his personal Cause, I'd like the conference at least not delivered via 2-by-4. <br /> <br /> OK, the sociology lesson is over. The message was delivered. The important episode was broadcast. Now back to some funny episodes that try to respect our intelligence.
