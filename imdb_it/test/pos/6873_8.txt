Walter Matthau is remembered for the long series of comedies he did with his comedy companion Jack Lemmon of THE FORTUNE COOKIE to THE ODD COUPLE II. But people tend to forget that in the late 1970s he appeared with another partner in two films: a female. This was Glenda Jackson, the double winner of the English Oscar, who demonstrated her comic abilities against the first in Mattonelle di casa and then in HOPSCOTCH. The role of Matthau was slightly wider in both films, because his characters were more central to the plots, but the chemistry between them was quite good. If you want to see two professionals who demonstrate how sexual intercourse can be incredibly funny, look at Walter and Glenda like Dr. Charley Nicholson and Ann Atkinson experimenting to see if two people could have sex on a bed under the old two-man movie code share each with one leg on the floor! Sex has never been seen from a clinical or mechanical point of view. <br /> <br /> Matthew's Charlie has just been widowed before the film began. He only had one woman in his life - his wife. So now it's the right bachelor. He is also the principal surgeon of the hospital where he works, but the chief surgeon is Dr. Amos Weatherby (Art Carney). Carney is apparently senile (there are moments later in the film showing that he transforms his senility in and out - see the scene where Richard Benjamin's machine is planted). Amos is ready for re-election (Charlie is his closest competitor for the place - if he wants to). However, Amos manages to convince Charlie to let him keep the job for reasons of self-esteem. <br /> <br /> One day Charlie notices Ann in the hospital. She had a minor accident and is resting in bed, but Amos put her in a cage-like apparatus (which Charlie observes hasn't been used since about 1920). He pulls her out of the device and is soon teasing her. He joins the hospital staff, but is critical of Charlie's willingness to satisfy Amos, and is critical of certain selfish tendencies he sees among the doctors at the hospital. the death of a wealthy protector of the hospital (Lloyd Gough), owner of a baseball team (his biggest innovation is the separate admission costs for double headers). Amos tries to calm the young widow of the team owner, delivering the funeral eulogy to the burial service (the line in the summary above is the praise line of praise). However, she is still determined to sue (her lawyer Thayer David says the hospital is the most incompetent I've ever seen). So Amos suggests Charlie to love the widow to satisfy her from that expensive legal action. But how will Ann react to this? The film is quite funny and has been so successful that in addition to causing a sequel for Jackson and Matthau, it has also led to a television series.
