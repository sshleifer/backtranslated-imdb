OK. A warning to anyone out there being a parent or guardian. Pay attention to who you see this movie - that is - DO NOT TAKE CHILDREN TO SEE THIS FILM. I'll explain why. <br /> <br /> 1 - the title is misleading and the film has nothing to do with romance - I assume it was intentional for the producer, but it's annoying 2 - the movie itself is really very very disturbing. I have some problems: the first is that the film is neither violent nor sexual and therefore is not a "horror film". But it is a very disturbing film and involves a child, his parents and a small town. <br /> <br /> OK, it comes down to this. The film is not suitable for minors, because it contains sequences and images that are disturbing and would confuse a child. It has a bizarre quality and ONLY because it has a child that makes me feel inadequate. As a parent, I feel strong enough to tell people why I only read the other day that he is having a theatrical release. <br /> <br /> I hope not to offend the filmmakers by saying this, but I think that's right, because it was released and only has an M score (because it's not violent or sexual). Simply strange and disturbing, but good enough in and of itself.
