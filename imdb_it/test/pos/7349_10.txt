Viva La Bam was one of those shows that I didn't have high expectations before seeing it, and I never knew it until I saw my friend watch it. I thought Jackass was pretty funny, but the stunts were just like that, fun and I never really cared about the show. When I looked at Viva La Bam for the first time it was the opposite effect, I loved it. It looked more like a TV show than many "Reality Shows" have today. I was hooked and wanted to see what new scheme they would prepare for each episode. Until the last episode, I was aroused and even though some of the ideas seemed to be reworked at times, it always had a more new and fun touch. Viva La Bam is one of those shows that keep you glued and I have yet to see another show that is quite similar.
