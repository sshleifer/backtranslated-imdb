Robust David Innes (solid Doug McClure) and doddery Dr. Abner Perry (a delightful Peter Cushing) make their way into the heart of the earth in their ruthless bulk. The duo discovers an ancient prehistoric world populated by dangerous giant beasts and human beings that are used both as food and as slaves by the evil telepathic pterodactyls. Director Kevin Conner, who works with a light-heartedly stupid script by Milton Subotsky, maintains a constant and constant rhythm and treats the premise exceptionally silly with surprising seriousness, thus giving this image a certain ragged quality that is fun and engaging in equal measure. The amiable special effects (not so) are quite (unintentionally) amusing. The assortment of low-priced creatures in particular is positively deployed: cruddy-in-obvious men - men of poor pterodactyls, equally wild mascots of wild ape-men and a hilarious frog-thing that erupts frog-blowing fire blowing really good A climax occurs when McClure mixes it with a fat, clumsy giant reptile. Another priceless scene depicts a dinosaur clutching a doll in its slave jaws. Furthermore, we also get a bit of a stir and an exciting climatic slave revolt. It is a real surprise to see Cushing take it cheerfully in a rare and ample comic part and become an unlikely, but enthusiastic action hero with arrows in the last third of the film. The always luscious Caroline Munro looks really appetizing like Princess Dia, besides there are some nice rounds of support from Cy Grant like the gallant warrior Ra and Sean Lynch as a coward traitor Hoojah. Mike Vickers' very varied soundtrack alternates between the saucy orchestral music and the bombastic synthesizer stuff. Alan Hume's clear cinematography adds shine brilliance to infected acts. A complete campy riot.
