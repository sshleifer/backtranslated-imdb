This is a great car movie (It's a work of art / YES a work of art!) All the vintage cars are not fantastic plastic, I watched it over and over again I consumed two videocassettes, and I would wear out much more. Many other young or old car enthusiasts will love this movie and will watch it more than once! so rent it or buy it (just see it) I would like them to make more movies (cars) like this V8 power not gasified with small snipper whipper !!!! <br /> <br /> (shes a 351 true?) (engine magic) (the wagon pile) <br /> <br /> (you must learn to feel the power)
