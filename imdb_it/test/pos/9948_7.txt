If you love movies of Japanese monsters, you'll love this action-packed battle that attacks an alien invader, intent on conquering the Earth, and a "giant Robot" with an armor of super weapons. The alien, "Emporer Guillotine", from the planet Gargoyle, has an army of thugs called, (of course) "the band of the gargoyles", as well as an endless supply of immense hostile creatures that are regularly dumped on Earth to destroy buildings, make noises strong, panicked, etc. A little boy, named Johnny Sokko, calls the giant robot at his invitation, and sends the robot, if necessary, to beat and then blow up these creatures. Johnny joins a group of "good spies" called Unicorn, and strives to help save the world. <br /> <br /> Despite the wild nature, the involuntary and humorous dialogue, and the fact that the target audience was obviously children, this film has a ceaseless action, colorful characters, decent special effects, and it seems to be really fun to watch. The battle scenes are well executed and frequent, as the plot requires. The good guys and the bad guys made sure that they had an inexhaustible supply of bombs, lasers, ammunition and schemes to attack each other. Despite the fact that the film was made by TV series episodes, the plot develops and reaches a definitive conclusion. <br /> <br /> The film has a positive vision and appeals to everyone (especially children)) desire to destroy evil in its many forms. Children can be the target audience, but it's fun for everyone to laugh at its comic stupidity; yet at the same time, the root for good guys to prevail and "save the world". The acting is trivial, but this is the charm: there are several lines of banal dialogues (probably translation errors or perhaps intentional jokes from film producers), and you'll find yourself citing these absurd lines later. <br /> <br /> Of course, this film does not have a high level of quality or production budget. However, for what it is, Campy Sci-Fi, it's fun for some laughs. I recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor for that sort of thing.
