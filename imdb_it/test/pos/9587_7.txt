Tiny Tweet and Sly the smart are locked up in a cage for a train journey to who knows where. Sweing Tweety starts to sing an unbearable song as soon as the train leaves the station, so we hope Puddy Tad will do it this time. Sly tries on a couple of funny tricks with his hands, but he ruins the man who leads the man to a safer place in the luggage. The cat's next attempt will put him in the steam engine's coal-fired oven. And the pursuit is on. Obviously there is also a bulldog, and foolishly Sly can't keep his mouth shut. <br /> <br /> Next the persistent kit proves the old stacking of the bit-suitcases (twice) that produces a payoff Tex Avery would be proud of. Unfortunately for Sylvester, that bulldog seems to be everywhere. It also shows a talent for changing shape and producing huge clubs from the back pocket. Not even the Sylvesters' ability to run faster than a running train can save him when he is ejected, Silver Streak style, several times in a row. Arriving at the new place of the grandmother, (Gower Gulch, population 86) the last attempt of the cat regards the disguise. But you know what happens to the men in the clothes, they get more and more attention than they have contracted. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
