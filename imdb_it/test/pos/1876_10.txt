OK, well, nobody in their right mind (s) should take a movie called "The Man with the Screaming Brain" and expect him to be serious. This is an outrageous b-movie, and this means a really hockey storyline, strange characters, clich√©s, exaggerated action and a single line type. For that strange part of the population (including myself) that gets a kick from that kind of thing, this is a gem. <br /> <br /> Acting is better than expected. Stacy Keach is incorporated into her character. Bruce Campbell brings a lively and convincing performance. His skills in physical comedy are truly impressive in this film and he listens to the "Evil Dead" movies.
