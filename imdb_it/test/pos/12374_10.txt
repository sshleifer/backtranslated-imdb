This film is a masterpiece to put it simply. Especially the double exposure made by the cameraman Julius Jaenzon. It is skillfully made even with the standards we are used to today, seventy-eight years later. Viktor Sjöström, the director, also plays the main character, David Holm. New Year's Eve is killed in a brawl, and legend has it that the first to die in the new year will have to work as a soul collector in the form of a transparent ghost. There is a new anime collector to be nominated every year. <br /> <br /> The scene in which the alcoholic, David Holm, rises from his dead body (as the soul is leaving his earthly body) in the churchyard (where the fight took place) is a real prize for an eye that loves to film. Even when the current anime collector arrives with his horse and his carriage is a beautiful but also scary scene. David Holm recognizes this anime collector as a lover of previous life. Now it's up to him to take over. Just like Scrooge in the Dickens story "A Christmas tale", David is shown what his life and actions brought to the people around him. <br /> <br /> The film is about the danger of abusing drugs, in this case alcohol. It is based on a book by the Nobel Prize winner Selma Lagerlöf. Viktor Sjöström has shot some of his books, but this is the one with the best result, perhaps because this book is the most filmed of them. <br /> <br />
