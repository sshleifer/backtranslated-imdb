This is one of those movies that seems so "dated" that being that way is part of the fun. See and hear things you would NEVER see or see on the big screen today. Some of these are good; a little too trivial for words, a bit bad (depending on your point of view on some cultural issues). <br /> <br /> For example, in this short film (68 minutes) of 1931 you have: <br /> <br /> The grandfather of the family that is described in this story that enhances the value of patriotism and why it is should speak out against criminals for the sake of the United States (photos in today's films!) <br /> <br /> A district attorney (Walter Huston) almost implored death sentences and the population shown as a 100 supporter for one hundred (once again, the image that in today's films.) <br /> <br /> Along the way you have some shocking violence, like a boy who was captured a few times and literally thrown headlong into a closet, and his father was taken and swung headlong repeatedly in a wall. This is a tough stuff to say the least. <br /> <br /> Yet the film is full of comedy, mostly from the patriotic grandfather, memorably played by Charles "Chic" Sales. There are lots of laughs for everyone who sees this unique movie. And, for a soft touch, there are the two young boys, one of whom - Dickie Moore - has continued to become a rather famous child actor in his time. Here, he's just a little boy of about 5 years who, understandably, is far from being a lucid actor, but you can see celebrity on the horizon for him. In fact, he did just that the following year with a solid performance in "Blonde Venus", starring Marlene Dietrich. <br /> <br /> However, this is a funny film due to an effective mix of violence, comedy and sentimentality ... and it has a nice and pleasant ending and a stimulating message. It was also an Academy Award for "Best Writing, Original Story". I'm sorry to say that it's only available for viewing on cable TV as it's never been put on VHS or DVD ..... and that's a shame.
