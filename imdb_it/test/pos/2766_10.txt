Susie Q is a great romantic movie. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a great actress. I think he did a great performance. I hope that sometimes the Disney Company can put this movie on DVD. I think it's cute and a little funny. It's a bit sad when Susie Q dies in a car accident at the beginning, at first it makes you want to cry or sob. But in the middle when no one suspects Susie Q it becomes quite funny and surprising. There is a bit of mystery in this film but not much. But I would still recommend this film to the whole family if they love comedy, mysterious or romantic movies. It's great! I think Amy Jo Johnson as Susie Q is pretty.
