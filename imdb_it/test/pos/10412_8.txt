I think it's great how Chiller has picked up this series and shown it for this generation. The making of the film has come a long way in particular with special effects and in order to see the archived shows that had never existed, they will certainly be able to see progress compared to now. MONSTERS is neither lame nor spectacular but it is fun. It takes creativity for the types of plot they invented and each generation seems to have its own horror series. This particular series was not as terrifying as on Friday 13, the series, nor as an adult oriented like the Freddy's Nightmares..it was something that an entire family could watch and still get a laugh and a scare at the same time. I'm glad the Chiller channel shows it in their line-up, I'm almost taken by the episodes I missed when I was growing up.
