Recently I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Hauer at the Sarasota Film Festival 2005 for the American premiere of this film. Not only was he kind enough to autograph my copy of BLADE RUNNER, he took the time to answer some questions about the film before projecting THE ROOM for a theater full of people. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed by the film that I used it as a yardstick to compare all the other films I had seen at the festival. It was powerful and moving, but subtle and brief. The film tells the story of how a young man (older version played by Rutger) one day finds himself enchanted by an apparently ordinary room in an insignificant building near the road. As you walk, you notice a single window, always open, from which you can hear a disturbing melody. Every day, he passes by the room, sometimes staying out for hours outdoors, watching him through the silk curtains that flutter in the light breeze, hoping to see his occupants. Towards the end of the film, we discover how significant this room is and what our protagonist has attracted us to. <br /> <br /> The film has been beautifully cut. A second of screen time was not wasted for an uninteresting shot. Every single frame of the film could be alone in an art gallery. Rutger is fantastic. It is mysterious, yet accessible. His dialogue includes a series of reflections on a life that has run its course, for better or for worse. His words evoke familiar feelings and thoughts from the public. I was particularly moved by a scene in which he is looking at some old photos, remembering his favorite dog, his favorite horse and his first love. You have the feeling of being in his presence, as it allows you to enter his world to glimpse precious memories of a life that is about to end. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone looking for something fresh, smart and moving. Viewing for all major films should be requested.
