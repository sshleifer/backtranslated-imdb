During the search for Susan Harrison (The Ballerina) in reference to an episode of Bonanza, I was reminded of this jewel. <br /> <br /> This episode is the inspiration for Dylan's "All Along the Watch Tower" (Hendrix's cover is probably well known and is one of his best) which is one of his best. <br /> <br /> So this episode is responsible for many "bests" - not bad for about 22 minutes of television. <br /> <br /> But this is "The Twilight Zone". No further comment is required in the series. <br /> <br /> The '5 characters' are typical of Serling. Intense, dramatic, barricaded towards an end that is inevitable in hindsight since it is surprising the first time you see it. <br /> <br /> This episode is ruined in a sentence and is too good to ruin who has not seen it. <br /> <br /> But you will be ambushed. And you'll never hear Hendrix with the same ears again.
