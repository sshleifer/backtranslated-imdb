I like to say that the film was good and touching. The film explains the true meaning of being saved or reborn and is very well defined. The acting was pretty good but could be improved. The board of directors is catchy and when my church had a service for young people and we watched it, 8 people gave their lives to Christ. I also want to tell anyone who is reading this, to give your life to Christ and repent of your sin.
