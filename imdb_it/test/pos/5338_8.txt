If you haven't watched the movie yet, but you like comedy, go out and buy or at least rent it! The fact that he won, the animated Oscar, is not a coincidence! I have not seen many other films by Wallace and Gromit (in fact, I think I only saw each other), but humor is very particular ... and some would even say very English. In a good way, of course! <br /> <br /> The story will be just an excuse for all the jokes to come, but even if it's not the most elaborate, it still works (by the way, my niece imagined to see one of the big surprises coming, Not the 'I did, congratulations to her; o)). I think that after seeing this, go out and look for the other W & G films, which are out there. Have a good time!
