In today's world of advertising and horror and adolescent sensationalism it is very rare that you can watch a movie and there is nothing about it. Movies like Psycho and Blair Witch, despite being big in suspense (both with big build ups) are spoiled by the fact that we know everything about the best scenes and at least on the plot before seeing them. With Mute Witness, a rare thing, I came across this movie and watched it, scared with no mind, in the middle of the night. I was frightened by the threatening Russian atmosphere, by the "snuff" theme and by the sad claustrophobic situation of the mute and by the fact that the characters (funny, always funny) could reach the end at any time. As this is a low budget and rare film, we watch it without any expectations. He also has Fay Ripley in a rare film role, watching and getting ready to be excited, scared and electrified in totally unexpected ways.
