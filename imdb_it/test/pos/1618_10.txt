OK, I'm a sucker. I loved it. I had no expectations and I had everyone satisfied. It was a terrible film. I loved it. I was able to consume a DVD from overuse. No one can understand my obsession. I can't even tell you the truth. For those who have seen the film this will not be a surprise, but I asked the video store clerk if I could buy a copy and I could because there were two in stock and only one had been extracted and over half the time it was been for me. <br /> <br /> Now, the film is terrible. The special effects are terrible. The acting is terrible, but I loved it. The actors are fools, the plot is dull, the numerous are sad - like being able to see through monsters, the "arachnids" seemed made of plastic garbage bags (maybe they were), there was light underground, TNT was not Absolutely deafening, etc ... <br /> <br /> You really have to love B-Movies to get pleasure from this ... alcohol helps others tremendously.
