It's a wonderful film about people. Strange people. The characters in the film all have a very tragic past, so they all have their problems. Their problems evolve in a way that makes the film's plot very absurd; but that doesn't make the film worse, but just better, because it's shot in a kind of fantastic way, so nothing is real. This review may seem a little strange, but then again, the film is not entirely normal ... It is also a hilarious movie on many occasions. If you haven't seen it, look at it. To enjoy!
