I've been a big fan of Cky, Jackass and Viva La Bam videos for a long time. They had a nice run and I expected my laughter to end. But it is not yet This movie has kept my mouth open all the time. I'm still laughing, at random. I went to the theater with low expectations, thinking it wouldn't be better than the first. Oh, how incredibly wrong I was. <br /> <br /> There have been many good moments in the film. If you are picky, you don't like crude humor put randomly, or if you didn't like the first movie, you probably won't like it. But with that being said, I almost wiped my pants so hard to laugh. He had all kinds of different jokes, masochistic humor, toilet humor, throwing up, laughing, some big falls and huge damage to the whole cast. Ryan Dunn has even labeled the back of Bam with an image that will remain locked for a long time. I'm sure you can only imagine how raw this movie is. <br /> <br /> No pain, no gain? Right? This film has already done well, making theaters all over America laugh so much that they will want it to last longer. I know I did it. This film didn't feel at all short, especially with the end credits that continued the movie. But, I still wish he could go on forever. Now, let's wait and see when they release Jackass Number 3! Overall, an excellent film, if you can overcome male nudity and some disgusting images. Keep your kids out of this movie. They don't need to see it, at least until they are older. Support the crew and BUY THIS when it comes out on DVD! I know I will.
