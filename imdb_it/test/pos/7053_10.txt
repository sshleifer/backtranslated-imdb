Imagine spending the summer without your family or friends at school and meeting new people. Or again, it's your first time when you're nobody and the only person you can count on is someone from the camp. "Meatballs" contains a lot of comedy in this film. In the field there is an eccentric counselor (Bill Murray) who knows how boys and girls can have fun. Join a boy named Rudy (Chris Makepeace) who has nobody to look after. It doesn't fit anyone, only Tripper can make it fun. The rest of the jar is crazy like Tripper. Camp Northstar is an average field with an above average team. The other Camp Mohawk hand is an elite camp that makes them run for their money. In the basketball game, the Mohawks broke up! And in the Olympics Northstar's teal got the revenge they needed when one of the members took the saboteur. And Morty (Harvey Atkin), this poor soul will never be able to get going if he tried. A very, VERY funny comedy, and it is a great guardian that I will say. This film shows that the field can be fun, if you wanted it! 5 stars!
