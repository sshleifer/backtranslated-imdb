I saw him on HBO because he won the Oscar a week earlier. He compares favorably with the fictional dramas of the court. <br /> <br /> The story is of a 15-year-old black boy being tried for the murder of an elderly white woman from Jacksonville, Florida, based almost exclusively on identifying the victim's husband and a confession that the defense claims to have been forced. <br /> <br /> About half of the movie is from the process; it is completed with videos of defense lawyers (two public defenders) explaining their case, interviewing witnesses and visiting key positions. This is modified with a minimum of unnecessary repetition and entered in logical order. The camera work is quite solid. And there is a slightly surprising ending.
