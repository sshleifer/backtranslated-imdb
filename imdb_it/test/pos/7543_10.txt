There are other films about colleges and the antics of students and staff, but "The Belles of St. Trinian's" dominates all of them! The plot has been carefully summarized by other posters, so I will not cover the same land. I just want to say that it is a pity that it is FINALLY released on DVD, but in a format that cannot be used in the United States! :-) Also, is it possible to be notified by e-mail when (I won't say "if") it will be released on DVD in the US? Thanks!
