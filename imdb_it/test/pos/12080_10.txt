I saw this movie many years ago on TV and recorded it from there, I could never really understand why my mother was upset watching it! It was because I was so young at the time. I just sat down and watched this movie again Now I have 2 children of mine and I had to try to fight the tears but it didn't happen that I was crying for most of the movie. Just to show how different you feel when you have your children! Such an extraordinary family, such a heartbreaking film, really wonderful! Someone said that about 8 still live other news, you are all still in contact I'd like to know! Touched by the film everywhere!
