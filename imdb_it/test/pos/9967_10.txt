William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice talks about a Jewish lender and his bond to extract a pound of flesh from the wealthy merchant Antonio, the lump sum of a debt. The Jewish money lender, of course, is Shylock and he is presented with such a great performance by Al Pacino that even exceptional actors like Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynne Collins vanish in the background. The film is set in 16th century Venice and director Michael Radford relies on setting, mood and realism to tell his story, rejecting sumptuous period costumes or a modern environment with rock music to attract a wider audience. <br /> <br /> Radford divides the duration of the game into two hours and eight minutes manageable and also provides a historical background. In the initial narrative, it tells us how the Jews came to England, they were subjected to a growing persecution and eventually expelled from England. They were forbidden to possess property, they could only make profits by lending money at interest, and they were forced to live in a Venetian "geto", a forerunner of the darkest events to come. In the film, the merchant Antonio (Jeremy Irons) spits on Shylock in public, but does not feel ashamed of going to the usurer to borrow 3000 ducats to help his friend and suggests to his lover Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) to properly court Portia (Lynne Collins), rich heiress. Although Shylock has been insulted by Antonio, he agrees to lend the money without interest for three months on condition that the confiscation of the bond gives him the right to demand a pound of flesh from Antonio's heart. <br /> <br /> the game is primarily a drama of hatred and revenge, but like many of Shakespeare's plays there are also touches of broad comedy. Here the play involves three pairs of lovers: Bassanio and Portia, Gratiano, a friend of Bassanio, and Nerissa, and Lorenzo, another friend of Bassanio, and Jessica, Shylock's daughter. Portia offered herself to the person who can choose the right treasure from one of the three boxes, made of gold, silver and lead. The Prince of Morocco chooses the golden one, the Prince of Aragon the silver one and both are disappointed. Bassanio, however, loves her alone and opens the lead coffin to find the portrait inside. Radford's adaptation conveys an extraordinary feeling for time and place. The Portia residence in Belmont suggests one of those splendid summer houses complete with immaculate gardens and artistic treasures hanging in every room and contrasts well with the ramshackle appearance of the town of Shylock with its damp alleys. <br /> <br /> When it becomes clear that Antonio cannot repay the debt, Bassanio returns to Venice, leaving Portia behind him. When he arrives, the loan is in default and Shylock asks for his pound of flesh. Even when Bassanio, backed by the wealth of Portia, offers many times the amount of the reimbursement, Shylock intends to take revenge not only for the loss of money but for a life of status as a stranger. The duke, who sits in the trial, will not intervene when Portia becomes a lawyer to defend Antonio. This is where the film reaches its dramatic heights while all parties arrive in court to reach a final resolution. <br /> <br /> The Merchant of Venice is not just about an unpaid debt, but also the removal of Jews from Christians, society and their desire to belong. It was one of the most controversial theatrical works and Shakespeare's analysts discussed at length whether this is an anti-Semitic work or simply an anti-Semitic work that reflects the prevailing view of Christian society in Elizabethan England. Although Shylock is certainly a caricature, he is an ambiguous figure and there are many indications that Shakespeare sees his defects as human, non-Jewish defects. The Duke acknowledges that he is simply a man who failed to respect the compassionate language of the Torah. <br /> <br /> In the monologue, "I am a Jew. Do you have Jewish eyes? Sting us, do not bleed? If you tickle us, don't we laugh? If you poison us, don't we die? And if you twist us, we will not avenge ? ", Shylock shows a universal humanity, expressing the equality of all men. Even if we are horrified by the phrase we wish to perform, we can feel his pain accumulated over the years. Pacino's performance brings new vigor to the text and his often exaggerated personality is replaced by a gentler and more discreet demeanor that brings understanding to his cause .. During an interview at the Toronto International Film Festival last September, Radford said of Pacino , "When you work with a brilliant actor, you have a great car, it's a bit like driving a powerful car, you must dare to do it" He dared and we are all beneficiaries.
