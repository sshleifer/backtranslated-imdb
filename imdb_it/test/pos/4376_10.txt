It is bad that Ya really shows more talents than George Carlin. It's really as strong as a bite. It is a pity that we lost him last year, but his comedy will live forever. This special stand-up is literally one of the most fun I've ever heard a comedian. Even if you are making fun of young children, it just makes you laugh as some of the things say. It is true that Carlin can literally do something that seems unpleasant and turn it into one of the funniest things you've ever heard and will never hear. I really liked this stand-up, especially from Carlin, and I recommend it to those who liked this check-up more than George Carlin's stand-up.
