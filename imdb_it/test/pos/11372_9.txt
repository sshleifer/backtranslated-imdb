I think it has been more than 40 years since I saw this series, but the memory of it has not faded a bit. This would be natural for the re-release of the DVDs, it seems to me. Many of the artists have become famous (Robert Hardy, Sean Connery, to name a couple); although it was a rather small role, I still remember Judy Dench, then twenty, as Katherine of France (Henry V). She was very beautiful then as now. There is a clue on this site that the series was filmed in color - is that it? Who of us would know - practically without color TV in those days. Mores pity, no VCR; if so, some may have registered it. As a way of teaching English history, this series has made the game alive as few class teachers can handle it. <br /> <br /> What a beautiful reissue it would be!
