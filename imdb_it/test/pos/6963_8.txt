The lovable, yet lethal, Alexandra (the beautiful blonde statuesque beauty Stacie Randall, who looks absolutely smashed in a tight black leather suit) must find a magic amulet so that his evil demonic Faust master can cross our size. It is up to the intrepid cop, Jonathan Graves (sympathetic Peter Liapis), stop it. Meanwhile, two creatures of gnomes dwarves, pitifully dishonest, with a "comic relief" are unleashed in Los Angeles. Jim Wynorski, experienced veteran expert on slavery exploitation, tells the extremely silly story to a brisk pace and not taking seriously any of this nonsense. The cast fight fighting with silly material: the lovely Barbara Alyn Woods as the unfortunate captain Kate, Raquel Krelle police as a whore, sexy prostitute Jeanine, Bobby Di Cicco as intractable and uncomfortable Graves Scotty partners, as Peggy Trentini curator of museums Monica and Ace Mask curator like the cheerful Dr. Rochelle. The stinky screenplay for Mark Stevi biscuit, a fun sense of humor without blinking, the bouncy soundtrack by Chuck Cirino, the two dwarfs wearing Halloween masks at low cost, simple cinematography JE Bash, no tension or female nudity free to talk about, and the special effects (less than) of all the others further refine the delicious general taste of this first slice of Velveeta celluloid. A fun piece and mindless dreck lovable.
