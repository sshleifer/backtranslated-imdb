My friend gives me these 3 huge boxes. "They are Flash Gordon series laser discs," he says. "I'll have giant coasters," I say. But not so. This serial oscillates. (But I had to whine and complain to almost everyone I knew to find a laserdisc reader). <br /> <br /> There is really a bit of everything in this serial: There are lion men, hawk men, shark-men, earthlings, and I imagine you would call Mongo men. Sets and costumes combine, Greek, Roman, Oriental, Egyptian and even armor like English knights. Fantastic costumes. And in part it was a revolt. Those horrible tights with shorts worn by Zarkov above are indescribable. And the boys in the furnace scene seem to be wearing boxers. <br /> <br /> It is also amusing the way they have dubbed the octopus in an octosacoda, the orangutan in orangapoid and the tiger in a tigron. There is even a dragon (a Godzilla-like creature that threatens Flash on a couple of occasions before being killed). <br /> <br /> Do you like the Invisible Man? This has you covered. Do you like sword fights, wrestling (both animals and men), fist fighting? Abundance for any taste. We have an underwater city, a city of heaven, a city on top of a mountain and tons of secret passages and caves. <br /> <br /> Effects of hokey? Huge quantities The city of the sky is supported by radio furnaces fueled like old-time steam ships. The missiles are "powered" by fireworks and have constant flashbacks and / or buzzing noises. Many threads are visible that hold things (like food when Flash was invisible and, of course, missiles). There are clouds in space, but none around the earth when viewed from Mongo. The "giant" lizards appear briefly. Presumably fighting sea creatures threaten Flash & co. on the way to the underwater city of shark men. The "gadgets" in Dr. Zarkov's laboratory disgust me. And they seem to be the same, regardless of the lab they work in (he worked in the Ming lab and in Vultan's). And yes, we have a love story. Everyone wants Dale; Ming, Vultan, Flash. But at least one person wanted Princess Aura (Prince Baron) not just the person she would have preferred. In fact, it seems that many of the secondary plots involve the intrigue by Princess Aura to try to win Flash. <br /> <br /> I think the characters are fantastic. That fat, laughing on horseback, King Vultan was exhilarating. The way he handled those wings was pure mastery. And Ming! What can I say about Ming? It was perfect. They should have had it for the emperor in Starwars. Ming must be my favorite character in this serial. Princess Aura was also a rather small character. And he pulled it off well. I think you have been a better actress than Dale Arden for a long time. Even the sneaky priest played a special role. Zarkov was good, but not the strongest character --- and he always stopped in the background during the fight scenes with Dale. Now let's get to Flash: Flash, of course, was the strong point, the leader, the hero --- and he did it well. Crabbe is a good actor and this role makes him perfect. <br /> <br /> After seeing this, I think I know where George Lucas got the main idea of ​​Starwars. Look at this, you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> If you've ever considered watching an old serial (or any serial for that matter), this should be your first choice. The only reason I didn't give this to 10 is because of some history holes that could have been easily fixed, the way the giant lizards seemed to be stuck in there and a couple of weak characters (king of shark men and king of lion-man).
