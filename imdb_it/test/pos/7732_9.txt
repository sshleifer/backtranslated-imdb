Just lovable. Is long. No climax. Don't wait for something to happen. Great for a rainy day. About a middle aged man who brings his family to a secluded part of the Greek islands. I saw him in my adolescence and I still love him more than 20 years later. However, I couldn't find it in video stores. Molly Ringwald is a pretty and pretty teenager who basically wants to go home and then settle in the place. There are no telephones, no TV, boredom, which when struck by such tranquility, the human condition must be bored and therefore reflect. And every character does it. Susan Sarandon plays a beautiful woman who wants to be sexually involved in the character of John Cassavetes, but is unable, well, you know. Gina Rowlands, is the wife who loves him but is about to give up their marriage. It's demanding and frustrating for everyone. There is another character in the film, a Greek who speaks inappropriately about Molly Ringwald about sex, but about things she is curious about. But he is irritating and horny and I didn't like this character. The setting of the film is what makes this film so beautiful. It would not work if turned elsewhere. I recommend this movie and give it a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.
