I believe John Houston's "The Dead" is a true classic. Not only was it the last Houston film, he said that "everything I know about the making of the film is in this movie". The story, closely adapted by James Joyce's "Dubliners", is a great ensemble that presents extraordinary interpretations of Angelica Houston, daughter of John and a cast of British and Irish actors who bring the story to life. This is a film that should be part of every serious collection, not only because it is visually elegant, but because the story is timeless and very attractive. The film is not rushed, nor is it loaded with action. Rather, the plot takes place within the characters, which bring light and meaning to the dialogue. The end of the film is astonishing, poetic and disturbing. I recommend "The Dead" without reservation as one of the best films ever made.
