This is one of those games where you love or hate it. Even if you are a huge Mario fan, you may not like this game. You can hate him because he is short and a bit boring and easy. Or you can love because it's a mixture of amazing graphics (not a great Nintendo enthusiasm) music or game. I know a lot of people who say it's incredible, and others who think it's the worst Mario ever. It really depends on the type of Nintendo fans. I personally love this game and I think it's the best Wii game, but you should determine it yourself. So, you should definitely get it if you're the right Nintendo fan. But if you love The classics too much, you might not like them. Try it yourself.
