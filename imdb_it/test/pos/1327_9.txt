I heard that after the first Oceans movie, the sequels start going downhill. I believe this is not the case (at least not for this film). This film is even better than the first movie! The original crew returns three years after successfully stealing Terry Benedict's casinos. Now, Benedict is visiting each of them personally telling them to get the money back within two weeks. To do this, they have to do a couple of robberies in Europe to get the money. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good. The cast of all the stars has exceeded expectations. Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones were probably the best in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are some confusing moments in this movie. But it doesn't matter because there are only a few confusing moments. However, this film is made only for harmless fun. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great robbery film. I consider this film 9/10.
