I loved it. Others have revealed spoilers, but I will not. It was an unusual premise, actually a bit strange, but I completely agreed. Camille was a difficult part to convince convincingly; maybe that's why some people hated him. But I think Sienna was excellent and her acting skills allowed her to nail the part perfectly - without being malicious or ridiculous. I don't know why she was interested in a loser like James Franco, but she married him anyway. I like acting, and I also think he did a fantastic job. He has nothing to be ashamed of. There have been films with similar configurations, eg "Ghost". I simply love Sienna Miller and got along with the situation as written in the script. I feel that his great acting talent is very underestimated, and I hope he becomes more recognized by the public. I thought all the actors played their parts very well, and I hope more people can see the movie. I highly recommend it. I was surprised that my local Block Buster shop had about 10 copies. I definitely intend to buy it.
