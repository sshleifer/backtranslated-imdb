One of the biggest French hits of the year 2002, "l'auberge espagnole" was also very well received abroad, which is quite extraordinary for a French film. It is not difficult to define the reasons for this success. This film made by one of the most interesting French filmmakers in recent years, Cédric Klapisch, presents students from all over Europe and gathered under one roof in Barcelona. These students are described as those you imagine or see in everyday life: either messy, or serious or with a sense of humor. I imagine that if the film worked so well, it is because many students must have recognized themselves in the portraits of the protagonists and in particular in those of Xavier. We follow the film and so his experience abroad as an Erasmus Student through his eyes. Xavier is really a normal student with his qualities, his flaws. An intelligent creation with many brilliant ideas perfectly expresses its lost mind and its anxiety for the world and for being an Erasmus student. On this topic, the best examples can be found in two sequences. The first is when Xavier asks a woman at the university for the documents he has to send to prepare his DEA. When the same woman informs him of the various necessary procedures, all the documents appear on the screen when he names them! In the next sequence, Xavier's voiceover confides to the viewer his vision of the modern world. Now where to find the second example? Well, the scene where Xavier has a thorough medical examination during which Klapisch films his visions is largely enough to talk about himself. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the director was not very interested in the studies of his protagonist. He left this low-key point. Rather, he made a lot of effort in Xavier's private life, of course, in his love affair with Anne Sophie but also and above all in his dealings with his tenants. It is a true story of friendship that Klapisch shows us with his moments of happiness but also his arguments and his tensions. Through the adventure of Xavier and at the end of his stay, he will have been initiated into life that will make him more mature. The message that the author wanted to convey is not difficult to guess. You naively believe in living in a messy and complicated world. You don't have to give up but try hard to get what you want even if it's difficult. <br /> <br /> Besides this, we might also fear that with the argument, Cédric Klapisch would not avoid a trap: clichés. Let's be honest: they are included in the script, but the director does his best not to spread them too much in his film. Then, the script contains comfortable and predictable moments: at the airport and before boarding we see Xavier shedding a tear after leaving his family. But fortunately the defects in the script stop there. Amusing dialogues and young actors perfectly in their roles constitute the whole. <br /> <br /> Despite its weaknesses, "l'auberge espagnole" must be taken for a success in the film of young people. Moreover, the whole atmosphere that brings out us makes us think that this film is directed mainly to a young audience. Ultimately, the end of the film and its great success suggest that Klapisch has succumbed to a fashion that is good for American cinema: the development of sequels. And in fact, the filmmaker currently works on a sequel called "les poupées russes". We hope it is as good as the "auberge espagnole".
