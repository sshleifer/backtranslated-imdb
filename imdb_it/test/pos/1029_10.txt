Incredibly well made mini series. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing most of it twice when it was shown on American Playhouse on PBS. It was heavily publicized at the time. I believe it may have been one of the first miniseries showing PBS outside the Masterpiece Theater series. <br /> <br /> The entire production was shown that I believe only once during its first transmission. It was 6-8 hours in total. This length was changed slightly to 6 hours. Cut some interesting but slow scenes. <br /> <br /> I really hope that the people who own their current rights follow and restore a complete, unmodified version on DVD. It is not worth creating a VHS version at this point. <br /> <br /> It would fit very well in the miniseries or in the dramatic genre of the story.
