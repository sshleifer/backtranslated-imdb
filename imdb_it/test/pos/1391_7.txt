Looking at this strange little adventure film, it's hard to believe that it was directed by the same man who brought us high quality yellow classics like Mrs Wardh's The Strange Vice and The Case of the Scorpion's Tail, but it must be said that despite it is a low quality production value, Island of the Fish Men is a fun ride and one that certainly deserves more praise than it is getting. Like many Italian films of the seventies, this is one of those of a successful American film, the one in question this time is the island of dr. Moreau. Sergio Martino's film takes ideas like mutation, greed and adventure and shapes it into a film that is a bit compelling, which compensates for what lacks coherence and logic with a load of mostly intriguing ideas. The central plot follows a boat that crashes on a small island. It soon becomes evident that not everything in this place is normal, and soon it transpires that half of the population has been transformed into "fishmen" - a cross between a man and a fish, which exist for purely selfish reasons ... <br / > <br /> The truth about this film is that it's a lot more fun if you ignore poor production values. The central monsters seem completely ridiculous, and much of the film takes place on sets that seem to cost someone a few cents - but the film is well shot despite this, with underwater photography being a particular highlight and the rhythm of the film is well done because the film never gets boring. The way the story comes together isn't exactly brilliant, but it takes a lot of ideas and I've seen films made on plots with fewer thoughts placed by them than this. The biggest location in the film is definitely the lost city of Atlantis. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of adventure films, so I don't see this lost city being mentioned much - but it's always nice to see it in a movie. The central position of the island is good as it provides a suitable setting for the story and also provides the film with the right amount of mystery, given that Martino makes good use of the voodoo theme. Overall, this is not exactly a classic and there are surely bad adventure films that are far worse than this.
