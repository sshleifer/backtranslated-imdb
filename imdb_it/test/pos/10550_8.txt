This is a funny movie, there is not a lot of it. OK, the plot is a bit scary, but very original. A teenager trying to stay with dad, because he has never been around and almost sent him to prison because he was lying to impress an older guy, how could it not be funny? It is also not the typical movie with teenagers. The first remake I saw is better than the original, the only problem with both: Gerard Depardieu. With another actor this would be a perfect 10, because it plays all the rolls the same way, it sucks. Another problem is that all women are melting on him, he is not remotely credible, he is not attractive !, he had a rubber troll that was more beautiful than him, come on!
