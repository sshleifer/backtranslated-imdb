This show is a show that is great for adults and children to sit together and watch. Stories are a bit slow for adults, but they are still good. There are lots of kids in my family, boys and girls, and it's hard to convince them all of what to watch, but I always agree when they want to see the Mystic Knights. It's a wonderful show and I hope they will continue to do so. All the children in my family and I think that Vincent Walsh is the best of all. We have seen that you have done many other jobs and think you are doing a great job. We wish all the actors, actresses, writers, directors and producers good luck and I would just like to continue doing the good work.
