I don't know where to start writing about this jewel, except to say that it represents the young Buster Keaton at the height of his powers and must certainly classify himself with the half dozen of the best short comedies ever made. THE GOAT is composed of twenty minutes of skillful gags, carefully photographed and beautifully executed; two rolls of non-stop comic invention guided by an unmistakable subterranean current of paranoia and somehow leading to a happy ending - which was not always the way with Buster's comedies. (See COPS for a case in which fatalism eventually got the better of him, or ONE WEEK for the victory of defeatism.) If I had to describe this film in one word I'd call it "effortless", but if I were allowed two I would call it "apparently without effort", because surely a lot of hard work is dedicated to the realization of any comic opera that takes place with such sublime ease. Still, they didn't call it the Big Face of Stone at all: Buster never let the public see him sweating. <br /> <br /> A sardonic card tells us that our opening sequence is set "along Millionaires Row," that is on a line of bread in a dark urban context, where Buster patiently waits for the back of the line and, of consequently, it is not powered. But it must be emphasized that for a moment he does not play for pathos; Buster has our sympathy, but he never asks. In a short time, through a series of accidents, coincidences and absurd misunderstandings, Buster is believed to be a escaped killer named Dead Shot Dan and is chased by every policeman for miles around, yet while he is clearly dismayed by this round of events there is never a hint of self-pity or surprise; we have the feeling that he has always known that this is what life would have in store for him, and that he has no time to feel sorry anyway, he has to find new ways to dodge those cops and escape from the last trap. Just like Buster refrains from playing out of sympathy never seems to strain too much for laughter, which is particularly impressive because THE GOAT must be one of the most ridiculous short comedies in existence. This is the film that presents the iconic shot of Buster that rides the wandering of a train right up to the camera lens, which is not exactly a gag but is causing a laugh in its own way. Meanwhile, there are gags involving guns, dogs, cops, incredibly hairy mustaches and a clay statue of a horse that melts under the weight of Buster (a surreal sight indeed), but some of the larger boffos are saved for the finale when Buster is trying to evade his primary nemesis, Big Joe Roberts, a smart cop who is also the father of the protagonist Virginia Fox. Trapped in Big Joe's dining room, Buster jumps over frogs and sails across a bar, turns a phone booth into an elevator and pretends to disappear, and eventually uses the elevator itself to get rid of his pursuer and win the girl in time for a last fade-out gag. <br /> <br /> Saying another would be a disservice to viewers for the first time. I just wish I could see this movie in a theater full of people who had never seen it before, and float on laughter. Even live musical accompaniment would be nice; and incidentally the musical score provided by Kino for their home video / DVD version of THE GOAT is top notch and serves as the icing on an already tasty cake.
