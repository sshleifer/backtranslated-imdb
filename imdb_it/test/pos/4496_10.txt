OK, I didn't read the book ???? And maybe the book was better ????. WHO KNOWS ??? // But I loved the movie. It was fun, not a little boring, pleasant and above all heartbreaking. The friendship between the two children was so pure and innocent. These children have done so well, especially the son of the Servant. Oh my God is like the form of GOD on the face of the EARTH. ARGHHHH steals our hearts so easily. ********* Spoilers ************* The other Friend the rich is a Kid and his confusion and frustration can be understood. BUT I got angry when he left and ignored his friend when he needed consolation. However he was just a little boy and a bit stubborn. I wish the film would also show the previous version of the poor boy. Arghh just ached to think about the ending. This film is sad. I felt terribly sad during the finale. Tears fell down my eyes. Yes, the scores in the background are fantastic, the scenes are WOW. Kite scenes are fascinating. And well, there's a bit of adventure in the middle. Wonderfully recited and superbly cast. The children played so well. GREAT direction. I don't know why this movie failed to WOOO the critics. But surely WOO made me. 10/10 Must-See ??????
