Two years later "Aereo!" took off, Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker wrote one of his stars - Leslie Nielsen - in this hilarious television series, a glorious take-off of old US detective shows like "Dragnet". Nielsen played Frank Drebin, the American response to "Inspector Clouseau". He had the same style of humor as "Airplane!"; intelligent visual gags in the background, unnoticed absurdities and recurring characters like Johnny, the shoe boy who seems to know everything about everything. Guest-stars (including William Shatner!) Were killed in the opening credits. 'Police Squad' was the first US sitcom from "Batman" to miss a laugh. Many have complained that only six episodes have been made, but I think it was right. The concept could never have supported a full 24-episode run. Five years later, "Police Squad" was successfully transferred to the big screen when the first "Naked Gun" trilogy was released. Jim, Jerry, David and Leslie had the last laugh.
