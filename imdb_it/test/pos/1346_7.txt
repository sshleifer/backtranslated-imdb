I saw him last night in Fort Lauderdale. In general it was fun and I liked the characters in particular Sabrina. The acting is good and the plot is ok except for the ending that dangled many strings and we were like (what?) I wanted to know what happened to the characters and it was a strange ending that could have been done so much better. <br /> <br /> The film was the rule of life very well and we laughed everywhere. He has flaws, that's for sure, but for the first time for Ash Christian I thought he was good. You may want to wait for the DVD on this. But if you have the chance to see it, give it a try
