I happened to read all the manga published by Junji Ito in English. I saw Tomie's movie and it was a big bunch of smoking crap. EQUAL, Uzumaki does justice to the manga. I think those who have read the manga will really appreciate this movie, since many screenshots and camera angles are exactly like in manga and it is interesting to see how the characters in the book are interpreted in the film. This film reminds me of the strange Indian. The ending differs from the manga, which I expected. Kirie looks like her manga counterpart, and her male friend fits the whole thing very well. Very scary, I have to admit, this movie looks like a feverish nightmare, the kind you have when you were a kid. Not scary at all, but crazy, if you understand my direction? Another great horror from Japan, get a copy.
