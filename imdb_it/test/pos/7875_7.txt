Imagine that episode of "Dragnet" in which Fridays and Gannon enter a typical 1970s den of iniquity hippie, but instead of giving a lesson to everyone, they "take some". This is "Joe" in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> This film of a working-class bigot and a rich guy who just killed his fianc√©'s girlfriend is terribly dated and most of the acting is crazy, but it's still interesting to watch. Peter Boyle, then about 35, plays Joe (the bigot) and looks like James Gandolfini. In her film debut, Susan Sarandon plays the fawn-eyed daughter and, although she doesn't necessarily indicate her future greatness, you can't take your eyes off her.
