I love this movie as much as anyone who loves to see whatever they saw when they were young. it was one of those movies that Home Box Office showed every other day during my youth. this film is forever lodged in my brain. For someone who didn't grow up in this movie, you may have been spoiled by the ADD cycle we've been in since the mid-1990s and may find it more difficult to appreciate this gem. this is cool, since my little sister was drugged on "better dead" before I saw this (of which I raped and loved) - and nobody, NO ONE can deny the embrace of childish humor in American cinema in the 80 - this gave rise to everything we found boring in teen comedies ... because with all the excessive use of slow-mo, the current soundtrack, the new technology. I wonder if the cinema will return to these roots ... THIS IS the adolescent comedy ... YES!
