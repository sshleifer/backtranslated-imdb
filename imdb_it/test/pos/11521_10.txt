I must say that this film has had a great cast, location, music and work with the camera. Cameron Diaz was fantastic, she had a very exciting roller, very lively, while Jordana Brewster played an important role but still caught one. for me Jordana is very nostalgic, she remembers one of my classmates! what really struck me in this film was the cleverly planned camera work and the choice of locations. the story is very talented written. it is a must see. Those who are in the yellow movies should watch this, I guarantee you everything that will keep you in your seats until the end.
