I was struck by how the acting was in everything. William Haines had a acting that is wonderful for silent films. Not over the limit. There are times when the camera works excellently and combined with the story, like when it's waiting to see the superintendent, very well done. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br />
