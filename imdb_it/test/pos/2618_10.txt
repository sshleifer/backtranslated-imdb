just the scene of the hospital with Holly and Shannon was made brilliantly begins with Piper On A stretcher that seems seriously injured, the doctors make her run into a recovery room and move her from the stretcher to a bed and Prue holds your hand by that point about it is obvious that Piper is having a lot of trouble breathing and that her lungs are failing, as she turns to implore Prue not to leave her side and let it go "I don't love you and then her wrist goes down and she enters cardiac arrest and the monitor shows a clear flat line and the nurses go into full trauma and wear a defibrillator Prue steps back from the horrified bed while the doctors desperately try to shock his dying heart but there is no answer and she is tragically pronounced very well scene big scene girls well done
