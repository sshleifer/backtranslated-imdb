Throughout the world the unmistakable imprint of the C.I.A. can be found in many confused confusions that they left behind. At first, their goals were simple: to spy, remove enemy agents, steal classified information and destabilize unfavorable governments. The years go by and although their mission remains similar, their clandestine black operations now include domestic espionage, discrediting US citizens and infiltration of American organizations that criticize the US government. This film, however, focuses on the C.I.A. for the infamous "Carlos, the Jackel". The film is called "The Assignment" and tells the story of Lieutenant Cmdr. Annibal Ramirez, (Aidan Quinn), a US naval officer who bears a striking resemblance to the mind of so many terrorist attacks. Recruited by Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland) of the C.I.A. and Amos (Ben Kingsley), special agent of the Israeli Mosad, Ramirez is secretly trained to watch, pose, infiltrate the elusive organization and subsequently discredit the real Jackel who works for the Russians. This film is extremely exciting and full of wild chases, killings and unrest among countries. Quinn is wonderful and surprisingly artistic that plays both sides of the war. Easily one of his best efforts. ****
