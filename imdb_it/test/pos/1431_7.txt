But rather dated today. Otto Preminger made this film without the necessary approval certificate. It was enormously brave and risky how he could have lost his investment and the future. <br /> <br /> The film is not faithful to the wonderful book and is unfortunately hollywoodized. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra (and I've never been a fan) played Frankie Machine, it's surprising in his performance. They forget that it's Frank up there, the level of realism that leads to the role of a Jones addict must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak, eternally beautiful and talented, does not disappoint the role of the devoted outsider, always there for Frankie. <br /> <br /> The support roles, particularly Darrin Mc Gavin, young, handsome and talented, are impeccable. <br /> <br /> Eleanor Parker, playing Frankie wife, is hopelessly inept. It oscillates from the irritating to the melodramatic and is too over the top. A performance to forget. <br /> <br /> The stages, the economic settings are appalling, as if a gust of wind were blowing on the entire painted cardboard in bad taste. Almost laughable at times in their bad economy. <br /> <br /> The music has been irritating, sometimes so violently. As if every nuance of the script (example: when Louie is bringing Frankie to fix it from a drawer) had to be underlined at a high decibel level. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10. Sinatra really deserved his Oscar nomination. Worth seeing.
