I saw The Reader at Sugar, which is not an optimal place to display anything, and the film was by far the highlight of the evening. The technical elements were well structured and it was obvious that Duncan Rogers had chosen his designers and his team well. But it was the story and the delivery that really made this short shine. Duncan Rogers' rigid script was just what he needed tonight's "short films". He didn't meander, as they made several offers, or preached to us. The Reader was a simple narrative in its best form, well played by Rogers and beautifully performed. Duncan Rogers is obviously a director with the ability to put all the pieces together, I can't wait for his next finished project. K.
