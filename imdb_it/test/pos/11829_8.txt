Interesting story and comprehensive treatment of racial discrimination, Son of the Gods is quite long and contains a bit of acting, but overall it remains a fascinating film. <br /> <br /> Story of a Chinese passing as White (Rchard Barthelmess) begins when Barthelmess leaves college after being insulted by a trio of mindless peers. He embarks on a world tour to discover himself and ends up as secretary of a British playwright (Claude King). In Montecarlo he meets the beautiful Alanna Wagner (Constance Bennett) and they fall in love. But when he discovers he is Chinese, he goes crazy in a memorable scene. <br /> <br /> Afflicted by guilt and love, Alanna enters a mental spiral and makes some attempts to contact Barthelmess. After his father dies, he takes over the business (banking?) And wears Chinese clothes as a symbol of his hatred of the white race that rejected him. After a San Francisco detective told him the truth about his birth, Barthelmess makes the decision to honor his Chinese father and mother. <br /> <br /> And I agree that a reviewer here has never seen this movie. Alanna declares her love for Sam BEFORE he tells her about her recent discovery. And this makes the difference in this film. <br /> <br /> Barthelmess and Bennett each have some scenes in which they chew the scenery, but overall this is a solid and interesting drama. Frank Albertson is a good college friend, Claude King is as solid as the playwright Bathurst, Bess Flowers has a scene like an Indian from Oklahoma, and E. Alyn Warren is the Chinese father, Dorothy Mathews is a bad Alice. Not so good are Anders Randolf as Bennett's father and Mildred Van Dorn as Eileen. Also note the gorgeous blonde to the right of Barthelmess at the roulette table. How disgusting whoever she was!
