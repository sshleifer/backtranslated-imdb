I am stunned by the fact that a director famous for his left-wing political fervor can make such a subtle and not hypocritical picture. If you are for capital punishment, you will still be after seeing it. If you are against the death penalty, you will still be against it. But whatever your position, this film, at least, will make you think about why you feel like you. There is not a single false note in the film.
