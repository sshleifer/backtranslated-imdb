George Barry is a genius. "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is a prototype for much of the "slipstream" narrative and surrealism of the field which is now so chic. Truly innovative, non-conformist, and simply brilliant. Hyper-strange atmosphere, subtly nightmare atmosphere. I recommend reading Stephen Thrower's book "Nightmare USA" (there is a chapter dedicated to Barry and "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats"). Available from FAB Press. On a related note, "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" and "Beyond Dream's Door" make a perfect double bill. Moreover, it is banal and tired - and at the end stupidly ironic - to criticize a low budget cult movie for being "badly made" or "technically inept". The aesthetics of the film B is part of the charm of these films. No amount of CGI could duplicate the cumulative effect "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" which has an advanced palate on the viewer.
