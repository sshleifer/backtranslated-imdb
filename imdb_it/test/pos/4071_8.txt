If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you know practically what to expect, because what you see here is what you get. And even if you haven't seen the previews, it won't take you long to figure out what awaits you - in particular, a good time and lots of laughs - from this clever satire of "Reality TV" show and "Buddy Cop", "Showtime", directed by Tom Dey, with Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy. <br /> <br /> Mitch Preston (De Niro) is a detective with the LAPD, and is good at what he does; but working a case one night, things suddenly go south when another policeman, Trey Sellars (Murphy), inadvertently intervenes, a television crew arrives and Mitch loses his temper, which results in a lawsuit by the television station some money is going to cost department. Except they might be able to get around it, thanks to Chase Renzi (Rene Russo), who works for the station and likes what he sees in Mitch-- enough to throw an idea at his boss for a 'Reality' cop show , who would present nothing but Mitch Preston, whom Chase sees as a real "dirty Harry". <br /> <br /> His boss loves the idea and gives Chase the go ahead. Now all he has to do is convince Mitch to participate, which shouldn't be too difficult, since the station has agreed to give up the cause if he does. But Mitch is a cop, not an actor, and he wants nothing to do with any of this - until he has a heart to heart with his boss, Captain Winship (Frankie Faison), who puts the future of Mitch in a moment perspective for him. And just like that, the show is on. Oh yes, there is another thing; for the show, Mitch will need a partner. And who do you think will come up with that? Let's put it this way: Trey Sellars is more than one of the usual suspects. <br /> <br /> This is Dey's second film as a director, his first is "Shanghai Noon," - even a comedy - and he is certainly showing a weakness for the genre. From the opening frames it establishes a rhythm that keeps the story in motion and allows its stars to make the most of their respective talents and personal strengths, including their impeccable timing. With stars like De Niro and Murphy, Dey obviously had a leg on this project to begin with, but it is he who keeps it on track, proving he knows what works, getting just the right mix of physical comedy and action, and employing the subtleties of the dialogue with great effect. <br /> <br /> There is no more natural actor in De Niro's business, and he enters Mitch's skin as if he were born for him. And after years of dramatic and sharp dramaturgy (in which he transformed one remarkable performance after another), with films like "Analyze this", "Meet the parents" and now this, he firmly established his competence for doing even the comedy . Mitch is not a particularly complex character; it is, in effect, something of a "normal" type, but here is the challenge for the actor - making it credible, making it look like the boy who could be your neighbor and just another member of the community. And on all fronts, De Niro succeeds. It's Mitch, the type you meet at the supermarket or bank, or "hello" to your way of working; who likes to watch the game on TV and has a life, just like you and me, who earns his living by being a cop. It is the character that Mitch must do to make this film work, because it makes the "ordinary boy in extraordinary circumstances" corner credible. It is one of those roles - and of work - that is often mistakenly rejected a priori, because it seems so easy; and, of course, this is what makes De Niro so exceptional - it makes it seem easy, and it does it easily. <br /> <br /> Like Trey Sellars, Eddie Murphy turns into a winning performance, well, and it's a role that fits like the proverbial glove. Trey is a policeman, but also an aspiring actor - and a bad one - and gives Murphy the opportunity to play on the exuberant side of his personality (he reigned enough from Dey, however, to keep him from soaring-top-up in the territory by Jim Carrey), which works perfectly for this character and this movie. From his melodramatic interpretation of a part during an audition, to his throwing of jokes - delivered by looking directly at the camera (which for him is not even there) during the shooting of the "reality" show - Murphy is a revolt. And he has a chemistry with De Niro that really clicks (which is not unexpected, since this is another of De Niro's many talents: his ability to connect and bring out the best from his co-stars ... support - they are better with their craft after working with him, including characters like Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken and Ed Harris, just to name a few). More importantly, this is a part that allows Murphy to excel in what it does best, and it certainly takes advantage of it. <br /> <br /> Russo is committed to doing the best even with Chase, a character who is not very artistically extensible, but who presents with pleasure, with a strong and credible performance. And William Shatner (playing himself) absolutely steals a couple of scenes as a show director. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes Drena De Niro (Annie), Pedro Damian (Vargas) and James Roday (Camera Man). Well-packaged and made, `Showtime 'is a comedy that is exactly what it is meant to be: pure entertainment that offers lots of laughs and a couple of pleasant hours that will make you giggle for a while. It's the magic of movies. 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
