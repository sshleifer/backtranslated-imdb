This is a film about music that is currently being played in Istanbul. Istanbul was the center of the two superpowers of the Old World, the Byzantine Empire and the Ottoman Empire. Today it is a megalopolis of almost 10 million. So it's not surprising that a lot of music is played in Istanbul, with a wide variety of voices, styles and influences from all over the world. It's Turkish music, of course, and I've been fascinated by Turkish music since I bought my first record a long time ago. The film features several singers, instrumentalists and groups. The comments made by the musicians pleasantly illustrate the music reproduced and the social context in modern Turkey. For my perspective, the most interesting comments were from Orhan Gencebay. Furthermore, the films show an urban scene mainly from Istanbul which is very pleasant to watch. <br /> <br /> "Crossing the Bridge" is listed as a documentary and includes minority music, eg Kurds and Roma. Other important topics are omitted, such as Turkish jazz music or the music of Armenians and Greeks. <br /> <br /> This film is strongly recommended for lovers of music and culture in Turkey, the Balkans, the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. It could also be useful for those with a strong interest in the global effects of musical styles like Rock and Roll or Hip Hop.
