Somehow, I missed many of the early Farscape episodes, so I see them in all kinds of orders as they are repeated on various channels. I took it for the first time - by pure chance - while I was relaxing in a hotel room. The first 10 seconds completely blocked me - THIS is what SF is all about. <br /> <br /> The characters are strong; and Moya / Pilot, the living ship, is what Lexx should have been. The plots vary in terms of quality, but in my opinion none falls below the optimum. And I have to mention Rygel - what a gloriously irreverent character! None of your sugar-coated Star Trek aliens is a real bargain - cynical, selfish and full of disgusting personal habits, Rygel is creating a genius. <br /> <br /> Last week the SciFi channel showed "Out of Mind" (the body swap episode). A true classic, I couldn't stop laughing from beginning to end ... <br /> <br /> Long may Farscape beautify our screens!
