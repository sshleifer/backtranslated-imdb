Taylor Hackford wanted to make this film for 15 years, and eventually found Jamie Foxx to play the lead role. Foxx is incredible in his portrait of Ray Charles. From an interview I saw with Foxx, he met Charles several times and they too played the piano together (Foxx had piano lessons as a child and actually played the piano in all his scenes). I haven't seen Charles live until his last years, so it was nice to have a perspective on how his career developed. I hope Foxx is nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor, as he certainly deserves. The music is also incredible - it really shows the breadth of Charles's music, from country to blues and everything else. The film also provides an unmistakable account of the life of Ray Charles, from the many women with whom he had dealings with his drug habit and the consequences of that.
