Most of Brigitte Bardot's films I've seen have failed to take full advantage of her eye-catching on-screen presence. Unfortunately, she was given a few really good roles in movies of undeniable quality, which was a real oversight. She deserved them and was able to demonstrate her full cinematic power when they came her way. As Genevieve in "Love on a Pillow" we had a clear exception to the tendency of light and fluffy vehicles, because it was an interesting artistic film, to any reasonable extent, and in it a 28-year-old BB was the most fascinating to her "Une Parisienne "is another, with an extremely captivating Brigitte in an interesting and well-made comedy that explores how a man of an ambitious woman can be persuaded to remain faithful to an incredibly beautiful young wife. There are many good performances here. Her playboy husband, Michel, is one, "the prince", played by Charles Boyer, is another, with amusing efforts by a good supporting cast. As for Brigitte Bardot, the way she looks in this film is the way I remember her as a child in the fifties. He was 23 years old in 1957 and long before his time, more beautiful than any other actress of the period, including Marilyn Monroe. His sinuous and flirtatious sexuality, widely exhibited in numerous tight-fitting clothes, simply seems to jump off the screen. She was more fashionable and pretty than American women today, almost fifty years later. Obsessed by their careers and still desperately clinging to feminist politics, they emerge as a group of incapable lesbians. In stark contrast, the sexual kitten was sexually liberated, intelligent and clearly independent long before it was fashionable, yet, while fully understanding the power of its exceptional femininity, she used it for a higher purpose than mere self-interest - she believed in love. A photo could not simply do justice to her. You had to watch its slim but voluptuous shape (with its 20-inch waist) slightly cross a room. You had to see that blond and wild mane, look at his big brown and seductive eyes and listen while his full and pouting lips spoke French. In a close-up at the end of this film, she winks and flirts with the camera, her beautiful spheres shine. What a doll! For fans of Brigitte Bardot, "Une Parisienne" is not to be missed.
