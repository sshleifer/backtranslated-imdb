Since I saw the trailer on the DVD of "The Little Mermaid II: Back to the Sea", I had the feeling that this movie would be great, because I'm a big Disney fan. And guess what? I'm right! This film is a worthy successor to the original classic "Lady and the Tramp". <br /> <br /> It tells the story of Scamp, the mischievous son of Scamp, Lady and Tramp, who wants to be wild and free instead of living a housedog life. Even though the film may not be as good as the first, it has a great moral that you can't find anywhere else until you look at it. <br /> <br /> I admit that the film is not for everyone, but those of you who hate it, all I can say is that you don't have a spirit for this and I suggest you never go see it again. But hey! It's really a fantastic story, full of brilliant animations, music and starred talents starring Scott Wolf (Party of Five) and Alyssa Milano (Charmed). So if you haven't seen the movie, why stay there? Go and get the copy !!!
