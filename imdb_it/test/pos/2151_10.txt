I was lucky to have seen this movie at its Seattle Film Fest screening, and was amazed at how beautiful it was. This is undoubtedly one of the best music documentaries I've ever seen (and I've seen many!) This is a loving look at life and at the times, the music and the relationships of one of the true music legends. Harry Nilsson deserves to be up there with the likes of Gershwin, Cole Porter and all the other great songwriters of 20th century standards. He was considered a peer by all four members of the Beatles, whom everyone called a 5th Beatle, and one of the same wavelength. <br /> <br /> Harry refused to do a tour, so many today do not remember him and those born after his golden age are not aware of who he was. This is tragic. Everyone should have the opportunity to be exposed to this wonderful talent. This film is a step in the right direction, to finally give the man the due. Unfortunately, the film has yet to have a wide distribution, or even a DVD, for the moment, good luck seeing it. <br /> <br /> If you are someone with the power to put together a DVD distribution deal, PLEASE contact the directors. This film must be available. Hey VH-1, how about projecting it on the air, so maybe publishing it on DVD? Harry Nilsson deserves nothing less.
