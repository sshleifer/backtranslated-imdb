My interpretation is that the term "distant" is used in the sense of the opposite of "hot"; people who are not warm towards others. The film reminds me of the Dalai Lama's teachings in "The Art of Happiness", where his main point is that the key to happiness is the connection with others. Not only are the characters in the film insular, but they are also without humor, without charm, timid, silent and hostile. These features seem to prevent them, among other things, from forming and enjoying relationships and being able to talk and deal with their problems. And consequently they are terribly unhappy. I see it as a strong confirmation of the teaching of the Dalai Lama (I am not a Buddhist, by the way). If you are one of the people who thinks their behavior is a natural response to life in a big city, then I think you may be right, but I recommend the Dalai Lama's book. City life does not have to be this way. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some people found it boring - it drags a bit in places and the characters aren't particularly nice. And it contrasts with Lost In Translation, where island characters are much more sympathetic and connect to each other even if they don't connect with people in general.
