This version of Peter Pan's 1955 Producers' Showcase musical with Mary Martin has the advantage of presenting most of the original Broadway cast, including Kathleen Nolan as Wendy, who was a more natural actress than the girl they hired for the 1960 color television game. It is a pity that most people no longer sit anything in black and white because in many respects this previous production - which does not even appear in IMDb ads when you enter "Peter Pan" in search engine! - is superior to the prettier color version that most people have seen. I got the original on disk and then worked on it to make it look and improve it digitally. Now, when I put the 1960 color version, it looks flashy in comparison. I suspect that Mary Martin herself undoubtedly preferred this original TV version in the showcase of the 1955 b / w producers. <br /> <br /> As an addition to the album, I also showed the original spots and the opening promotion. How far the 50s seem - a time so innocent compared to today. I miss.
