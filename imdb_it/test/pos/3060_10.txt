How can someone GIVE say something about BAD on this movie? Pardon Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie that gets more fun every time you watch it. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw it, I cried with such a loud laugh. Everything about it is fun. <br /> <br /> While "Robin Hood: Men In Tights" is not my favorite comedy (that place is played by "Real Genius"), it is very high in my book. So go see it! If you don't spend all your time laughing, at least you'll spend all your time drooling over Cary Elwes.
