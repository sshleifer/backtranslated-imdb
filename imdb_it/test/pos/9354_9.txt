Exceptional film that manages a large scale theme with a well-balanced direction. Dmytrik was a great director, at least from what I can tell about this movie and Murder my Sweet, but he was seriously influenced by HUAC like other directors and actors. It is somewhat ironic that Crossfire did not receive an Oscar because it is a great example of how to make a great low-budget film. Everything about this film is exceptional: a well-written script that uses large flashbacks, an exceptional cast, extraordinary lighting that seems to tell the story more than the appropriate actions. What can you expect more from a high-end movie? I can add that the noir is used here for its elegance, and I could add financial advantages. But this proves once again that what was originally considered a B-movie can have more impact today than most heavy-handed A-movies that have lost their audience over time. <br /> <br /> This film is not a film noir in itself and this raises serious questions about what noir actually is. The style is definitely noir, in terms of sets and above all of lights, but the theme goes beyond the recipe of the "genre noir". You can see things from the opposite perspective and say that anti-Semitism is just a pretext for criminal investigation, the enigma around murder is the real goal. This would have been the case had it not been for Robert Ryan in an exceptional performance. In any case, the film has a lot to offer and it is really a shame that the director had to endure so many inequities for his old beliefs in a truly "noir" period of America
