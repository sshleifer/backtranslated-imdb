A competent comedy that offers laughter for Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau fans. I imagine this film was made for those who enjoyed the two films GRUMPY OLD MEN, as there seemed to be a group of these teammates that highlighted the comic duo in their twilight years. The idea is infallible: Matthau, a clumsy player who has thousands of dollars in debt, connotes his unsuspecting friend Lemmon to take a free cruise with him where they can meet rich old ladies; the grip is, they were signed as Dance Hosts and Matthau can't dance. <br /> <br /> OUT TO SEA is a fun movie, and not all the laughs were found courtesy of Lemmon and Matthau. I found Brent Spiner (better known as Date of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION) as witty as the snobby dance coordinator who smashed the ball. As the evil leader of the two elderly actors, he manages to match them in the laughter department. Even if the film doesn't really need it, there is also a love story or two that can be found here, involving Dyan Cannon (who looks nice for his years).
