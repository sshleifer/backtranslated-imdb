Wow. I saw this movie and "Su" on the same day at an hour from each other in different theaters. I saw "Mr Bug" before, and I was totally disappointed with the follow up of "Up". What a beautiful and touching film! The films of the 30s and 40s for us today can be Irish with their melodramatic acting and their dialogue, but like animation the same melodrama and plaintive humor can be wonderful. And the soft "organic" lines of the 1930s draw And music simply puts you in a comfortable mood and you can enjoy the show with all its little characters: ladybugs, grasshoppers, bees, snails, bedbugs, flies, mosquitoes , cockroaches, crickets and more each with its small idiosyncrasies (but not overbearing). Interaction with the human world, from nemesis (cigar smokers, high-heeled carriers, innocent children playing kick-the-can) to those with kind hearts and unknown destroyers, is realistic and fascinating. You worry about insects, And Dick and Mary. The main character Hoppity is not a perfect superman who comes to "fix things well" but a starry-eyed optimist who drives everyone along the garden path (literally!), And every time you think he will happily end up in the style of the 1930s , another checkpoint arrives ...! I was on the edge of my place much more than with "Up". I came out of the cinema smiling and giggling: something that hasn't happened for a long, long, long time!
