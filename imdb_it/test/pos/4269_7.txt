Where do we go from here? this is the main question of this film. And making no mistakes, "mainly ETCs", the 2003 effort by director John Jansen, raises many more questions than it answers, but none as sharply or as powerfully as this. <br /> <br /> The film sounds like a conversation between you and your college friend, and I'm sure many of the questions asked by the main characters you'll recognize from your evenings of drunken debauchery. however, one of the many beauties of this film is that we are rarely given an answer. The questions are raised ?? everything from the mundane to the deep ?? but jansen skillfully forces his audience to examine and answer these questions ourselves, with little or no help from the characters. <br /> <br /> side 1 opens with an increasingly complex and well-orchestrated arrangement of non-linear segments to introduce us to the main characters. Do we meet them on the morning of 8 April 1994 ?? the day Kurt Cobain committed suicide. And it is the death of cobain, and the journey in his wake two days later in Seattle, which are the backdrop to the film. In exploring cobain's life, music and death, the characters attempt - with varying degrees of success - to understand and come to terms with their lives. <br /> <br /> there are some aspects of the film that are what you could expect from an independent low budget film: the performances range from decidedly mediocre to exceptional, with the strongest performances coming from jessica scott (holly) and noel wood (daniel); some of the dialogues are certainly a bit rigid, but they never move completely in the unreal; and there are some minor audio problems, particularly once we're on the road, which sometimes make it difficult to follow the action on the screen. <br /> <br /> but despite its shortcomings, "mainly ETC". it's a solid and deeply moving piece of cinema. Between moments of tormenting intensity, crackling humor and intimate turmoil, jansen cleverly weaves all the threads of the character and illuminates their struggles, making them at the same time accessible and engaging. and since we can see reflections of ourselves in one or more of these characters, we can identify with the questions and issues they are struggling with, and we can look back and remember where we were that day in 1994, when for many people the world has changed. <br /> <br /> while jansen takes credit for writing, editing and directing the film, compliments must also be given to his photography. With a disquieting eye and an incredible ability to capture and drag us into each of the character worlds, jansen was able to produce one shot after another that blocked me long after the credits were pulled. <br /> <br /> And no review of this film would be complete without a nod to the amazing soundtrack. the music in this film is used with surprising effects; sometimes subtly emphasizing the action, other times at the center of the scene, but without ever interfering or deteriorating in kitsch music videos. the soundtrack sounds like the greatest hits, although I suspect that the label will probably not sit very well with the director. <br /> <br /> the new edition of the double DVD archive offers some scenes, trailers, music videos and a deleted cobain documentary scene. the deleted scenes offer some information on the making of the film through alternate sequences of opening and closing, and it is certainly a pleasure to have the rare and beautiful Raining Kind video. the cobain documentary is fine, albeit a little worse for wear, and surely the most extensive documentaries are available for hardcore fans. a comment by the director is conspicuously absent, and I cannot help wondering if jansen intends to republish it at some point with that tasty snatch attached. <br /> <br /> suffice it to say that the next time you come I am looking for a strong job from a talented filmmaker, I suggest you get on board.
