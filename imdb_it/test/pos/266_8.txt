Inherited this from my x DVD collection when he left with my best friend (quite told), he looked at it one night when there was nothing on television (nothing new there then) and got a very pleasant surprise. Very British (you have practically no budget, no face you know or have ever seen before), the accents were a bit thick for my taste, but after a worrying start (a little too close to home in my case) it started to grow on me. Apart from the useless cut of jokey that didn't add anything, I found that the film through its exciting, realistic, natural performances left me more from an ending that came suddenly too soon. Highly recommended!
