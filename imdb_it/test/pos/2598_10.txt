If you ignore the fact that the plot was made many times, this is a funny and cheerfully funny Looney Tunes cartoon. The animation is wonderful, the backgrounds so detailed and also a lot of bold colors. The writing is razor sharp, and the view becomes particularly acute, given that Daffy, constantly, to blow his head, is brilliantly timed. I really loved the discussions between Daffy and Bugs, and Bugs wins every time. I also like that Daffy is really greedy and unpleasant despite being incredibly funny. I prefer it when it's manic, but it's also a lot of fun here. Bugs is still his charming and rascal, and Elmer is funny though rather stupid. In short, this is absolutely brilliant, and actually my favorite of the hunting trilogy for pure entertainment value. 10/10 Bethany Cox
