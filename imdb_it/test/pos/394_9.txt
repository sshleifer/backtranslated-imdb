I liked this film, which offers a variety of interesting subplots and complex relationships of hate-love, together with interspersed action scenes and carefree moments in which mountain men oppose the harsh military discipline. All the main characters are well launched. True, John Wayne or Robert Mitchum would probably have been able to play the lead role, but Victor Mature certainly comes across a sort of whimsical Tarzan type. It reminds me of his film role as Samson, another difficult but not impossible man to tame. <br /> <br /> Mountain men in the opening scene are certainly an anachronism, like the era of pure mountain trapper men ended 20 years earlier, with the collapse of western beaver populations and the fashion market for beaver furs. This story presumably takes place in Oregon just before the end of the Civil War. Judging by the volcano in the background of the opening scene (probably Mount Lassen), the imaginary fort was somewhere in a remote section of the Falls, since we never see any other civilian. However, there are many conflicting evidence that actually takes place in the mountains of Wyoming or Montana! Red Cloud, the war chief who threatens hunters and soldiers in the fort, is the namesake of a famous Sioux war leader who led a highly successful campaign in 1865-66 to exterminate the newly built army forts in the Wyoming and Montana. Fort Laramie (eastern Wyoming) is mentioned as not too far from the imaginary fort. The Assiniboines lowland tribe is quoting how to join Red Cloud. This aspect of history, therefore, has a general resemblance to the historical fact. <br /> <br /> It might be interesting to note some similarities between the plot of this story and that of "Fort Apache" by John Ford. In both cases, we have a strong commander who was recently assigned to his first border post with Native American problems. He underestimates the military ability of his opponents, considering them little more than cannon fodder to promote his career. In both films, he pays his inexperience in dealing with the enemy at a high price. Even in common, the commander of the greenhorn resents a subordinate who has a long experience with local native Americans and wants to tell him what it is wise to do and not to do. In both films, we have a budding romantic relationship between a woman very close to the commander's heart and a subordinate, whom the commander does everything to suppress. Clearly, the commander must be eliminated to allow these novels to continue until the end. <br /> <br /> I also see some similarities with "The Misfits". Soldiers as a whole, including the commander, are misfits (as one of them admits): mostly they have "problems" or are inexperienced recruits with Native Americans. The commander's wife is apparently the only woman or near this fortress, so it is inherently a misfit, with a husband who is very uncertain about his future in the army. The trappers, in turn, are also maladjusted, not really wanting to accept the army or civil discipline, cut off from their previous lives of spirit free from the recent red cloud-generated antagonism of the army. <br /> <br /> Finally, we can also compare this story with Anthony Mann's next film "The Far Country", starring Jimmy Stewart. chance, he can choose to go back to being a lonely cowboy at the end. But the Mathematics character doesn't have a new appetizing way of being his boss. Red Cloud has made life outside the army in this region too dangerous to contemplate. Furthermore, he has an obsession for the commander is the wife
