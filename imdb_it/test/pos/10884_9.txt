What can you say about one of the greatest N64 games ever? That the action is fast enough to literally hold even the sweaty abacus and FPS veterans? That the graphics are fantastic, up to the explosions that everyone loves to see? That nothing is as fun as playing in multiplayer mode and shooting your friends and siblings in the back with submachine guns? <br /> <br /> Very little beats Goldeneye 007. The only thing missing was the vocal recitation, and a little more intelligence in the enemy soldiers. If you have an N64 and like to shoot people and things crossed with espionage, take a copy of this.
