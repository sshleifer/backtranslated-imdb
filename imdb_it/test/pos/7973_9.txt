This is definitely one of the best western movies produced in the new millennium. It is a tribute to all the stars of the great classics of Western TV, and is the last revival of the western film. The story of two brothers who meet after the war between the United States and end up on different sides of the law is not new, but still interesting, and the clashes and atmosphere are great. There is a certain graphic violence as the bad guys who are killed in pieces with an ax or the women are killed in cold blood, and Lee Majors does not take part in the action until the end, that's why I gave 9 points out of 10. But it's still one of the best new western productions I've ever seen. I had the honor and pleasure of meeting Chris McIntyre at the Festival of the West and having a good talk with him, and I had the opportunity to meet Buck Taylor who plays the role of city doctor. In my opinion, we should be very grateful to Chris McIntyre for his efforts in bringing together many of the classic TV western and SASS stars that surround him to perform in a new western like this. Chris has an exceptional talent for choosing the right actors even for the main characters. Both are young and promising, and I think we should see more in future Western productions. I genuinely enjoyed this western movie - it was worth every minute. I hope that Chris McIntyre will continue to work on other western films and introduce us to other great productions like this one. Great job, Chris! Jasper P. Morgan (Pete)
