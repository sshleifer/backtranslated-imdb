The short film that got Gaspar Noe on the film's map, introducing us to his horrible, but absolutely interesting character, The Butcher, brilliantly played by Phillipe Nahon. Noe's management here has all the distinctive features of his later films, showing that he was recording his own voice and style from the start. His sudden cut along with the hard and noisy noise, the leaping flashbacks and many other techniques are all used to baffle the viewer. And it certainly works. Furthermore, he is not afraid to show violence, as the viewers of Irreversible will know. Here violence is equally powerful, and in the sequel Seoul Contre Tous, it is almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a killed horse. He is shot in the head, and we watch him wriggle on the floor, his puddle of blood flowing. We therefore see a human birth in all its glory, the butcher's daughter. He was orphaned in World War II and grew up hating the world, and everyone and everything. He serves his clients, but his inner monologue constantly reminds us of his thoughts: he wants them all dead. His daughter Blandine Lenoir, who will resume her role six years later, is the only thing that matters and we see them grow old together. She is still dumb, and bullied and toying. The Butcher's relationship with her is almost incestuous, the wet when she is old enough to do it alone, etc., but this is explored more in the next film. When attacked by a man, the Butcher explodes with anger, stabbing an innocent man in the mouth. He goes to prison, taken from the only things he wants: his shop and his daughter. In the short 40 minutes we see all this and more, his time in prison and release into his world. Because of her daughter's condition, I also believe she is autistic, she is insipid, does little except gaze, and is under her father's full control. The film continues in the exceptionally dingy Seoul Contre Tous. If you can, watch these two films first. It has a really excellent acting, but it is very difficult to watch due to the relentless tone. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
