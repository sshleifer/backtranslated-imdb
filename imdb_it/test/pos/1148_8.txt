<br /> <br /> Average adventure film that has taken a serious story and "Holywoodised" it. The watered-down effect, particularly in relation to the average script, has taken the place of this film as a solid classic. Why break down such a big plot? Probably because it deals with "sensitive" colonial matters and the producers don't want to create political warmth, just fast profits thanks. The direction, the cinematography, the soundtrack and the acting were good. Connery's charm compensated for his wrong Arabic accent and all the scenes with President T. Roosevelt were masterpieces. The costumes / sets here were very good. Unfortunately we have not had a serious historical drama since this is what the story requires. Only for the big fans of the main actors or fans of the exotic movies of Romance / Adventure Holywood .....
