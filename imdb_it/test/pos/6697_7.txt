A mixture of Alien and Ghost Busters? <br /> <br /> It starts very promising, then slows down to become almost boring. <br /> <br /> LifeForce contains some fantastic special effects that they were able to produce in the mid-80s. The story is intriguing, but eventually becomes rather lackluster. He was rated R because of nudity, sex and blood. The ethereal and wild beauty (naked) of Mathilda May is very evident throughout the film. A bizarre film and it cost a lot when it was made. <br /> <br /> This could be a bigger classic with a better script, but unfortunately it wasn't a big hit, I think it actually fell pretty bad. <br /> <br /> So something went wrong with this, but still, it's very funny.
