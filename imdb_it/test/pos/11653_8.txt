This is the most human and human of the films I've seen in a long time. Ironies abound, Susan Sarandon as a nun, Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon in a film that does not preach but does not condemn. It is true cinematic at its best, yet the story is fictionalized by several real events. <br /> <br /> Which of the two is more surprising, Sarandon or Penn? It is easy to say who is more likeable, but it is difficult to say who is more convincing. they are simply magnificent. <br /> <br /> You might think that all the killers should be killed or you could argue that life without words is not life and that death is more merciful. whatever your personal feeling, this film gives you the chance to pause and reconsider. <br /> <br /> In the end we simply want to sit in silence and reflect. This is what the great drama does, gives catharsis, creates a moment in time, a shared memory that touches our humanity.
