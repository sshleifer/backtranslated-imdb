This was the best film I've ever seen on "Germen's Cine Club" (Buenos Aires). This film is a realistic critic of the society of the past and of the next century. Makes a great impression on all the partners of "Germen's Cine Club". I recommend this film to all Troma fans and to all the people who like good films, not commercial films.
