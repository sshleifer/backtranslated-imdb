Now I myself had already seen some episodes of the Leauge Of Gentleman that I found funny. When I brought the film I wasn't sure if I knew enough about the series to get it, boy was I wrong. This is one of the best comedy movies I've ever seen and the clever acting of the Leauge makes the film. It has a very good and funny plot and the use of a few characters at any time helps because it doesn't make the fact that it would have destroyed the film too confusing. Even if you've never seen The Leauge Of Gentleman get this movie it will make you laugh and this is a movie that can be seen more than once and is an excellent movie to watch with your friends. It really deserves to review a precise 10 out of 10.
