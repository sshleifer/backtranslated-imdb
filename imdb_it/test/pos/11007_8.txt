_Saltmen_ is a long film for its genre, and very often the rhythm is much slower than that expected by the western public. That said, I really enjoyed both in terms of interesting topics and the magnificent images contained in this film. Some scenarios are truly breathtaking, and there is enough interest that most should be able to survive _Saltmen_ with the minimum use of fast-forward. <br /> <br />
