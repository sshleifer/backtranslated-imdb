This movie is really cool. I do not know why. I always have a weakness for Damian Chapa. It's not Scarface, but I really enjoyed it. This is a film I can watch over ten times. Really try to make a good movie, but can't do it. I feel sorry for him, so maybe it's a bit of a sympathy vote. I can't help it, but I can't give it less than 9 stars. Everyone should have seen it once in a lifetime. To see how to make a cheap film works. I live in the Netherlands and bought this film for just one euro! That's 1.50 dollars. I would have even bought for ten euros. Great Great Great. In a small Dutch film this film gets 101 votes. Here only a 260. This is not much more. So people all over the world. Buy this movie!
