I'm slowly going through as many Hong Kong action movies as I can get my hands on this jewel, mainly thanks to Ching Wan Lau, who is one of my favorite actors. <br /> <br /> It is a great action movie although not OTT as the title might suggest. It moves at an exceptional pace and is really fun. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise of this film was the soundtrack. It would seem that Rob Dougan - the guy who made the song "Clubbed To Death", which was popular in "The Matrix", raised the soundtrack from Big Bullet and compiled it into one of the tracks on his album "Furious Angels" ; the song in question is called "I'm not driving anymore" and it's also the opening theme of the TV series "Law and Order" And the opening track of the teaser of the DVD menu "Matrix Reloaded"! This really surprised me, because of pure coincidence!
