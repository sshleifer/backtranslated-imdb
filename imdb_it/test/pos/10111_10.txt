The recent history of Hollywood remakes of horror / ghost movies from the east has been sad. This film will inevitably suffer the same fate, so take a copy on e-bay or similar. <br /> <br /> It is well photographed and the sound is superb. It is recommended to display on a good screen and with a good 5.1 or DTS enabled audio system. Obviously it's subtitled, so if this puts you off, then I wouldn't worry about it. Dubbing rarely works and simply wouldn't do it here. <br /> <br /> It's also really scary, with excellent performances from a cast that won't know the western audience. In particular, I would select the character of the stepmother, who was absolutely brilliant. The ending will want to see it again, if you can do it. The plot is relentless and does not offer comforting moments of release along the way. <br /> <br /> If I have a small criticism, there is perhaps a detectable influence in certain scenes of the Japanese version of The Ring. However, for years we have accepted faithful copies of other people's ideas for Western films, so my point is limited and it hasn't stopped me giving it 10/10. I believe that most fans of this genre will derive from this film a huge "pleasure" that, for a single hope, is a classic.
