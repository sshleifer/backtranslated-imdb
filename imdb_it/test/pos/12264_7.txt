James L. Brook is one of those directors who always seems to give a bizarre look to life. He's not just the producer of "The Simpsons", he has some classic comedies under his belt - "Broadcast News" is one of them. <br /> <br /> Although it does not correspond to his subsequent effort "" Good News "," Broadcast News "is still a very intelligent, funny and witty film about a television station and all the problems that suffer from it. is a great comic comic humor sequence in which Joan Cusack goes around the building trying to send a news bulletin to the editing room in a matter of minutes before it is broadcast live on TV. <br /> <br /> This does not it's just very true in terms of how hectic broadcast stations are managed, but also a skilful and honest portrayal of human beings. <br /> <br /> A thin and thin film with good acting (especially by Hurt, a who doesn't always like it so much) and the right direction.
