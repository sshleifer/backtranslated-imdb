I once knew that Donald Sutherland, (Jack Shaw / Henry Fields) appeared in this film, he immediately told me it would be a good image to see. Most of Sutherland's images are full of action and suspense and can play a rather cruel character and can also be quite charming and kind. In this photo, Jack Shaw did his best to be a good boy and a villain while he was training a naval office to become a spy who had to change his entire identity and become a different person during the night. There are lots of car chase scenes and lots of stunt situations that I wouldn't want to show. This naval officer lived in a quiet community with his wife and was a father, but you would never realize it until the film reveals its horrible background secrets that you had to keep away from your family and friends. Great espionage film and great acting of all the actors.
