The main point of the film, IMO, is the fact that Joanna's entire life was nothing but a series of facades. The film opens with her secretly dying her gray roots and hiding the used kit in an empty paper box. The strange thing is that she is hiding this from her HUSBAND. If he has to hide trivial things from his beloved, you can bet that he hides even bigger things from other people involved in his life. <br /> <br /> When Joanna accidentally hits Cory, she leaves the scene to call the police. When he returns, the police and ambulance are there, as are the people in his community, stressing "What kind of person hits a child and then leaves it there?" Well respected in his community, he decides to keep quiet about what he did. But he never realized how hard it would be to keep his facades ... <br /> <br /> Great movie, I've seen it many times!
