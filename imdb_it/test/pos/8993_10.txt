I wonder how anyone could diss for this movie. It is based on a real story. It is not necessarily "Rugby", so for what he published here that they need to make a "real" rugby movie, you missed the point. This is not another typical sports movie in which a team sucks, takes on Emilio Estevez and turns the team around and wins the championship and gives everyone the warmth and nuances. It focuses on a story. Show how someone can change their life for the better. Today films talk about sex, drugs, parties, etc. It's Hollywood. I'm a big fan of the movies, but I have to say that this was an inspirational film with a great message. If you consider yourself a "tough guy" don't watch the movie, it won't live up to your standards. If you want to see a good inspirational movie, this is a good movie.
