In 1929, director Walt Disney and the animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the first episode of their series "Silly Symphonies", "The Skeleton Dance". Iwerks and Disney have collaborated together since the early 1920s, in Disney's "Laugh-O-Gram" cartoon series; however, their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when Iwerks accepted a competitor's offer to leave Disney and start his own animation studio. It was the birth of Celebrity Productions, where Iwerks continued to develop his style and technique (and where he created the character of Flip the Frog). While his work maintained the same high quality, it was not very popular and in 1936 the studio was closed. Later that year, Iwerks was hired by Columbia Pictures, and Iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance, this time in color. <br /> <br /> "Skeleton Frolics" from 1937 is essentially a 1929 remake of the classic "The Skeleton Dance", the film that gave him fame and fortune. Like that short film, it is set in an abandoned cemetery, where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play. The dead rise from their coffins, ready for the show that is about to begin, when a group of skeletons has formed an orchestra and starts playing a happy melody. Now, it's not easy to be a musician made of bones, since some members of the orchestra have problems with body parts, however, the band manages to put on a good show and another group of skeletons starts dancing. A lovely couple faces the same problems that disturbed the orchestra: it's hard to dance with loose body parts. Everything ends at dawn and just as the sun is about to rise again, the skeletons run towards their graves. Directed and animated by the same Ub Iwerks, "Skeleton Frolics" faithfully follows the model set by "The Skeleton Dance" years earlier, albeit with a crucial difference: Iwerks made the entire Technicolor film. The brilliant shades allowed Iwerks to create a visually more captivating film, and also to use the many new techniques he had practiced since leaving Disney, creating effects of depth and dynamism even better than those he had conceived before. It is certainly a more experimental film than "The Skeleton Dance", although unfortunately this does not necessarily mean that it is a better film. To begin with, the film is virtually identical to the one he made with Disney, with the only differences between the music (more on the next) and the color effects. It looks beautiful, there is no doubt, but after all it seems decidedly unoriginal. <br /> <br /> However, it is not the originality of the concept that really hurts the film (after all, Iwerks performs it in a wonderful way), but the fact that the musical melody created by Joe DeNat for the film is rather uninteresting and lacking in the fascinating elegance and extravagant fun of that created by Carl W. Stalling for "The Skeleton Dance". In other words, while the DeNat melody is effective and appropriate for the theme, it is easy to quickly forget about it while the Stalling song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable. Being a musical film, this is of great importance, and so the mediocrity of music breaks down Iwerk's flawless animation work. Personally, I think that with a better musical accompaniment, "Skeleton Frolics" would be remembered fondly as "The Skeleton Dance despite not being so revolutionary, since it is still a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> It's kind of sad that much of the work done by Iwerks after leaving Disney has been forgotten because of his poor success, however, it must be said that if Iwerks lacked the popularity of Disney or Fleischer (Disney's main rival), he did not lack the quality of films of those companies: it was probably just a case of bad luck that made the man who gave birth to Disney's mouse for the first time to face the failure of Disney Despite his shortcomings, "Skeleton Frolics" is very funny and visually stunning film, which although not exactly the most original and fresh film (one cannot help but think of "The Skeleton Dance" while watching it), surely reminds us of c h and Iwerk's skeletons are still here to persecute and inspire us. <br /> <br /> 8/10
