Black comedy is not always easy to sell. From time to time you get a very successful black comedy, like Fargo, for example. But usually they don't often find a large audience. It seems that people decide for comedy or serious chaos. There doesn't seem to be a big market for a good combination of both. The launch of Momma from the train was a fairly decent success, but few people seem to remember it much today. Danny DeVito almost hit this film in 1987. <br /> <br /> DeVito plays a strange mom boy named Owen who tries to get rid of his outrageous and unpleasant mother he still lives with. The mother is played by Anne Ramsey, who died shortly after release, and is a true caricature. She is noisy, ugly, rude and authoritarian. Although Owen does not seem able to take care of himself, he desperately wants to have his mother cleared. He fantasizes about some really strange scenes, but clearly he doesn't dare to do it really alone. This is where Billy Crystal comes into play. Crystal plays Larry Donner, Owen's creative writing teacher at a nearby community college. Larry is an aspiring paranoid intellectual novelist who claims his ex-wife stole his novel and made millions of dollars. He is currently trying to write a new one, but he can't even find a decent first sentence. "The night was ..." Owen hears Larry want his ex-wife to die during an explosion at the school cafeteria. And borrowing the idea from Strangers on a Train, Owen decides to travel to Hawai'i and kill Larry's ex-wife. Once he seems to have done so, he expects Larry to return the favor and kill his mother. The resulting action is often quite funny and even moving. It is certainly never boring and often full of surprises. <br /> <br /> The acting is exceptional, although Ramsey was a little exaggerated. Crystal is as good as it can be, and DeVito has always been underestimated as an artist. The film is based on a lot of physical comedy that usually works, often painfully. The film uses some really innovative editing techniques in some scenes and the off-beat tone is really refreshing. I was often critical towards the end of the 80s as a period of artistic malaise and a sluggish movie. Throwing mum out of the train makes opportunities. Both in the way his characters are drawn, and in his general plot. How many comedies revolve around a son who killed his mother? The film is not too long and is full of laughter. Writers tend to find it more interesting than the general public, but can still be appreciated by anyone. 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The hound.
