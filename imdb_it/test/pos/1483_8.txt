Once upon a time there was someone in my family (not saying who it is for personal reasons) who thinks that Mr Bean is always so foolish in whatever he does in the comic series. Imagine how I felt at that moment. Shocked instantly. <br /> <br /> There are more reasons than one because I love watching Mr Bean. Being one of those first local television shows here in my country where I grew up watching, it's just one of those things that stuck in my mind. Once upon a time, my friends and I talked about some of the selected episodes and we simply laughed together. <br /> <br /> It is always silly, funny and fun in all the antics that Rowan Atkinson will play Mr Bean in each episode. Although lately he can sometimes show some of the repetitions here, he has never failed to bring back my childhood memories. In fact, I can dare to say that this is the very first show that introduces me to the kind of shows that came out of the UK while I was growing up. <br /> <br /> The comic series ... definitely really evil, as the British might say.
