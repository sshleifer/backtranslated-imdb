A good movie for horse lovers and many others. It's a horse racing movie, and it's a "little man gets his chance" movie, and it's a "how far would you go?" movie. Walter Mattau once again demonstrates his adaptability as an actor. It fits perfectly with Lloyd Bourdelle, a Louisiana Cajun tramp. This film offers you a rare vision of Lousiana Cajun horse racing fencing. He has a young quarter horse who is a racing prospect. "he had nothing but a service station and a good horse". The Bourdelles take the opportunity to make it big by bringing the horse, Shadow, to Ruidoso, New Mexico, to prepare to race in the All-American Futurity. But to what extent will Lloyd win fame and fortune? Also from this film are memorable scenes of Lloyd spitting tobacco juice and waiting for his truck.
