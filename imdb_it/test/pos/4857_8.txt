I don't know if it was the filmmakers who made sure the sky was almost always sunny and beautiful in this film. Perhaps this is the romantic image that many Americans have of the time this film is set, as it is in the middle of the war, Macy has returned from the war (his neighbor asks "Hey, is it true that you have a Fritz over there?" ) and is trying to get on with his life but one day he receives a new pair of glasses (hence the name) and sees things clearly while the surrounding situation turns out to be a rabid anti-Semitism, and Macy and Dern could be wrapped in it . Strange how neither of them is Jewish in this film, but the accusation is made. It is also historically accurate, as the democratic unions of this era wrapped themselves in the flags of America and God. Macy is continually tormented to come to the "meeting". His presence brings unexpected results. <br /> <br /> Applying this time frame to date is a contrasting study. In 2005, it underwent a complete reversal, with average citizens taking patriotism and religion as their unifier that supports the Republican Party and sees work organized as part of an "unpatriotic" left-wing America. <br /> <br /> A great photo to watch, if you are interested in seeing the friendly, shy and gentle Macy (beautifully interpreted by him) let yourself be taken in the carnage of the race and hatred in the mid-40s in New York. <br /> <br /> A tough, emotionally charged movie.
