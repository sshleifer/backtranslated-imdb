Fata Morgana is an absolute masterpiece. It is the most unconventional film by Werner Herzog. It has no plot or story. Instead of a story, we are given a collection of images, words and music that work so wonderfully together. It's not even a documentary. Some of the people in this film are direct and have lines to read. It has some of the most beautiful and captivating images. Herzog shoots real mirages and we see cars and people floating in the middle of the desert that really aren't there but hundreds of miles away they are reflected like in a mirror. The use of music in this film is so brilliant - by Leonard Cohen, Mozart and the Third Ear Band. Imagine Stanley Kubrick 2001: A Space Odyssey in the Desert; it's how this movie is. This film is so hypnotic that it has the ability to make you feel as if your spirit had left your body. A must see The way to see the movies will change. Rating: 10 out of 10.
