While driving on the highway at the wedding of his beloved Betty-Ann, Adam (Eric Jungmann) is surprised by his former schoolmate Harley (Justin Urich) in the back seat of his car. Adam broke up with the uncomfortable and stupid Harley because of Betty-Ann. During their road trip, Harley teases some rednecks in a bar and later their car is chased by a giant monstrous truck on the road. After a few incidents, they give the hitchhiker Sarah (Aimee Brooks) a lift and first the trio is terrified of a scary monster driving the monster truck. <br /> <br /> Despite having one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in a horror movie, the annoying Harley, "Monster Man" is a surprisingly good trash horror comedy. The story is a collection of clich√©s, which begins as "Joy Ride" or "Duel"; then it turns into one of the countless rip-offs of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"; there is a surprising twist, which ends with a hook for a sequel. There are hilarious scenes, Aimee Brooks is extremely sexy and this movie really entertains. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Monster Man"
