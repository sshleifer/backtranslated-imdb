This 8-minute gem is not only timeless, but a milestone in the cartoon. It is the third cartoon of Mickey Mouse and one of his best. It is a milestone of the cartoon because it was the first with sound. And my goodness, even after more than 70 years, is always so good, and gives further weight to the narrative. The black and white animation is excellent and the character's characteristics are quite convincing. The music is wonderful, I love the soundtrack, it adds to the fun of cardboard, regardless of how thin the story sometimes is. And the cardboard is fun! So many memorable moments, like the cow's teeth used as a xylophone and her breast like a bagpipe. The characters are also engaging, Mickey and Minnie two famous Disney characters are well voiced by Walt Disney, and Pete is also "the villain of the piece". All in all, "Steamboat Willie" is just a timeless gem that everyone should see at least once. 10/10 Bethany Cox
