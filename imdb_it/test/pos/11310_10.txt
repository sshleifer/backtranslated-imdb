"Medusa: Dare to be Truthful" is a shockingly funny parody that is an excellent companion to the original, "Madonna: Truth or Dare". The brilliant creation of Julie Brown opens up the very funny documentary of Madonna (even if it wasn't exactly bold, insightful, sincere or sincere) with a loyalty to the details, up to the packaging. I highly recommend this for Madonna fans, Julie Brown fans or anyone who loves acute and intelligent parody.
