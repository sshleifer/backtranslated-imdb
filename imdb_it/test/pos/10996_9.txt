I would recommend this film to anyone looking for a relaxing, fun and challenging film. The absence of sex, vulgarity and violence made the evening more pleasant. I particularly enjoyed the Buffalo scene, but it's probably because I live a short distance from there. Even so, this film may have been produced in any city; is the theme that is so important here. I'm just grateful that Manna From Heaven fell on us. Try it ... you'll like it!
