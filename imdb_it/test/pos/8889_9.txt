If you had a mother who described you this way, you could simply try to hit her alone. That's how Danny DeVito tries for Anne Ramsey, it's just like putting the plan into action. <br /> <br /> And his creative writing class taught by Professor Billy Crystal gives him the idea. This is a view of Alfred Hitchcock's classic Strangers On A Train that gives DeVito the idea of ​​committing murders with Crystal who hates his wife, Kate Mulgrew, who is not only betraying him for an idea of ​​a book he wanted to write, but it is also carrying on with Tony Ciccone hunky. <br /> <br /> Throw Momma From The Train is a bit like Strangers On A Train as DeVito seems to have completed its murder plan. But Crystal has a little trouble putting Ramsey down with Danny's help. That woman might need to kill, but she'll take a lot. <br /> <br /> The only award from Throw Momma from The Train was an Oscar nomination for Anne Ramsey as best supporting actress. Ramsey lost to Olympia Dukakis for Moonstruck, but the film turned out to be his best hour. Ramsey already had throat cancer that would eventually kill her the following year, but look at the list of credits she managed to amass even after Throw Momma From The Train, worked to the end. <br /> <br /> I saw interviews with both Throw Momma stars from The Train, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito, and both happily admitted that Anne Ramsey's performance as the mother of hell made the film successful and stole it under them. Their recognition of Ramsey's talent and performance is the best possible tribute. <br /> <br /> If Marion Lorne in Strangers on a Train had been something like Anne Ramsey here, Farley Granger would gladly join Robert Walker to get rid of it. Throw Momma From A Train is one of the best black comedies out there, not to be missed.
