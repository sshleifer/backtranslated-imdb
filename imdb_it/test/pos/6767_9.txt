OK, so I'm usually not one who runs out and hires foreign films ... especially foreign obscure comedies. I think I can count on one side the number of films I found really hilarious from beginning to end. This film will be added to the short list. Even the dark Hollywood comedies sometimes repel me because they require an incredibly dry sense of humor. But this had my eyes filled with tears. My sides hurt. I didn't laugh so long. This film was recommended by my mother and I don't think I would ever have dreamed of watching it if it hadn't thrilled me. Don't be afraid to read during your movie - you'll miss a chilling movie.
