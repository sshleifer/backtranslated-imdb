I recently saw this movie for the first time. I liked it so much that I immediately went to buy the DVD. This film is pure genius and becomes more and more fun with every vision. Anyone can write funny jokes or dialogues and make the actors memorize them, but the base of this movie has improved !! How do they do it? Thank you, Christopher Guest!
