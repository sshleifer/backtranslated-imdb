This little film is reminiscent of many other films, but it manages to maintain its style and mood. "Troll" and "Don't be afraid of the dark" come to mind. The suspense builders were good, and it was enough to cut the line from G to PG. I particularly liked the non-clich√© choices with parents; in other films, I could predict the dialogue to the letter, but the writing in this film made better selections. If you want a movie that is not serious but gives you chills, this is a great choice.
