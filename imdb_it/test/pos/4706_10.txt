I was first informed of this film when I saw a preview before another film. I was intrigued but I didn't see it before it was short in theaters. <br /> <br /> It is not an easy movie to watch several times. There is a lot of violence inflicted on unarmed civilians. There are lessons to be learned here. One of Patricia Arquette's lines sums up. "For the Americans, if it didn't happen on TV, it didn't happen" There's a lot of truth to this. <br /> <br /> Another is that at some point you think that just because you are announcing that you are an American citizen that the soldiers will separate and let it pass. It doesn't work that way. <br /> <br /> The scenery is beautiful. The acting is all decent. THE PROFESSOR is particularly good. Mainly though I care about these characters. Francis McDormand and Spaulding Gray are fine but their appearance is short, so it doesn't matter much. Patricia has liver. In the hands of a minor actor this could have been very bad. Since it is love or hate, the film should still come out with the idea that military dictatorships still exist in the world in this century, and until one of our people is hurt we ignore their oppression. <br /> <br /> Aung San Suu Kyi, is the female political leader in the film. In real life he won the Nobel Peace Prize. Recently she was released from house arrest. The Bush administration, from the date I write, is trying to pressure the military government to engage in talks with her and reform the government. The Burmize government was subjected to such control that the name of the country was changed to the Republic of Maynamar. The US government has yet to recognize the new name. <br /> <br /> If you don't have a message in your movie, don't watch this. If you don't mind a little education with your fun, then it's nice.
