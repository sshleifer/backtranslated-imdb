Directed and starring in Burt Reynold in this great cop movie, Reynold's comedy is Sharkey of the title, who is a tough cop while he works incognito and a drug bag goes wrong, and is demoted to vice, <br /> < br /> The title machine refers to the heterogeneous group of Reynold's crew to bring down a dishonest governor who is involved in the cocaine of high-level prostitution and contract killing, <br /> <br /> The heterogeneous group is played by Brian Keith, Blackploitaion's favorite Bernie Casey, Richard Libertini, (as eccentric as an ace-man-sound) Charle's Durning, like the chief, The beautiful English rose Rachael Ward plays Dominoe a prostitute of $ 1000 dollars that Reynold's protects and eventually collapses, when it taps an apartment used by the governor. <br /> <br /> The Italian actor Vittorio Gassman, the game is the high pole pimp, who has a deadly triad band at his disposal, and Henry DeSilva, the game is his psychotic brother who is a hired assassin who is very tense on prescription painkiller and a Dust gel, <br /> <br /> The action packed finale sees the remaining members of the "Machine" Engaged in a deadly shooting with Desilva, which culminates in one of the most spectacular Stunts ever made to Celluloid, <br /> Alas Hollywood has run out of ideas and is contemplating a remake of Sharky's Machine! Because to annoy a DVD of the special edition of the 25th Anniversary would be ideal, not a remake of the silly ass,
