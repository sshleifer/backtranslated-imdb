This could be the wine that speaks, but this could be the best film I've seen in a long time. Of course, I spent much of the first half hour wondering what the hell was going on, but once I accepted that I would never understand everything from the subtitles, I was able to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> Can you really hate a movie where a staff turns into a flock of birds that defecate on the enemy? How important is the development of the character in front of an alien lesbian princess whose people built the pyramids? Why does the Buddha wear diamond earrings really set? All this is important when you are faced with the pure sumptuousness of the images and the cunning humor of the characters. Every battle for my heart was won when I saw the main protagonist dressed as a spider man: fantastic! Many people will complain about the lack of cohesion in the story, but for a funny movie to laugh with a group of comrades you can't do better, especially if you make a shot at alcohol every time someone says "I'll love you 10,000 years".
