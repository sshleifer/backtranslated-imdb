For those who expect documentaries to be objective creatures, let me give you a little lesson on American filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Documentaries rely heavily on casting. Choose and choose the characters you think will improve the dramatic and entertainment value of your film. <br /> <br /> After filming a ton of movies, combine them to make a movie with ups and downs, turning points, climaxes, etc. If you have problems with the existing movie, you can take a little more that makes sense, find a movie or be smart with your story. <br /> <br /> The accusation that the filmmakers used the film of locales not part of the film (favelas next to beautiful beaches) does not detract from the value of the film as a dramatic piece and the particular image is that which resonates enough to justify its inclusion not really truthful. Either way, use the movie you can. So they didn't have footage of police violence for that particular neighborhood. Does this mean not including it and talking about it or maybe inserting some animations of cartoons so that the public is not "tricked"? Er, no. <br /> <br /> As for the hopeful ending, why not? Yes, the Americans made it. Yes, Americans are optimistic bastards. But why finish on a negative note? Just because it is set in a foreign country and foreign films in principle on a negative note? Let the foreigners portray the sad vision of life. <br /> <br /> Let us Americans think that there may be a happy ending hanging in the future. There can be only one.
