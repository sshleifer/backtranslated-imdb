Exhilarating, clean, light-hearted and worthy of mention. What more can you ask for in a movie? This is my favorite movie of all time, number one. Ever since I was a child, I have dreamed of owning a blue truck with flames and an observation bubble. <br /> <br /> The clich√© characters in ridiculous situations are what make this movie so funny. The wonderful chemical comedy between Stephen Furst (Harold) and Andy Tennant (Melio) makes up most of my favorite parts of the film. And who didn't like Flynch's awkward despair? Don't forget the airport antics of the comrades of Leon, dressed as Hari Krishna: dance, sing and play the tambourine: unbeatable! The clues are brilliant, the settings are classic and the plot is timeless. <br /> <br /> A word for the essay, if you didn't watch this movie when you were little, you probably won't win a movie in your heart today. But still give it a chance, you might find that "It doesn't matter what you say, no matter what you do, you have to play".
