the first time I saw this movie, I thought "what the hell?" a 10-year-old child driving in bizarre places, meets bizarre people, chasing a game called MOTORAMA! Hell yeah! I really enjoyed this movie! <br /> <br /> Jordan Christopher-Michael is a brilliant young actor! It is a pity that he stopped acting. He plays his character Gus very well in the film. <br /> <br /> Gus loses an eye, has tattoos and goes to the weirdest cities starring with Flea, Drew Barrymore and Meat Loaf! I want more? <br /> <br /> OK, don't even try to understand the story, but why does this film need one !? Open your mind and let Gus guide you on this journey. <br /> <br /> "Motorama Gus, you won Motorama"
