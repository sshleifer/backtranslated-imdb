My mother is as Gone with the wind as it can be. It has collector plates, Rhett and Scarlett Madame Alexander dolls, GWTW Christmas ornaments, even a GWTW recipe book! My sister and I had only seen pieces of GWTW but we knew the whole plot by heart. On a whim, my sister bought this miniseries thinking that my mother would like it and we took an interest in it after leafing through the novel. <br /> <br /> Yesterday we decided to watch both Gone With The Wind and Scarlett. We started GWTW around 2:30 in the afternoon and finished it at 6:30. We started Scarlett immediately afterwards. My mother usually goes to bed around 10:00, she stayed up until 1:30 with us to finish it! We have been riveted! I like how the movie starts at Melanie's funeral, right where Scarlett left off, saying "I'll think about it tomorrow". Scarlett doesn't stay long in Georgia, she runs to Charleston in her quest to win him back. Rhett is not happy when he finds Scarlett in his house, so he leaves for the family plantation. Rossella, being Rossella, follows him and in the end they agree to set aside their arguments for a while to keep the gossip at bay. Rhett starts enjoying his company again and takes her on his boat. A storm arrives and sinks. It helps her to swim to the shore of some island. Terrified of being dead, Rhett is anxious until she wakes up. When it does, both are swept away by the moment and make love. Scarlett wakes up the next day in Charleston but Rhett is gone and writes that he thinks it's better if they never see each other again. <br /> <br /> Scarlett has a broken heart and when she does she does stupid things, in this case she is seen by Anne Hampton who goes up to a hotel room alone with Ashley. Nothing happens, but his reputation is tainted so Scarlett goes to Savannah with her two aunts. He soon finds out he is pregnant and decides to wait for the right moment to tell Rhett. While in Savannah he meets many of his relatives O'Hara and grows up as a cousin, especially a Padre Colum. He will soon receive his divorce notice from Rhett and then decide that he will never tell him about his child just to spite him. Typical Scarlett. <br /> <br /> Decides to go to Ireland to make sure Rhett can never find out about his condition. Meet many other relatives and buy a beautiful ancestral home in Ballyhara. All this time, Rhett is courting Anne. It is on Halloween when Scarlett receives the warning that Rhett has remarried, that night she gets hurt. <br /> <br /> The film jumps to a year later and Scarlett is very happy with her beautiful daughter Kat. He is chased by Lord Richard Fenton who is indeed a wicked man, forcing a young girl named Mary Boyle to sleep with him. Rossella meets Rhett and Anne again at an equestrian fair. After an accident on horseback, Rossella has a conversation with Anne and discovers that she and Rhett have a child. Distraught again, Scarlett leaves and goes to Dublin with Fenton. There he cultivates a relationship with him, as I said, he does stupid things when he has a broken heart. Mary Boyle found out she was pregnant and went to ask Colum for help. The priest urges Fenton to help the girl and Fenton kills him after Colum threatens to tell Rossella. Fenton convinces Rossella to go to London with him to escape his grief over Colum's death. Maria asks to go with her. Back in Charleston, Anne died of yellow fever. It was made clear that he never bored Rhett. <br /> <br /> In London, Rossella sees the true colors of Fenton after hurting her when she is not in the mood for sleep with him. Fenton raped her after she told him she would never want to see him again. Fade fainted afterwards and when Fenton wakes up he was stabbed to death. Scarlett is accused of her murder. <br /> <br /> Rhett talks about it and rushes to England with Sally in tow. Scared of the gallows, Rossella has no choice but to tell Rhett about their daughter. Rhett is furious with her for keeping a secret, but remains to help her. Mary Boyle, the real murderer, cannot be found. Scarlett is found guilty, but Mary finally arrives to declare her innocence. After promising to help Mary, Scarlett leaves Rhett for Ireland because, as he says, "It's time I met my daughter." The scene in which he sees Kat for the first time is absolutely beautiful. In Ireland, Rhett sees how much Scarlett has changed and the two finally reconcile completely and admit that they still love each other deeply. <br /> <br /> After seeing GWTW, I will say that yes, Vivian Leigh was a better Scarlett, but I liked Scarlett's character in this film compared to the first one. The reason is that in GWTW, you don't know why you like Scarlett. He is so cruel to Rhett and haughty and spoiled, but you like his lively spirit. To Scarlett, you see how much has changed. Oh, she's still in luxury, but she's no longer haughty. See how she becomes a real mother to Kat and a generous person for the poor of Ireland. Joanne Whalley does it and excellent work in reciting this new side of Scarlett. Timothy Dalton is not Clark Gable, but sometimes you swear you can see the original Rhett in him. <br /> <br /> If you sit down and don't compare Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton with Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable, you will surely appreciate this movie. It is an opportunity to compare the Scarlett of yesterday, the one that becomes after "tomorrow".
