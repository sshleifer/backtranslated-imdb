Alex Benedict (John Cassavetes) is an orchestra conductor who has a secret relationship with his pianist. When she threatens to report him and create a scandal if he does not leave his wife, he sees that he has no choice but to kill her and make it appear that she has committed suicide. Too bad our crumpled detective, Lt. Columbo (Peter Falk), is on the case. <br /> <br /> Stephen Bochco has written another clear episode for the series, following wonderful details with wonderful details. We watch the criminal commit his murder and set up his alibi for about twenty-five minutes, and we are completely absorbed. Then, when Columbo appears on the scene, it gets even better. <br /> <br /> First we see Columbo after the murder (as usual). This time he is at the vet with his new dog. The scenes of purely comic relief are usually the weakest in the show (think of the discomfort of Columbo on the nude model in "Suitable for framing"). Columbo is exhilarating when he is deliberately shaking or muttering to stumble his prey; but too many writers make the mistake of showing it in a ridiculous light when it is with non-suspects. Bochco, by contrast, shows Columbo a little awkward with his new pet in a handful of low-key scenes that are fun and cleverly integrated into the story. (And I am grateful that he did not force Columbo's quest to name the dog for a final joke. As far as we learn, the dog remains unnamed.) Bochco gives Columbo some of his best moments in this episode, and Peter Falk most of them do. He is particularly good at a monologue in which he expresses disbelief that anyone could kill himself, much less this brilliant and beautiful young pianist. And it's even better in his scenes playing cat and mouse with Cassavetes. That these two old friends and collaborators played each other brilliantly is predictable; and that's what we get. Notice how Alex Benedict can't help but admire deceptively darkened Columbo, just as the brilliant detective is tightening the noose around his neck. <br /> <br /> Bochco makes the most of every situation in his script. When does Columbo go to question Benedict's snob mechanic, of course ?? obviously! ?? he asks the man to look at his pile of pies. And when Benedict finds Columbo at the Hollywood Bowl before the rehearsals, of course ?? obviously! ?? "Chopsticks" plays on the piano. And what should our daring lieutenant take with him, but the victim's typewriter with the false suicidal note still in the roll. <br /> <br /> Columbo also has good scenes with an early girl (Dawn Frame) and the adorable Blythe Danner, who plays Cassavetes' wife. It's nice to see Myrna Loy introduce herself as Danner's mother, although she does little with her minor role. <br /> <br /> The director Nicholas Colasanto (who also acted, in particular as Coach in "Cheers") does perfectly deserving work, although he follows the guidance of almost all the other directors of "Columbo" adding one or two stupid triumphs. The scenes end blurring and begin to focus. Then there is that piece in which Cassavetes sees the carnation he dropped at the crime scene? and we see an enlarged image of him reflected in his sunglasses. There is also a scene with Myrna Loy and a group of old fogies that are performed atrociously by everyone except Cassavetes. <br /> <br /> These are quibbles, though. This is a beautifully entertaining episode, the kind that made me a fan of "Columbo".
