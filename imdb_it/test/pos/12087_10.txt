I could be a good old boy from Virginia in the Confederate States of America, but this man does it for me. That mustache makes me angry. I remember when I saw his video for the first time. That girl he beat was incredible. The depth of his acting when they cut his altered facade was a new level of masculinity. It reminds me of the granite sculptures of our Monte. Rushmore. If I could ask him a question, it would be, "If I were a hot dog, would I eat you?" Orhan will do a reunion tour? Take note from greats like Gordon Lightfoot, true heart music never fades. Lives La John Denver. Gracias, my friend, O.F.F.L. (Orhan Fan For Life)
