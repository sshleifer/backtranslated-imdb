The viewer who said he was disappointed seems to have lost the point here. This is a superb film, excellent and realistic portraits of a middle-class Jewish family in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, a long time ago. The nuances are perfect and I felt that everyone's casting was superior. Above all I found the recitation of Judith Ivey perfect, especially the talk she has with her daughter when her daughter comes home late one night. That scene was worthy of an Oscar. But really, the whole acting was fine. I recommend this movie. It's a fun and familiar and delightful movie to see how a beautiful bourgeois family lived in Brooklyn so long ago. Watch it and you'll be glad you did. He has very funny lines and the character of Eugene is a real comedian - very funny.
