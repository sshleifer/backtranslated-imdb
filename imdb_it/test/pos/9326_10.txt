Michael Jackson is the greatest singer and greatest dancer that ever existed and this film proves it. It's great to watch and the dance is fantastic. when Michael turns into a werewolf he is a bit on the edge of the chair the first time you look at him. and the rap of the winning price increases the fear when all the zombies rise from their graves. if you like it, then I suggest you buy "Making Michael Jackson's Thriller", which has the film and then the making of it after it. making shows an incredible performance by "Billie Jean" by Michael, which is when he first did the moonwalk on television. Watch it.
