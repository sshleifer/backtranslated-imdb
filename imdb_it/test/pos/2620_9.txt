This episode of Charmed changed everything! The show is about to finish the third season and all hell breaks loose in this episode. The enchanted ones carry a certain Innocent named Dr. Griffiths to the manor that protects him from Shax, the Source killer. When Shax attacks, he explodes like a tornado and then materializes in his demonic skin. He detonated Prue by throwing a wall that completely knocked her out and practically killed her. Then he blows Piper throwing what's left of the wall. Phoebe comes from the attic and says the spell crosses before Shax arrives to kill the doctor. But being the Power of One, it merely hurts him. Leo comes to heal the other sisters and Prue wants to find Shax and destroy him for real. Phoebe, meanwhile, is in the Underworld trying to find Cole. When Prue and Piper go out into the street to find the demon, the demon finds them. After their battle, the witches realize that a camera has captured everything! When they return to Manor trying to fight the media and after defeating Shax, a witch who has gone kookoo shoots Piper. Prue uses her telekinesis to move people off the road so she can get to the hospital. But they are late and Piper dies. And just when Prue is about to be shot, time is taken up where they take Dr. Griffiths to the Manor. Shax blows and blows up Prue and Piper. But Phoebe is still in the Underworld, so Shax kills the doctor and runs away from the manor. When Leo finally arrives, he cannot heal Prue. Prue is dead and so is the power of three. Currently. Personally. this episode was sad. Prue was the strength of all of them. I'd like to have his telekinesis power. I really don't think Phoebe should go to the Underworld because if she didn't, Shax wouldn't kill Prue. But Paige reports The Power of Three again and I'm happy with the show's progress
