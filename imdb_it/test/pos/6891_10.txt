Although it has been deactivated for 6 years, Promised Land was one of those shows that comes once or twice in a generation. Good cast, supporting cast (including Richard Thomas and Ossie Davis) and crew. The plot is credible with McRaney who prepares his family and says "to hell with it" after being subjected to so many disappointments and accidents since his return from Vietnam years ago. I think many veterans of the Vietnam era, myself included, can really relate to McRaney's mental process in deciding definitively on his course of action. Many of us did exactly the same thing in real life, after returning from that war and discovering that America was not the same place we had left. The show not only conveys values ​​but a look at what happened in a veteran's life. Only in these two aspects, I think it is one of the most touching TV series of our time. Because this program only worked for 3 years is beyond me.
