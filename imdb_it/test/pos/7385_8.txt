Rickman is sexy and good, but the "foreigner" is less convincing - Reedus is kind of sexy, but he's not a coherent actor - it could be the director's fault in this case - we should find him seductive to the extreme because he's "cute", but it's not enough. The frustrated wife is almost convincing - 7 years of marriage and she and the character of Rickman should be more determined with each other, whether their roles must be incompatible or not - they must have models by now. I understand this, even though I think the wife is a little rigid in her role - and not convincingly attracted by the "foreigner" - so it's a failure - the tacit link between Rickman's character and the "foreigner" is better done , even if we're not sure what it is. I miss Rickman's sexy English accent (luckily he slips in and out of the American model). disappointing, but with a certain acting.
