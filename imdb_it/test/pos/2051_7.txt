Let me start by saying in general that I liked The Long Kiss Goodnight. I would give a 7/10. The good: 1. Acting: Samuel L Jackson is fun in almost every role. In this film he doesn't play his usual character, the guy who has control, instead Geena Davis has control and Sam is around. His timing on his lines is great and he is the highest point in the film. Geena Davis also gives a great preformance as Samantha Caine / Charlie Baltimore. She is a credible action hero and I don't think too many other actresses can do without Geena's preformance. 2. The Action: this is an action-packed film. Things are always crashing or bursting or someone is chasing someone else. The special effects are good enough especially for being almost 8 years old. I can see some images on the green screen but it doesn't take much away from acting. <br /> <br /> The Bad: 1. Why was half the film needed to set the plot? This film had to be modified in the script phase so that it would not be performed until then. Perhaps a drama or something can last so long, but people really need to be in the film all the time to support it. I think if you manage to keep the first half you will be surprisingly surprised by the second half. 2. Geena Davis has a cold climate and a tank top but never seems cold. 3. Some things are not realistic. Sam Jackson flies through a giant sign after he is blown out of a room and then lands on a tree and stands up. When you see this part you will think it is a gag. fun movie in general 7/10
