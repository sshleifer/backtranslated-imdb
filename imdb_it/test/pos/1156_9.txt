1904. The North African nation of Morocco is hanging on a tenuous independence, as the various European powers - France, Germany, Great Britain, Russia, Spain and now the United States - are competing for influence in the region. The Sultan (Marc Zuber) is a weak puppet; his uncle, the Bashaw (Vladek Sheybal), who is manipulated by the French and the Germans, is the real power behind the throne. Enter Berber Chieftan Raisuli (Sean Connery), leader of the Rif tribe and "the last of the Barbary pirates", who kidnaps an American missionary, Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen) and his two sons and takes them hostage. Back in the United States, President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) threatens to go to war for the problem: "Pedecaris Alive or Raisuli Dead!" - seeing the problem as the perfect way to exercise his "Big Stick" diplomacy, although Secretary of State John Hay (John Huston) is not so sure. However, the Raisuli has less sinister plans for the Pedecarises, who are more than capable of managing themselves anyway. <br /> <br /> The great historical film by John Milius, VERY loosely based on a true story (ie Pedecaris was a middle-aged man), is a good deal of escape. It has some incredible action scenes, a witty and well written script, a refined cast that enjoys the material, and does not stop beyond its welcome such as, for example, "Pirates of the Caribbean" or the movie "The Lord of the Rings ". It is not really an "epic" film in the strictest sense, but it is one of the best action films ever made. <br /> <br /> While the historical context is shaky, the plot is interesting and, as some reviewers, out, is even more relevant today than when it was done. As President Roosevelt states, "America is like a grizzly bear" - fierce, strong, but a little blind and reckless at times. At the time of the film's set-up, America has just been pushed onto the world stage as a superpower, after their sensational victory in the Spanish-American war - and Roosevelt takes this incident as a way to demonstrate America's value. In real life, it didn't work that way, but allegorically it works well. While it is written from a right-wing perspective, Milius's script is quite accurate in evaluating America and its place in the world. He admires Roosevelt and his "big stick" diplomacy method, and correctly recognizes (in Roosevelt's words) that while America can be feared and respected, it will never really be "loved" by the world, regardless of what they do. And there are some scenes - such as Roosevelt's shooting of European leaders and the almost comical surprise attack of the Marines in Bashaw's palace - which show America's reckless and violent side, while others - the final clash with the Germans - show their heroism. br /> <br /> The historical / political context of the film is, of course, simply flesh on the bones of what is essentially an action / adventure film. There are some brilliantly done action scenes, like the rescue of Pedecaris Raisuli from members of the double cross tribe, which features some of the best sword games in each movie. The opening entrance of the Raisuli and the aforementioned march and attack of the US marines are done brilliantly. And the final battle, which combines elements of "Lawrence of Arabia" and "The Wild Bunch", while a great historical fantasy (a three-way battle between Germans, Americans and Rifs), is a superb staging, adrenaline rush sequence . <br /> <br /> The excellent cast offers wonderful performances. Everyone seems to have fun with the film, and proves it. Sean Connery is surprisingly convincing as a Berber with a Scottish accent, but manages to bring out his interesting, well-designed and chivalrous character who comes to respect his hostage and abhor modern, uncivil war. Candice Bergen, an actress I have never been fond of, offers a beautiful performance like the exuberant Eden Pedecaris, who is as tough as her captor. Brian Keith is a surprisingly convincing TR - you really feel he must have been like that, an athletic, bold man, but practical and intelligent with an admirable sense of self. The scenes of Roosevelt boxing and target shooting while discussing foreign policy are some of the greatest "bad ass" moments in film history - and who can forget lines like "Why ruin the beauty of the thing with legality? " John Huston provides solid support like Hay, tired and cautious, acting as perfect support for the much more impulsive Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> Among the best supporting casts, the best are Geoffrey Lewis as Samuel Gummere, the cynical Ambassador caught in the midst of political intrigue, and Steve Kanaly, playing the Marine Captain gung-ho who cheerfully defends (and executes) "Military intervention!" as the straightforward and simple solution for the whole complex situation. Other well-known faces such as Vladek Sheybal, Nadim Sawalha, Roy Jenson, Larry Cross, Marc Zuber and Darrell Fetty do a great job, no matter how small their role is. Spaghetti Western fans will recognize Antoine Saint-John ("A Fistful of Dynamite") as the German general and Aldo Sambrell as one of the members of the Raisuli tribe. <br /> <br /> "The wind and the lion" is, all around, a wonderfully made adventure film. It has something for everyone: a wonderful game of weapons and swords, a lot of humor, a tough and gritty heroine (and her two cute children), a beautiful love story (if not consumed) and an interesting (if imaginative) political / historical context. It's not a masterpiece, but hey, it wasn't trying to be. I give "The wind and the lion" to nine agitated stars and my highest recommendation.
