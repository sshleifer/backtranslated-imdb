A sign of what to expect in this film came when I noticed that this was the first (and probably the last) film to have a "Technical Vomit" in its credits. <br /> <br /> In what is a couple of hours of stupid gags, exhilarating violence and excellent crap humor. <br /> <br /> This film was just what you would expect from the Bottom guys, and it's nice to see them in their best shape after the life of Rik Mayall's Menacing Incident. <br /> <br /> Richie (Mayall) and Eddie (Edmondson) are too similar to their Bottom characters, if we can have some criticism, and Edmondson does a surprisingly good job even in directing the film. <br /> <br /> This film has already generated predictable comparisons with the Fawlty Towers that just are not there, and the Paradise Guest House itself is not Torquay! <br /> <br /> Watch out for some excellently made dialogue between all the violence and chaos. <br /> <br /> If you don't like Bottom you will probably hate it - but I loved it.
