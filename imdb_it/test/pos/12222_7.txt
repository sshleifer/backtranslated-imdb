This set of DVDs is the complete series of 15 episodes of "Surface", a television show made by Universal in 2006. The complete execution time is 10 hours and 34 minutes plus some bonus features (deleted scenes, cast interviews, featurettes of special effects). This has been a relatively high budget and much of the budget comes to the screen in the form of quality production designs and special effects. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately 10+ hours is a lot of time and, as typically happens with this kind of thing, the general quality starts to fall in the later episodes. I found the first 7 episodes (discs 1 and 2) extremely engaging and the rest a disappointment. "Surface" was produced, written and directed by Josh and Jonas Pate; and they seem to have been surprised by the success of the series and have not been able to put together enough good material later as they rushed to fill the order for more episodes. It also seems that other writers were introduced for later episodes because the characters (who were already the weakest part of the series) lack consistency with the way they were interpreted in the first few episodes. The series has been canceled and although the last episode provides a conclusion of this kind, many things still remain outstanding. <br /> <br /> It's basically a science fiction story about genetically created dragons; a sort of TV mix of "Jurassic Park" and "ET". The story begins as an enigma when an unmanned navy submarine is found drifting in the sea, boatmen on a Texas lake are sucked into the whirlpool, a lighthouse in Africa is destroyed by a huge monster, etc. Etc. And as long as things remain this vague contains a good dose of tension and suspense. A human element is introduced in the form of three American families, one on each coast and one on the Gulf of Mexico. Laura Daughterty (Lake Bell) is a Californian marine biologist who discovers a strange creature from an underwater air intake on the ocean floor. Rich Connelly (Jay R. Ferguson) dives with his younger brother in the gulf when a similar creature drags his brother away (never seen again). <br /> <br /> Miles Bennett (Carter Jenkins) is a teenager from Wilmington who finds strange eggs floating in the ocean. He takes a house where he hatches into an "ET" type dragon. He will spend the rest of the series trying to hide his strange pet from his family and local authorities. These dragons may look like lizards, but they are more like indestructible electric eels, which emit electromagnetic impulses, cause lightning, empty the sea of ​​fish and reproduce like a bunch of bunnies when they find an underwater thermal vent of boiling water. Until he is sure if they are intelligent, extraterrestrial or harmless, the premise is interesting. When you begin to suspect their origin, everything becomes very tired and predictable. <br /> <br /> Jay R. Ferguson (a terribly bad actor in the tradition of David Hasselhoff) essentially plays Richard Dreyfuss's character from "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", so you know it with a better actor and a better director could have been an interesting character. You will grow to hate this character more in each episode. Unfortunately what begins as three parallel lines is soon condensed into two as Ferguson and Bell (a low-cost version of Sandra Bullock) are soon paired and involved in a series of almost unlikely moral adventures like those of "Jason Bourne" gets in You expect potholes and the need to suspend disbelief in this type of show (which can also be part of the fun), but their adventures are not only totally unlikely, they are completely and completely boring. There are three consecutive episodes presenting Ferguson and Bell together in a submarine that will make you want the excitement of an all-day actuarial conference. <br /> <br /> Jenkins (Miles) is the strongest member of the cast and the segments with his domestic dragon (Nimrod) are inter-cut quite often with the boring Ferguson-Bell stuff to make you look. And these segments benefit from the presence of the splendid Leighton Meester (of the recent fame of "Gossip Girl") as her sister Savannah. Apparently the producers have grasped the importance of this for their "teenage" audience and the only positive thing they did with the latest episodes of the series was to introduce Linsey Godrey (Caitlin) as a "first love" interest for Miles. As the screen time of Savannah decreases, Catlin is gradually inserted. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, they needed a third plot to keep viewers sufficiently engaged and it would have been better to limit the melodrama of adults in favor of a second group of young actors. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
