Describing Stalingrad as a war movie can be a bit imprecise. Of course, it focuses on the longest and bloodiest battle in the history of the world, in the most expansive theater of the most expensive war in terms of lives, money and material that has ever happened. Yes, it contains action scenes depicting bitter battles and terrible destruction. The visceral plot and the harsh images, however, make it more than a war movie, even more than an anti-war film. Stalingrad is instead a film about absolute and undeniable hell. <br /> <br /> The film is full of visual descriptions of the worst kind of war, intensely personal and close, in which the days pass by taking a block, only to have taken it on a surprise assault. The first form of modern urban warfare that the Germans came to call Rattenkrieg (Rat Warfare) is represented in brutal and intransigent terms. The characters fight in the tunnels of the sewers, on the railway yards and from the building to the building in the infernal bomb of the ruined Stalingrad, only to be defeated by the Russian winter. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the problem of Nazism and the denigration of the Germans at that time, as do many other films from Germany and the rest of the world. His characters are a group of soldiers swept away by the winds of war and who are simply trying to solve them with themselves and as many of their companions alive as possible. The characters do not fight the Soviets with any ideological hatred between National Socialism and Soviet communism, not for any great dream of Grossdeutschland or racial superiority. They only fight because if they don't the enemy will kill them, and if the enemy doesn't, their own officers will certainly refuse to fight. This portrait adds another layer to the suffocating shell of trapped despair that pervades the film. <br /> <br /> A kind of ground-based companion to Das Boot frames the epic WWII fight in a personal light and the unexpected prospect of the ordinary German soldier as a sort of hero made tragic by the circumstances and a brutal government that would have perverted its sacrifice.
