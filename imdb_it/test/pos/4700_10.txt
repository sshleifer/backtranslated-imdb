"Sister Helen" is a superb documentary on a stiff, intolerant nun, with a dirty, bitter, oblate (civil) mouth who runs a shelter for drunks and drug addicts in a very run down neighborhood in the southern Bronx. All but one of the 21 residents are drunk / addicted. Robert, the only representative of the middle class ?? had a real job, home and even a BMW ?? he regrets being dead before he could drive her away. Why? <br /> <br /> Robert, like six of the residents, was on probation. He complained that Helen was brandishing a huge stick on him and constantly threatened to let him in if he didn't pull the cows. In an "extra" interview, did you say that Helen ran the center to compensate for the death of the three men in her life? her husband and her two boys. <br /> <br /> The husband was an alcoholic who died of a heart attack at age 55. One boy died of a heroin overdose and the other was stabbed to death at 15. Helen stayed with a daughter, whom she abandoned for running to the center. The daughter was not happy. He wanted his mother <br /> <br /> What is fascinating is how little Helen has changed. Outwardly, it seems to have made a huge change. But after seeing this compelling and disturbing video a couple of times - once with the narrating directors - it became clear that Helen replaced 21 male drug addicts at the head around to replace her three dead males. <br /> <br /> Helen admits that she ignored her children and spent every day in bars. But his arrogance, intolerance and sharp tongue did not emerge at the age of 56. Living with her had to be extremely difficult. Even Robert says he stayed clean despite Helen. <br /> <br /> The film opens with Elena abusing a man who wants to live sheltered. Presumably she is showing her street expert. Another time she publicly fades Mel, his "assistant" for not taking a bath for a year. Then he shakes his dirty pillowcase in the air. The film is viscous with Helen threatening and belittling people. His signature song is "My Way". His favorite sentence is: "I will be totally honest with you." Often, people who use these sentences turn out to be the opposite. <br /> <br /> The residents are really down and out. Only Robert has marketable skills as well as pushing a broom. They all desperately need a roof over their heads, and Helen, since she runs the place alone, has the power to admit or evict anyone she likes. It does not have a board of directors to answer to and does not obtain public funding. It's his show. <br /> <br /> Helen believes in the approach of cookies to sobriety. He has stopped drinking cold turkey and this means that everyone else can too. He blames the abuse of drugs or alcohol substances, and not the underlying problems that led men to drink and take drugs. She is not a therapist, only a lady of the house who dyes her hair, wears a habit, exercises complete power over her tenants and stops drinking. <br /> <br /> Helen also opposes her inmates asking for urine (ureen she calls him) to test the requests. Twice as great, a very solid and respected long-term resident - whom he trusted - failed the tests. Helen was furious and evicted him. The major remained standing and said that the results were wrong because he had never done heroin. Helen did not give in and could not consider a mistake that could have been made. This was particularly worrying since he had known Major for a long time. Yet he discounted his relationship with him, believed he was a liar and relied completely on the results. The major eventually discovered that codeine in his cough syrup presented itself as an opiate. Helen has never publicly apologized, but presumably was privately constituted privately. <br /> <br /> Helen also had a very flawed reputation in her old neighborhood. He tacitly admitted to Robert that he once got up very late one night to cut someone's tires. The person offended her and certainly deserved to have his tires cut. She was not a beautiful woman. So in the end, did you decide the only way to keep Travis's name (his surname) alive? since when the three male Travises died? he had to start the Travis Center. <br /> <br /> For some of the residents it was a great deal. They respected Helen and in return received a cheap, safe, sober and structured place to live. One however, said he preferred prison. Employees and drunks do not all need to be treated like children. Helen employed "old school" techniques that were discredited. However, no one was forced to stay in the center and for some it was certainly a positive experience. The Travis Center is not a treatment center. It is a residence for alcoholics and drug addicts that straighten out their lives. <br /> <br /> To receive the complete experience of Sister Helen, watch all the extra interviews plus the audio version in which the two directors share their experiences with Sister Helen and her guests.
