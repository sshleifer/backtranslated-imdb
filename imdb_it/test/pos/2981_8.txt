My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally published. The controversy surrounding the original version (adolescent nudity, physical intimacy and involuntary pregnancy) were subjects that never touched our vision of the film. We were close to the same age as Paul and Michelle and we lived many of the same intense and confused emotions. We were too young to be involved in simplistic (sometimes) acting and (sometimes) touching twists. This film told us in a way that an adult love affair could never have. I still remember sitting in the cinema with my girlfriend and holding her hand while she cried during the tragic (albiet sciroppose) final scenes.
