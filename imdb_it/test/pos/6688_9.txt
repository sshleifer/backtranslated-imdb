I'm a Jeff Bridges fan so I put it on DVD without having seen it before. I immediately became also fan of Kevin Spacey. <br /> <br /> The general plot of "alien in human body" was, in my experience, over, but I liked the approach adopted in K-PAX, which struck me as very different and much more sensitive to many others. Bridges is an excellent doctor (you * want * to tell him what you have in mind) and Spacey's expressions and gestures are perfect in the role. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Prot and the entirely human characters in the clinic is delightful, particularly the subtle manipulation of their behavior. <br /> <br /> The ending is bittersweet - I like the choice of Prot, but the final scenes (with Bridges) made me weep.
