I was a projectionist while in the United States he remembers this movie very well. we had just been installed with Stereo Sound !! o-o-o-o-o !! well, it was a big problem in 1959. the instructions came with the rollers. the overture was performed while the image of the projected curtain was closed and I followed the example also with the closed theater curtain. for the interval the theater curtain was closed and after five minutes I restarted the film with the projection curtain closed while the music was used as a call to the second part. Being the first stereo movie I've ever seen and being such a big music production, I definitely enjoyed watching it every time I showed it for the race.
