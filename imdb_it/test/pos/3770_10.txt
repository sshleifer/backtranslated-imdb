A mix of 70's drug humor along with a parody of medicine and classic storyline. As I have often said on this film - if you don't understand it - you are very disgusting ..... Classic lines like (parafarse) "I have this erection and it won't go away no matter how many times I do it. You are a nurse, what can you give me for this? "The nurse answers" all I have is 5 dollars and my wedding ring ... "Excellent soundtrack. The classic "Hyde has nothing to hide". It remains surprisingly close to the original plot - not that the original remains in the way of a joke ..... I haven't met anyone with a IQ out of 115 who doesn't find it hysterical. <br /> <br />
