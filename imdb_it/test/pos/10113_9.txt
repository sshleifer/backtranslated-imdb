This film was an excellent actor, excellent director and overall had an excellent history. I had a real life experience with a guy like "Radio". In the soccer program of my city, every year we had a boy with mental problems who practices, travels and has fun with the soccer team. This film is really true and I can identify myself 100%. A boy like "Radio" just needs to feel part of something; they need to feel like they are worth living. Here's how 'Radio' feels and that's why that kind of program was installed in my high school. This is a very touching film that was brought to the big screen. My father and I loved it and will always remember it as a film that tells a compelling story of the goodness and kindness of the man!
