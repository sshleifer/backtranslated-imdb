First of all, let it be known that I came to this film not for music; actually I find it repulsive. In fact, I was interested in the psychology of the punk subculture. On this point, the documentary did quite well. An unpleasant aspect is the numerous scenes in which the songs are played and the exasperated band and the belligerent crowd are shown in ecstasy. If you've seen the first scene like that, you've seen them all. This superfluous is a party made for the printing of texts for some of the songs. With these, the public is able to somehow mentally connect with the band. The lyrics are far more interesting than the confusion of sounds projected from the speakers. I don't know why all the texts have not been printed. Slow speechless scenes (ironic eh?, Given the numerous references to the speed of music) of the flow of the film. Interviews with fans and bands have also been penetrating, although there is disappointment when the latter band's interviews turn out to be not as exciting or entertaining as the first two. Overall, a good movie that I'm glad I saw. I'll check the follow-ups if I ever have a chance. <br /> <br /> Favorite quote: He tried to hide the fact that he couldn't play by rubbing peanut butter on himself and breaking the glass. <br /> <br /> Wide punk generalization: although their shame, lack of vocabulary and hygiene, and drug-induced oblivion is often hilarious, in the end it is understood that punks are just pathetic young people who rebel only for the good of rebellion seen through sophisticated texts and naive attempts to philosophize and politicize (ignoring the Black Flag, which are slightly less misled than their peers).
