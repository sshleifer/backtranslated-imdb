'' Meet Sherri..for an evening of pleasure and terror! '' Cheap special effects, cheese lines, yes his original 1978 film '' Nurse Sherri '' Start Geoffrey Land as Peter Desmond, and Jill Jacobson as Sherri Martin and Directed by Al Adamson. <br /> <br /> The film is about an ancient evil spirit who owns a nurse in a hospital, then starts killing the doctors one by one. The acting was ok, but some of the roles were robotic. the plot was good, but the sex scenes were probably thrown in there to get more points of view. The direction was bad, and the special effects seemed a design, the effects did not deceive anyone. The death scenes were pretty good but the director mixed too many things in there that didn't make sense like the sex scenes, nudity, football player and many others. <br /> <br /> Overall it's a good film, but not the best. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
