I don't see very bad in this film. Of course, the main singers may not be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they can certainly have a melody. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented songwriters and I happen to love their songs, especially "The World Is A Circle", "The things I won't miss" and "Question Me An Answer". Some argue that the choreography of Hermes Pan is horrible and that the snow-capped mountains seem to be made of plastic; I disagree on both counts. I saw snow before and the snow in those mountain scenes seemed realistic to me. And above all, in the defense of this film, it is appropriate for a family audience (at least I remember it this way when I saw it on Christmas day a few years ago). With all the clamor for sex and violence in the cinema These days, I find it interesting to note that this film deserves its G-rating. And they don't say that pert word "F" every ten minutes like some movies I've seen. Thank you God. So even though this movie might not be everyone's cup of tea, it has a ransom value and I give it ten points out of a possible ten. This is my story and I'm sticking to it.
