SPOILERS UNDER <br /> <br /> "A Dog's Life" was noteworthy for its excellent comedy time. In the other Charlie Chaplin film of 1918, `Shoulder Arms', the genius of silent cinema focuses on a completely different brand of humor. His war comedy specializes in surreal and exaggerated sets in which Chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and composition. When the soldier's bunker is flooded, the water level reaches the right height so that Chaplin can execute his gags more successfully. In a later scene, the soldier dresses like a tree, a disguise that belies Chaplin's ingenuity and nonsense. Of course, when the enemy discovers his stratagem, the soldier rushes towards the forest. The following chase is a visual marvel: Chaplin not only hides the soldier from the Germans, but uses the forest to mask the soldier even from the public, so that the camouflaged soldier remains unlocked in the middle of the frame, but somehow remains Invisible. All the while we thought our little hero was pulling hard on the German army; for our joy, the joke is also on us. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
