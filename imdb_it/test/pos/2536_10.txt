This is a difficult movie to watch, and it would have been even more difficult if I had known that the actor who played the protagonist had been killed at home by the police at age 19. Pixote (PeeWee) is a street boy in SÃ£o Paulo who is caught in a raid triggered by a murder in which he had no involvement. He is engaged in a juvenile prison in which he witnesses the brutality and exploitation that ordinary citizens try very hard to believe that he does not exist. When he finally escapes, he and three companions survive with the only means they know, which is a crime. What makes the film so heartbreaking is that both Pixote and the actor who portrays him clearly do not want to be the characters that the circumstances of life have made them. Pixote tries to trust, love and bond, but there is simply no room in her world for the kind side of human nature. Eventually one is left to desperately want to do something for the Pixotes of the world, but what? Building more prisons for children with higher walls is definitely not the answer ...
