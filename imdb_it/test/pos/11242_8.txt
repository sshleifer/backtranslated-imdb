I can't say that this show is perfect. Perhaps all the previous commentators remember the old 10:30 Tuesday slot taken from the childish humor of Butch Elvira Curt ("There is a space shuttle that mounts a 747!"). Oh, the glory of shuffling to hit any key on the remote to change it. <br /> <br /> Face it, the comedy cannot bring out a showcase and create the comic genius of the Canadian Trailer Park Boys. But hey, they try. <br /> <br /> This show is by far one of the best original shows. However, none of the following people will find themselves laughing at the apparent "players" who show their stupidity in gathering girls: <br /> <br /> a) "Stupid" girls - Obviously, they cannot realize that they are just like the show girls. Unaware. Jump on the man's flesh, tomorrow you can call yourself a whore and get her name. It looks good, it must be popular and kind. HAHAHAHA !!! Oh, but you would never do it! No one would do that ... if they knew what was happening <br /> <br /> b) Unsociable guys who think women are good guys - Obviously seeing these guys succeed in what you fail or not even experience is going for boil your primary rabies. Look closer, they are cut down most of the time. They say stupid crap. <br /> <br /> c) Girls with mutual respect - Obviously seeing your distinctly distinct female species get caught up in real world situations is wrong wrong. No one plays. Women are not objects, they cannot be played, because they are all very faithful angels who attend clubs to converse politely with each other without fear that the boys try to collect them. <br /> <br /> Oh wait ... hmmmmmmmm <br /> <br /> HOW MUCH EVERYONE will say that this show isn't fun, and that it doesn't teach you anything, I have to take the opposite side. The show is very good in describing how relationships work for both men and women. The way they think, the way they think about each other and the social hierarchy. It's fun to see and hear kids making absolutely idiotic comments to things women say ("My grandfather died recently" "Oh ... well, are we having fun tonight?"). <br /> <br /> Also, its a club. The place where people go to have fun and fuck. No matter who you are, you're going to a club to get or pay attention to someone. The boys go there to test their game and collect the girls. The girls go there to flirt with the boys and find the one who pushes her feet away at best. Lightened! <br /> <br /> If you are a boy, learn a thing or two about the different approaches and the different effects they have. If you are a girl, learn what these "studly" bitches really think and learn to tell them apart from real men. The next time you are destroyed by one of those douchewads, don't realize it because of him, because you're stupid and you thought he was the greatest ever when he was clearly a dick for you all the time
