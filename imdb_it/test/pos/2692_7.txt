I need help identifying an episode of King of Queens. Start with a scene where Doug is talking to Carrie on the phone, and suggests accepting to stop any conversation with "I love you". However, it is difficult to do and he ends up calling her back, only to close with "I love you". It is a very intelligent moment and I think it speaks a lot about long-lasting relationships. <br /> <br /> I THINK (but I'm sure) that it's the same episode where Doug gets some guys from the local building to whistle and throw dirty comments at Carrie to revive his spirits. <br /> <br /> I saw this episode recently, but it was probably a repeat. I don't know in which network I saw it. Can anyone tell me the title and season of this episode?
