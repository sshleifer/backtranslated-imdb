Watching John Cassavetes' debut film is a strange experience, even if you've already seen improvisational films. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is the roughness. Immediately, it is obvious that some characters are ruining their lines. But then you move away from the situation, as you go deeper into the intimate exchanges of these people and ask yourself: "Have I ever stumbled into MY words?" Obviously the answer is certain, we all do it. It is a pity that most of the gaffes in this regard arrive soon in the picture, because, of about twenty minutes, you have sunk so deeply that you wouldn't know if a bomb exploded behind you. <br /> <br /> The next thing you notice ... or maybe you realize that hours or days after the end of the film, it's that you've never seen a substantial plot, but the themes and poetry of dialogue and characters never leave you. In fact, the treatment of the role that the race plays in the daily life of these characters is always there, but it is so ephemeral that not even they are aware of how they are informing their opinions about themselves, about their self-awareness, about their perceived state, or the fate of their relationships. <br /> <br /> The title is appropriate because you get a full spectrum of blacks, whites and grays ... and not just in the pigmentation of the characters' skin. Leila Goldoni (truly remarkable here) is African-American / Caucasian, her two brothers are white and dark African Americans. The irony is that they exist in what is undoubtedly the most tolerant and "hippest" atmosphere of the time ... the manhatten higher than east-west beaten ... and there are still conflicts within and around themselves. <br /> <br /> I don't think I've ever seen a film with such a subtle delivery or technique. It looks a lot like a really great piece of art gallery and then just makes us a nod of happiness as you look back at the images it has evoked after days. <br /> <br /> Great command and extras on the Criterion disc. Probably the first truly experimental independent film ever made.
