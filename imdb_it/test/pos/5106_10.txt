I loved the film and the story immensely! I saw the original (I believe in 1939) and I liked both. To really appreciate the story you need to know the English culture and customs. The professor. (Peter O'Toole) was dedicated to his school and "boys" in that school. It was an English "public" school, which in the United States refers to as a private school (E.G. Andover). He is a very ascetic person and, on the surface, gives the impression of being rigid, suffocating, indifferent and weak to the point of being effeminate. He is strict in his educational standards because he takes care of "his boys", that is, he does not want them to get an economic or weak education. He meets (through the introduction) a "ballroom girl" (Petula Clark) and is totally in love. In England at the time, the reference to the "ballroom" bore the connotation of extreme sexual promiscuity and was decidedly "lower class". We find out that Prof. is indeed a very tough and courageous and loyal person to the people and institutions he loves and / or respects. Clark becomes more than a lover and a wife ... she "leaves" her personality and allows her to grow as a man and a person, to the benefit of her beloved school and her own happiness. The first film was set BEFORE the Second World War, this runs through the Second World War, also, it's 1969 (we had the "British Invasion" ... Beetles, etc. Clark has had successes and was very popular then. .. still is for me), the music is excellent, excellent colors and photography. I think O'Toole played the character perfectly! There are dedicated people like "Chips" ... all around us but many don't receive the recognition. Very funny movies and stories!
