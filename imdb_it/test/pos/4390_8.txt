I was really and wonderfully surprised by "O Brother, where are you?" The video store was out of all the movies I was planning to rent, so I came across this. I went home and while I was watching I immersed myself and found myself laughing hard. The Coens have made a great film again. But I think the first time you watch this movie, you know the characters. The second time, now that you know them, you laugh so much that it could hurt you. I highly recommend ANYONE to see it, because if you are not, you really lack a cinematic gem for centuries. 10/10
