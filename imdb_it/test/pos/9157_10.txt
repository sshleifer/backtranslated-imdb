Hey, you're not alone! I remember Nichols! I was only 17 when he was on. I remember that James Garner was one of the most interesting actors, and Nichols was a great show. I could not believe that it was in such a short time, I wish I could remember the last episode, I probably didn't see it ... there weren't any VCRs then when you saw it you saw it, and if you missed a episode had gone forever, unless he returned to the summer replicas. However, surely it would be nice if it came out on DVD, but I don't think many people knew it. What a shame. <br /> <br /> Garner would have achieved success a few years later with Rockford Files, and he brought his friend Stuart Margolin from Nichols with him to play the role of his helper Angel.
