I really like the show !! As part of Greek Life, I can say that some things are exaggerated, but overall it's still pretty damn funny. <br /> <br /> Rusty is a cute character, his roommate is HILARIOUS and the whole cast is fun in his rights. I like it to focus on individual situations and interpersonal relationships with organizations. <br /> <br /> This show covers everything, and they do it without cursing or anything else negative (how else could it be on ABC Family?). <br /> <br /> My favorites are Cappie (obviously), Rusty's roommate and pretty much all Kappa Tau. This show is a great springboard for them and I'm excited to see which doors will open. <br /> <br /> Please renew this show next summer, ABC Family. Like I said, love, love, love !!
