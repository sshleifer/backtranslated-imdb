Yes, perhaps there are parts of this film that require a little suspicion, but this does not detract from the charm and wonder of the film. It was shown as part of our city's youth film festival and was the favorite of the organizing committee. Which is not surprising The topic - which meets in a South Africa torn by the race, although post-apartheid, is of great relevance and the treatment of the theme is inspirational. Of course, as the previous comment mentions the film has its flaws, but the realism of the setting and the way the director treats his subject belies these shortcomings. I saw it with my wife and we came back the same evening with the children. A film to watch, meditate, discuss and act.
