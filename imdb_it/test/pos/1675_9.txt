Or viceversa. <br /> <br /> This is a French noir film directed by an American director (Jules Dassin) who had to leave the country for being listed on the Hollywood blacklist thanks to HUAC. The premise of the story is quite familiar - a last jewel for Tony the Stephanois and his peaks - and so is the ending with all those who come ... Well, no spoilers here, for sure, since this is the kind of film where the tension towards the ending is important. <br /> <br /> Dassin filmed in realistic black and white lighting on the streets of Paris using actors and actresses who are not glamorous. The captivating - at times intrusive - Georges Auric soundtrack enhances the film well and will remind many viewers of a soundtrack similar to the American noir films of the forties and fifties. Jean Servais plays the title role in a fedora as much as Humphrey Bogart could have interpreted it. Tony is just out of jail, beyond his first, but still tough and determined when it must be, his mind still sharp when focused, the kind of antihero whose eyes water even if the tears will never fall. <br /> <br /> Dassin plays the Italian burglar and aspiring gentleman who knows the rules, but lets himself be distracted. <br /> <br /> In the film noir we are forced by the logic and focus of the film to identify with the bad guys. Often there are bad levels, the "good" bad guys we identify with and the bad "bad guys" who are out to do our good bad guys, and then maybe there is a villain or two villains. (Here we have Remi Grutter, played by Robert Hossein, a bit sadistic junkie.) Then there are the cops who are irrelevant or nearly so. In the most modern film noir the villains are not even "good" villains, and they get along with it or something similar. In the old film noir, which evolved from the gangster films of the thirties, the usual motto, following the old Hollywood "code", was "Crime Does not Pay", with every criminal having to pay for his crime before the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Probably the most impressive feature of Rififi is how pleasantly the film moves. The plot unfolds quickly and seamlessly, just as the great directors, directors like Stanley Kubrick, Louis Malle and the best of Hitchcock always did. Some have actually compared this to Kubrick of The Killing (1956) and suggest that Kubrick stole a little. Well, the filmmakers always steal if necessary, and there are some who perhaps tell similarities, like "a last robbery" for the protagonist, and make the girl masturbate the works. The similarities could go deeper because, while this film was approaching the end, I suddenly thought, oh, no! the suitcase in the back seat will fly out of the convertible, hit the ground, explode and all the money will fly in the air! Those of you who have seen The Killing could remember what happened to the money towards the end of the movie! Which reminds me of another film with something bad happening to money: Oliver Stone's U Turn (1997) with Sean Penn. There the money in his backpack is blown to pieces by a barrage of hunting rifles. Hahaha! Obtaining the double version of this film would be an act of sacrilege since the dialogue (when there are some: the shot itself is done entirely without dialogue, about 30 minutes) is tense and easy to follow and requires only an occasional look to subtitles, which, by the way, are rather utilitarian and guiding rather than having every word spelled out. <br /> <br /> Another thing: all the brutality is made like sex was used in the film, that is outside the camera. A boy gets his throat cut. We don't see it. I like this approach. We don't have to see the blood. You could almost let your kids see Rififi - almost. <br /> <br /> Catch this now and you're looking for a Hollywood shoot with Al Pacino and directed by Harold Becker due out next year when you can be sure that the violent scenes will be played in full.
