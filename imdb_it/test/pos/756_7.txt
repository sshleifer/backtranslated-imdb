You will love or hate films like this thriller set in a lonely kindergarten in a distant and lonely land. It is not so much a horror show, but a mix of frightening images and wackozoid mental patients. "Scream" is the best term to use in what was obviously a popular classic drive-in known for some strange and evil behavior. Notice the "judge", who is about to put the doctor behind him! Brr-r-r-r !!! Not much else can be described here apart from some good-natured goodness, but when you can, remember the old saying of the old witch: "Get out! Get out! And never come back!" Wouldn't you like me not to have looked in the basement?
