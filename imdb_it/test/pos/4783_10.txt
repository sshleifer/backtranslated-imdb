This was the first Mickey Mouse comic book released and the first cartoon with sound. It was based on a silent film called "Steamboat Bill, Jr." played by Buster Keaton. Back at Mickey's, Mickey didn't talk and didn't have gloves. He could only whistle and play music. The song he played was "Turkey in the Straw" using different poultry as musical instruments. He plays the teeth of a cow like a xylophone and plays the teats of a nurse sow like an accordion keyboard. Captain Pete, however, is very angry and makes Mickey peel in the kitchen. Pete's parrot flies towards the window and orders him to peel the potatoes. Mickey Mouse throws a half-peeled potato to the parrot and laughs, thus closing the cardboard. I was able to get this cartoon on tape and I really like it. I think Disney shorts are much better than feature films.
