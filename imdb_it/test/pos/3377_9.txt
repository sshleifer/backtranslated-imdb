I wanted to see it, to take a look inside the show. He told the story more about Robin Williams, then about Mork & Mindy. Anyway, I thought it was great. We have seen, Robin is always 'on', no matter what. The Diamontopolous performance was fantastic. <br /> <br /> The presentations of the main players seem to me so real. Roebuck like Garry Marshall was wonderful. He was so charming in this, that he helped me get over all of Williams' energy. The little backstage pieces of his other shows (Happy Days and Laverne & Shirley) were illuminating. I also thought that the Richmond-Peck Harvey was also a beautiful rock in the pond. (This is a good thing). <br /> <br /> This film told the secular history of the people of Hollywood, passing through the ups and downs of celebrity. It kept me glued to my TV, and I learned to love Robin, well, of course, mostly everyone seems to be the super people I sometimes think is Hollywood. Go figure. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wonder why people in the network are always interpreted as idiots. We have never seen the head of the ABC. I just heard it, like Charlie by Charlie Angels (I wonder if it's so planed?). It seems so sad, that a show at number 1 could be so destroyed by their own network. <br /> <br /> I think this story can be told about anyone's life as they climb the ladder of any job. Movies and TV stars are always loved or hated by so many people, with whom you grew up, you just want to go back to their past, remember your past. I remember watching the show and I always wondered what will happen in their personal lives. <br /> <br /> Mork and Mindy will always be part of me, and I could see part of it. It may not be all true, it's not even a lie, but in the end he told me a wonderful story, sad and happy.
