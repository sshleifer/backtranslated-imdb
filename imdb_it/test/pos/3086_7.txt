This is a funny movie and I like it a lot. Cary Elwes plays Robin Hood in a t-shirt. This is, of course, the usual good against evil with Robin against the evil Nottingham Sheriff. Humor is kind of stuff for most of the face, but it still works well. A comedy for a night when you don't want to think much, it's worth paying a rent!
