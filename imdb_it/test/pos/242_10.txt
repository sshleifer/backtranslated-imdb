I really like this film because of all the stars, the dance and the history that accompanies it. Rita Hayworth was the most fascinating in this musical and the costumes were fantastic. Despite being a musical, I thought that Rita Hayworth also played drama well in this film. As far as dancing is concerned, I think it was excellent. Even Betty Grable practically supported Rita's dances in this film, commenting that Rita danced around her dances and let's face it, Betty Grable was an excellent dancer. Cinematography and bright colors are also noticeable. Rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine but is also in love with her mentor played by Gene Kelly. Does he leave Kelly to fulfill his dream and overcome the love and celebrity of Broadway or does he stop to find that unique pearl that will change his life forever? You'll have to watch the movie to find out!
