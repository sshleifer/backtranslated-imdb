WHEN EVERY idea has been successful during those "Golden Days" of Silent Movies, you could bet your lower dollar that it would be repeated; even if "Reprocessing" is the term that is used. Obviously it could be argued that this reworking activity has never left us, because success in movies or on TV always leads to a trend; with all the competing parties who challenge each other to propose their own version of the famous movie or television program. <br /> <br /> We strongly disagree with this premise; because this is script or plagiarism, simple and simple. <br /> <br /> THIS, the last Silent Laurel & Hardy Short, must have been very well received; for ANGORA LOVE (Hal Roach / MGM, 1929) it was reworked on Lotto di salsi, not once, but twice in the following three years. We were treated to RISATA GRAVIA (Roach / MGM, 1931), in which the Capra was replaced with a cute puppy. Moreover, time turns into the heart of winter, in the midst of a snowstorm. They also made other line-up changes with the replacement of the owner Edgar Kennedy with the owner Charlie Hall. <br /> <br /> The second reworking of the hidden animal premise is 3 Reeler, THE CHIMP (Roach / MGM, 1932), which replaced a female monkey by a dissolved and deceased Circus, to which Stan and Babe were former employees . The circus paid its employees with their assets and the boys received the chimpanzee as their last payday. <br /> <br /> BACK to our original "victim", today's topic, ANGORA LOVE. Recomember? The short starts quite simply. The boys meet the Goat in the street and the Tata reciprocates them in their home; after Stan gave her a donut. The following comic moments are generated by the interaction between L & H and the slow-burn exponent, Edgar Kennedy, their Landlord. The impact of the accident is amplified by the interaction at night. And luckily he would have liked; their room is located directly above the house of the landlord. <br /> <br /> In addition to the noise, the goat's bath, its smell and the owner's suspicions of Edgar, Laurel and Hardy have another person illegally in the room; we were more amused by a small gag thrown away, which may have been ignored by the Censors. While warning the boys about the noise they were making, he reminded them of the rules of the house regarding any unauthorized person who was there during the night, regardless of sex. <br /> <br /> ITS was taken from inside The Boy's room, over the shoulder. With Edgar in the lobby and in front of them, he warns; "Remember, this is a respectable structure!" Just as this says, a lady dressed in evening gowns walks across and behind the owner; followed by a uniformed sailor, who lifts his hat forward as he passes! POOL SCHNITZ !!
