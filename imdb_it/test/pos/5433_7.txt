I went to see this thinking it would be a great comedy and a comeback for Robin Williams, but when I saw it I realized that the advertisers had lied to me because this is more dramatic than the comedy, even if it has some really good laughs in it. It looked like I was watching two movies. One was a fun romp-with Robin Williams that should have been the whole basin for the film anyway, but it also gets a techno thriller movie with political angst in the middle. I really don't know how to classify this movie. But I can tell you that it was nice and I laughed, not as much as I hoped, but at least Williams is back in the right direction. See this but know that before you go it's not all comedy and it's a bit intense.
