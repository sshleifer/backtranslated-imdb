An opera diva has an accident, which leaves the door open for her replacement to take on the role. Betty (Marsillach) is now the protagonist of Mac Beth, but someone hiding in the trenches has her own planned work. He gets his kicks to tie Betty, putting needles under his eyes (so he can't close them) and kill the members of the opera company before his eyes. <br /> <br /> "Opera" is certainly one of the most ambitious Silver films, like mixing it with Shakesphere's Macbeth, there is obviously the fact that the work performed in the film is the version of Macbeth by Giuseppe Verdi, but also Argento, just like Shakespeare uses crows as a harbinger of death and misfortune. And like the ravens that surround the castle of Dunsinane, foretelling the disappearance of the complicated Macbeth, the ravens of OPERA play a key role in the fall of the killer. Also, just like in the old comedy, the killer acts on his lover's exhortation. But I don't want to go so far as to say that OPERA wants to be a remake of The Phantom of the Opera or Macbeth, the similarities are too subtle. It's just a typical masterpiece by Argento, and with it it gives this otherwise simple enough thriller a vivid hue of Gothic mysticism. <br /> <br /> Although this film has negative aspects like the heavy metal soundtrack, it does not fit with this film and the final scenes of this film are a bit strange. <br /> <br /> All in all "Opera" is an imperfect but still good masterpiece.
