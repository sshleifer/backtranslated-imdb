"Traffik 1989" is an Emmy award that won six miniseries in six parts of the UK that was the inspiration for the Academy Award "Traffic 2000". The five-hour movie breaks the opium / heroin trade for the viewer from hand-poppy seed transmission in an Afghan camp to an addict's "rush" to an apartment in England. Not only does "Traffik" offer entertainment value through interleaved dramatic stories, but it also provides an overview of the international drug trade at all levels, responding to who, where, how and why the questions of the old and unstoppable machine of supply / of the narcotic question. Honestly fun and educational, "Traffik" will prove to be a time well spent for boys and up. (A)
