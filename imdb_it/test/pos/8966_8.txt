Charlie Wilson (two-time Oscar winner: Tom Hanks) is an accommodating deputy ... Who likes to party, enjoy the company of the woman and above all drink his alcohol. When the old friend and ex-girlfriend of Charlie, Joanne Herring (Oscar winner: Julia Roberts), wants Charlie to visit Afghanistan, which surely needs help. Charlie is shocked by what he saw, especially from all different ages are killed or injured by this war with the Russians. He decides to help the population and the rebels fight the Russians, who started the war. Charlie, Joanne and a CIA agent disowned by the name of Gust Avrakotos (Oscar winner: Philip Seymour Hoffman) will start a good fight to bring the biggest secret operation in history. <br /> <br /> Directed by Oscar-Winner: Mike Nichols (The Birdcage, About Henry, Wolf) has created a satirical, lively and entertaining war comedy based on a true story. Hanks, Roberts, Hoffman in an Oscar nominated performance and Amy Adams as Charlie's faithful assistant are very good in their roles. Despite the excellent premise of real life, "Charlie Wilson's War" never catches fire and isn't as wickedly fun as you liked. Director Nichols and writer: Aaron Sorkin (A Few Good Men) keeps things moving and the characters are well appreciated in everything. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a strong Pan & Scan transfer (1.33: 1) and a good Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The only peculiarities of the DVD are the featurettes behind the scenes with the cast and crew and a real featurette with Charlie Wilson and others. "Charlie Wilson's War" is a good movie that could have been really great but it is not. But this film is smart enough to satisfy those who have enjoyed well-written or well-performed adult comedies. (*** 1/2 on *****).
