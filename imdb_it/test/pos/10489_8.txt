"Il Prezzo Del Potere" by Tonino Valerii. "The Price Of Power" is an excellent and compelling Spaghetti Western that mirrors the Kennedy assassination. A great interpretation of Giuliano Gemma and an excellent soundtrack by Luis Bacalof are just two of the many reasons to watch this film. <br /> <br /> In 1881 Texas is divided between those who appreciate the abolition of slavery and just want to live in peace, and those who, after 16 years, still want to reinstall the confederation. Despite warnings, President James Garfield, who wants to establish a new equality policy, decides to visit Dallas, where corrupt law enforcement officials are planning his assassination. Bill Willer (Giuliano Gemma) and two of his friends, a black man named Jack Donovan (Ray Shaunders), and a crippled guy Nick (Manuel Zarzo) are determined to prevent the President's murder. <br /> <br /> Since James Garfield was not murdered by racists, who wanted to reinstall the confederacy in Texas but in Washington DC by mentally unstable Charles Guiteau, the "Price Of Power" plot is, of course, historic without sense. Since the film does not, however, claim historical accuracy, but tries to allude to the 1963 Kennedy assassination in Dallas, the fact that the story is fictitious is legitimate. <br /> <br /> Giuliano Gemma offers excellent performances as the main character Bill Willer, Benito Stefanelli is as big as the sheriff and corrupt Sheriff Jefferson. Other good performances are those of Ray Shaunders like Jack, Bill's black friend, Warren Vanders as Arthur McDonald, the president's advisor, and Fernando Rey as Pinkerton, a rich and evil businessman. Luis Enr√≠quez Bacalov's score is fantastic, photography and locations are fantastic and (as in Valerii's "Day Of Anger") they remind Sergio Leone, for whom Valerii worked as an assistant director on "A Fistful Of Dollars "and" for a few dollars more ". <br /> <br /> That said, "Il Prezzo Del Potere" is, after "Day Of Anger", another excellent Spaghetti Western that shows both the great talent of Giuliano Gemma as an actor and Tonino Valerii as a director. "The Price of Power" is a must for Spaghetti Western enthusiasts, and I highly recommend it to everyone else. 8/10
