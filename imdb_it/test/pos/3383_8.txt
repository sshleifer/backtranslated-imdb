North and South is a miniseries of the "golden age" of the television miniseries in the 1980s, which was a time for long and overwhelming epics with high production values ​​and many stellar cameos. It is, for the most part, excellent for what it is, although I personally prefer the less soap-opera elements of history and the sense of history. <br /> <br /> James Read and Patrick Swayze deliver excellent performances - in particular Read, whose George Hazard acts as an emotional anchor in the midst of a often melodramatic story. The series also contains high-level works by Kirstie Alley, Wendy Kilbourne, Hal Holbrook, Lewis Smith, Genie Francis, Georg Stanford Brown and others. Even the costumes, the shooting, the sets and the music are of first quality. <br /> <br /> Don't take it as a history lesson, but take it for what it is: a well done epic, overwhelming from a bygone era. The second book, which followed a year later, is also excellent, but I would advise viewers to skip book 3, which came out 8 years after the second book and which was not as good as the first two parts. Books 1 and 2 are classics, albeit with their most delicate elements, and it is worth looking at them.
