Ok, I think we all agree that Michael Jackson was the weak point. <br /> <br /> And special effects too. But please keep in mind that this was NOT a big budget movie, okay? Not all films have a budget as high as Harry Potter or Star Wars. <br /> <br /> However, I thought it was quite fun. B-? Nothing that, in my opinion, would waste your time. <br /> <br /> Parodies are always fun to watch, and just because it wasn't a big budget doesn't mean it's ugly. <br /> <br /> I think it was a good movie, although weak in some places. <br /> <br /> I hope this comment helps. ~ Angela
