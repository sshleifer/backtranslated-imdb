If you have seen the Telugu version of Gilli "Okkadu", you will find that this is very similar in the plot, but Gilli has different songs and takes place in Tamil Nadu and not in Andra pradesh. Although this is a remake of "Okkadu" you will discover that Vijay and Trisha make this a unique film, Vijay and Trisha make it a great couple. Some downsides were when Vijays 'character slapped Trishas' character for buying a present for him, never apologizes and eventually stays with him. The good deed and the songs make this great movie all around, I recommend it. <br /> <br /> I give him a 10/10, one of the best I've ever seen.
