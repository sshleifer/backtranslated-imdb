Alfred Hitchcock's remake of "The man who knew too much" is usually not considered as good as the original, but for me it's one of the best films ever. I prefer it to "Vertigo" and "Rear Window." <br /> <br /> Like "North By Northwest", it's the story of an average man who is unwittingly thrown into the world of international intrigue. James Stewart plays the father of a kidnapped son because he is mistaken for an international spy. He will do anything to make sure he regains his son and protects his family. <br /> <br /> While the original was good for its time, it is difficult to observe by today's standards. The remake has excellent production quality, a captivating Doris Day and a truly terrifying villain. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about renting this because you'll want to see it over and over again.
