To think that this film was made the year I was born. To think that people still have their constitutional rights taken away, now in the name of "national security". To think that this film was intentionally banned by the American public. PUNISHMENT PARK faces the political gap in the United States better than any film I've ever seen. If he had been seen more widely, would he have changed anything? A film like this is so polarizing, it has the potential to cause riots. It shakes you and forces you to take a stand. Makes you address the question: are you for the right of dissent of the people in time of war, or because the constitution is compromised in the name of "national security"? The protagonists are forced by the government to run towards the American flag in a game that undermines the same ideals that the flag represents. The acting is totally convincing. So, I can't see any acting going on here. If this is a copied documentary, it is more convincing than any reality TV show today. PUNISHMENT PARK is perhaps the most important film ever made. It really makes you think.
