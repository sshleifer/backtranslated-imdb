I saw the 2-hour version of Choker Bali. I can't say it's long. The film has a certain natural rhythm and does not seem to be late at any time. The costume and the set remind us of what we would see in old movies. <br /> <br /> Aishwarya Rai did a good job of acting. It's really a mature role with enough space to act within the story. The script also supports the story very well. Aishwarys acts as the unfortunate widow whose husband dies in the first year of marriage. The film is about the passions and desires of such a character and the conflict he faces with the overwhelming condition of the widows of those times. <br /> <br /> His best friend in this film is played by Raima Sen he was also well-handled. His innocence and his admiration for Aishwarya's ability to speak English and behave well were done very well. These are really some of the prevailing mentalities of those times. We can see how far we have come from a similar era! <br /> <br /> The film is about the liberation of women as a thin line in history. I found the development of the story very similar to Ghare Bahire also written by Tagore. It is part of the struggle for independence and contrasts the struggle for Indian independence against the silent struggle for women's rights. <br /> <br /> A well-made film certainly deserves to be seen. The recitation of Aishwarya: par excellence. Rituparna has managed the story with great care. Yet another Rabindranath Tagore classic.
