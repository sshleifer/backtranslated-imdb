Paul Bettany has played a great role as a tortured father, whose favorite child tragically dies of diseases. For this, it deserves all the credit. However, the film dealt mainly with this, keeping Darwin's adventures while collecting data for his theories as incomplete stories told to children and completely skipping disputes concerning his ideas. <br /> <br /> Two things bothered me terribly: the soundtrack, with its whining sound, almost pushes sadness into the spectator's throat, and the trailer of the film, which shows some beautiful scenarios, his theological reflections and his wife and the enthusiasm of his best friends as they prepare for a battle against blind faith, thus completely misrepresenting the film. <br /> <br /> To put it bluntly, if the movie trailer scenes were to be removed, the result would be a non-descriptive family drama about a little dying child and his parents' difficulties as a result. Clearly, that's not what I expected from a Darwin movie, even though the film was beautifully interpreted.
