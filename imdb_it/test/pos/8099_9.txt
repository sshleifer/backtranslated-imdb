Chaplin plays the dual role of Jewish barber who, with amnesia, is mistaken for the dictator Adenoid Hynkel (ie Hitler). A film made in 1940 when the war was in its dark days and was in no way defeated by the allies. .it was banned in Germany by Hitler and was a risk in one way for Chaplin because if the war was lost, he would certainly be sent away to be "re-educated" <br /> <br /> A funny satire with the classical scene of Hitler who turns around a giant balloon of the world..good fun but with a message..a little preacher at the end. This was the last film with Chaplin's mustache. on a scale of one to ten..9
