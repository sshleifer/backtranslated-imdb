This film is complex and interesting in many ways. It is an endless array of taboo emotions and arguments. Sex and love. Emotional abuse of women on men, physical abuse of women by men, sexual abuse of minors, new approach to religion in real life and all connected with very crude and powerful blues music. <br /> <br /> I promise you that if you sit in the first 20 minutes you will find the draw and improvement of all the characters. And the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect. The music is exceptional, the writing is powerful and everyone's acting was brilliant. <br /> <br /> And the DVD has some great features, including the background of Samuel Jackson to learn to play the guitar and hear the blues. <br /> <br /> This film is not for children and I also pay attention to parents of teenagers.
