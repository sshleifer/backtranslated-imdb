'Checking Out' is an extraordinary film that dominates most of the film production. His refreshing and witty humor is never an excuse to remain superficial. On the contrary, the film explores the many facets of the human spirit and human relationships. His warm approach fosters tolerance and acceptance of diversity and recognition of what unites all people. The characters are fascinating and fun, reflecting those idiosyncrasies we can all laugh at ourselves. Quick dialogue and jokes will keep you on tiptoe and you may find yourself trying to contain your laughter, since you won't want to miss a sentence! You will probably want to see it at the cinema and then again (several times over) on video, and each time you will discover something new. After each viewing, you're sure to feel warm and relieved.
