The Nightbreed drove me crazy the first time I saw it. And it has held up quite well over the years. Monster sets and effects work, they are among the best I've ever seen. No one I know seems to have seen this film, which I believe he dug at the box office, due to the lack of interest in horror, in the early 1990s. It plays like a dark and horrible fairy tale, and is much deeper, so one might think, with a strong message against bigotry, presented by a rich mystical past, created by Clive Barker. What sucks is that the film ends with a very interesting note, which we'll probably never see. My only minor complaint is that Craig Sheffer is at best a passable actor, and the project may have benefited from a better actor in the part. Only a small complaint, however, like Sheffer is fine. I had a similar problem with Scott Bakula in Barker's Lord Of Illusions, not really a terrible performance, but I didn't like the role as much as I did other people.
