I consider this a breathtaking but deceptive film because it seems so simple and direct: a survivor from Vietnam tells his heartbreaking story and part of the story is re-edited on the spot. Sometimes reviewers even claim that Herzog's presence in the film is minimal, but how wrong they are. We know that all documentaries are "mediated" to some extent and this has the subtle hand of Herzog everywhere, particularly in extraordinary music, in the incredibly expert selection of archival footage and in cascade image management. The evocative power of this film is staggering, starting from the title, the opening title of the book of "Revelation" and the initial off-screen voice. This is a film that you can watch repeatedly with increasing wonder, not just a product that is swallowed up by your favorite beverage on the way to the evening news. This is one of those movies that can resonate with you for life.
