Klatret © ªsen (Catch That Girl) is really a fantastic movie! It is a 'happy' film. I saw this movie in "Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival (PiFan)" on July 12th 2003. There is Action + Adventure + Comedy + Thrill + Happy + Romance (love triangle for cute kids!). You have to see this movie. :)
