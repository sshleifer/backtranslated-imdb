"Who Will Love My Children" The saddest film I've ever seen. Defined 10/10. Released on TV in 1983. The film was released on VHS. The DVD version is a must, sooner or later. Mom dying of cancer, must find homes for all her children before she dies, because her thoughts are that her husband and father are unable to take care of him once he is dead. He manages to find homes for children except one, a boy who is not wanted because he suffers from epilepsy. Very sad when you didn't want it. In a real tear-jerker, get your hands on this movie. I'm a boy too, I was crying when I watched this movie. Not to be missed.
