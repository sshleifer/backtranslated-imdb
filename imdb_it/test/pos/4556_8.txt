A certain remake of PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES in many ways. I think, I think it's such a bad and sad coincidence that John Candy and Chris Farley left us when they still had a lot to do. God bless them both, I think the plots of 2 films are very similar, Road Trips of two different poles of characters, and a lot of unfortunate consequences because of the Chubbies, This film can't be Planes train and Automobiles but it's a movie really funny especially with great performance by Chris Farley, The missing part of this film is the touching stuff if we compare it with Candy & Martin Classic, but I think it's better this way
