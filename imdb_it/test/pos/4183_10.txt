This film, like most of their music, is underestimated or unnoticed by the casual observer. It's fantastic and, in many ways, ahead of its time. <br /> <br /> The images are fun, disturbing and at least engaging. <br /> <br /> The music is incredible. <br /> <br /> This is not the "candy pop" sound to which they are unfortunately associated. This is the sound of a band in exploration and revolt. <br /> <br /> HEAD alone should put The Monkees in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. <br /> <br /> Can anyone tell me why these guys aren't there?
