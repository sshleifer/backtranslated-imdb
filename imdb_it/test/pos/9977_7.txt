When I first saw the film being advertised, I thought it would be another Disney movie that went directly to the video. In the end I went around and rented it. I thought it would be bad because I could not see Shia in any other role than his recently canceled show "Even Stevens". When I turned it on I was ready to turn it off from boredom in about ten minutes. It started a little slow and I couldn't understand the beginning because the years didn't make sense, then they explained that later on the show I was relieved to ask. All in all I thought it was a good movie and would recommend it. The cast was top notch and although I'm not a golf fan, he easily kept my attention with a good storyline.
