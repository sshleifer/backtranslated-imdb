I liked the acting in this movie. Except his sister. It reminded me of Janice on Friends. I could never believe that it was anything but nasty. <br /> <br /> My main problems with the film were the anticlimatic ending and the executive scene with his sister and brother-in-law. The guy who falls from the exploding car? Perhaps if his hand had been wiped out and he'd run to the mute's aid and she kissed him and rushed him to a hospital, maybe I could have gone to the final. I think someone had to die in the execution scene. Mostly the brother-in-law. However it was a real pain in the ass. Or maybe the sister needed to accidentally kill the guy who saved the mute. I might even have bought the brother-in-law who kills the hero and the ending is that the two sisters have been immortalized. <br /> <br /> It is worth looking at again and, as I always say, it is much easier to be an editor instead of an author.
