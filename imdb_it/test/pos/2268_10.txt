What an original job. I have always liked "the actor" Liev Schreiber, but now we must appreciate the man on a multidimensional level. How did you get that sunflower field? It was computerized, certainly seemed real. And how do you audit a dog knowing that you'll get that kind of performance? Does the academy have a category for animals? I guess what I'm saying is that I really liked this weird, weird, indie film. From the excellent cast (one would never have known Eugene Hutz was not a professional actor) to the director of photography (some beautiful shots) to the music (he bought the CD when he left the theater) and obviously the two "D's" (direction and the DOG) . All in all a "10". <br /> <br /> /
