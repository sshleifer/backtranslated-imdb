I seriously appreciated the vision of this film for the first time some years ago and every time it is broadcast again somewhere (which fortunately happens from time to time in European cable television) I try the same thing, I am moved, I enjoy myself and I end up wishing they were more films like this. <br /> <br /> This is Leo (Kevin McKidd) and his group of friends living in the city of London, Leo as a gay guy who follows a friend in a hilarious New Age Men's Group and falls for the type straight Brendon, played by James Purefoy, which is not that simple. Thrown as secondary characters are the equally great Tom Hollander and Hugo Weaving whose separate story deserves the vision of the film, Simon Callow as leader of the men's group, which turned into a great performance as always. But it's really hard to choose some people here, because every character, female characters like those of Jennifer Ehle, Julie Graham and Harriet Walter, are exquisitely recited. Perhaps Kevin McKidd also looks a little pale compared to his co-actors, but to the advantage of his slightly understated character. <br /> <br /> The idea behind this film is simple: there is never only black and white, classifications are difficult and may not always stand the test of time. <br /> <br /> Leo identifies himself as gay but ends up falling in love with a woman who turns out to be his teenage girlfriend and Brendon's long-time girlfriend. Brendon starts straight but finds that the gay could be more than just an option for him and that being bisexual may not be so bad. Darren and Jeremy (Hollander and Weaving) are gay and amiable and even the heterosexuals in the film, like Leo's roommate Angie, get their fair share of love and fun moments until the end of the film. The bits of the comedy (especially Tom Hollander which is simply hilarious) are funny and honest and the emotions are credible, confused as they might sometimes appear when reading this summary. <br /> <br /> What I like about this film is its very positive notion. Whether you are gay, straight, bisexual or just not sure, this movie suggests that it's OK NOT to be safe and that "not being sure" could be something worth experiencing! Sexuality is represented fluid in this film and none of the main characters seem to have a real problem, apart from all the fighting of gay / straight fights that sometimes feed you in other gay-themed movies. I can only sincerely agree with the subtext of the film, that what you hear someday, when you think you identify yourself as gay, straight, whatever, may seem very different from another. I've never seen (what to call it?) Bisexuality or maybe just the absence of the segregating need for sexual classification that is portrayed in a way that is so touching and true to life. <br /> <br /> This film dares to go where few films go, gay or straight films, not playing on labels and stereotypical assumption of sex and relying on it. It goes further and assumes that there can be a life of sex after well-known rankings and I think the times are more than ready for this and other films that explore postmodern themes like this! <br /> <br /> And for everyone else who doesn't care, heck, it's just a fun comedy that is worth watching on a rainy Saturday night with some popcorn in hand. Try it! <br /> <br /> I loved it!
