I really enjoyed both times I watched it. And both times, I went to think about it, and the "moral of the story" was a big deal. I agree with another reviewer that the film does not focus on the science fiction aspects that could be expected from an alien film on Earth, but rather concerns the human condition. The characters of the psychiatric hospital provide a great vision of this and how they go from hopelessness to hope. This film has a touch of sadness for the humor of sympathy for the final "it's him or not he". That final question was well managed and even if someone might argue that you don't know what happens in the end and the question has no answer, I feel that it is done in much more detail than something vaguely like the movie Ronin (with Robert De Niro) where you never find out what's in the box and feel very frustrated because of it. I highly recommend K-PAX. 8/10
