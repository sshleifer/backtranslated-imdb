This was truly an extraordinary adaptation. I lost the first episode, so unfortunately I lost the connection between the characters and the regular flow of the plot. But as soon as I saw the second and then the third episode, I was simply wiped out. I ordered the DVD less than a week later and couldn't wait for it to come, I went straight and brought the book. From the moment I opened it I was hooked, I couldn't put it down. I decided to finish the whole book before daring to watch the DVD. I preferred the book because it entered the minds of the characters, it was clear where they came from and what was inside the story. They missed much of the adaptation which was disappointing as the book is a masterpiece and I think they could have done it superbly if they were able to extend it for a longer period of time. But considering being able to fit into a 3-hour slot, I think it was done excellently. He brilliantly followed the twisted main plot. And the actors who were drafted as main characters where it's great! The scene of love was pure beauty. He was so tender and loving and simply showed how natural homosexual love can be. I was totally amazed by the book and TV adaptation! I loved both of the previous Sarah Waters novels and also found the adaptation of Tipping the Velvet pleasant. But when I read and looked at Fingersmith, I knew that none of his previous novels / adaptations could beat him. This time Sarah Waters has outdone herself! I suggest you watch this adaptation! If Tipping the Velvet were not your kind, don't let this put you off. Fingersmith is a completely new ball game. It's a beautiful but obscure story about love, greed and betrayal ... <br /> <br /> TO SEE!
