DO NOT LOOK IN THE BASEMENT This little forgotten gem occupies a special place in my heart and in the List of Nasties Videos. The soundtrack of the sitar-rattle flute is classic. The main character, although much hotter than most low-budget starlets, is a rather low and standard advantage. The character of Doctor Masters is well written and well acted. Some of the minor characters are rather stupid, but they add to the nostalgia of the film. It's Campy. I'm not trying to lie. The character that makes this great is a Man-Child by Faulknarian named Sam, one of the patients in this science fiction movie. Blood is fairly standard although I think the color of blood is fantastic. It is so .. Red. This film, I believe, was badly received due to its advertising scheme. A small soulless advertising executive got their hands dirty on it and thought "Let's make a copy of the AD campaign for the last house on the left, it's going well." Small pieces like this have ruined the world of cinema. All the balls and no brains. Furthermore, the publisher may or may not have been an alcoholic. Maybe you're all drunk. You'll see what I mean. One more little note. Don't buy it from the Wally-Mart dollar rack. They have cut and unwatchable level. Try to find the longest cut you can.
