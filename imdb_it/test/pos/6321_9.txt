The mystery and its solution were a great noir. I have some questions though, maybe I wasn't paying enough attention. <br /> <br /> Who killed the neighbor and why? Who killed the replacement girl and why? <br /> <br /> And some minor quibbles, they should have shown the hotel stop for the switch. Not that they should have shown the switch, but they should have shown Jim and the girl going to the hotel, Jim going to the bathroom, going out and being told by the bartender that his girlfriend was driving without him. > <br /> then, Jim gets back in the car and sees the sleeping woman, and the little girl in the back seat. <br /> <br /> This would give the viewer a sporting chance to understand the solution. <br /> <br /> I wish I had registered it, I'd like to see it again.
