Forget all those people who tell you it's not as good as the book. So? This is a movie, after all. It is a pure joy to watch, made entirely on location in Kefalonia, beautiful photography but with dark and disturbing moments. The only problem I have is with Nicolas Cage's obvious miscasting as Captain Corelli. Apart from that, the film was a pleasant surprise.
