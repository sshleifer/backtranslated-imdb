I saw UZUMAKI about a year ago and I was enchanted. The only Japanese horror film I had seen before this was KWAIDAN (which by the way I proudly own on DVD), fantastic! The idea that a city is absorbed by spirals looks exactly like Lovecraft. Surely it recalls the SHADOW ON INNSMOUTH, of the inhabitants that slowly turn into monstrosities (in this case giant snails). And who can forget the sequence of the washing machine? I hope we will soon see this available on the Region 1 DVD (I see that Sundance recently screened it on US TV, hopefully they will do it again very soon) so that we can all see it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
