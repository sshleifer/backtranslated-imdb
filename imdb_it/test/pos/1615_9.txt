Brett Piper is again an excellent film that is trashed by the so-called "experts" of cinema. it's a low budget, but fun, and the main character is very sexy. I wish I could see more of Irene Joseph. Good fun view. I bought the DVD and enjoyed it. The special effects are stop motion animations, and much better than computer-generated crap that today they call effects. I always like Brett Piper movies and, if you liked it, I recommend Bite Me, Screaming Dead and whatever else you did. I look forward to seeing more of his work and more of Mrs. Joseph. I simply can't understand why this woman hasn't been in other films, since her acting is excellent.
