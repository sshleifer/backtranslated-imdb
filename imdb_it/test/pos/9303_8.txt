I find it extraordinary that so little has actually been done with the history of the atomic bomb and that it was developed for decades after the completion of the Manhattan Project. My suspicion is that this is due to serious fears in the fields of cinema and entertainment (in the 50s and 70s) with "McCarthyism" and phobias related to national security (including the Hollywood blacklist). There was a film in the 1950s (with Robert Taylor) about Colonel Paul Tibbits who flew for the Enola Gay in the Hiroshima bombing, but otherwise nothing else. A look at a tragedy of collateral problems (the sinking of the United States of Indianapolis shortly after the delivery of the Tinian bombs) could be looked at in Robert Shaw's description of shark attacks on JAWS survivors. But the real trials and tribulations of Groves, Oppenheimer and their team were not considered filmed. <br /> <br /> And then in 1989 two films appeared. I have already reviewed one (DAY ONE) which I think is the best of the two in discussing the long technical and emotional and political problems of the Manhattan Project. The acting of Brian Dennehy in the role of General Groves and David Strahairn in the role of Oppenheimer was first-rate and perfectly balanced. Small side vignettes about Szilard's anti-bomb crusade (Michael Tucker) help complete the story well. <br /> <br /> Here's the problem here. Paul Newman is a great actor (like Mr. Dennehy), but Newman approaches Groves in a different way which, although not terrible, is smaller than Dennehy's fine but delicate military brass. Newman seems too stunned by the possibility that the weapon is the biggest stick to face the other boys in the after-school playground. Yes, of course, but the real Groves would have been more like Dennehy who didn't think about that big toy of the future, but about the business of creating that big toy. <br /> <br /> Dwight Schultz's performance as Oppeheimer helps keep the film's interesting and good production, helped by Bonnie Bedelia as his wife. But the most interesting aspect of this film is the updating of the two tragedies of Daghlian and Slotin, in particular of the latter, in the character of Merriman by John Cusack. Inevitably in all technological advances people are killed. It's just that these two tragedies (on top of the tens of thousands that were lost in Hiroshima and Nagasaki) brought home the dangers of the new power unleashed even in a so-called peaceful and controlled experiment. The two tragedies (in particular the slow, agonizing death of Louis Slotin for radiation poisoning) showed how much care was needed in the use of atomic energy - and how the smallest of cases could still cause disasters. The only really different thing I saw in Cusack's performance (and in the script) and the real incident with Slotin is that Slotin actually took some time after the incident to figure out where all his fellow researchers were when they were hit from the radiation from the accident (he was able to prove that only he achieved the full effect of the accidental explosion, so that only others would need relatively minor treatment). Perhaps the complete story of Slotin's actions was too technical for the screen, but given the enormous pain he suffered in the end that he took his free time to think about others shows what a top quality person really was.
