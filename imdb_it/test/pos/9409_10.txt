I had heard of the case, but in reality I had not paid attention to all the fuss of Fuhrman writing the book, Skakel was arrested, etc. However, this film did a great job in detailing Martha, the Skakel brothers, the murder, Mark Fuhrman's involvement and the results of his investigations. I particularly liked the flashback scenes with Martha talking about her last summer. The actress who played her literally shone with life and made it even more moving that the real Martha was probably like that. He made Martha look like a real person rather than a victim. I highly recommend watching it.
