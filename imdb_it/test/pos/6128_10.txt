My 10/10 score applies only if you are willing to be completely and completely extrapolated *. Because you know that only John Waters can do it. In "Pink Flamingos" (his directorial debut), he portrays two families locked in combat to see who may be the dirtiest person alive. What Divine celebrates in the end practically answers the question. But apart from that, the film is basically an excuse to shock people beyond what anyone could imagine. You should have a very strong stomach to watch this movie. Also some lines are quite upsetting. <br /> <br /> * Otherwise, avoid this movie as you would with the Ebola virus!
