A tomb robber is sitting in his cell awaiting execution is visited by a monk who wishes to put down his last words for posterity and as a warning to others about the horrible life he leads. At first reluctantly, but with his tongue free from drinking, the young tomb robber soon tells his story that it is full of deaths, undead and things that stir in the night. <br /> <br /> The New York horror film (shot in part on Staten Island which undoubtedly questioned the spirit of Andy Milligan) is one of the best horror comedies in circulation for some time. This is often a very funny movie that turns its story anyway. The cast is top notch. Dominic Monaghan plays Arthur Blake, the grave thief who tells his story. Ron Perlman is Father Duffy, the monk takes the sentence and perhaps lets himself get too involved in the story. Both men are clearly having a great old time and show. The rest of the cast is just as good. Jeff Grace's music is excellent. The effects are perfect for this kind of stupid stupidity. The film is a lot of fun. If there is any problem with the film, perhaps this throws its net a bit so that the result is too long. I don't want to give too far, but I don't think we need the alien body in the mix. Yet this is a lot of fun and it's almost certain that I'll come back to IFC in the Theaters, where I first saw it, and later I'm sure I'll take the DVD. <Br /> <br /> It's worth a look.
