While the concept of "medical appointment" is the only thing that saves this film from being an otherwise normal romantic comedy with a standard genre plot, I found it amusing enough to raise my opinion about it so I ended up really enjoying it more than if he had had a mediocre plot without many twists. Will Smith does a great job, as always, starring as Hitch, the man who devotes his life to advising men how and how not to conquer women ... since his failed attempt to keep his girlfriend in college . There is a lot of laughter as he tries to help his last patient, overweight, clumsy asthmatic Albert Brennman (Kevin James) to successfully court the beautiful collaborator Allegra Cole (Amber Valetta). Also, when he decides to get rid of a woman he meets in a turkey bar that just doesn't seem to get around he doesn't want to be around, he finds himself drawn to Sara (Eva Mendes) - it seems to be a big deal for him, so I guess from college he never practiced his rules on himself. Unfortunately, Sara is a gossip journalist who is interested in "the date doctor" who has a seemingly sick guy like Albert with Allegra - especially the AFTER player / asshole Vance Munson (Jeffrey Donovan) breaks the heart of his best friend (Julie Ann Emery) and suggests that the doctor he saw disgusted him when he didn't realize that he refused to see him. However, the troubles follow and Hitch remains stuck wondering what to do with his relationship, while he is not very helpful to Albert when he tries to figure out what to do more in his. The acting is good, there is a lot of humor and other good points of meaning. Hitch's character is witty and wise, sometimes he manages to be simultaneously. It is true, the misunderstanding in which the woman is offended for something that man did not really do (why do they always show it?) As a common and irritating - I suppose it would not have been if it were the 1st, not the 5th , time I saw IT - but the rest of them was completely new. I just wish this movie were longer - I remember watching 3/5 while playing on a restaurant TV once - but I continue to approve. It is certainly worth paying for its brevity.
