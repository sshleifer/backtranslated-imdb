I rarely worry about watching movies or television these days. They are tasteless, vulgar and, above all, not fun. This could be seen as a refreshing explosion of the past. It is worth looking at, and I don't think it would have dated in any significant way. Classic humor is classic humor, and good writing is good writing regardless of the era in which it was created. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see this movie again; it occurred to me after seeing the "Summer School" somewhat similar on television recently. Like that slightly newer movie, "Meatballs" is fun without being cruel, overly sexual or indulging in the humor of the bathroom. The key, of course, is how the adult character makes such a difference in the life of the adolescent character - perhaps even a practically life-saving change - and how they both grow in the space of a summer.
