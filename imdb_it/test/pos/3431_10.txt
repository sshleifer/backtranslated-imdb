This thing works at all levels - it's as intense as a thriller, full of tributes from Lars von Trier, but also a lot of his film - and has a message: happiness comes from within, the best personification in the wounded soldier who practically ( and, believe it or not, humorously) it disintegrates limb throughout the film, all the time apologizing to others for having imposed them. Laugh at him, but I envy him too. The central character is a well-meaning but clumsy writer who spends the entire film trying to help those who make friends on a train from Stockholm to Berlin immediately after the Second World War. Tie parallel stories together, and really make people go crazy in the process. To say that things go wrong is a euphemism - and structurally, the characters are all in perfect opposition to each other. It is as if each of them had an opposite - just so narrow, like looking at the colliding anti-matter. You won't believe the sick things you end up laughing at. More could be called a spoiler - all I can say is that it is a pity that this film was not released in the United States, not even on DVD. Some idiot probably said that Americans wouldn't understand it - which is crap, because not only do we "get" but produce things like South Park ... If this film is marketed in the United States, it should be sold as a black mainstream comedy, because that's what it is. Over-the-top, sick and twisted, but fuuuuunnnnnyyyyy!
