I still remember watching Satya for the first time. I was completely wiped out. Here is a movie that was very different from the other Gangster movies I had seen. So realistic, so Mumbaiyya and so believable. Despite "Company" (which was a great effort) and "Vaastav" (more focused on the protagonist's journey) that came close, no underworld movie could ever live up to Satya. <br /> <br /> I watched Ab Tak 56 for the first time, I said to myself "Indian cops have their 'Satya' now". The Nietzsche quote at the beginning tells you that this is not a normal film. What strikes you about the "encounter" at the beginning of the film is the relaxed way in which it is realized. There is a cold and frightening atmosphere because you realize that it is part of their routine. <br /> <br /> Ab Tak 56 is not the story of an honest cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop ready to do what it takes to get rid of criminals when all lawful means are exhausted. With simple shots and camera angles, the director Shimit Amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and approximate feeling to the film. The change seems non-existent and therefore effective. The music is also awesome and disturbing and stays with you long after you leave the theater. <br /> <br /> But for me, what really takes the cake are the dialogues and the superlative acting of each character. Sandeep Srivastava did a brilliant job as a screenwriter. If I start to list my favorite dialogues, I'm afraid I'll end up rewriting the entire script of the film. <br /> <br /> The film boasts some stellar performances. Yashpal Sharma is detestable as sub-inspector Imtiaz Siddiqui and so is Jeeva as mixed commissioner Suchak. Revathi, Hrishita Bhatt, Mohan Agashe and Kunal Vijaykar have small roles that play to perfection. Nakul Vaid as novice Jatin Shukla was a revelation. The scene where you have to shoot the injured gangster with hesitation ?? My God! Learn under the guidance of Sadhu Aghashe and firmly believe in him. <br /> <br /> Prasad Purandhare as Zameer Zafar is impressive. His conversations with Sadhu are real jewels of dialogic writing. Never before in Indian cinema have any films brought out such a beautiful relationship between a policeman and a gangster. <br /> <br /> I have not been a fan of Nana Patekar before this film, but this film pushed me as a fan to a devotee. Nana as inspector Sadhu Agashe gives the performance of a lifetime and one of the best I've ever seen in Hindi cinema. From the way he talks to his expressions, from the way he touches his cigarette to the way he sips his tea ?? it's almost as if Nana couldn't be wrong. He's at his best in every scene, especially when he teaches Jatin how the police force works. His fresh and composed way of doing things is scary at times. His dialogue and body language convinced me that he is one of the best actors in the country. It is a pity that he did not win any popular awards for this. <br /> <br /> Last but by no means the least, Shimit Amin does a brilliant job of bringing all these talents together and making the most of them to invent a modern masterpiece of Indian cinema. In an industry that is disgustingly used to raising stories here and there, Amin takes an original script and brings it to life with beautiful treatment. I just hope the work continues and doesn't give up on Bollywood-isation! If you can do it, I'm sure it will be a force to be reckoned with in the coming years.
