beautifully constructed, "Traffik" tells the story of drug use and trade from multiple points of view. From the point of view of a policeman, from a political point of view, from a dependent vision, from the point of view of a smuggler and from the point of view of a farmer. In a carefully constructed plot, one gets the impression of how everything is related. From the beautiful shots in the fields in the poppy fields in Pakistan, in the center of Karachi, to the airports of entry points in Frankfurt and London, to the devastated buildings where smuggling takes place, we see the massive dimension of drug use.
