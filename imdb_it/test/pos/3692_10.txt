Both my husband and I love this movie. At first my husband was skeptical and asked me how many points he had to sit through this. But after a few key scenes he was completely sucked and eventually he was convinced that it was one of the best films around. Kathleen Bates has never been so wonderfully adorable and the rest of the cast is just great. Thanks for this great movie.
