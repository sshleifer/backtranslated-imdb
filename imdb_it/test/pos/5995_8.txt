<br /> <br /> This movie features truly impressive action scenes. Humor and action blend well, although the intensity of the film is not sustained until the end. The last scene is a slight anti-climax in terms of action quality and surprising explosiveness of the scenes that precede it. Humor does not seem to be as ridiculously clumsy as in many other Hong Kong films, and this film is totally classy compared to most American comedies in recent years. Lau Ching-Wan acts as a typical, intuitive police hero who makes a mockery of invalid orders from incompetent police superiors. The dialectic of the film is built on the superhuman coldness and ruthlessness of the drug gang, humiliating the police and providing a serious dose of lead poisoning with a variety of machine guns. Leave many corpses in the wake. Yu Rong-Guang is particularly impressive as an ultra cold and ruthless gangster in this piece of Woo-type action where tough guys are really die-hard.
