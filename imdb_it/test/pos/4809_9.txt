I just bought An Zhan (Short of time) on DVD and it was an excellent movie, I have to say. Not really full of action, in terms of gun play, but definitely exciting and witty. I don't think I saw Andy Lau in better shape. And the editing of this film was very well done. Go see this now if you are a fan of Lau or HK thiller / action movie!
