In this episode, Locke and Eko go in search of the "?" symbol that we saw during the lock-down on a previous episode. Michael, after shooting Ana Lucia and Libby, struggles with his actions while Libby approaches death. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this episode (I think). It is during the commercial break. Locke and Eko find a hatch under the plane that killed Boone in season one, and a new training video ends with "Copyright, The Hanso Foundation, 1989" In a subsequent commercial break, a rather bizarre and anonymous commercial advertises "The Hanso Foundation "(an advertising spot) and the website advertised (www.sublymonal.com) guides the visitor through a world of information about life outside the LOST storyline. A must see for all the fans!
