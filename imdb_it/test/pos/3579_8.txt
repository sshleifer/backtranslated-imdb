Blue Planet ... Wow ... where do I start? The years of hard work have paid off in what is, without doubt, one of the best documentaries ever created. <br /> <br /> The images and sounds presented in Blue Planet, like most of the documentaries with the Attenborough tone, are rare and I have not even tried by most people. Only this should be reason enough to buy this series, especially if you are the curious type who "wants to know". <br /> <br /> Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary, however. It gets a little repetitive after the third episode. How many ways different sea creatures can swim, kill, shit, mate and spawn, and must all these ways really be explored? But if you have a deep interest in marine life, this repetition should not become a problem for you.
