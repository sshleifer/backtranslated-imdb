The beautiful, charming, extremely versatile and talented Irene Dunne is one of the greatest 5 or 6 actresses in American cinema. In Over 21 - as in all his films - it illuminates the screen with a natural but at the same time glamorous presence. It is both authentic and human, and a charismatic and inspiring model. This role is the quintessential Irene Dunne, full of pathos, wit and a little bit of malice. I love all his films and this film was a fantastic discovery for me when TCM broadcast it last night. I hope they don't wait years to send it on the air. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Charles Coburn is one of the greatest actors of all American films. True, he often portrays variations on the same theme, but I will never tire of looking at his tender-hearted muzzles. Here his character is the perfect support for Irene Dunne, and is played perfectly by Coburn. Their conflicts in this film are absolutely fantastic. They never miss a beat. Furthermore, they represent the central conflict of the film and the moral conflict of Irene Dunne's husband, played by Alexander Knox. <br /> <br /> I am not familiar with Knox's work. It was recognizable, but that was all. However, in the cast with Dunne and Coburn, he keeps his. Offers a subtle and nuanced performance. His character has noble motives that are made accessible to us by Knox's performance and have never held us back as a holy grail. He is noble, but in conflict and doubts his ability to successfully complete the OCS. His interaction with Dunne is always convincing. Dunne supports him without being syrupy or becoming a martyr, and responds in kind. Their scenes are very well done. <br /> <br /> The film itself is a fantastic snapshot of a moment and an environment not portrayed in other films. I do not remember by my head another film that portrays the America that still fights the Second World War, but with the end in sight and the attention on the creation of the postwar world. Not the usual WWII movie! This in itself is interesting; it is also essential for the plot and the message of the film. In contrast to other commentators, I thought the climate was ok, but not exceptional. It was delivered very well by Knox, but it was not written "firmly" as accumulation led me to expect it. I have heard better film talks addressing very similar topics. It served its purpose. <br /> <br /> For me, the greatest value of the film was the representation of Dunne and Knox's life, as it reflected the typical OCS experience. The sense of community among the wives who lived on Palmetto Terrace seemed absolutely authentic - like Palmetto Terrace, in turn, despite the fact that it was obviously a sound stage. Incredibly short meetings between wives and their OCS husbands. The rigors of the OCS candidates, mastering the difficult and complex material they had to learn. The shabby "basic housing" - obviously hastily built. The tired and worn-out furnishings. The constant and strenuously short deadlines - for the return to the base, for the learning lessons, for the capture of the trains to the following "posts". Tenants constantly encounter their predecessors and successors in the basic housing as they move in and out. Yes, I suspect this was a taste of a true World War II experience - dressed in some comedy, but very real in its core. I loved it and highly recommend it.
