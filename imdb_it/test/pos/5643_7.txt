The title is a reference to the destruction of the remains of a crop, such as rice husks, by farmers who burn them, creating fires in the plains. This is a sad story of the destruction of the Japanese soldier. <br /> <br /> The story is set in the final days of the Philippine campaign as a soldier with tuberculosis returning from a hospital because, because he can walk, he has no room for him. His senior officers do not want him around because he is too sick to work or fight. Abused by his officer, he is sent back to the hospital with orders to be admitted or killed. They will not take it and will soon be left to wander through the war-torn landscape trying to find help or a place to stay or even just food. It is a bleak journey without hope in sight and only the death and inhumanity of man towards every man. <br /> <br /> Announced as a harrowing journey into the dark heart of man and war, this is also a very funny movie. This does not mean that it is not horrifying at times, but it is also obscurely comical. How could it not be? Here is a movie in which madness and madness are rampant, people constantly try to pass off tobacco leaves for food, trying to get even a slightly better pair of shoes, trying to remain a Japanese soldier facing the absurd by marching constantly but without never anywhere and you can't help but laugh. To be sure, things become more obscure as it becomes clear that cannibalism could, literally and figuratively, the only way to survive, but at the same time there is something unpleasantly funny in human comedy. <br /> <br /> Hailed as a great anti-war film, its rigid photographic style clarifies the madness of war even if it dazzles our eyes with its beauty. Here we see landscapes full of bodies that include the soldier and the civilian. set among the fields of forests and trees that would otherwise be, and to some extent still, quite beautiful. It's a shocking feeling. <br /> <br /> What is intriguing is that I read that this is based on a novel about the redeeming power of Christianity. The director has removed all religious references to hope and salvation and instead he used it to show that life stinks, war stinks worse and that there is none, ultimately no hope. <br /> <br /> Intellectually I admire the film, emotionally I don't. Part of it is a shrill downbeat score that, for me, accentuates what we're seeing on the screen. The lily is almost golden because the imaginary is so strong that it does not really need to have music to force you to feel yourself in one way or another. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, that's what you need to decide. In some ways it is different from any other war movie, bloody, horrible and real in ways that big-budget films claim to be but never are. This is not for those who are averse to blood and blood since he is here in spades. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look.
