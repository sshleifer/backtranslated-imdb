One of his lesser-known films, many horror fans have yet to seize this unlucky offer by Dario Argento. It is undervalued mainly due to the fact that not enough people actually saw it. The film boasts A Silver level gore, with its usual close-ups set to wild rock scores. Although it is true that this script is not very complex, it is not as bad as the other voices of its genre, or its personal resume. <br /> <br /> This film symbolizes more than the "terror" he likes to portray in his films by his own admission. It's worth taking a look at any night.
