Ordinarily, Anthony Mann did westerns with "the great ones" - James Stewart, Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda. . . the list of cowboy stars. But in this B + movie, he faced something very different and had some success with what turned out to be a truly unique western. The main character, played by Victor Mature, is a trapper / mountaineer, and they are usually romanticized in the movies - Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson, that kind of thing, in which the hero is not actually a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure that hangs out with real mountain men. Not here. For once, a true mountain man - vulgar, crude, animalistic - is the central figure, and is something to behold, giving Maturo one of his best subsequent roles. The constant action troops are provided by Robert Preston, excellent as a self-absorbed Custer-type cavalry commander, and James Whitmore, poor Spencer Tracy, as another of those old tempers who feel trapped among increasingly hostile Indians on the one hand and the imminent strength of civilization on the other. Even more impressive is a very young Anne Bancroft as the officer's wife, who is initially disgusted by the sight of the macabre character of Mature, then finds her civilization veneer slipping away as she begins to realize, to her shock, that she is attracted to him. Rarely, if ever a remote frontier fortress has been so carefully crafted on the screen, without the romantic charm that John Ford has given to such a place in his masterful Fort Apache. The battle sequences are large and in particular violent and particularly impressive if you see them in widescreen format. Good show and undervalued film, all around.
