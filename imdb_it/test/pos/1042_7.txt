I've always liked Barbara Stanwyck who was, perhaps, the toughest leading actress of the 30s and 40s, although few of her film roles are memorable. Today she is best remembered for the TV show "The Big Valley". Stanwyck worked hard because he was tough; it seems that you would accept most of the roles and make the most of it to make the film a success and so the directors loved it and many common images have gained credibility with its presence. <br /> <br /> And so it was for "Christmas in Connecticut" is a very ordinary effort whose plot puts a strain on credulity and does not even refer to Christmas. However, he has Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan and some prominent figures like Sydney Greenstreet and S.K. So Sakall there are twists and funny moments that undoubtedly seemed more real in 1945 than they do today. To begin with, the plot is about a magazine writer (Stanwyck) who readers of the magazine believe is a domestic goddess, married to a child and who lives on a farm in Connecticut but who is really single, lives in New York City and doesn't know nothing about cooking or homemaking. Could someone run away with such a fraud even then? Apparently, and even the owner of the magazine (Greenstreet) is deceived even though one might think he would have seen deception for a long time but the story moves and Stanwyck, Greenstreet, a sailor recently survived from his sunken ship (Morgan) and Stanwyck's restorative friend (SZSakall) finds himself spending the Christmas holidays in Connecticut on a farm of Stanwyck's rude boyfriend (Reginald Gardiner). You can imagine all the possibilities that exist because the fraud takes place as it should. Gardiner wants Stanwyck to marry him to perpetuate the thrill, but one wonders how he can stand it. Morgan and Stanwyck fall in love with each other but he should be engaged and she should get married. Regardless, they begin what appears to be a business that believes dancing cheek to cheek and stealing in a horse-drawn sleigh. Meanwhile, the incredibly naive character of Greenstreet who saw Stanwyck and Morgan leave together but still can't see him, sees one of the neighbors take back a child who was borrowed as part of the deception and calls the police to report a kidnapping. Stanwyck and Morgan are arrested for stealing the sled and the buffalo starts to relax. <br /> <br /> At this point the movie is funny as ridiculous or absurd, not funny has, has and ends regularly as broom comedies always done. The good guy gets the girl and presumably live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> I watch this film every year at Christmas to enjoy these actors at their best in a story that reflects the way it was in 1945 and because of a long passion for Barbara Stanwyck. Thank God it was set for Christmas or 95 percent of Stanwyck's films would have been long forgotten and we couldn't have seen it again every year.
