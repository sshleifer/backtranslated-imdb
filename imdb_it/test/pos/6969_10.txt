Ghoulies IV may not be the best in the series, but it's not bad, if you don't take it seriously, then you'll like it. <br /> <br /> It's nice to see Peter Liapis return as Johnathan Graves who gave up the use of magic and became a detective, but still thinks about what happened to Ghoulies. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a woman named Alexandra who is Johnathan's former girlfriend who breaks into a museum and picks up a red gem, using the gem wakes up her boyfriend named Faust which is Johnathan's dark side but he needs the gem to get into the real world and John is sent to hell. <br /> <br /> Something goes wrong and Alex loses the gem, so he needs to find a new one, while leaving the gateway is still open and two small Ghoulias appear called Lite and Drak. They are not the real Ghoulies since they look like boys in troll costumes wearing a mask, but it doesn't matter since they're fun in parts. <br /> <br /> Lite and Dark need to find Johnathan since he can return them home so that they go around causing chaos as they try to find Johnathan. Another difference is that the two Ghoulies are the good guys unlike those of the previous films. <br /> <br /> I found Ghoulies IV good but this movie may not be for everyone, watch it if you like budget movies like Troll 2.
