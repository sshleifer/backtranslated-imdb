There are one or two other short films from the Shemp era that I like best (eg SCRAMBLED BRAINS), but I think we can say - without much argument - that in this particular episode, Shemp gives her biggest comic performance from puppet after rejoining the team in 1946. <br /> <br /> Scene by scene, this episode hardly gives up: from Professor Shemp Howard's voice lessons to Dee Green, which explodes glass, to his useless attempts to win the hand of a dame in marriage (this is your little snobs ... you will marry me * click *) until the sensational ending, you will never fail to keep me upset. <br /> <br /> It would be negligent not to mention that immortal scene with Miss Hopkins (the ever-adorable Christine McIntyre). By the way, isn't she rather underdeveloped and loving in greeting the man she thinks is her Basil's Cousin? Who knows, maybe the real Basil was a cousin "very far", which makes it legal in some states (as far as I know). >: -]
