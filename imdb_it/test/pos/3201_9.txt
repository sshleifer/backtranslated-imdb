I guess I'm not sure what to expect from this movie, he had a good cast, an interesting storyline, and a lot of other things that did, but I still couldn't shake the feeling of fear in my stomach about what it would be like. I am pleased to say that I was very satisfied with the result and I regret being worried about it all the time. The film's opening scenes were extremely intriguing and were enough to support the interest in the film soon. As the film progressed, we were introduced to the characters in the film, in addition to what happened in the riots in prison. Like most of the reviews for this film, I have to admit that there are non-essential cliches, but it cannot erase the overall power of this film that reads like a good novel. The cast is fantastic, especially Chestnut and McGowan, and the film is considered one of the best made-for-TV films this year. Definitely worth a look if you are looking for a good court drama.
