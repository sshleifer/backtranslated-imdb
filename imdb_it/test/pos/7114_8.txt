This is another celebration of universal fun. Many people want to compare it to House Of Frankenstein. Even if it has a similar cast and the same director can be alone. (It seems that Erle C Kenton directed most of the Universal horror movie of the 1940s). The plot summary: Baron Latos appears in the house of Dr. Eidlemann looking for a "cure" for his vampirism. Even Larry Talbot (who somehow survived House Of Frankenstein) at the door of the doctors looking for a cure for his affliction. After a failed suicide attempt Talbot and the doctor find Frankenstein's monster. To complicate things before he bites the dust, Dracula infects the good doctor with his blood. The doctor becomes a bloodthirsty maniac at certain times. Where this leads is something that you will have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Carradine offers very good performances like Dracula. He is not chewing the scenery like in the following roles. It is difficult to suppress giggles when it appears in a top hat though. The coat / cloak is traditional but the hat must go. Where does the hat go when it turns into a bat ...? <br /> <br /> Onslow Stevens offers an excellent portrait of the doctor. He is torn between his basic kindness and the growing desire for blood to which he is now prone. This is a very underestimated performance. Chaney brings even more life to Wolf Man in his fourth appearance in that role. <br /> <br /> The monster doesn't have much to do this time. It remains on the table until the end (some Ghost Of Frankenstein stock footage is used). At least in House Of Frankenstein he was standing a little. <br /> <br /> Yes, this fades to the universal basic model complete with the angry the village crowd goes wild with torches. But it's not a bad way to spend an hour and ten minutes. Become a low 8.
