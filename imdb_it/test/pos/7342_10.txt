Whatever you do, don't stop looking when you think the movie is finished! Wait for the first batch of credits or you will really miss something! We saw this film at the Savanaah festival and thought it was the best in the group. Dreya Weber is truly a wonder, not only for her performance, but because she manages to get her out of the ground. At the Q&A he said there were no wires or effects, so all you see is really her going for it. Addie couldn't get to the festival because she was dancing with Madonna. She was excellent and, my dear, so beautiful. I was amazed that the film went so well with the crowd of blue-haired women, but it's not, Savannnah is not a stagnation.
