"Meatballs" is an ode to the summer camp. Those of us who have to go to the field will see many of the scenes we remember or wish we could be. <br /> <br /> Bill Murray plays senior advisor Tripper Harrison, who really runs the field. It reminds us of the fun and entertaining staff member that everyone loves. The young campers gravitate towards him and if he talks to you, you feel like you're a family. This is one of Murray's best roles. Guide the film with its one liners and ad-libs. <br /> <br /> Chris Makepeace plays Rudy, the lone camper who is brought under the Tripper wing and exits his shell. <br /> <br /> The rest of the campers and film staff were also excellent. <br /> <br /> The general theme of the film is the loser who overcomes obstacles to finally win. From Rudy to Spaz to the field and even to Tripper himself, the film's losers are the stars. The film has a heart. <br /> <br /> The film is fun and entertaining without being cruel or too big as some teenage movies are today. The cast looks and behaves like real people. <br /> <br /> Comedy and the heart attract you to the point that in the end, just like in the field, you're sad to leave. <br /> <br /> In my summer camp experience we had underwear, flags, mysterious meat, trying to take a peek at the girls' booth, the madmen with the hooking stories around the camp fire, and move the people asleep outside their cabins and putting them elsewhere. But we also had a field staff that guided us to be the best we could be. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the CIT during the night, when they are canoeing across the lake singing a silly song. The only joke that makes me collapse every time is when Tripper announces the light before the day of the parents and ends "Tomorrow is the day of the parents, and you have to rest or Morty will be sent to the state penitentiary".
