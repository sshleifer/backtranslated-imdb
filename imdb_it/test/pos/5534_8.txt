Strange but acceptable mass comedy that has an undercover FBI agent (Matthew Modine) who flirts with a widow worried about a gangster (Michelle Pfeffier) ​​to tie two murders on a leader of the elusive crowd (Dean Stockwell). <br /> <br /> The film shows that it should not be exaggerated just to be funny and the director Jonathan Demme ("The Silence of the Lambs", "Philadelphia") prevents the film from appearing as if it were held back. It is fine and also avoids being predictable.
