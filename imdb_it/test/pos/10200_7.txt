This western was established in 1861 and had to do with the creation of the first transcontinental wireless lines that were laid by Western Union. While the good boy Dean Jagger (showing off a lot of hair) did his best to achieve this, there was a villain who was just waiting to cancel this for his own selfish reasons. So it's up to Randolph Scott or Robert Young to save the day. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of the best westerns of the 40s I've seen and has almost earned an 8 - it was good. However, for the life of me, I have no idea why Fritz Lang was assigned to direct this film - after all, he knew nothing about westerns. His forte was the drama - and I imagine this film is a drama - set in the old West. Strange, yes, but it seemed to work well, although I wonder how this great German director felt about this work. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the film, it is exceptional - with vivid colors, excellent shooting position and very good acting. As usual, Randolph Scott presented another relaxed and realistic performance. However, I was surprised that Robert Young was also chosen for the film, but it was a good casting decision - he should have been a Harvard-trained orientalist. When I also saw Barton MacLane in the film, I practically thought it would be the "bad guy" and my thoughts were well founded, since he made a career out of the jerk game! As for the script, it seemed pretty ordinary for the most part, but the final showdown between Scott and Barton MacLane was much better than I had hoped for - by ending this film on a very high note.
