One cannot help but be struck by the intelligence and size of this film, and at the same time disappointed by the missed opportunities. <br /> <br /> I found the excellent script and the vocal talent of Edmund Purdom quite impressive. However, as an artifact of his time, the film suffers from too many Hollywood stars, particularly the poor cast, too much lust of the sets and too much pretense. Edmund Purdom (who plays the title character) is so obviously embarrassing with physical acting, I suspect he was first and foremost in Shakespearean theater before that. <br /> <br /> So if the people of the cinema are reading this, I propose it as an excellent candidate for a remake, especially if you cast real Egyptians as Egyptians!
