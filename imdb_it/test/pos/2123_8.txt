This is a new Barbie movie. The graphics were really good. They made the film look partially realistic. I was doing ballet and this film made me want to continue. This film was a bit like a Cinderella movie, but a little different. A father of 12 princesses gets very sick. His cousin poisons him and wants the throne. The girls find a secret magic land thanks to the stories of the dead mother. It's up to them to save their father and society. With the help of their handsome prince. It was a funny movie and my friend and I enjoyed watching it. We loved it and also enjoyed the Indian talking parrot. The music was very beautiful and made the film even bigger. He had a great classical orchestra. The voices were fantastic and the characters were admirably sweet and cute. I liked it so enjoying the movie is great for the family. All in all, I would look at it again.
