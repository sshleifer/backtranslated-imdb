I was skeptical before going to this because of the horribly assembled trailer that made it look like an equally horrible movie. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I didn't waste my money. I believe the film's success derives from how disturbing it is and how the home environment is. Little things like sensor lights create a real uncomfortable feeling. The shadows and the disquieting coldness of the house make it easy to understand that no matter how much you know horror movies, anything could happen in the movie. Acting is by no means perfect or bad. The main character is also convincing in view of the boring teenage dramas that surround her. In the end, I was deeply impressed by the film in many respects. <br /> <br /> It is definitely a film I would recommend.
