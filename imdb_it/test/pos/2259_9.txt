I saw it last night and voted for an "8". Since then, he grew up with me and I would give him a "9". <br /> <br /> The film has (initially) a fa√ßade apparently a little disconnected between the first and second half. The first half is a comedy and there is a small hint of the torn truths of ages, life, wars, religious intolerance that will be revealed in the second half. While at first it might be a bit disconcerting because it is a somewhat unfamiliar narrative sequence, by reflection it works. <br /> <br /> The acting was good (Hultz in the role of Alex, the interpreter, was particularly outstanding). <br /> <br /> I have scanned most of the other "user comments" and I see that some who have read the book are satisfied with the film while there are some that are not. Both feelings are obviously valid. <br /> <br /> For me, a retired family therapist and world believer, the film was relevant on two different levels. <br /> <br /> The first, as a story, has given a powerful reminder of how commonly polarizations occur - with demonization and trying to exterminate some of those with a different moral value system than ours. <br /> <br /> The second is that in demonstrating the first, he also revealed something in common to each of us, ALL our families - that each of us must return to our roots to better understand ourselves. <br /> <br /> TS Eliot expressed this exquisitely in 4 of his "Four Quartets" when he said: "We will not cease exploring // And at the end of all our exploration // We will have to get where we started and get to know the place for the first time. " <br /> <br /> Jonathan embarks on a fulfilling journey that each of us would find fantastically illuminating: exploring and discovering our roots; what were those people passing by, who were they? Really! - before, when and during the first years before and after our birth? Etc. <br /> <br /> So the film initially gives us the impression of a comedy, then moves to give us a lesson in history and human deficiencies, but through all this it also gives us - subliminally - a message about each of us. We would all be amply rewarded for going back and understanding the place we started from.
