A beautiful film about the coming of silent cinema at the beginning of China. SHADOW MAGIC skillfully combines a love story with the drama of the cultural clash between ancient Chinese traditions and modern Western culture in the form of films. An incredible first film by Chinese director Ann Hu. If I correctly understood Ms. Hu's comments at the 2000 Sundance Festival, this film was produced as an American film with a Chinese government co-financing, and shot in China. SHADOW MAGIC reminds me of films like IL POSTINO and CINEMA PARADISO - not necessarily in theme or plot, but it has a similar feeling.
