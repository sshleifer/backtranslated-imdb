I'm a Christian and I thought this movie was pretty good! :) Although acting was not an Academy Award caliber, I thought it was a good thing, given that the cast had a limited acting experience at the time of making this film. <br /> <br /> The message of the Gospel and the transforming power of Jesus Christ has been wonderfully explained. The message that the director was trying to cross (which is the important thing, not like the dressed characters!) Has surely surpassed. The theme of having the main characters involved in illegal illegal immigration was also a good idea (cool muscle car, btw). I think this film will surely reach many young people. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film, it's a great testimony tool! :)
