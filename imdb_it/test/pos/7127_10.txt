This film is so wonderful that it captures the life of the game. I laughed so much while watching him. The film is about a gaming group that has difficulty with a campaign that their dungeon master has invented. The film passes from the real world and the world of games as they play the campaign that shows them in the game world as their character, to then return to the real world when they are not playing. The campaign is the basis for a module that the dungeon master, Lodge, is writing. The problem is that Lodge cannot finish his form because the characters cannot finish the campaign. They are more to kill and plunder instead of role-playing games. Lodge wants them to play through the countryside something they have never done before. They decide to bring extra help so as to lead to, wait, girl to play. Lodge also does a npc, a non-player character, a paladin, who cannot testify or make mistakes, play. The film is how they do all this and I don't want to ruin any of the films so I won't say anything else. This film may not be a big budget movie, but acting may not be worthy of the Oscars, but if you like video games or dungeons and dragons, then definitely watch them. They had a lot of fun making this film and this shows that I'm not going to get rid of movie problems like continuity or anything that is a cheap movie that is simply fun. There is a slap stick comedy that I like and a damn good script in my opinion. So if you want a funny movie try it.
