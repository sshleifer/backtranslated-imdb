Several weeks ago I lost my beloved companion and fourteen year old friend, a golden retriever named Sasha. When I returned home from the animal hospital, alone, after taking one of the most painful decisions of my life, my teenage daughter sat by my side. . . and we talked about this episode of the Twilight Zone. I could be wrong, but I remember a sentence that Arthur Hunnicutt said when Satan was trying to deceive him, but his dog couldn't go with him. . and his dog in turn snarled in defiance of the doorman who was trying to trick the old hunter into "entering". . .that it would have been "a hell of heaven if dogs were not allowed" and the spirit of the old mountain man and his dog decided to move away from the gate (of what they had thought was paradise, to wander only for eternity). What a moment of tears when they meet a "good old" country boy "on that eternal road, only to find out that he is an angel, sent to look for them and" safely close, of course dogs are allowed in paradise ". <br /> < br /> I confess to having cried while talking about this with my daughter while we were crying the passage of our beloved golden. Rod Serling was really a genius, a voice that in the early sixties spoke against racism, hatred, "know -nothingism "and inspired me deeply to become a writer. This episode, in over forty-five years, has brought a message of comfort to all of us who have lost a beloved friend. I urge you to take a copy the next time you are there one of the Twilight Zone marathons or buy it. There will be some tears, but also comfort. As always, thank you Rod, for all you have taught us... even now.
