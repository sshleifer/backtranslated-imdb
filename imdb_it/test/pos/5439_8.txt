Over the years, I've become a fan of director / writer Barry Levinson and he hasn't disappointed me with this very funny aspect of politics. Popular television comedian Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) has lit up the nation with his ferocious jokes about the state of the country and responsible politicians. Night after night, he has his fans rolling in the islands; then the question is posed that Dobbs should apply for the president himself. His manager Jack Menken (Christopher Walken) says he does. Dobb's irreverent games flare up for a radical movement that puts him on the board. Comedian to the President-elect. Meanwhile, a young woman (Laura Linney) finds a flaw in the computer system that will contain the cards from coast to coast. My favorite sequence is Linney's crisis in the coffee shop. Williams is absolutely hysterical with his quick jokes. Others of note in the cast: Jeff Goldblum, Lewis Black and Rick Roberts.
