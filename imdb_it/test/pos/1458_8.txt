We went well beyond this temporary incursion into a forbidden area - drug addiction - in the 1950s. As such, the film may seem dated. The man with the golden arm performed his function by removing a layer of the lower part of society, opening his eyes to a boy from the South in 1955 when I first saw this film in the theater. After seriously considering being too young, I was allowed to go. It was powerful and influential therefore and still maintains some sharp and painful moments of the soul stripped naked. Like a film that describes solitude at the center of being, it is successful. <br /> <br /> Full of anguish, Frank Sinatra, in his best role, creates a vulnerability that makes him sympathetic to the viewer. It conveys its powerlessness and ineffectiveness in a splendidly contained performance. As a common sense voice in the landlocked urban jungle, Kim Novak in Molly's shoes is pretty good. She is compassionate yet is on solid ground. The interaction between Sinatra and Novak is really good. Darren McGavin plays a slimy character and does it very well. Eleanor Parker is superbly irritating and painfully insecure in her role as the pathetic Zosch, Sinatra's crippled wife. Arnold Stang is another unlikely survivor of the road. Regarded as pitiful and contemptible, his Sparrow character offers sweet comic moments. <br /> <br /> Music is almost the protagonist of this film - dark, frantic, moody, moving. Elmer Bernstein's score perfectly accentuates the tensions of Frankie Machine's spiritual weakness and the physical need for heroin. Molly's theme is bittersweet and acoustically captures what the film visually describes. I know of no other soundtracks that effectively complete the tension and defeat within a man as effectively as this.
