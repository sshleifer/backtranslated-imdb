I have seen and enjoyed all the Chameleon films and I must say that they continue to improve and improve each of them. Bobbie Phillips is fantastic and my niece wants to be just like her. I'm glad they brought a "Brother" character for Bobbie (Kam), so we can expect to see more exciting shows. Bobbie is handsome, sexy, sweet and independent at the same time, and everything a female might want to be!
