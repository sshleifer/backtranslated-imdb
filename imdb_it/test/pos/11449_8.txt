A group of mostly disgusting and grossly unpleasant teenagers go to an old deadly, remote and dilapidated cemetery located near a graveyard to attend an all-out Halloween party hosted by Mimi Kinkade, the strange fanatic from the hidden obsession and her vacant boy - the hungry little girl friend Linnea Quigley. The mischievous mustache, the uninitiated, the beer drinkers and the cunning of sex hold a seance like a joke (a bad idea, because it is said that the desolate old dive is obsessed with demonic spirits). Certainly, this reckless session awakens those decidedly grumpy and hostile evil spirits, who kill horribly and possess the majority of children, turning them into ugly beak-faced demons with fangs, which make the usual gruesome destruction around the world. duration of a particularly long, dark and excruciating night of pure terror. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is essentially your umpteenth vigorously graphic and inexorable rigor from wall to wall at low cost "Evil Dead", full of closed, there is no way out claustrophobic, confined, confined, outrageously exaggerated splatter pieces, an incessant pounding hum'n'shiver synthesizer, a total sense of gloomy and gloomy dark nightmare, and vibrant in -your busy-minded cinematography (the long awaited and indescribable overactive camera , soft, sinuous shots, insanely pushed shots, even the camera on a trolley that makes an eight with grace at 180 degrees). Fortunately, the elegant, confident and elegant direction of Kevin S. Tenney keeps the procedures extremely worn and derivative that go hand in hand in a quick jerk; in addition, Tenny gives the film an elegant and refined appearance and effectively creates a chilling atmosphere of ooga-booga in an atmosphere of energetic and grotesque cruelty. <br /> <br /> However, the wonderfully bloody and imaginative makeup effects of Steve Johnson are true stars of the show. Among the bloodthirsty attractions include the disgusting and fat drunk Hal Havins (who played an equally annoying obese hole in the immortal "Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-A-Rama" at the same time) with the tongue bitten, Quigley pushing a whole tube of lipstick in one of her breasts (yow!) and creaking the eyes of a guy while she is making love with him (double!), a libidinous teenage couple is taken out while doing exactly what you think in a coffin (the girl has her neck broke while the guy cut his arm), Kinkade set his hands on fire and, in the ugliest scene in the film, a bad old man has his throat cut from the inside out after eating a piece of laced apple with razor blades. Likewise the trash and dirty rock score smokes. And then there is the incredibly wild, sexy and uninhibited demonic dance of Kinkade, a sizzling number accompanied by a flickering stroboscopic light and cuts of amazing jumps that Kinkade choreographed herself. Okay, so this in general is not equivalent to anything more than a completely mindless and useless piece, albeit pleasantly mounted and voluptuously vulgar with carefree bravado, but if you're in the mood for the grumpy fuss of hastily cerebral horror this nonsense cheerfully coarse and youthful does the trick well.
