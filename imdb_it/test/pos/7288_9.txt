OK ... people need to get settled! This film is not so bad. I saw it for the first time last night and I fell in love with it! I have to admit I was never a fan of LeeLee Sobieski, but she grew up with me in this movie. I think Josh Hartnett is good looking, but come on ... Chris Klein is the most beautiful man I've ever seen !!! It made that movie better for me. Come on girls ... when she's not wearing a shirt and fetching water, I know your mouth has fallen. Yes, I know he is a fool at first, but eventually he realizes how he behaved and learns to be a good boy. If he hadn't come to the end ... then I would have been crazy. I think there is no need to say a couple of lines, but all in all it was a great movie! I highly recommend it!
