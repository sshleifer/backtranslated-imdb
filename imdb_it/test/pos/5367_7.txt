The first time I saw a Brotherhood of Satan I was 12, I saw him in a small town in central Washington, where he played in front of Tales from the crypt we had left early because my sisters were already scared by the Brotherhood of Satan. All in all I thought it was a good movie. The beginning was good, we just sat down and that tank made a number on that station wagon. <br /> <br /> What struck me about the film was the scenery around the city where it was shot it looked almost like the area around Chelan WA, where I saw the movie, especially when they were driving to the city of Hillsboro, which is the site of the film, a small city in New Mexico. I always liked LQ Jones and Strother Martin and also Charles Bateman who was on Get Smart another show that I like. I gave the film at 7 and later, when I saw Tales from the crypt, I thought Brotherhood of Satan was better.
