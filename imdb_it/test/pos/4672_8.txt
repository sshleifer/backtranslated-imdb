The film is really good, it doesn't use violence or sex etc to sell itself like the other films, but it uses only a really decent plot (based on the original by Michael Caine) and some great actors to make a movie full of fun and action which I really enjoyed. One thing that made me appreciate this film even more was the presence of some actors that I like very much, like Edward Norton (whom I saw for the last time in 26th hour, which I also liked), Jason Statham ( transporter, I had fun too) and Seth Green, which I think is great, his role as Shawn Fanning's roommate "The Napster" is hilarious and his hacker skills play an important role in the main blow that focuses on a big traffic jam in Los Angeles. Car chases are really decent and the high tech equipment used by thieves is interesting and very impressive. I didn't see the original so I can't really compare it, but I liked it a lot and I highly recommend this movie to everyone, it's not a movie where you need to appreciate that specific genre, it will be good for everyone, I felt good after this movie, he had a really nice ending and it was really fun to watch. I give them 8/10. Go see it!
