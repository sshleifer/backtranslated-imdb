this show is the best that is full of laughter and Kevin James is the best so if you want a good show I recommend the king of the queens and it is a disappointment that they canceled it so in the end this show will make you forget your worries and problems cause if you have a cast with Kevin James and Jerry Stiller you can't go wrong. so I don't know why the cancellation of the show, if anyone knows, please tell me. For a day now you can't find many shows that satisfy your needs as an audience. After Seinfeld and the king of the queens the only show worth looking at is the prison break and if that stops I don't know what to do. in the end, if I were to recommend a show, it will be the king of the queens.
