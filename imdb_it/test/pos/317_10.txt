While I browse through the hundreds of comments that the faithful readers of IMDB published on this film, I find it very interesting that there are few "halfway" comments. Everyone loves it or hates it. Having seen Apocalypse Now about 30 times, and having recently dissected on DVD (how come we never lived without those magical digital machines ?????), I can say without hesitation that I am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this movie. "Why would you like such a confusing film?" ask many of my associates. The answer is this: Forget the war, forget the brutality ... This is a classic history of society that protects itself from those who refuse to align themselves with the status quo. Brando represents the individual who has his own way of completing the job. They (Big Brother) sent him to do the job, he does it too well, without adhering to the accepted "standards" of death and destruction (I'm the only one being tormented by the fact that we have "standards" for death and destruction ????), then send the "Compliance Police" to eliminate the individual. Hmmmmmm .... Do you draw any parallels between this and what you see every day? With the deepest respect for Coppola, who I believe is one of the best directors of all time, I think he has transcended his original intent in the film, and probably didn't even realize it until after the film was released. The subtle text that permeates the entire film has too much to be programmed and portrayed; instead, it seems to have "developed", like a wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden. Once again I have to reiterate: I think that FF Coppola has done a great job on the whole production, as well as the cast and crew, but the sum of the film exceeds ten times the individual efforts. So, if you haven't seen the movie, let's rent it, look at it, then look at it again, and maybe some other time, and look for all the generic parallels to everyday life. Only then can you judge the quality of the film. Those of you who have seen it, look at it again with the mentality described above. I think you might just have a new appreciation for the movie. Or maybe not! It doesn't matter if you love or hate it, make sure you give Coppola credit for his masterful narrative style!
