Henry Thomas and Robin Tunny are a couple of the most underrated performers in the business world. It is beyond me why they have received no more recognition than they have. This film is a perfect example of how unlimited their skills are. <br /> <br /> Playing the lives of people who might be called a bit weird seems to be their specialty, and if these characters aren't weird, I can't find anyone who is. <br /> <br /> The story is fun, romantic, dramatic, complicated and tragic. I hated the ending, but if I didn't, I wouldn't have loved the story as a whole. So there you are.
