Pitch Black is a surprisingly good film. I wasn't a fan of the Vin diesel before seeing Pitch Black, but after seeing Pitch Black my respect for Vin Diesel went up. He did a great job playing Riddick a wanted man for many murders. His character is cold and makes many decisions that have surprised me, as almost at the end Riddick was about to get on the ship and save his ass leaving everyone behind to die. I like this film and how it deals with human instinct. This film is low budget but this film shows that you don't need amazing special effects and a lot of money to make a good movie, I think all the characters have made this film. I give this movie to 8 out of 10;)
