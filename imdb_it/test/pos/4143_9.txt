I was lucky to be an extra in this film when I was about 13 years old during the skating rink scenes. My acting class for middle schools was invited to participate. It was a fantastic experience. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey, Charles Martin Smith and Don Stroud played live music all day long! As a musician, I can appreciate the tireless work and dedication that these guys have brought to their roles. They must have played those songs 20 times. It is very difficult to maintain coherence and energy in these conditions. This is visible during a cut to a close-up of "That'll Be the Day", but fortunately the unsuspecting public probably wouldn't have picked it up. <br /> <br /> Skating all day, getting the day off from school and transporting back in time was an incredible thrill. I also had my first "date" on the film. I had to take a girl to the ticket office. Woo hoo! Even with an expired haircut and the warm lights that dissolved the vaseline in the hair, it was still worth it. Funny things. <br /> <br /> The film is top notch and very satisfying as a whole. Busey offers his best role ever and the supporting cast is superb. I'm glad I took part in a great movie of the day. To think that I could have been in Corvette Summer or something. Not. <br /> <br /> A funny ironic ending to this is that years later I was in a video store in Malibu watching the movie the week it was released on video. Gary Busey came in and stopped right next to me. I showed him the cover and stammered about how good he was and how I was an extra and whatever. Rather strange, but very beautiful, for what it's worth.
