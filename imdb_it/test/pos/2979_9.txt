Great movie! The soundtrack is fantastic! Very relaxing sound. Elton was ahead of his time even in 1971. Lewis Gilbert did a magnificent job in producing and directing this film! The film was romantic and a breath of fresh air. The sound tracks written by Sir Elton complimented the film with a T. Rex Morris does a great job with the tenor sax on the song "Honey Roll" and the poem "I Meant To Do My Work Today" by Richard Le Gallienne is it was unbelievable! Congratulations to everyone involved with this fantastic movie! Not surprisingly, many of the people involved in this film have become the best in their field.
