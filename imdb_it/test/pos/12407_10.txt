I love this movie. Tense with great characters. The boy from "Sandlot" is excellent as Corey Feldman. When children rage the bank, it's pure adrenaline. Inside the bank, it becomes a bit like a "Lord of the Flies" situation in which they light each other. Justin Walker of "Clueless" is wonderful. I saw it on "Showtime" while browsing the channel. It was a pleasant surprise James Remar is also quite good here as the sheriff of the small town. Taylor Nichols whom I love from "Barcelona" also does a good job as a federal agent. I recommend this movie to all bank robbery fans with many good characters. I was shocked to find that Roger Corman was a producer on this, since the film is not a B movie.
