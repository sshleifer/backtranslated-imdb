I didn't understand what that line meant ... I do it now. I didn't want to see Dirty Dancing either. I rented it but never saw it, and today I did it. And I thought it was a really fun movie, fantastic that makes you want to get up and dance. Okay, sometimes it was poor ... but it's still a great movie. I can't believe that Jennifer Gray was 27 years old in this movie - my friend and I thought she was about 18 or 19-20 at the most. I imagine this is attributed to his acting talent. And sometimes it seemed really embarrassing. Patrick Swayze is also very good, but you can say he is thirty and looks a little old. However, still very good. I love songs from the 80s, so it really struck me, and the love story (yes, I'm a romantic) was done in a wonderful way. I really enjoyed this movie. It exceeded my expectations!
