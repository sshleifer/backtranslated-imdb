Cactus Flower is what I call a "pizza movie": a personal favorite that never fails to satisfy. Perfect for an evening at home with a pizza. Know all the lines (and which lines!) Just improve the fun. <br /> <br /> Since so many others have told the plot here, I will simply add the correction that Bergman's character, Miss Dickinson, was a nurse-receptionist, which means she was an experienced nurse - and therefore an educated person - not "just" a receptionist. <br /> <br /> Bergman's performance in this film - and the film itself - was largely rejected at the time, but today's audiences will be amazed at its range; not only impeccable comic timing, but the ability to make us believe that his character is not aware of his feelings while he reveals them so clearly to Toni and us. While the general plot tends to increase credibility, Bergman's performance is compelling: honest and absolutely credible. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Jack Weston's performance is Matthau's old friend and co-conspirator, Harvey. No one could deliver a zinger like Weston and I.A.L. Diamond's script gives him a lot. For example: "It's a lie so big, dirty and rotten that it has class". Weston excelled in characters a little dingy because he gave off a warmth that allowed you to forgive the defects of his characters. <br /> <br /> The film is a fairly direct adaptation of Abe Burrows' work (adapted from a French comedy by Barillet and Gredy). On Broadway the role of Matthau was played by Barry Nelson. Bergman's by Lauren Bacall and Hawn's by Brenda Vaccaro. It ran for 1,234 shows (three years) and was nominated for two Tony Awards (Vaccaro and Burt Brinckerhoff, who played Igor). <br /> <br /> For me, the soundtrack of the film, written and adapted by the legendary Quincy Jones is another highlight. The main theme (A Time For Love Is Anytime) is played by Sarah Vaughn on the opening and closing titles. He also crept into several arrangements throughout the film, particularly as the romantic piano music, emphasizing Berman's speech in Hawn in the record store. Jones also created covers of popular songs from the period (To Sir With Love, I'm A Believer) for the night club scenes. As with all elements of the film, there is an enormous amount of talent, obvious taste and professionalism. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, few modern romantic comedies can compare with this classic. It's great to have it finally available on DVD. It's time to call a pizza ...
