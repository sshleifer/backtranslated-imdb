In one of Charlie Chaplin's best long short films, he puts the little friend in the trenches of the First World War, where he brings his intolerable courtesy and infinite patience to the laborious work of the trench, where the troops lived for months at a time before going finally over the top to overcome the enemy, and usually until death. It takes someone from Chaplin's skill as a comedian to make something as sad as the trench in such a brilliant comedy, but the irony he uses in the film makes even the most uncomfortable conditions extremely fun. <br /> <br /> Like all the best of Chaplin's films, short films and more, this one is full of brilliant and memorable scenes, like the scene in which he marks with a piece of chalk on a board in the trench, erasing one when he gets his helmet fired, the scene where he and his comrades sleep underwater, opening the bottle of beer and lighting the cigarette and, of course, overtaking the enemy. All these scenes are show-stops, reminiscent of the most beautiful Chaplin scenes. This should not be lost!
