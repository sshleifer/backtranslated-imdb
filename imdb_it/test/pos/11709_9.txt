Sharky's Machine is easily one of Burt Reynolds' best efforts. It also stands out as one of the best contemporary dramas. Erotic and violent, the film stands out to set the story in Atlanta and to deliver a case of chaotic detective to you (the viewer) on a silver platter. Dedicated and determined, Sharky must stop the murder of Dominoe, an adorable lady of the night, whose clientele is anything but ordinary. In a short time, Sharky's crime-fighting machine discovers a first-rate conspiracy that threatens to corrupt Atlanta's internal body. As a resident of Metro Atlanta, I remember the enthusiasm in the city during the production of the film. Sharky's Machine does everything to give an accurate portrait of Atlanta. Twenty years removed and 2,000,000 more people, the film has stood the test of time. Trust me, Atlanta hasn't changed. One of the highlights of the photo is the daring aerobatics of Dar Robinson (a classic and symbolic ending). It was also presented on That's Incredible, the ABC reality show of the period. It's just a pity that Hollywood doesn't produce enough films like this. Kick back, each of your popcorn and watch the cinematic action of silver.
