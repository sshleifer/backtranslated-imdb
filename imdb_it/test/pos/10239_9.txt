I was disappointed that the award for the make-up academy went to Dick Tracy, a horrible movie with a horrible trick. The Nightbreed (based on the novel "Cabal" with the best title) looks fantastic, the acting is excellent and David Chroneburg is a truly terrifying and terrifying antagonist. <br /> <br /> The focus on the plot is about Aaron Boone, who has nightmares about a society of monsters that live under a cemetery. Is he inventing or is it real and does he call it? His Pyschologist (Chroneburg) convinces him that he is a murderer, a family murderer. <br /> <br /> Troubled and suicidal, Boone seeks refuge in Midian, but the monsters do not want him at first. He is also followed by his girlfriend, Lori, who refuses to give up even after his death and returns cold and monstrous. <br /> <br /> But Decker will not let Boone continue. It raises the locals in a total assault on Midian, like a holy war in the name of gods with the devil. <br /> <br /> Barker's themes of misunderstood monsters can come from his experiences as a homosexual male, but I am always strong and honest. Nightbreed turns the genre in the head. The monsters are just trying to survive and want to be left alone, but the man is hunting them. <br /> <br /> A cut of over 20 minutes was originally presented by Barker, but the studio cut it into this fragmented masterpiece. Barker is at work trying to find the missing video for a press release as a director. Until then, this version will have to do.
