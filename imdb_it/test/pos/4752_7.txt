This film is not about soda or French Connection. <br /> <br /> Seven Ups is a group of elite policemen who use tactics that do not comply with the NYPD protocol. Scheider leads the group with his team or with a regular appearance. They are doing surveillance on a sign of our local coast and things go wrong when a policeman's wire is discovered. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Richard Lynch, the most evil man in the film (Invasion: America, Little Nikita) and his companion ends up killing the policeman by accident and escaping from Scheider in the most beautiful chase scene I've seen, Bullitt and French Connection are not as good as those on the West Side in George Washington and on the Palisades Parkway in New Jersey. <br /> <br /> The stunt pilots are fantastic and Lynch manages to get rid of them even if he seems scared to death by the dangerous journey. Roy Scheider is nearly killed when his car slams into the back of Mack's truck ripping up the roof of his vehicle. <br /> <br /> Things go to the head and you have to keep looking to follow a sequence like that. Fast and intense movement, fresh for thirty years.
