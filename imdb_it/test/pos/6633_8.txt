A very credible and disturbing film that describes the effects of war on the general public, Shame gives us a chilling understanding of Ingmar Bergman's beliefs. The absence of color and sound (as in a soundtrack) helps to give the film a more realistic feel. There are no soft or rigid lights or a variety of camera angles to give the story a fascinating or dramatic effect. Everything is simply depicted as it would be in reality. Sometimes the plot was confusing, but maybe to make sense of the mental structure of the characters ?? as they too now know what is happening or why. The simplicity of the film made it a bit boring, but I could understand how the director is trying not to fascinate the story and the points. He painted the hard and disturbing events and effects of war. At the beginning the characters were introduced and shown as contents with the clearest settings and very long and drawn shots. When the war suddenly struck them, they were much darker and quieter with less intimate blows. Bergman did a good job allowing us to be consumed by war ourselves and presenting us with an image so adequately corresponding to the war. Although the plot itself was not too impressive, the content of the film was.
