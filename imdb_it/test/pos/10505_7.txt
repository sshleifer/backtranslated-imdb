A strange beam of light enters the bedroom of Dr. Craig Burton (Arnold Vosloo) and his wife Sherry (Jillian McWhirter) while making love. About two hours have disappeared because they seem to hug each other unharmed. Under hypnosis during a session with psychiatrist Dr. Susan Lamarche (Lindsay Crouse), Craig discovers that his wife was impregnated by aliens. Sherry resists this notion as absurd and is happy to pass on news to her husband who is really pregnant. Ecstatic after trying to get pregnant for years, Sherry is frightened by Craig's perseverance that the fetus is not his ... comes from a control over his low sperm count with particularly high probability that he would not in any way impregnate her wife. Embarrassing and disturbing experiences with the fetus inside her lead Sherry to some frightening discoveries ... the doctor, David Wetherly (Wilford Brimley), discovers that the ultra-sound gives some unusual results of the appearance of the developing child, but it's Craig to notice that it looks like an alien! Sparks light up and cut off the electrical equipment, even blocking the Wetherly pacemaker! Through hypnosis, Sherry reveals the experience of his abduction, but Lamarche believes his problem is psychological and not physiological. Since no one believes his wife's theory of alien fertilization, Craig turns to sociologist Dr. Bert Clavell (Brad Dourif), whose work is in studies of alien life and abduction. But, Bert is reluctant to help Craig go to the ends of the earth to save his wife's life from damage. The tragic results occur while Lamarche and others try to keep Craig from his goal of "cutting the thing" believing he is crazy. Craig will continue to do his job trying to drag Bert down this road with him. Grim, a compelling horror story about a man's struggle to save his wife from the evil of beings that no one else believes exists. Fortunately, the character of Dourif is not a bit of a quack but an intelligent doctor who wants to know more, but his search for the truth of the aliens is not hostile ... he hopes to learn from Sherry, but it's not incredibly challenging in this objective. The story is told in a realistic way. It's easy to see why others might consider Craig his rocker. Vosloo does not take the character too far, but expresses the anguish of his current situation. How can he save his wife from these enemies and prove to others that he is not mad? McWhirter deserves credit for the demands of the difficult abduction scenes in which his unfortunate character is naked on this table that is probed and harassed by these things. Crouse is fine in his limited but important role as a voice of reason in a situation where his clients seem psychologically out of control. The monster effects are icky and effective. I think the film works quite well, and director Yuzna deserves the credit for staying at least for this film. The last twenty minutes of Craig trying to perform his "removal surgery" with a frightened Bert looking at the insanity of the situation to escalate is a disaster. <br /> <br /> You know, "Fire in the Sky" fans could dig this flick.
