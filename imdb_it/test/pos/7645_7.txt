This is a bizarre robbery / kidnapping film, which at first seems predictable and then continues to surprise until the last scene. The protagonist is a grifter who goes to work in a small carnival, where he is paid to kill the wife of the manager of the womb of the manager, Divana, and ends up falling in love with her. It is fascinating, difficult and deadly and continues to disappear and to appear as a kind of wizard trick. The other props in the film include her duplicate husband / employer (played by the talented Armand Assante), some ugly Dominican mobsters and the most important for the plot, a suitcase full of money. Just like the old "shell game", the one in which you have to guess which of the peas is underneath, you'll have to guess who has the money, and how the victims of the beggars who run such games, probably guess. Dagma Dominczyk, as an adorable Divana, is a talented artist and a careful vision, both dancing with the huge snake around her shoulders and working adrift on all the unfortunate men in her orbit. Norman Reedus is as good as the young swindler who is baffled by the elusive beauty that has been paid to kill. Don't exclude him, however, because he turns out to be smarter than he gave him credit. This strange film is worth a look.
