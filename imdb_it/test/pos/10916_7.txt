*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** I loved the set-up and I always laughed for the whole movie. The acting was great, with the part I prefer to be that of Howard (Kevin Kline) trying to be a "manly man". The boyfriend and parents did a great job as a support cast. Spoiler Warning: Acting acceptance of his conservative family and his attempts to be educated have been encouraging and credible. My only problem with the end was the fact that Howard was actually gay. The film is set up as a "being who you want to be", but the film actually does the opposite. Howard's logic behind his "discovery" is the fact that he loves Barbra Streisand's films and loves to dance music. His mannerisms and tastes seem to be gay, and it is not until he is pointed out that he realizes it. Instead of freeing Howard, the pigeon wounds him. Oh, he likes dancing with music, which must be gay. His confession to marriage seemed to bend to the wishes of society. In the end, the film becomes a film about the rights of homosexuals, which was not the original course. It becomes almost insipid with the rest. I think the film would have been better in the end if Howard had been honest. It would have been more true for the message.
