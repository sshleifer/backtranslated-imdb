A fantastic film, I've just seen it and I want to see it again. I had never heard of Derek Jarman before seeing this movie, but now I am, I look forward to seeing his others. The film has a completely new perspective on Shakespeare's The Tempest, I'm sure he would have appreciated it for Jarman's use of the themes of love, magic, darkness and atmospheric tension in the game. OK, OK, there might have been a bit of nudity in the film I didn't expect, but it didn't offend me, it just surprised me and made the movie more unpredictable. One Spoiler (for those with a nervous predisposition: make the flashback scene fast with Sycorax and Caliban and Ariel as their slave, its cute graphics. In general, if you're starting to find the shakespearean performances of Kenneth Branagh flaccid and monotonous, then you have to see this movie Fantastic and surreal, it will leave you speechless, but only if you let it ... Have an open mind - and then let this movie work is magical for you.
