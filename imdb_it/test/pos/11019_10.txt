I've seen this movie over and over again - every time it makes me laugh, it makes me think, and it makes me cry. Robin Tuney does an incredible job of portraying Marcy (and I am glad that Kate Winslet and that other lady have rejected her part) is just one of those roles that you know no one else could even compare. <Br /> <br /> It is a beautiful love story of these two very different people in disgusting situations that come together. They stand next to each other, no matter what, even if it's in a strange situation and crazy ways. <br /> <br /> Now I tell you it's not for everyone - from everyone I've shown to myself Let's say the results are 50/50 - but if you like it, you'll like it and want to share it with others! 10 stars all the way!
