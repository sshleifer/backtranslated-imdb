This is a clever story about relationships and an exposure of three main categories of players in the game of relationships: playboys (Max), manipulative women (Alice) and fools who could really be in love (Lisa, Muriel and Lucien). <br /> <br /> Max and Alice are very unpredictable and perhaps contemptible characters, but they always have control in the game, leaving their companions in the dark. But as the discussed ending tells us, as veteran players like Max and Alice, they would be happy to part when they think it is appropriate, as if the game had just ended and none of them could have cared less about it with their life and play another game with other anonymous people when another opportunity presents itself. Lisa, Muriel and Lucien could be the ones who want to invest something real in a relationship, just not being able to realize that it was the baits in the game and the last losers (regarding what they showed us ... .What they know if they are also advanced players of some kind in their worlds not shown on the screen). <br /> <br /> This is a very fast story, delicately elaborate and seductive witty with a seductive execution of the cast. It also deserves a deeper thought: how real is it in a game of relationships?
