I was very anxious to watch this movie first. <br /> <br /> Even though I knew it would be another kind of Revenge of the Nerds movie, I was still impressed. <br /> <br /> There is plenty of truth about this type of learning and we strongly believe that it should be allowed in a "new style of schooling". <br /> <br /> Traditional teaching methods do not always teach students what they need to know or should know or want to know. <br /> <br /> This approach to teaching should be further researched in real academic courses. <br /> <br /> While there was still too much the party scenes, of course they had to be thrown there - for Hollywood's interest in doing a college comedy ... even though we all know that life is not really so. <br /> <br /> An incredible touch, still fun and with a killer ending. <br /> <br /> Awesome finish. Fundamental to the whole story and very surprising. <br /> <br /> Without the final scene, the film would have been just as good. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie and it was not necessary to have too many curses or nudity or coarse jokes to be good. <br /> <br /> Great crew and cast, history and even the generic typecasting of the obligatory "members of Hampton's brotherhood" has been well done. /> <br /> American Pie 1, 2 3 and American Wedding or any other clone that makes people not up to this 1/3. <br /> <br /> Much better than most comedies in the first year of college without humiliating humiliating pranks to make someone vomit. <br /> <br /> I liked it, even if it was simple ... it was interesting and it also had the heart ... my only regret for watching this film is that it was no longer long
