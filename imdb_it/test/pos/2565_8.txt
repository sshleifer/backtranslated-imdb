While I was reading the comments, I was surprised to find one that said this film was "not very deep". I have to disagree, this must be one of the most profound and inspiring films I've ever seen. Yes, the acting and the music were excellent; have been praised over and over again in reviews. However, I also praise the heart of the film. It resonates with deep meaning and feeling, it is a story of redemption. These are two very different and very imperfect characters, knocked down by life but too strong to lie down and die. It's about a man who sees more value in a girl than he has seen in himself. It strongly reminded me of the book Redeeming Love by Francine Rivers, which has a similar story of redemption. Yes, the images and themes are confusing and sometimes shocking, but if you look closely enough, you may simply see yourself in these characters. Sometimes the real things in life are not beautiful, but they are real.
