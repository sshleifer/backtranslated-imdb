This film should be easily qualified as a movie <br /> <br /> that best promotes human understanding between people. <br /> <br /> It might be rather annoying even to try to understand that a young southern Jewish girl could shelter a fleeing German prisoner of war. <br /> <br /> Kristy McNichol paints an incredible portrait of the unhappy young woman thirsting for acceptance and love. Michael Constantine gave a remarkable performance as his difficult father and Esther Rolle, as the maid, Ruth, gave a superb Emmy-winning performance as a headstrong waitress who reached these events. <br /> <br /> Bruce Davison plays the German who is allegedly not guilty of Nazi atrocities. Here's how his role looks. He fled, but joined the German army and may have been a member of the Hitler youth movement. <br /> <br /> The action takes place in 1944 in Georgia, in a rural area. Citizens are full of prejudices. Even the FBI inspector acts like he wants to get something out of the Jews. Notice the opposite interpretation that when McNichol is in bed, Davison is hunted and eventually fired. It is interesting to see that the company considers McNichol a traitor for hosting a escaped prisoner of war. The film also deals with an extremely complex relationship that exists between father and daughter. The explosion of Constantine to his daughter in the end is a bit of acting. Like her mother, Barbara Barrie, she has little to do. It was annoying that she was stereotyped as the typical Jewish mother with that strong lipstick on her lips. <br /> <br /> Memorably done and worth seeing.
