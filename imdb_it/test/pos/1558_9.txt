Fantastic movie! Wow - this is really a pleasure. I can't believe I discovered a jewel like this. <br /> <br /> A rather young girl traveling to the south of Florida meets an elderly friendly couple with a camper van, after she has an apartment in a park. However, she learns that things are not what they seem and the couple gets a little creepy after she spends time with them. <br /> <br /> Everyone was so perfect for their parts. I believe you are looking at what is happening in real life in front of you. The newcomer Emily Grace has done a fantastic job like Alice, really pretty, yet a little shy. Emily gives you the feeling of being able to understand what she is experiencing and you can see how she got into the situation that develops in the film. I'm sure we'll see Emily in other films in the future. <br /> <br /> Contrary to what others have said, lighting and photography in this were simply perfect. The assembly was also done well - it's the right way to put together the images of the highway to give you the feeling that you're traveling together with the cast on their journey. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen it on the big screen, but I can only urge everyone to go out and see it. More movies like this are * exactly * what we need. <br /> <br /> SF
