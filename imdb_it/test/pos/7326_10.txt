The Universal Studios version of "Flipper" (1996) is a moving film for the whole family with good values ​​and sentimentality. It's the story of Sandy Ricks, a Chicago teenager who reluctantly spends his holidays with Uncle Porter Ricks in the Bahamas. This eventually changes the lives of teenagers and grows in the process. Learn to appreciate nature and have respect for the environment. I grew up in the 1960s and the NBC TV show "Flipper" was my favorite childhood show. Elijah Wood is perfectly launched as Sandy Ricks of the 90s and offers excellent performance. As much as I liked the NBC TV show and the MGM animated film with Luke Halpin as Sandy in the 1960s, I liked this feature better! I feel that Elijah Wood is the best Sandy Ricks. Regarding Luke Halpin, I feel that Elijah Wood has more than a series of talents and emotes more as an actor which makes his performance excellent and more credible. I think Elijah Wood is the best young actor working in movies today. Director Alan Shapiro also wrote the script and did a great job both as a writer and director of this film. Paul Hogan gives a comical and enjoyable performance like Sandy Porter Ricks' uncle. Mr. Hogan's performance perfectly compensates for the role of Elijah as Sandy. I'm a big fan of underwater movies. This film was beautifully filmed in the Bahamas as "Thunderball" (1965 AU). The director of photography was Bill Butler A.S.C. who directed the film "Jaws" in 1975. Mr. Butler is a very talented filmmaker. Pete Romano was the director of underwater photography. He did a great job with underwater photography. I liked the soundtrack of Joel McNeely. This good soundtrack included Crosby, Stills and Nash among the other talented artists. This film was shot in Panavision as "Thunderball" in the proportions of 2.35: 1 If possible, try seeing this film in an oscilloscope version as originally framed and viewed by Alan Shapiro and Bill Butler. Another very nice thing is that Mr. Shapiro gave the "original" Sandy Ricks (Luke Halpin) a small part in this remake. He played Bounty Fisherman # 3 in this film. This was a very kind gesture from Mr. Shapiro! As you can tell, I'm a real fan of this movie. Unfortunately, this beautiful film has been received with harsh words by most film critics. I originally saw this film on my birthday, May 31, 1996, in a movie theater. It means a lot to me. I have it on many video versions. The VHS versions are in "pan and scan". The laserdisc version is "letterboxed" 2.35: 1! I even have a VCD in 2.35: 1 from Hong Kong which is "letterboxed". But my most precious asset is an "original" 16mm theatrical print that I will keep for the rest of my life! Thanks to Mr. Shapiro, Elijah Wood, Paul Hogan and all those involved for making this film unforgettable for me! <br /> <br /> P.S. I must add that the quality of the Universal DVD is superb! It's the best quality DVD I've ever seen. The color and resolution are spectacular. The soundtrack is fantastic. I think Universal must have used the same transfer for the DVD they did for the laserdisc version. The 35mm print is "perfect" and Alan's film really looks wonderful. A great tribute to a wonderful film! The DVD resolution is even higher than the quality of the laser disc! It's simply spectacular! Thanks Universal Home Video for excellent quality control and transfer. Thank you very much for doing a great job in this wonderful family movie. Also many thanks to you Alan for all your extreme kindness to me !!! It is a real honor to meet you !!! (Revised / updated June 27, 2005)
