Growing up in the late 60s and 70s I couldn't help but become a fan of science fiction. With the top American space program, science fiction books, movies, TV series and comics have fueled my imagination and opened my mind to the possibilities that exist in the universe. Farscape is so different from any other science fiction show yet it has all the ingredients that made shows like Star Trek, Battlestar Gallatica, X-Files and Deep Space Nine favorite. One of the criticisms of Farscape is that the casual spectator cannot simply jump in and watch an episode and understand what is happening. There have been other hugely successful shows that have used multiple episode strings and complicated characters. For me this is one of the positive aspects of the show. I don't need or want to have the whole story tied to the end of each episode like the various Star Trek incarnations. All in all, Farscape has wonderful and amusing characters and a plot that says that although humans can be the least evolved or advanced intelligent species in the universe, they still have unique qualities and abilities. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the short-sighted people on the Sci-Fi channel canceled Farscape's fifth season. They stated that the cancellation was based on poor evaluations. Yet only a few years ago it was their most voted original series and the critics' favorite. It is a pity that all the artists who contribute to creating this show will not be able to continue their labor of love due to the fiscal problems of the same channel / company that made it all possible in the first place. <br /> <br /> Hey, don't believe me, watch the show, watch the replicas and decide for yourself. Help save Farscape!
