I found this film pretty bright. Initially I wanted a "when the animals attacked" by hitting the lines of "little fish" or even "thieves", but it was given a truly horrible ordeal that was not devoid of humanity. Having been in the areas where it was created (including the crocodile farm at the beginning of the film, also sharing the same guide!), He added to the fear factor. Those crocs are really everywhere up there, although I don't think they had the "attitude" of this beast. Yes, there were some melodramatic moments but they helped rather to distract from the whole atmosphere. I was genuinely interested in the characters and I shuddered thinking "what would I do?" in their boat. Not knowing where your enemy was hiding or the sound of the crocodile chowing at night was really scary. I would say that this film is one of the best horrors I've seen over the years (approaching the descent). I give him four alligator bags.
