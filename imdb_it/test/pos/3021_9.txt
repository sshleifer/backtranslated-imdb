A crackling and magnificent thriller about a child psychiatrist, Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) who is desperate by two FBI agents, Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) and Gordon Ramsey (Jake Weber) to use his therapy on Carl Stargher (Vincent D 'Ofornio), a serial killer who (uses strange and terrifying torture tactics) is found in a coma by the feds. What Novak wants in exchange from Deane is where Stargher's latest victim is and whether she is alive. Once Deane enters the mind of Stargher, who has the look and feel that recalls a colorful combination of "Dune" or "Blue Velvet" by David Lynch and "A Nightmare on Elm Street" by Wes Craven, start 'adventure. Deane sees a variety of strange people ranging from Carl as a young man (an adorable Jake Thomas) to a man like Freddy Krueger without the razor's claws. I don't want to give the final as a present, but the film is truly exceptional in addition to the dynamic performances, the music and the gruesome direction of Howard Shore (by Tarsem, which shows here that he can direct).
