Lana Turner showed that in this spell of 1940 she could really dance a storm for the last sacrifice her sister (Joan Blondell) made to her. <br /> <br /> When both sisters come to New York, they follow Blondell's boyfriend, a wonderful George Murphy, in this movie. <br /> <br /> As fate would have it, the director of the show is impressed by Turner, but sees nothing ahead for Blondell if not a job like the cigarette girl. Not only does Blondell miss the celebrity, the boyfriend, Murphy (Eddie) also falls in love with Turner. Not to hurt his sister, Turner is ready to marry the producer of the show, a wealthy womanizer who has married four times. <br /> <br /> The story ends best with Blondell moving away quickly in Nebraska. Look for Paul Ford, as a gossip reporter in the film. It is difficult to recognize due to the date of the film and the fact that it is much thinner. The film leaves you with the question of whether Ford and Blondell could ever meet. <br /> <br /> Blondell, like his devoted sister, sacrifices both career and love, for his sister. This film is sentimental and could have worked better if it was shot in Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Few realize that George Murphy, the future California Republican senator, was rather a singer and dancer in his time.
