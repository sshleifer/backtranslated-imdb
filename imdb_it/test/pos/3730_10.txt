Great movie. Post-apocalyptic films. This is no exception. He kept pace and interest without a speck of dialogue (mainly through good character development). The struggle between the Reno and the hero was close. I also liked the use of cave paintings and medieval weapons to show how primitive and wild humanity had become without their technology and guzzalina. The connection between the beginning and the end was a bit of space, that is, I had difficulty understanding the distances between the hotel and the opening sequence. In summary, the progression of the characters, design, history without the cushion of dialogue and, above all, the desolate and always appreciated scenery of a post-apocalyptic desolate land.
