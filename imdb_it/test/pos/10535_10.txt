This is absolutely the best cartoon of the 80s, perhaps the best cartoon of all time. It had all the action, adventure, thrill and more ... <br /> <br /> I can't imagine how difficult it was for the Ruby-Spears company to make this amazing cartoon, it was spent a lot of money on this work masterpiece and it was worth it, for example only the illuminating scenes were difficult because I wouldn't have called the 80s for a great technological year with computers like now in the world we live in, so the scenes illuminants were excellent! <br /> <br /> The cartoons will never be the same as before, which is why I hope they will all be released on DVD specifically for The Centurions since it's my favorite. I have the entire complete set of 65 episodes on DVD-r but it's not the same because if they were released on DVD people in the world would be able to buy it and watch DVDs in almost every store, which means a lot to the fans . My good friend Ted made this petition to bring the show back on TV or better on DVD, that is if we get many requests to get them back on DVD. <br /> <br /> So, help us by signing the petition at http://www.petitiononline.com/6600F/petition.html
