I saw this movie with my mother and I loved it! It was such a sweet story, (not to mention funny because of the supporting cast!) They never made films like this ... ever! My favorite part is when Grace (Minnie Driver) discovers the death of her fianc√©'s wife, and that she has the heart of her dead wife and shouts "WHAT WAS GOD THOUGHT?" I believe that everyone (no matter who you believe) has such thoughts once in a while. But while he is very sloppy, he could only make you believe in true love and destiny once and for all. (Sigh) <br /> <br /> The comic timing between Bonnie Hunt and Jim Belushi will only make you collapse (especially in the scene above, it's terrible, yet so funny!). They make a good pair, and I hope to see them again in something soon. 10/10 stars
