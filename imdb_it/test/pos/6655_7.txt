I went to this film thinking that I wouldn't like it, but I was hoping to be surprised, but this, very similar to the movie, ended in a void and without hope. But don't get me wrong, Minghella offers all sorts of great epics and for those who love this kind of experience and are willing to embark on that adventure and accept what comes simply, so they won't be disappointed and will be one of the best films of the year to them opinion. The acting is high quality and will most likely come out with a triad of Oscars for Law, Kidman and Zellweger, although Portman's few scenes could be the most powerful in the film. The locations are beautiful and Minghella has an eye for a good shot. <br /> <br /> However, for those like me who want the director to take them on the adventure instead of going willingly they could be disappointed mainly because of Minghella and his adaptation. The film is so profoundly dreary that it makes what I consider a punching bag epic that is a film that tries to hit hard with emotion but does so at such an extreme and so often that during the movie I didn't have the time to invest emotionally, or of not having recovered from a previous blow, and it became unrealistic and consequently too difficult to really cure, not to mention predictable. Overall, the "Cold Mountain" almost left me drained even just to rethink the positive aspects of the film, since all I remember is death, which may have been an original motif, but which ends up being at the center of the characters.
