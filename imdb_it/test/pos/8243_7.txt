We went to the cinema waiting for a very demanding budget publication and we got an art movie. The film was digitally projected on about two-thirds of the real estate screen with classic sloping edges of digital projection, and had a limited stereo soundtrack that was wasted in the cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> The content of the film was the same old historical content that we have seen before, but heavily sanitized to prevent the public from getting sick. The live action scenes, those that were few, were constantly reused in classic documentary style, which became annoying after a while. <br /> <br /> I was rather surprised that only 4 people showed up to watch it, guess the rest knew something we didn't have. <br /> <br /> I suspect that the producers have made the film the recognition of the ninetieth anniversary of Gallipoli. I have to ask myself if they should have bothered me. <br /> <br /> Seven out of ten for trying, and out of respect for the ANZAC.
