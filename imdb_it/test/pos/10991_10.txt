As a native of the city where the story takes place, Buffalo, NY, it's fun to see the local sites, but the plot is so local and fun! <br /> <br /> The small-scale promotion of this film requires strong word of mouth to realize the broad vision it deserves. Please make this movie the success of Big, Fat Greek Wedding.
