I saw this movie as a child and I fell in love with it. It has a sweet and delicate history. Something that children can appreciate. I loved so much as a child that I had to find it for my daughter. It is definitely a film I would watch with children. It reminds me of a great deal of Disney nature stories like Pete's Dragon and Mary Poppins. Both for the live action and for the cartoons, but for his premise. It is also a good story to show children that if they tell the truth they can be trusted and adults will listen to them. I think all children should see it and have fun. It is such a break from the violent tacky movies that so many children watch these days. It has all the fascinating qualities that many of today's movies don't have.
