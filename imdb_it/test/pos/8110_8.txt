Hynkel, dictator of Tomania, is a spoiled child who gets angry when he can't get what he really wants ... And what he simply wants is nothing less than the world ... <br /> <br /> In one of the extraordinary scenes of Chaplin's art, Hynkel performs a ballet with the "world" that breaks out when he thinks he has it in his hand ... <br /> <br /> Chaplin also has some pungent words about war and war movies .. In a scene at the beginning of the film, which takes place during the First World War, the Tomanian messenger crashes the plane and thinks ... He is going to die ... In a state of delirium, he begins to say ridiculous words. .. The double empty chat continues to rise in a brilliant take-off on all the heroic scenes of the death of war films ... <br /> <br /> In another scene when he becomes a fugitive in the Jewish ghetto and assumes the command of the resistance that foments rebellion among the old, plans to kill the dictator ... One of the members of the crane ppo must kill the ruthless conqueror of Austerlich ... Anyone chosen will naturally die, but his heroic death will be rewarded and his name will shine like a star in the history of Tomanian ... <br /> <br /> The sequence in which he and four other characters eat cream cakes containing coins to determine which to sacrifice his life to kill the dictator is a bitter bitterness full of great fear ... <br /> <br /> For all his disappointing failings, "The Great Dictator" is still a significant film for the ironic tones of the film adding something that neither Chaplin nor others could have given him: the irony of the story ... The need to kill Hynkel foreshadows Hitler's assassination attempt by his generals ... The strength of the original satire is surpassed only by the imitation of the history of art ... <br /> <br /> With a splendid sequence like the incident with the ducks that leads to the dictator mistaken for the barber umilme Jewish and vice versa, "The Great Dictator" is Chaplin's first talking film .. This time "Charles" and not "Charlie", I want to say more through his film and not through a funny comedy, the last in which he uses his famous 'Tramp Character'.
