More than a miss near that a flop, MR. IMPERIUM plays Ezio Pinza in the role of Alex, apparent heir and later king of a small European nation, who falls in love with a willing American actress and entertainer, Fredda Barlo (Lana Turner), but because of the machinations of Alex's disloyal prime minister as King, played by Cedric Hardwicke, the lovers are separated for 12 years before they meet in Palm Springs, where their love is rekindled. Director Don Hartman, who is also a screenwriter, is unable to fully exploit his talent for snappy dialogue due to the attempted use of Pinza in English, and the necessary rewrite, combined with a non-total relationship between the two stars , translates into a somewhat harsh tone to the script, exacerbated by the unkind cut of the studio of many scenes, which leads to a confusing ending. The oppressive Pinza dominates his scenes with Turner, but both performers score with a good job, while Marjorie Main is impressive with his patter effects as written, with Debbie Reynolds placed on track by Louis B. Mayer for SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN as a result of his lively performance here; only Barry Sullivan is heavily victimized by the flagrant cut. Filmed mostly in Pebble Beach, California, and other parts of Monterey, the film features Pinza's operatic iron bass in Solamente Una Vez, as well as original songs by Harold Arlen and Dorothy Fields, with Douglas Shearer that beautifully handles the recording sound, and you have to pay attention to the beautiful decorations by Edwin Willis and the costumes by Walter Plunkett.
