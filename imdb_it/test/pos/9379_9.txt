Tense and organically compelling, Edward Dmytryk's Crossfire is a suspenseful suspense characteristic, an unlikely "message" film that uses the look and feel of the noir cycle. <br /> <br /> Bivouaced in Washington, DC, a company of soldiers confronts their anxiety by going around the bars. Three of them end up in the apartment of a stranger where Robert Ryan, drunk and belligerent, beats their guest (Sam Levene) to death because he is Jewish. Police detective Robert Young investigates with the help of Robert Mitchum, who is assigned to Ryan's setup. The suspect falls on the second of the three (George Cooper), who has disappeared. Ryan kills the third friend (Steve Brodie) to ensure his silence before Young closes. <br /> <br /> Thanks to a superior script by John Paxton, Dmytryk draws precise performances from his three protagonists Bob. Ryan, of course, makes his prototype Angry White Male (and to the end), while Mitchum underestimates with his characteristic nonchalance of alert (his role, however, is not central); Young people may never have been better. Gloria Grahame gives her first full-fledged interpretation of the vulnerable tramp with an intelligent mouth and, like a sad sack that is immersed in her life, Paul Kelly pursues us in a small peripheral role that makes it memorable. <br /> <The politically committed Dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonization, but is practically limited to Young's reminiscence of how his Irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier (hence, incidentally, stretching the chronology to the limit). At least there is no attempt to make an explanation, however insignificant, of why Ryan hates Jews (and hillbillies and ...). Strangely, Crossfire survives even the great changes that resulted from it - the novel is based on (The Brick Foxhole by Richard Brooks) faced with a homicidal murder. But homosexuality in 1947 was still Beyond The Pale. The news of the Holocaust, however, had begun to emerge from the ashes of Europe, so Hollywood felt encouraged to register his protest against anti-Semitism (the studios always trembled at the prospect of offending any potential ticket purchaser). <br /> <br /> But while the transition from homophobia to anti-Semitism works in general, the details don't fit so well. The victim is chatting with a lonely and drunk soldier and then the invitation to the house seems strange, even though (or especially since when) there is a girl in tow. It raises the question of whether this scenario was inadvertently restrained or left in a discreet tip to the original engine that generates Ryan's murderous rage.
