David Suchet, (Poirot), "FoolProof", '03, gave an outstanding performance as a perfectionist in almost everything he did or said. If he had a cocktail, he always had a napkin to dry the excess in his mouth with incredible perfection! You could just see the expressions on the detective's face and see that he never lost an important element in the behavior of suspects. The beautiful Falls Colors through the English countryside were simply breathtaking. Megan Dodds, "Bait", 2000, gave an exceptional performance as a very sexy and wild woman who was able to keep very important secrets away from Mr. Poirot. A very funny film if you really like the recitation of David Suchet as Mr. Poirot!
