A delightful black comedy on a middle-aged schlub (Danny DeVito) who wants to clash with his mother and opens a plan to do it with a bitter divorcee, who wants to clash with his ex-wife. The film is completely unrepentant in its cynicism and leaves us nobody to like, but for once it works in favor of the film rather than as a starting point. <br /> <br /> Anne Ramsey, as DeVito's battle mother, steals the show in a grotesquely entertaining performance. Even if it's a horror, you end up rooting for her, because it looks like she could kick both of DeVito's and Crystal's asses at the same time with both hands tied behind her back. <br /> <br /> Vote: B +
