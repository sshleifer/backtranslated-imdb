So real and surreal, all in one. I remember feeling like Tessa. Hell, I remember being Tessa. This was a nice vignette of an end of a relationship. I particularly liked the bribery protesters. It's nice to see the symbolism in a film without being slapped. If you have the chance to see it, take it. It is worth 30 minutes.
