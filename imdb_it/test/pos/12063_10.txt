War at home is a splendid television series and I don't understand why it was canceled. Please do something to continue with this beautiful television series, with excellent and wonderful actors, good acting and good situations, please we want the third series and also many new episodes. I beg you!!!! I would like, if possible, to do some way to achieve this and send the interested subject, since I can tell you that this series is very popular here in Italy, as in other European countries, for example the chest of drawers in Spain. In fact, as I wrote above, what is striking about this television series is the good acting of the actors and also the honest one with which numerous topics of real importance are treated. I think both of the best American television series have arrived on Italian screens in recent years. Please !!!!
