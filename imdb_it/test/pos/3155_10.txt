Just see it! It is an intelligent film but too difficult to understand the first time. Watch it more than once. Everything that is seen or heard on the screen is intentionally created to evoke a sensation, a sensation or a tone. The clarity of certain images and the clarity of certain sounds are deliberately contrasted with blurry images or snaps, crackles, hissing and barely audible sounds. The structure is not linear and cyclical. The patterns repeat themselves as time flows both clockwise and counterclockwise. Expectations regarding the "plot" and the character "are interrupted by signaling a non-traditional use of the film to tell a story that is both contemporary and as old as humanity." It is part of a review: "USA The film is emotionally intense, intellectually intriguing and deeply disturbing, in surprising and unconventional ways." Dion Dennis, PhD
