They are just stories, some that we want to happen to us, some that we would never want to happen to us, all about unfulfilled desire. The places and the naked bodies are beautiful, but after the second story all I could think is that "it takes much more than just beauty to create a real movie". So naturally, the film takes place. The stories are moving except that Sophie Marceau fails to communicate her story in this film. But Malkovich interprets the story for both. The voiceover fails to connect the stories, but helps Malkovich to provoke some thought. <br /> <br /> I would say it's worth seeing and the best of Antonioni I've seen. Given his age - remarkable!
