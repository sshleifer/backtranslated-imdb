Reading the other comments here at the IMDB, I had very high expectations before seeing "Angels of the universe". I wasn't disappointed, and giving the movie an 8, I'd say I can justify that grade. <br /> <br /> The film has incredible acting, especially from the main person, Pall. Supportive actors are also doing a great job as the patients of the psychiatric institution, the parents and the brothers of Pall. The music is also worth mentioning, supporting the film in everything, giving depth and feeling. <br /> <br /> Although the film is very Scandinavian, it does not leave a bit of humor and has a sort of objective paternity about Pall's life. However, if you want to see a cheese comedy or something light, this is not for you. It is a story of people with mental problems, of the way they are treated in society - but above all of a story about Pall. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to all movie connoisseurs. It is one of the best films ever released from Iceland, if not Scandinavia.
