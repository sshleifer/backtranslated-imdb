The theme song often comes to my mind after all these years. I was never a TV observer, probably because I was just entering my teenage years when my family bought our first set in 1948 and it never became part of my life. But since the first episode of Lawman I was conquered, and it's the only TV program that has ever planned my week. <br /> <br /> Intelligent, credible, well written and well acted, and John Russell is still the most beautiful man I have ever seen. (Peter Brown was not even a dog: o) <br /> <br /> I agree that it is one of the most undervalued TV series of all time. I hope to see some episodes for my grandchildren to watch.
