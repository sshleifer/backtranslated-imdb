People have to learn to see what's up there on the screen. This is a great film based on a slow and accurate collection of details that serve to establish the personalities of these two men. The passivity of Yusuf (Emin Toprak), the country cousin, is well described by his fear of talking to women. He has at least three chances to start a conversation with a young woman and he loses them all. He has many decades of celibacy before him, and perhaps even unemployment. <br /> <br /> Mahmut is a different case. He left the small town working very hard (we imagine), and his resentment against slackers like Yusuf is palpable (he leaves the crumbs on the expensive carpet - the slob!). We are shown a group of friends talking about Tarkovsky among other things, and we note that Mahmut feels regret - but only a slight regret - that his work has become commercial over the years. The gap between the cousins ​​becomes wider and wider. The mousetrap theme is wonderfully vivid, bringing out Yusuf's compassion and confusion and solving the problem of Mahmut cold. I remembered two classic films of men driving each other: Chabrol's cousins ​​(the rich guy with Hitlerian pretensions played by Brialy is always in my mind) and Kiss of the Spider Woman (William Hurt can't understand why everyone is so bad). Nuri Bilge Ceylan takes his place among the dozen major directors now active. I only hope that in the future he will come to rely on collaborators instead of directing, writing and filming his films alone.
