Many consider BEAST STABLE the last of the "real" films FEMALE PRISONER, as it is the last of the series directed by Shunya Ito, and is followed by another film (GRUDGE SONG) by a different director. I haven't seen GRUDGE SONG yet (but soon I will ...), so I don't know how it overlaps with previous FP movies - but it will be interesting to see. The way BEAST STABLE ended did not leave much room for another predecessor, but I guess I'll find out ... <br /> <br /> This rumor has Scorpion running from the cops, where she hooks up with a prostitute who she ends up pregnant with her late brother (oh yes - it's not a lie ... I have to love these light plots). Scorpion ends up being kidnapped by an old rival, but (since he is so good ...) he ends up fleeing and taking revenge on some people who wronged some of his prostitute friends ... <br /> <br /> I agree with some other reviewers, that this is a bit slower in the points and more "serious" than the previous two items. The story is a bit confusing and complicated at times, but many of these 70s are pink movies - and I still love them. BEAST STABLE is lacking in the nudity area, which was rather disappointing - but I thought it was strong in other areas - plot, cinematography, some good sabers, etc ... Definitely worth it for fans of this kind of thing , or who enjoyed the other films of PRISONER FEMININE ... 8/10
