I love this movie despite the fact that it simply lacks to be fantastic. It is entertainment for adults, full of problems that an adult can relate to. The acting is superb. It's fun to watch John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands as a fighting middle-aged couple. Who knows how much of it came from their own marriage? Susan Sarandon has never been sexier or more attractive than her free-wheeling character, Aretha. Raul Julia is a cry like a vigorous shepherd. The scenery in Greece is spectacular; New York locations cause me problems due to many World Trade Center hits. Stomu Yamashta's fantastic score. With so many things to do, why isn't it a great movie? He is a bit inconclusive and too long, blurred and uncomfortable between humor and drama. Still, it's engaging, fun and deeply thoughtful.
