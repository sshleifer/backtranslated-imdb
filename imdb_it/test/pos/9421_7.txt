Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce respectively as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, the second of the Universal series, where it is again established by a written prologue that the famous detective is legendary and embraces time. This helps to conveniently arrange things here in the "present" era of the early 1940s. <br /> <br /> In this offer, Holmes goes through some different disguises (with the very important characteristics of Rathbone, is it likely that people would not really recognize his true identity?) while protecting a physicist from the hands of the Nazis so as from the greatest enemy of Holmes, Professor Moriarty (now interpreted by Lionel Atwill). The scientist has developed a bomb that will be of great help in the aerial bombardment, and has promised his plans to the English. But Moriarty wants to take it so he can sell them to the Nazis. <br /> <br /> A good entry was reinforced a little by the participation of the evil Atwill, now played as Moriarty (although George Zucco was certainly not himself in THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES). It is always fascinating to watch Holmes and his greatest enemy engage in jokes together ("the needle to the last, eh, Holmes?").
