Not only do I think this was the best film of 1987, it's probably on my amorphous list as one of the 10-20 best films I've ever seen. For whatever reason, I really connected to this film, and it's one of the most personal movies I've seen at that time in my life (I was 26). For better or for worse, I have strongly identified with the character of Holly Hunter (and I am a boy!). She plays an extremely bright, loyal and intense woman who can't understand romantic relationships. There were so many things he said in this film that they were things I would have said or told others in similar circumstances. And the ending of the film I find it very, very sad. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this role was a great opportunity for Holly Hunter. Clearly, I wasn't the only one who thought it so well.
