Ray is one of those movies that makes you stop. You really think about what you heard or think about what you read about this man and doesn't even come close. During my first vision of Ray I forgot that I was watching a movie, I felt like a voyeur watching this man's life through a window. This film is so addictive that it drags you inside and involves all your emotions through an exciting roller coaster ride and when it's over you don't want to do it again so soon because it has that kind of emotional punch that the other movies miss Jamie Foxx deserved his Oscar and rightly so his performance is spectacular and should be considered the standard for anyone who wants to take a bio-photo at any time. This film is as good as it is subject to both classic titles and legend.
