I saw this movie about 12 years ago and I can still remember it as if I'd seen it recently. This is what struck me in this film. <br /> <br /> Considering that this is a movie from the 1950s, I think it was ahead of its time. It surprised me how to maintain its integrity in this topic, some may have considered taboo at that time. Very realistic in showing the tumultuous and poignant journey that an addict chooses to undertake. One can only imagine how the public was influenced by the realism of this film in those days. <br /> <br /> Personally I think it was one of the five best performances of Frank Sinatra on the big screen. <br /> <When others discuss films that deal with mental illness and / or addiction, I always recommend the Man with the Golden Arm as one of the first five to watch.
