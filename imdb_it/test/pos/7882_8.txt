Dennis Patrick plays a man who accidentally kills his daughter's boyfriend and reveals his secret to a local bar. Joe (Peter Boyle), a bigot who is getting drunk there, first takes it as a joke, but then the news is confirmed on the evening news. Instead of calling the cops or something, Joe decides that since the guy killed a hippie, they must be kindred spirits! He blackmails the man by becoming his friend. At first, the film seemed harsh and critical, but, as it turned out, it actually became a fairly complex portrait of today's society. Yes, I think you're exaggerating a little, but in fun ways that don't detract from the power of his messages. Susan Sarandon debuted in this film, and it's a shock to see how cute she was around 11pm. It's worth seeing.
