Before seeing today's preview of Angels and Demons, I got rid of the mind of any uncertainty that could keep me from enjoying it; the huge amount of hatred towards Dan Brown, the fact that it was written by Dan Brown, and why Dan Brown's name is slapped on all posters. I came in with an open mind and was expecting the worst, but instead what I got was a 2 and a half hour game of cats and mice with Forrest Gump, and this is certainly a good entertainment value. <br /> <br /> The film loosely hangs on the actual novel. The Harvard symbolologist, Robert Langdon (Hanks), leaves for Rome after the Pope's sudden death and re-election through the Papal Conclave. To organize all this is the Carmelengo, Patrick McKenna (McGregor). However, he soon learns of a new threat, one that involves a secret brotherhood that makes its presence known, an antimatter time bomb to which the Vatican City is now targeted and the abduction of four cardinals. Langdon, using his intellects (and believe me, you will hear a lot from this), they are given the task of finding and saving them using the mysterious Path of enlightenment. Leading the research is the CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra (Zurer), who is also the co-creator of the anti-matter. <br /> <br /> The film itself flows at an irregular pace. One minute Langdon and the Swiss Guard are accelerating to save a brand cardinal, the next minute he bores you with useless information on every random object that passes, evidently slowing down the long-awaited action / thriller sequences in the book. It's an interesting read on paper, but on the screen it can go either way. <br /> <br /> The characters are decently written on the big screen. Ewan McGregor performs as convincingly as the quiet but experienced Patrick McKenna, a famous accent included. Tom Hanks is slightly more agile, intellectually and physically, since his last performance in the mediocre Da Vinci Code. Stellen Skarsgard plays Commander Richter, the head of the Swiss Guard. Unfortunately, neither his performance nor that of Ayelet Zurer is worth it, and instead of playing a part in the story, they are simply set aside as resources. <br /> <br /> However, Angels & Demons realizes what DVC could never do; an exciting frenetic film full of satisfying explosions, wonderful recreations of St. Peter's Square and the Basilica (including many of the churches) and a pulsating bomb counting at midnight. Ron Howard does a decent job in directing this second Langdon adventure, this time taking a lot of criticism and almost completely exchanging the boring dialogue for thesis pursuits (almost). <br /> <br /> While newcomers might call it a "National Treasure 3" with a much bigger threat, there is still enough contagious suspense / eye-candy thriller and brilliant images of Rome to breathe. Fans of the book may seem different to the drastic changes in the film, but considering the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy that it generates, A & D does very well to keep the viewer on the screen this time rather than on the sleepy shoulder. <br /> <br /> A good adaptation from book to film that will please and amuse. <br /> <br /> 7.4 / 10
