This is an excellent film. There were different parts of the film that I liked. This movie is very funny! Visit the Ernest fun club website www.ernestfunclub.com There are several films such as: Ernest Goes to Camp, Ernest saves Christmas, Ernest Goes to Jail, Ernest in the army, Ernest Goes to School, Ernest Rides Again Slam Dunk Ernest etc. I highly recommend these family films. All the Jim Varney stars still try to visit www.ernestfunclub.com What is Ernest's best film? In my opinion there are actually 2 Ernest Goes to Camp and Ernest Goes to Jail. So if you've never seen Ernest P. Worrell time to go see it. Will you find it satisfactory enough "no, what do I mean"?
