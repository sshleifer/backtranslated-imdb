Okay, I guarantee you that part of the science in "Doppelganger" (or "Journey to the Far Side of the Sun") is a bit stupid. The idea of ​​an entire planet is not detected (because we cannot see on the other side of our sun) it doesn't hold up at all - any Astronomy 101 student knows that another planet the size of the Earth would cause gravitational perturbations in the movements of other planets. That's how astronomers deduced the existence of Pluto, after all, and that's how they regularly find comets, asteroids and moons. <br /> <br /> And the idea that the mirror image of Earth has in some way evolved in almost perfect parallel to our Earth, up to the English-speaking scientists and the human counterparts of every human being born on our Earth ... that takes things from the fiction of the "hard science" and in the territory of "Twilight Zone". It is not necessarily a bad thing, but requires an important suspension of critical thinking to be accepted and enjoyed. <br /> <br /> But man, this movie made me lose my teenage socks. I was still used to fairly cheerful and optimistic science fiction films when the hero eventually won, even if the "2001" could be interpreted as an "optimistic" ending. <br /> <br /> But in this case: Thinnes tried to dock with his mother ship in orbit so that he could return to his Earth, only to be bounced out of his dock (Something about the fact that polarity is not reversed because his "doppelganger" was not doing the same thing, apparently Thinnes' "doppelganger" had decided to be happy in his new home. , and I was certain that somehow he brings the damaged boat to the ground safely and tries again, armed with the new information that would allow him and his supporters to succeed. He was the hero after all, and in the end the hero always wins. <br /> <br /> Instead, Thinnes failed to maintain control of the paralyzed ship, and the ship's subsequent crash at the launch site was so horrific and devastating that it killed everyone (except for the head of the main project) and destroy all recordings of the project and of the existence of Thinnes. Thin never went home, and died unnecessarily, his secrets never revealed. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the Planet Of the Apes series, I had never seen such a sad and pessimistic ending, and it always stuck in my mind - especially the fierce devastation of the crash scene near the beginning of the move (you knew the spaceship would NEVER fly again!) and the one at the end. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see this movie again and see how it has held up over the years.
