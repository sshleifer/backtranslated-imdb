"Robin Hood: Men in Tights" has not received any respect. It was fun! Cary Elwes was excellent as "Prince of Thieves", and David Chappelle, Amy Yasbeck, Patrick Stewart, Richard Lewis and Mark Blankfield as Blinkin all did a good job. I will never understand the hostility towards "Robin Hood: Men in Tights", but I know a great comedy when I see one. <br /> <br /> "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" receives *** from ****.
