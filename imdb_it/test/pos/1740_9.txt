First of all, I never joined Dr. Who until recently. Honestly, I have never had the opportunity to look at any of the previous incarnations (the pun) since it has never been "big" here in the United States like anywhere else. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I must say (obviously) that after finishing the second season, this is one of the best sci-fi shows I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Now I watch a lot of science fiction shows from all over the world the show stands out. <br /> <br /> The first season was in first place, with Christopher Eccleston in the title role and I thought it was fantastic. Obviously, so too was Billie Piper to add so much humanity and warmth to the character of Rose that no one could have done better. Let's not forget Camile Coduri as Jackie and Noel Clarke as Mickey / Ricky who are just a show to watch. Then there's David Tenannt. At first, I thought he was too clumsy to play the character (his ears !!), but after seeing the second season, it fits perfectly. His acute acting and his physical comedy are almost impeccable. It's great with snappy dialogues and can get serious without blinking. <br /> <br /> In addition to the great acting of the cast is the acting of most of the guest actors who have appeared. Many of them are veteran actors, but some are new to me and damn beautiful. <br /> <br /> Production and show management are top notch. Occasionally, there will be some effects on the game here and there, but this has always been a factor in the original series and, like those episodes, is negligible. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing about the series: The stories. Writing people is always the key to great entertainment. Russell T. Davies has written many of the episodes with some other writers and they have done a great job. They managed to bring excitement, ingenuity, intelligence and fun with intelligent concepts and a great dialogue. I also appreciate the fact that they can break the past lines of the old Doctors and the enemies well (my friend explains a lot about this to me while I watch the show) and with respect. <br /> <br /> I won't mention anything about season 2 and how it's been since the Sci-Fi channel just started broadcasting the second season. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't want to ruin it. It's so fun and exciting. You will never want to look away or lose a word of dialogue. <br /> <br /> It's really so beautiful. <br /> <br /> PS: Thanks to the Nicholas Briggs producers! **EXTERMINATE!**
