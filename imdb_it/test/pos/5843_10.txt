Oz was a fantastic show, as long as the frequent male nudity does not discourage you. There was ROAD too much male frontal nudity in this show, more than any other show you would see on a porn channel. Less than, it was the best show on TV, and a previous comment said "better than Prime Suspect". Prime Suspect is Tom and Jerry vs The Simpsons. No context. If you have Direcv, they're now running it again from the beginning on Channel 101, I'm now in episode # 3. Highly recommended. The creator Tom Fontana also did Homicide, which was an AWESOME show. But why all male nudity? We all know that things happen in prison, but do they really need to show them so often? This was the only thing that took me away from the show. If I want to see naked men, the boys are raped, I will kill someone myself and I will attend firsthand. Otherwise I like my TV shows without black penises every five minutes.
