I remember watching this movie over and over again as a child. I loved it. Although I haven't looked at it recently, I'm sure I'd like it again today. It's a very light and fun movie guaranteed to make anyone laugh. The situations with each of the characters were so funny and imaginative! I particularly liked the one with the girl who travels with her mother's ashes (who ends up taking them on the highway after the explosion), the thieves and the nuns. These days, this nice and humorous style has been missed. Furthermore, this film showed that the actor Paul Keenan (Dynasty / Days of our Lives) started off in a big way. I recommend it to anyone lucky enough to find it in their local video store.
