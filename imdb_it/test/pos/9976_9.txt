When you think about golf movies, think of Caddyshack, but what happens if there are children around? Go to this movie! The Disney uses are the proven formula for making a film that will appeal to adults and children. The acting in this film, in my opinion, is quite good and the main cast, for the most part, is very young! This film is also filmed in an extraordinary and unique way, seeing all the corners of the game of golf. I think this film should be rewarded with some academic awards for film editing or something like that because the whole flow of the film is top notch. Even if the ending could be a little predictable, the film does well on its own! It also shows that it is not necessary to swear, nudity or violence to make a great film about golf!
