Jay Craven's criminally ignored film is a slight breath of fresh air in the generally narcissistic and derivative world of independent film. First of all, photography is pure aesthetic pleasure, capturing all the gloomy beauty of northern New England in late autumn (filmmaker Paul Ryan made the 2nd drive at Malick's Days of Heaven). Secondly, the representations are uniformly excellent - No Torn Lourdes from Rip Torn is irascibly charming and the Bangor del Tantoo Cardinal is both sensitive and exuberant, not to mention a supporting cast. Overall, however, it is a tribute to the narrative force of the film that the story maintains a strong and lively rhythm while it is still unfolding at the time, and the film reaches a conclusion, natural and genuine, which however does not seem to be foreseen. This is one of the rare cells of dignity in the world of independent cinema, a film that explores a small fragment of the intersection between man and history.
