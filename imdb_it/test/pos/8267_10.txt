When the Precious Bane aired in America, I was stunned by this beautiful story. All the actors were brilliant; Clive Owen really understood the character he played. I immediately went to a bookstore and ordered the original novel, which is even more beautiful, and went out of print immediately after buying the book - even though I saw it online a few times. I had also hoped for the Oscar won by Janet McTeer and the enormous popularity of Clive Owen, the BBC would naturally have gotten this beautiful DVD production ... I can't believe that all these years later we still don't have a DVD. It must be the only production ever created by the BBC that is NOT for sale. Come to the BBC - you have money to take out the fans here. Take this on DVD please!
