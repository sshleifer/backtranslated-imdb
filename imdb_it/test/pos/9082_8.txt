Although Flatliner is 15, tonight was my first time to see it. I had heard of the movie Flatliner, but I've never heard of this to get me out, rent it or make a point to see it point. Well, I got it on one of the premium channels and I have to say that it was very nice. <br /> <br /> This film was about some brilliant young medical students who decided to explore death. They came up with a way to briefly kill a person and bring her back to life. In addition to the cast of all the stars, this film had a serious bite. The very thought of exploring death is quite compelling, but I really thought that the writer and director did an excellent job of giving a different but at the same time irritating view. It was not a general attempt to excite, frighten and make the mind run ... this was the real deal. <br /> <br /> Instead of making it an empty, superficial and starry thriller, this film had substance. A brass knuckles, white knuckle, a rough-nosed thriller. I give him an 8/10.
