A fantastic and very neglected film. Gary has never been nicer, and Ingrid is more beautiful than any other movie. If you don't believe, watch the movie. Every cast member is wonderful; the love scenes between Gary and Ingrid will make your pulse beat! The story is great, the script is of the caliber of the Oscars. Don't miss this movie !!
