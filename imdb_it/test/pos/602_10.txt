Jim Henson as Kermit, Dr.Teeth, Rowlf and Waldorf. <br /> <br /> Frank Oz as Fozzie, Piggy and Animal. <br /> <br /> Jerry Nelson as Floyd Pepper, Robin the Frog, Lew Zealand and Crazy Harry. <br /> <br /> Richard Hunt as Janice, Statler, Beaker and Scooter. <br /> <br /> Dave Goelz as Gonzo, Dr. Hunnydew and Zoot. <br /> <br /> Charles Durning and Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> cameos by Steve Martin, Carol Kane, Orson Welles, Bob Hope, Richard Pryor and others. <br /> <br /> This is the first Muppet movie of the billion others that have come out, and it's also the best, by far! This is Kermit, the frog, who goes on a trip to Hollywood and meets other characters along the way. This film, besides being already good, has excellent songs performed by the Muppets, including Rainbow Connection, Can You Picture That?, Moving Right Along and others. This film, unlike Muppet's other films, has a strong sentimental value for me. It is such a beautiful film. It has also been noted that there are many cameos with Steve Martin, Mel Brooks and a dozen others. <br /> <br /> my vote-A plus. 109 minutes rated G.
