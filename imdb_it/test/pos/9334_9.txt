For those who remember the initial impact of this video, it will never be forgotten and a Thriller vision is all that is needed to feel twelve again. But, even if it's a great video, it's not perfect, even if it seemed so at the time. When this video came out, nobody had ever seen anything like it before. Now the medium of the music video has grown by leaps and bounds, and a new vision of Thriller will reveal its flaws. Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song? When Michael Jackson walks next to the girl after leaving the cinema, he sings all the verses of the song, skipping the choirs. After he became a zombie, when the time comes for him to sing again, his zombie trick inexplicably disappears, and he sings the choir again, and again, and again, as if to compensate for his previous absence. This may have been the first time a song has been deconstructed to fit the graphics in a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time. It continued to be a problem in the MTV era. The best videos, like Jackson Billie Jean and Beat It, used images to serve music, not the other way around. Still, Thriller is a lot of fun and not to be missed for Halloween.
