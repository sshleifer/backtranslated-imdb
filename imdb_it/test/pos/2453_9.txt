This is a little anti-war movie since it has been ignored for too long. The time is Thanksgiving in 1972. The place is a typical suburban home somewhere in Texas. The eldest son has just returned from Vietnam and is spending time adjusting to the life he left behind. And the family doesn't know how to handle the problem. I honestly don't think I exaggerate when I say this is one of the most heartbreaking war movies I've ever seen. The funny thing is that there are only a handful of combat sequences in the whole movie. Most of the story takes place inside a home for a period of a couple of days. But the kind of war that takes place in this house is as intense as any real action on the battlefield. The film does something that is difficult to accomplish; somehow, Estevez and his team have created a film that embodies the whole Vietnam experience. And given the similarities between Vietnam and the current invasion of Iraq, the film is surprisingly relevant. Estevez does a magnificent job with the material. It gets a lot of help from a hand-selected cast. Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates in particular are as proud as their parents. A truly moving film. Highly recommended
