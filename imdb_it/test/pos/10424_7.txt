This was a nice soft-core film for men and women. A lot of nudity / sex, but without the general resentment you usually find. They couldn't have done a better job in casting, as the whole ensemble was staggering. Trust guys, if you want your woman to be in the right mood, take something with Bobby Johnston! And I'm sure the beautiful Monique Parent, Samantha McConnell and the rest of the women would do it for any heterosexual male. Unfortunately, Bobby and Monique don't share a scene together and if you know of a movie where they do it, please PM me! I'd like to know it. Photography was much better than usual. That was the story. Predictable, but pleasant, sweet and romantic. At least it wasn't one of those annoying predictable and mysterious murders full of blonde women in bottles with huge fake breasts. I give this 7/10!
