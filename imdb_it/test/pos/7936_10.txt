I have loved this film since I first saw it many years ago. I'm not sure how many times I've seen it, maybe 10, maybe 20. The last time I saw it I was struck by a detail I hadn't noticed before. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the photo, the killed heroes are brought back to the city by sled. There are a couple of close-ups of the dead. What struck me most was a shot of blonde youth. All you see on the screen is his profile from head to hands. His hands are holding a flickering candle. The wind blows and its thick blond hair dances in the wind, in tune with the glimmer of the candle flame. The contrast between death and the life he has lost is incredibly powerful. The movement of the hair and the flame of the candle remind us of the vital force that once inhabited his body. <br /> <br /> Every time I revisit this movie I see something new.
