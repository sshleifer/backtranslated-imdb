The Stooges are back and more fun than ever. "Brideless Groom" is probably the best Shemp film in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Shemp has the opportunity to inherit $ 500,000 (which was probably over a million dollars compared to today) from his uncle dead. BUT! There is a problem. He has to marry someone that day by 6. Hemp is a scapula with not too many admirers, except for a sharp and annoying singing student. But he doesn't want her, he wants someone a little more on the kind of Victoria's Secret model. But obviously he has no choice since he is not the same as Collin Ferrel. But when it is printed in the newspapers that he must inherit all that money if married, his ex-girlfriends are on the "I want my man back" attack! <br /> <br /> What a nice twist! This is up there with the winners of all the fantastic movies! <br /> <br /> 9/10
