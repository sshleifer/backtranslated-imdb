Dead Gentlemen Productions has made a film with incredible production values ​​considering the budget. Anyone who has ever played any role-playing game, especially any fantasy role-playing game (they will play Dungeons and Dragons in the film), AMERA this film. Brilliant performances all around - especially with regards to the dual nature of the principles, playing their players and their characters. Anyone who has ever filmed or acted in a student film will appreciate the amount of work and love they put into this project. This film (and its prequel) is for fantasy films and role-playing games what Blazing Saddles is for westerns - a parody of the highest order. I only have a couple of complaints about the movie itself, none of which will prevent me from buying the DVD as soon as it is available (only 6 more weeks - I'm counting the days): <br /> <br /> 1. When Lodge talks to Joanna joins the gaming group, gives her a copy of the Dungeons and Dragons Player Manual and says "this will tell you everything you need to know". The camera hovers too long on a click of the book and the moment really looks like an advertisement. <br /> <br /> 2. The jokes are hilarious, but seem to be unevenly distributed throughout the film. The last third of the film, after the almost continuous gust of visual and verbal humor, slows down a bit, as if the narrative were catching up with the lines. Strange, but Blazing Saddles has always struck me this way too. . . and I love that movie too. <br /> <br /> One of the narrative strengths of the story is the unresolved nature of the romantic subplot. Will Joanna become GM's girlfriend? Will you go back to Cass? Or will the three keep a platonic friendship, deepened by the camaraderie of role-playing? (Yes it sounds noisy, but there are a couple of corny moments, particularly when Cass and Lodge "put on make up" at the end.) But the film lasts a week: in terms of human relations, those questions can't be answered in a week . The fact that the character relationships are undefined seems to me to be better than the more classic choices you see in most movies, like the girl who gets her prince and move into the castle, or the prince sinks into the North Atlantic after three trivial hours boring and predictable. Writers really do seem to have an understanding of the psychology of the characters, and you can see the characters (both the players and the player's characters) change throughout the film, but not suddenly, and not incredibly. <br /> <br /> I would like to hear more wisdom from Brother Silence. "The man who stands out in the darkness is ... fluorescent."
