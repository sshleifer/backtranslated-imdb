Ernst Lubitsch gave us wonderful films like Design for Living, Ninotchka, The Shop Around the Corner, Being or not to be, and other wonderful films. But people usually put Bluebeard's eighth wife as one of Lubitsch's weakest films. <br /> <br /> But I consider this film an important film. This film started the collaboration of Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder. Charles Brackett, Billy Wilder and Walter Reisch wrote the script for Ninotchka by Ernst Lubitsch. Of course, Lubitsch worked with writers in the scripting process. Later, Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder worked together. Together they wrote the script for famous films like The Lost Weekend and Sunset Blvd. <br /> <br /> There are many fun moments in the film. I thought "The Taming of the Shrew" was a lot of fun. There is a famous expression called "Movies are slices of life". And here is a great example of Bluebeard's eighth wife (1938). <br /> <br /> In the first session of the scripting process, Lubitsch asked this question: how does boy and girl get together? Billy Wilder promptly suggested that the opening scene should be a men's store in a department store. "The boy is trying to buy pajamas," he improvised casually. "But he only sleeps on the peaks, he is thrifty, so he insists on buying only the peaks." The clerk says that he too must buy pants, it looks like a catastrophe, then the girl enters the store and buys the pants because she only sleeps in his pants. "Ernst Lubitsch and Charles Brackett were enchanted. Only a few months later they discovered that Billy Wilder himself was a top-top sleeper and had been nurturing the idea for months before he could use it. <br /> <br /> I received these information from a book. I think this film can be considered the return of Ernst Lubitsch. Right after this film, he made such wonderful films as Ninotchka, The Shop Around the Corner and To be or not be. <br /> <br /> I thought Gary Cooper's performance was good, I think Lubitsch probably chose Gary Cooper because Gary Cooper played Long Fellow Deeds who inherited Frank Capra's fortune in Mr. Deeds in town, but that's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> For my part, I really enjoyed the film, I consider this film 9 out of 10. Lubitsch's films are different, because his films are fragments of life.
