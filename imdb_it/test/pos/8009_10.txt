I like full house and step by step the same. I don't have a favorite episode I like certain scenes. but some scenes I don't like, but I have the courage to say that the reason I started watching this show is because there was Suzanne Summers. and my favorite character was Dana. and Karen could be snobby at times, but she too was a good character. I only like to watch family shows instead of litter that have a lot of drugs and violence. this show is very similar to other family shows in which one of the parents is always strict about curfews and dates. Apart from the step by step, my other favorite shows are the full house, Sabrina the teenage witch, Gomer Pyle Usmc, the show andy griffith and dukes of hazzard.
