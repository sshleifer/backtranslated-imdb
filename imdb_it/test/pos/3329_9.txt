The assignment of Tex Avery as director of cartoons for MGM was one of the most brilliant moments in the history of comics in the 40s and 50s. His cartoons were exceptionally imaginative and surreal with MANY strange touches that were later celebrated in the movie THE MASK. The eyes that pop up when a boy sees a girl, impossible acrobatics and non-stop actions are the marks of these films. <br /> <br /> This is one of several Droopy cartoons that Avery was responsible for and is among his best. Droopy is a Mountie and is determined to take his man, ... although in this case he is a wolf who has escaped from prison. Throughout the film, despite many stunts, Droopy keeps up with this scammer until the wolf gives up because Droopy is apparently everywhere! Filled with fun and laughter gags, this is a great cartoon.
