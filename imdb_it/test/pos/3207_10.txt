I'm not the kind of person to watch T.V. because acting usually sucks or is unrealistic or dramatic TOO! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act and you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any negative situation a little strange. Rory Gilmore is a good model for all girls. She is proud of wanting to attend Harvard and boys / boyfriends are always second in her book. She is a faithful friend and always a pacifist. There is a subtle love story that is what I like personally. It is not the soft and soft romanticism that not many people can have in their life, but a realistic type of romanticism. Each character eventually gets it, and they do not find their charming prince at first sight and do not "fall in love" with every boy who comes to meet them. It's a realistic show but when you look at it, it's better to dust off movies, pop culture and random facts because Lorelai Gilmore always makes references. I fell in love with this show and if you give it a chance, you will too.
