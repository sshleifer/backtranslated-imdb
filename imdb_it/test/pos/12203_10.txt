A new and innovative show with an exceptional cast that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Lake Bell is wonderful. It is negative that his other show "Miss Match" has been canceled. I'm glad it's back on "Surface". I can't wait for the return of "Surface". This show is really something unique to look at. With an eerie underwater world similar to Jurassic Park, this show makes you think about what will be next. Nim is adorable though it will turn into something bigger and much more disturbing. There are so many generic shows out there that seem to take back the same old arguments. When something like "Surface" comes along, you just have to say "THANK YOU!"
