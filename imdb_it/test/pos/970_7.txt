NOTICE SPOILER <br /> <br /> We have all heard the legend of the "Boy who cried wolf". But if the wolf was a person in the modern world. Well, it could be something like Big Fat Liar. 14-year-old Jason Sheperd (Frankie Muniz of "Malcolm in the Middle") was always lying to keep out of trouble. One day he is forced to write an essay in English, but ends up in the hands of the terrible director Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti) who intends to turn Jason's story into a Hollywood hit. Nobody believes Jason when, for once, he tells the truth and ends up in summer school. However Jason is determined to prove the truth to his parents and travels to L.A. with her friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes). When Wolf refuses to admit that he tore up his story, Jason plans to make Wolf's life a living hell. B.F.L. it's not a masterpiece but it's a nice way to spend 90 minutes of time. I wish he could have done a little longer though and there are not so many jokes even though they are smart enough (I like the dye in the pool the best). Maybe I wouldn't have liked it as much as I had if it wasn't for Paul Giamatti. It's simply hilarious in this. If you have 90 minutes to kill, try this. You could just have fun.
