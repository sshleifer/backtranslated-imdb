Ahhhh, 1984 ... I was young and stupid and I was just developing a taste for those exotic cigarettes while living in a squat at Manchester's Moss Side, with the most incredible case of cockroach infestation. <br /> <br /> After some of those doobies, this show was ROTFLMAO material - I was an avid fan. Then I would look at the floor (or above the walls, or almost everywhere) and see my personal collection of "little armadillos" going around. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it was the chemical improvement, but I remember thinking that the exaggerated surrealism of the show was fantastic - it was my second favorite thing on TV at the time (No. 1 was the season of Luis Bunuel's films shown by Channel 4). Radical art lives! <br /> <br /> You too owe that musical theme! .... I swear, I will never drink again ...
