My father, the hero is sweet, funny and cute. Gerard Depardiu is as exceptional as Andr√©, a divorced father who brings fourteen-year-old daughter Nicole (Kathrine Heigl) to the Caribbean for the holidays. While there, his daughter meets a boy named Ben (Dalton James. Andre is his lover and his father is in prison for armed robbery and his mother is a prostitute and she escaped with her pimp. island you immediately see that Andre is a child molester, one with Isabelle (Emma Thompson, who makes a cameo at the end of the film) and Diana (Faith Prince of Spin City). My father the hero has many funny moments, like when he is at a talent show and everyone tells him to play something French, so he interprets "Thank God for the girls" by Gigi. Everyone feels disgusted and they go away. My father the hero does not deserve the 5.1. a 9.0.
