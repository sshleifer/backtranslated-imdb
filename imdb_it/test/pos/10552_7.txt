This is another case of Hollywood Arrogance which presumes to eclipse the French style. The original, Mon Pere ce heros, was one of the most fascinating films of 1991, so naturally Hollywood accountants thought they could hire Depardieu and call the rest. However, they took the precaution of hiring Francis Veber to write an English version even if you use virtually every word of the original. Depardieu brings its Gallic charm and Katherine Heigl shows all the promise that is bearing fruit. The fact is that when the French make a sort of Lolita-lite, they get along because the thought of the "dirty French postcard" works in their favor; here the Hollywood idea of ​​light subtlety is to have Depardieu (totally unaware that his daughter has made it known that he is actually her lover), prevailed in playing and singing "something French", launching into a lively version of Thank Heaven For Little Girls. See the original.
