If you don't like Italian horror, you won't like this movie. In that note ... <br /> <br /> "Overall ... it was a terrible experience ... A lot has happened. Vanessa Redgrave was scheduled for the film, and she pulled out. She was crushed from a car, I was engaged to get married, but by the end of the photo it was over, my father died during filming ... of any kind. "-Dario Argento on the making of" Opera "<br /> <br / > I was really impressed by Argento and the film he made here, especially in those circumstances that were so heartbreaking. The entire mystique of "Macbeth" and its curse on those who attempt to stage the comedy add incalculable volumes to "Opera". <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Argento uses some of his most intelligent (and direct from the public) tricks. A young opera singer, Christina, is chased by a violent psychopath who forces her to watch a series of brutal murders. By recording several sharp blades on Christina's eyelids, the killer makes it impossible for him to close his eyes: "Look, if you try to close your eyes you will split them, so you will only have to watch everything!" <br /> <br /> It is clear that Argento has taken great care in the construction of the fake "Macbeth" on the screen, and his hard work pays off. Add to this numerous brutally unforgettable murders, an incredibly tense sequence of chases, and the brilliant use of POV to portray a certain character (the role that Vanessa Redgrave brought up, thank god) and you have one of the best Italian horror films of always created. <br /> <br /> That said, it's still an Italian horror. Because Christina never seems to tell anyone about these brutal murders it goes beyond anyone's understanding. Some scenes may be difficult for some viewers to endure, but personally I felt more tension towards Christina and her eyes than any brutal killing in the movie. The finale of "Tenebrae" made my stomach turn more than anything else in "Opera", but it's probably just me. <br /> <br /> And in the last five minutes ... Silver wanted it, turned it over and he struggled to keep it in the movie. Absolutely no one likes it, including myself, but it's not enough to ruin the rest of the film for me. It remains one of the best Silver films to date. <br /> <br /> 9/10
