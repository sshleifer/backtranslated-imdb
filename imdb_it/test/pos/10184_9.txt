I saw the second part of this beautiful vintage piece set on a ship in the 19th century. Golding's book must be responsible for some of the magnificent dialogues, but everything else was beautiful too! I particularly liked the way they created the period and the feeling of being on the ship so well. For me this gave me a feeling of completeness that I know I won't be able to put into words ... Maybe it was the way they mixed technical and historical details about sailing in the nineteenth century with history without messing it up. Benedict Cumberbatch was excellent, as were the rest of the cast. It doesn't often happen that a mini series sends me to the "zone", but this has been done.
