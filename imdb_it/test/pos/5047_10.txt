There is not much else to say that it is simply a masterpiece. this film contains a myriad of messages that everyone should take to heart. Above all, women do not stifle your man's dreams by honoring them, that's why you loved him in the first place! Those who plan death will live in the grave. Those who carpe diem will awaken those who live in fear. Our Lord also spoke of this when he chastised the one who buried his talent for fear of making a mistake and displeasing the Master. Take a risk, get out of the boat and walk on the water. Life is a journey that does not end in the grave but in our mind and in our souls.
