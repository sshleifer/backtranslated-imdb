No wonder this was a depressing and depressing film. After all, this is the impact of war on civilians and the "king of depression", Ingmar Bergman. In other words, so many of Bergman's works dig into human misery and anguish and so this film doesn't seem so extraordinary to come from this director. <br /> <br /> Although it is more difficult to look at, the last half of the film offers perhaps more information on the lower depths of humanity. This is because initially the main characters (Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow) try to overcome adversity and are basically decent people (even if a little stupid). However, since deprivation after deprivation occurs, they (especially Von Sydow) become less and less human and more animalistic - they do SOMETHING to survive. <br /> <br /> Fun to watch, NO FREAKING WAY! But, an interesting insight into human nature. <br /> <br /> PS: 1 what I liked about this movie is that it avoided a stupid movie script. When the couple sat down with the shopkeeper to drink a glass or a wine, they finished the wine completely! In most movies, they barely touch their drinks or leave them intact. It drives me crazy, since I NEVER leave a $ 4 alcoholic beverage without drinking it unless it tastes terrible or there is a floating insect! GOOD BOY!
