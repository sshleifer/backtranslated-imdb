Although perhaps the most stupid, insipid and violent slapstick comedy ever made, Guest House is also a lot of fun. Don't listen to critics, they have no sense of humor. While the climax is exhausted (but it doesn't vomit), it is still a fun film for the holidays. Seven candles in the eye out of ten.
