The Pickle was the most underrated film of the decade. Despite my best efforts at home, it's still seen as a bad movie. I tell all hell about this. Everyone does not understand that it is partly a comedy with a dramatic twist at the end. Danny Aiello plays a director burned with perfection and transmits a sad and depressed man. the scene in which he is trying to record a last message is quite good. The interludes from the Stones movie are absolutely funny. "This is Harry Stone and today I become a man!" In all a fine and sadly misunderstood film. Plus a great cameo by Little Richard. Funny! I hope more people see this film because 202 people are not enough for a consensus. <br /> <br /> -Silence Dogood
