This is an incredible film that starts slowly. It carries you forward in thinking of it as a typical family maudlin drama. Then, in the second part, there is a twist that completely transforms this into a deep story of global significance. <br /> <br /> If you're not used to films from India, with seemingly grafted songs and choreographies, continue with this film. Especially starting from the second part, you will find this film an extraordinary experience. <br /> <br /> *********** Minor spoiler here ************ * I have only one complaint with the movie. Dialogue at the end (between Amudha and MDS) seemed very weak and lost the opportunity to bring war as a force that transforms people's lives. It had always been implicit, but there had to be something about the importance of the struggle for MDS.
