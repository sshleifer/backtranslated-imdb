I haven't read the book I don't care. the film was a beautiful love story, and I think women will have fun. no, it wasn't a "10" movie, but it was fun. women, if your man is bored like mine, then look at it yourself. the pain is as wonderful as the philosophical doctor who delivers a reflective monologue on "love" and "love". <br /> <br /> Also, if you like the cage, it was great and fun. I enjoyed watching the developing romance. <br /> <br /> moreover, if you like Christian bale, see it balanced. this is a science fiction movie "10". <br /> <br /> watch this movie. ignore the previous user's comments. <br /> <br /> one - especially women !! also visit my website in my name as a word and a "dot" com.
