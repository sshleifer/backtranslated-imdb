I have already given my comment on this film under the name of BruceV3. Now I want to add something to BruceV13! Now after a long time I have seen many so-called hero shedding titles! But not many people approach the action shown in John Woo's films! That's why after all these years I think it's strange that "China White" doesn't have the merit it deserves! No matter what version you saw! The action is top notch! The scenery, China Town of Amsterdam is truly unique. You have the impression that it is a great district. But having lived in Amsterdam alone, I know it's just a small part of the red light district that has many Chinese shops and restaurants! But because of the way they shot the film, it actually looks like a big and important territory where people know they don't play with the triads (Chinese mafia)! In addition to the "China White" action, it's a compelling gangster film with some good acting! That's why I have to give Russell Wong credit! Too bad we don't see much of him lately, since he has a lot of potential! Must see the movie!
