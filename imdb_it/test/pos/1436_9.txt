STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Once heroin addict Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) goes out of jail to his blameless prison partner Sparrow (Arnold Stang), needy cripple of a wife Zosch (Eleanor Parker) and bitten on the side of Molly (Kim Novak.) Is trying to grow up as a drummer in a band, but until his big break Arriva, is stuck doing the only other thing that was worth doing, besides being a drugged card in high stakes games. And as much as he tried, even the prison did not cure him of his addiction to the devil's drug, causing him to lie and deceive all those around him and guiding him to desperate measures to nurture his habit. His desire to go out is his only motivation for a happy ending. <br /> <br /> When people think of Frank Sinatra, they generally think of classic songs like Under My Skin, New York New York and It Had a Sii Tu. But not to forget that he was also a famous actor and, if his performance in the acclaimed From Here to Eternity was not enough, he will be remembered for this avant-garde drama, facing what at the time was the ultra taboo topic of drug abuse. <br /> <br /> The film is often listed as one of the first to present graphic heroin (probably the reason behind the certificate 15) at a time when it was a topic that was still very metropolitan push. In his portrait of the main protagonist, Sinatra is fine, perfectly conveying the desperation, desperation and sincerity of a man who loses every second chance he is given. His cold scene in Turkey is much more intense than that of Ewan McGregor in Trainspotting. The first co-star to make an impression is Parker in the role of his wife, the shrew and needy in need of Machine, who uses her husband's guilt and sense of duty for all the possible effect. Novak as his secret lover still manages some strong moments but is less than a Parker star. Stang does his usual comic relief thing, like the bumbling sidekick that accompanies the main man with his spooky New York accent. <br /> <br /> The director Otto Preminger allows the rhythm to drag a little bit at times, but this is still an intensely absorbing the film to the end, with many unexpected twists and that should be admired for being one of the first films to bring to life a subject so dark so powerful. ****
