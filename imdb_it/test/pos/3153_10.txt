I destroyed my brain for another film that reminds me of this. I can't really invent one. I think it's because most of the films that deal with this subject (war, peace, violence) are in a fixed documentary style. There are some terrifying ones out there, all better known than USA TM, I'm sure, but they are meant to be informative and bring your emotional response to the surface through intellectual means. This DVD may seem more intellectual in some ways, but in reality it is not. It is philosophical, perhaps, but it ignores the information mode and goes directly to the same place that makes a piece of music. It makes you feel, but sometimes you don't even know why. You are just somewhere on a wave of feelings. When you look at it, notice how it was put together. It may not be for everyone but it is for everyone who is looking for a rare cinematic creation that respects you.
