This is a powerful film that never seems to have arisen after Joe McCarthy's period of censorship. He influenced me as a Jewish teenager who had friends of various colors and that his father's family had suffered under fascist regimes in Europe during the second quarter of the 20th century. Unlike the next "On The Waterfront", which seemed to take some of the same themes and transform them to fit the Hollywood political correctness of the time, he told his story directly and with respect for the characters and for reality reflected on fiction. It was an antidote to "Gone with the Wind", "Birth of a Nation", "Triumph of the Will" and many other glorifiers of hatred and violence. I would put it next to the recent German film (even virtually hidden in the United States), "Rosenstrasse". <br /> <br /> I remember that the TV version, also in black and white as well as the plot, was obscured outside some stations because the wife of the black hero appeared white. As a young civil rights activist, it produced a conflict for me because on one hand I was against smoking cigarettes and on the other I was opposed to the boycott in Georgia of a television program sponsor, a major tobacco company (I can't remember which - someone else?). <br /> <br /> I'd like to find a CD of the movie or TV show to allow my children to see something that has informed my opposition to racism universally (as opposed to just fighting racism against Jews) and the recognition of the intrinsic connection between racism and militarism.
