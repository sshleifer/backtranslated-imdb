You know, before seeing this movie I had little sympathy for those involved in criminal cases. I mean if they were arrested and charged, "they must have been guilty," I reasoned? <br /> <br /> I have formed this opinion for a few years. You see a good friend of mine once worked as a detective in some of the most infamous areas of Sydney. He often complained that his police efforts were being wasted due to "bleeding" lawyers and magistrates. He would "slam the thieves in the morning and come back" on the road at noon ". He took his tribute ... they took him down. He stopped. <br /> <br /> He discussed from, not without reason I thought, that the collection of creative evidence, to keep the bad guys "to which they belong", was ... well ... "acceptable". <br /> <br /> My arguments about the rights of innocent people are not "How many are the chances that you could ever be arrested and charged with a serious crime ", he would have argued and, being a law-abiding citizen, the weight of his argument convinced me that he was right, about me, or someone from my family or my friends, accused of murder or a serious crime were from zero to no one I thought. <br /> <br /> Hmmmmm As mentioned before, seeing this wonderfully enlightening documentary changed everything. <br /> <br /> I'm sending him a copy.
