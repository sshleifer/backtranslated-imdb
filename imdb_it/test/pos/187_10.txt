I am speechless to describe the beauty of "The Cranes are Flying", but I will try to write anyway. It is a powerful and delicate love story that takes its place in the Second World War. It is the classic story of lovers (Boris and Veronika) separated from the war and what separates them. The images in the film are so beautiful that they will carry you away - the technique of the film is perfectly in unison with emotion. <br /> <br /> There are few scenes that directly describe the war: a bombardment: wind, lightning, explosions - which will have important consequences in the life of the main protagonist, Veronika, who is waiting for Boris to return; and there is another scene on the front, where we will be faced with an emotional / visual hurricane that shows the images reproduced in Boris's mind. Another scene functions as the leitmotiv of the film and provides its title: the cranes flying in the sky. This image represents the symbol of nature and its seasons and underlines the final message of the film: don't give up hope and fight for a better future. <br /> <br /> Kalatozov is a great director, this film is visually stunning and also touched me deeply. It is not just pure technique. <br /> <br /> Tatyana Samojlova is as perfect as Veronika. What else can I say? The film transcends the time it was made - the action takes place during the Second World War. But it could have happened anytime, anywhere. As long as there are wars (large or small) the film and its message will remain relevant.
