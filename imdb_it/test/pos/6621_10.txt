Being in the suburbs of New York when the Z-Boys were creating the story at Dogtown, I was only exposed to take a look at what was happening. I had a P-O-S Black Knight skateboard with clay wheels. It's been a long time, and in the ash pile of my personal life. But I never forgot. It's like watching long lost brothers and friends and it hits me right where I live. I can't watch this movie enough. Every time I look at it, another aspect rises upwards, some other point of view is brought into focus. The vintage footage, the incredible stills, the current personalities intertwined with the vivid shadows of the brilliantly illuminated past, the heartfelt and unfinished narrative, all magnificently assembled together so as to make a historical documentary of a true slice of American history. In the words of Glen Friedman - "It was incredible F-ing".
