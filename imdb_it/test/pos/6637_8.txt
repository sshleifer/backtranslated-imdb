Max von Sydow of Bergman and Liv Ullmann played the village couple, Jan and Eva Rosenberg. The story began with an ordinary couple fighting and making up. Jan was a sensitive person, but an escapade that isolated himself from the world. Eva is a practical woman who gets tired of her husband's lack of ambition. Since Jan procrastinating in fixing their radio, the two are unaware of the impending war. Of course the war came, and the film was a fascinating study of their transformation of each other and of each other through the invasion, as abused by the enemy and their own government. <br /> <br /> There was no musical score in the film, but the soundtrack was the sound of war. In one scene the pulsating gunshot of the background, the explosion and the sound of the aircraft fly was incredible. Occasionally, Bergman magnified the facial expression when different events occurred. When something violent happened, he zoomed out to allow the public to perceive violence rather than see it up close. Very well done film.
