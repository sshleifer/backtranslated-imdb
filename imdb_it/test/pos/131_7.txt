A rather interesting look at some of the characters of the flourishing Indian bourgeoisie. Although India is rapidly modernizing, its culture is not keeping pace. This film involves the patriarchal society, where women are not really free citizens yet. A land of arranged marriages, men who welcome lovers with total impunity, and women who should tolerate all this, will eventually end up missing. I was impressed by Nandita Das, who was very attractive, and played her character with total seriousness. But I was even more impressed by Shabana Azmi, who I understand is a historical Bollywood figure. His silent beauty and low-profile psychic suffering were excellent. The lesbian subtext of this film has never been particularly erotic and never titillating. (Damn!) It's worth taking a look at those interested in very different cultures.
