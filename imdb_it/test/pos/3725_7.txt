Luc Besson's first work is also his first foray into science fiction, a genre to which he will return fourteen years later with "The Fifth Element" (1997). Although this film has been heavily influenced by Hollywood cinema, it is still very enjoyable. In 1983, "Le Dernier Combat" reveals Besson's approach to science fiction. He takes up a worn-out topic and his efforts are discernible to do an elegant job. Shot in widescreen and in black and white, a disaster has destroyed virtually the entire population from the earth and we will never know what this disaster was and why men can no longer speak. Some hordes of barbarians were formed. In parallel, a man (Pierre Jolivet) lives alone and arrives in an unrecognizable Paris where he is received by a doctor (Jean Bouise). <br /> <br /> There are no words in Besson's work. The actions of the characters and the progression of the events pass through looks and gestures. Although the starting point and the background are unnerving, the film never looks like a discouraged one. It seems that the man and the doctor try to reproduce gestures and actions related to humanity before the disaster. The film opens with the man having sex with an inflatable doll. Later, the doctor tries to make him talk through a car and he is a painter in his spare time. It is even more intriguing as these paintings seem to come from prehistoric times. Following this reasoning, it could be argued that the bearded giant (Jean Reno) embodies evil and threatens the efforts made by man and doctor to regain what eventually made a human being. Ditto for the band of villains at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> The pessimistic feeling that such a film could convey is not really in the foreground and gives way to a glimmer of hope. Personally, the film could have made money without music, except what the man can hear with his cassette recorder. Luc Besson should have made better and still bewitching films like this, he also boosted Pierre Jolivet's career as a director who will leave a patchy job behind him in the future: "Force Majeure" (1989), "Simple Mortel" (1991 ), "but Petite Entreprise" (1999) or "Filles Uniques" (2003).
