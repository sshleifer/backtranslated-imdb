In my opinion, the film is an excellent example of the reality of war and a tribute to the soldiers of all the nations who fought and bled in the soil of Gallipoli. The lack of violence has by no means diminished the greatness of the story in hand. He is honest, true and courageous, just like the men who fought and died at the Hellespont. The lack of brutal depictions of violence is fair and correct. Those men have suffered enough for freedom, freedom and the right to self-determination in a free and better world. They never wanted to see such scenes again. This is the legacy of the Gallipoli event. Suffering from free pyrotechnic scenes and blood and blood is better not to show for maintaining the proper respect for the fighters of this national melting pot. <br /> <br /> This film glories in the magnificence of the men who fight for them lives, with honor, courage, dignity and an irreproachable spirit and humor in the face of terrible adversities. This film is not interested in making a show for fools to rejoice. The brutal results that have occurred from these personal fights of these men are not something that those who survived ever wanted to see on an entertainment screen. They have seen enough of it at that time, and would prefer not to have seen it before, and have never wanted to see these scenes on a screen in the name of "entertainment". The brutal horrors of the reality of the fierce fighting fought at Gallipoli were scenes that haunted their waking and sleeping hours for the rest of their natural days. They were the painful internal scars that they, the men of all those nations who fought, carried within their graves. They all fought and many died in front of everything and somehow they, those powerful men, managed to laugh between the teeth of the constant death of terror because they would not have insulted their companions not being willing to die at the game beside them. This is Australasian for brave, the game is, but it applied to all fighters to a greater or lesser extent, but the word from that boy who fought was that Johhny Turk was like a game, which is brave, as you will for an ANZAC soldier and Turks were fighting to establish their place on the world stage, and from 04/25/15 onwards, their respective claims for equality in the Nation were made known and undeniable for that world. The director has created a masterpiece that truly honors the spirit and memory of those soldiers and serves as a reminder for future generations of all ages, because children can be taken without fear of scaring them because of a visual "horror" and it is morbid and useless appeal. And children should participate in this film to learn what happened on that sacred beach before they were born. So that they can remember. Because it is the nature of men, who soon forget.
