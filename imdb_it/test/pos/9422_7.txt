Starting in 1942, the character of Sherlock Holmes played by Basil Rathbone was set in the then "modern" Great Britain. Many Holmes purists praised the first two entries in the series (produced by FOX), but rejected the 12 features that followed. I for one have never been an avid reader, and therefore I appreciate these films as they are without initial preconceptions. In fact, the setting of the Second World War for this item places it as a period piece with British propaganda evident throughout the film. The execution of modern Holmes is managed with much more care than the previous one (Sherlock Holmes and Voice of Terror) and is much better for two reasons. First, Roy William Neil is available to direct (and it would be for the rest of the series), and secondly even if Holmes is deployed against the Nazis, the inclusion of Professor Moriarty makes him more like a battle of the intelligence between two rivals. Lionel Atwill's performance has been criticized by many as being far less than that of George Zucco and Henry Daniel, but I feel like it's more the script than the character's interpretation. Especially after seeing that Atwill was very capable of being much more varied and enthusiastic in other horror roles. Basil Rathbone on the other hand is exceptional in this voice. He seems to have fun in the role of Holmes, but for the blame for writing. For example: Holmes' introduction to the Voice of Terror seeks to establish immediately how Holmes is superbly intelligent as soon as he appears on the screen, while this film shows Holmes's brilliant deductions, but also his flaws. Even in the climax Holmes has the upper hand initially, only to have the blood slowly drained from his body. Now there are some flaws in this movie that I thought you could point out. Before the opening; Did the Germans not be deceived a little too easily? Maybe it's just me, but the book seller dances just inside the bar, says he'll take Tobel not only to answer his door after weeks of hiding, but allow him to come in and then take a walk with him? What!? Second, Tobel certainly seems to endanger all those around him. Leave the parts of the secret bomb with genius scientists. Leaving the note with her boyfriend. How was he thinking? He was endangering them all. Did I think it was this superb scientist trying to save England? And it's not the whole concept of 'using it on them before they use it on us' a little harsh. Obvious propaganda. Third, what was the name of Holmes in the back of his chest? It's really small! In fact, the entire performance of Holmes, who finds Moriarty in the ex-con disguise, does not really explain itself well. I've seen this movie well over fifty times and there are still parts like this that I find are performed in a very confusing way. Fourthly, it's okay so Holmes discovers that the first three scientists died, but it is immediately assumed that Moriarty cannot know the name of the fourth man because he was not dead yet. Well, if Holmes didn't know the name, how could he assume that? The boy could very well be face down in a lake. Quinto lucky hypothesis, again with confusion. When Holmes is dying on Moriarty's operating table, how can he heal so fast? He was certainly acting as if he had lost a few pints of blood, but not enough to keep him from saving the day. Now, despite these flaws, this is a very funny movie. The disguises are well done, the mystery of the dancing men is well done (especially the back-to-back scenes of Holmes and Moriarty, each of which understands that they were analyzing them) and Dennis Hoey as inspector Lestrade is always an advantage. And as a final note, the interrogation scene still bothers me, I always thought it was one of the most well-made sequences of the entire movie. Overall, this film holds a special place with me as it was what solidified my Rathbone as Holmes's obsession. A classic. 7/10.
