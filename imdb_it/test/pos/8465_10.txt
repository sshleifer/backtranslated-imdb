The fact that this film was shown at the London Barbican suggests that the press must have been acceptable enough for such a show. Now the question is: why is this lost and important film not available on DVD (or even on VHS)? A large number of people in Europe and the United States have hoped for many years to see this film, if only for the wonderful music written for him by Sergei Prokofiev. What should be done to obtain such a marvelous production available to a wider audience, not just for the Barbican patrons in London? Having been a devoted listener to Prokofiev's music for many years and aware of this film, PLEASE, someone "out there" does the right thing and takes it out as a DVD.
