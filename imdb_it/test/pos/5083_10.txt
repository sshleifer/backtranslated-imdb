I saw the movie yesterday and I was shocked, but even more shocked by some of the comments I read here. One person wrote that he was ambiguous if the torture victim was guilty or not - so ... One person wrote that since he was not an American citizen, so ... Some comment that people in the Middle East hate us and they want us dead, so ... So we're saying it's fair to torture someone who is guilty of a crime? Are we saying that it is right to torture someone who is not an American citizen? Are we saying that it is right to torture someone who could hate us and want us dead? We are saying that, as written in the Geneva Convention, the Declaration of Human Rights and the Constitution of the United States, "torture is wrong, but are some tortures less wrong than others?" When does it become "right" to torture? This is why this film is powerful - it's ambiguous, but it's not about torture. Torture is always wrong, and if we are willing to do it, even in the name of justice and "national security" or "freedom and democracy", then we are wrong and we are bad; we are doing exactly what we are accusing our enemies of doing (and we are calling them "wrong" in the same breath). My favorite phrase in the film was "if you don't want to compromise, join Amnesty International". That's right.
