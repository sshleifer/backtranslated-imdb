A very strange film, disturbing but intriguing. I don't think I ever needed to see what a human can do with his ass, and I doubt I'll ever want to see him again. That being said, there is a lot to enjoy, such as taking Divine on Jayne Mansfield's classic walk in "The Girl Can not Help It" and putting slices of meat between her legs in a grocery store. A gritty appearance is very similar to a Russ Meyer movie. Generally poor acting, with the notable exception of Divino.
