A terrifying and moving crime thriller with Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan. <br /> <br /> From the dizzying opening sequence to the extremely satisfying conclusion, this cat and mouser hardly skips a beat. <br /> <br /> Johnny To, still working with the ace composer Arthur Wong, builds another action actor who croaks in the face of his contemporaries. <br /> <br /> The images of To are strong and moving. His cut, combined with the extraordinary musical cues, is exemplary. You are in the hands of a great filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The two sequences in which Andy Lau "hides" himself from the cops on a bus pretending to accompany a supple beauty (Ruby Wong) are evidence of the uniqueness of To ability to direct. <br /> <br /> Lau Ching Wan is as strong and authoritarian as the tormented cop while Andy Lau is as dynamic as a dying man who avenges his father's death. <br /> <br /> This is a superb film making, only slightly compromised by a bad English dubbing in a scene with the criminal Waise Lee.
