The mountainous forests, the happy young campers, a warning from a park ranger and a lurking figure. The ingredients are there for horror pleasure, and the director / co-author Jeff Lieberman does an adequate job to achieve it. It's a formidable forest horror, but for the most part the performance is at the top of the game and the story (which is pretty basic in a trimmed sense) is actually told in a certain realism. Perhaps a little more exposure would not be lost, but Lieberman's art compensates for the flaws and details of the material with increasing tension, moody images and a stifling atmosphere created by the very sinister soundtrack by Brad Fiedel. Whenever that disturbing whistle was whistled, he painted a truly disturbing sense that crept into the beautiful background. Filmmakers Dean M. and Joel King also do an amazing job. There is plenty of style, even with its minimal reach and accumulation is slow. Sometimes the pace can become a stop-and-go affair. It is not particularly violent, but there is still a paltry line evident even though some of them occur on the screen. The last chase scenes and the escalation of fear are well done, since it has the darkness that comes alive with its burly murderer / s and you get the actor George Kennedy who rides his white horse in a light but wonderful turn. There is a nice group of shows; Deborah Benson is a strong and fascinating heroine. Gregg Henry, Chris Lemmon Ralph Seymour, Jamie Rose, Mike Kellin and Katie Powell complete a modest cast of credible deliveries. The final climax is rather twisted, but the ending is one of those types that let you think about it ?? "Is that so?" <br /> <br /> A well-engraved slasher object that probably makes it a little too safe to distinguish it from the norm.
