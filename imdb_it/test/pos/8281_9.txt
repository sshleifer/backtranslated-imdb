I think it's great one of my favorite movies as a kid and he said that the songs were unforgettable that they were still mint, but I can still remember them now WORD FOR WORD the film remains a favorite with my family and also my younger cousins they are dependent on it, they also know that the songs in this film are great and a funny movie for children has a moral lesson so don't say it's not good because it shows how the lie doesn't make you go anywhere with a separation comment: this movie is amazing you love me xxx Ps I would like the soundtrack, but I can't and yes, the animation is good, the jokes are fun and the action never stops. This film will go down in the history of children's cinema and, in my opinion, is one of the only safe films to show to children.
