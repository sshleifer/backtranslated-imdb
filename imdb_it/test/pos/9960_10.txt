Some thoughts before reaching the heart of the film: 1) I have never seen so many breasts discovered in a film before, exposed in so many non-sexual scenes - it was strange; 2) Joseph Fiennes, where have you been? You fascinated us in * Elizabeth * and * Shakespeare in Love *, and then you left for a while. The mainstream American wants more! Ok, I'm a university professor of English, I've read this play many times, and this is probably the best film version I've ever seen. Although individual aspects of other productions may have stood out, this is the overall package put together well. Pacino is not Olivier, but he doesn't need to be, so get over it! The film's cinematography is amazing and not just for the naked breast. Venice is portrayed in a surprising way, and you have the feeling of really being there. The residential island of Portia is incredibly beautiful, and the lighting is always painted in the right way for the appropriate moods of the scenes. <br /> <br /> Anti-Semitism in this movie / game is hard to look at, especially in the end. Pacino is falling to his knees and tightening his religious artifact is perhaps the most powerful moment of his film since * The Godfather Part III * (when Michael's daughter is shot on the steps of the opera). Is the show antisemetic? Sure. * Othello * racist? Sure. Take it for what it is: a commentary on the Elizabethan era, not a commentary on today. <br /> <br /> Fiennes is underutilized in the film, but it's still a pleasure to watch. The women in the film are doing well; nobody really stands out here, but they blend nicely with the scenery. Jeremy Irons and Pacino are excellent in the two most juicy roles, opponents to the end. I always thought Irons was underestimated (I still get chills when I hear his voice from * The Lion King *), and Pacino is Pacino.
