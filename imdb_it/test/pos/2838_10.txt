After a summer full of reconstructions and disappointments, Nurse Betty is a breath of fresh air. The film is like no other I've ever seen. Director Neil LaBute proves to be able to direct more disturbing photos of men and women and how they approach sex (his two previous films were the brilliant In the Company of Men and the almost brilliant Your Friends and Neighbors). Renee Zellweger gives the best interpretation of her career as Betty, a waitress who, when she witnessed the brutal death of her husband's asshole (LaBute, backbone of Aaron Eckhart), gets lost in a fantasy world. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock play the killers who killed her husband and are now on trial. The trick to the film is that Freeman and Zellweger are actually parallel characters. While Zellweger falls in love with the image of the beautiful and polite Dr. Dave Ravell in a soap opera, Freeman idealizes Betty. Nurse Betty is a brilliant film, full of life, humor, love and graphic violence. My vote: 10/10.
