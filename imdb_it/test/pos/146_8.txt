A beloved and devoted priest of a small town, a volunteer for a medical experiment that fails and turns him into a vampire. <br /> <br /> Physical and psychological changes lead to his relationship with a wife of his childhood friend who is repressed and tired of his worldly life. <br /> <br /> The ex-priest falls deeper into despair and depravity. As things get worse, he struggles to keep what's left of his humanity ... <br /> <br /> The vampire movie should have been really extinct now thanks to the poor efforts of the Twilight and Underworld franchises, but the director introduces new blood into the vampire story, putting simple things into perspective. <br /> <br /> These vampires have reflexes and no fangs, but continue to feed and die the same way. Making the main protagonist a priest really opens a box of worms to question someone's acts. The priest feeds mainly to improve himself, but when he meets his friends, a dissatisfied wife, the carnal instinct begins. <br /> <br /> What makes this film intensely erotic is that when the couple first consents, they are experiencing something they have never done before, the forbidden passion, which makes the scenario even more sensual. <br /> <br /> Chan-Wook adds a bit of humor to the film, but this is only realized in the last third of the movie film. We see her daughter lift her mother in the chair in front of everyone, and when she realizes her strength, she puts down her chair and goes on. Exhilarating. <br /> <br /> and the final act would not be out of place in a reporting film, or even the three Stooges while the couple fight for survival / death respectively. <br /> <br /> The CGI is subtle and fantastic, and the scenes with them jumping from building to building are so pretty that you could be watching the ballet. <br /> <br /> The vampire genre looks fresh and vibrant after this, but more importantly, it has the eroticism and intensity that most vampire movies lack these days. It's violent, but from the director in question, I wouldn't expect anything different. <br /> <br /> A really interesting story, with fantastic characters and beautiful cinematography.
