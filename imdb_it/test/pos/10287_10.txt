since the plot like Vertigo or Brian DePalma's Obsession, up to the soundtrack by Peter Chase that recalls the sounds of Bernard Herrmann, this little pearl seems to be seen by few. Remarkable interpretation of Romane Boeringer and Vincent Cassel in a bohemian Paris portrayed by the famous Thierry Arbogast. A little cult! It is a pity that the only version available on DVD is French and English. Directed by a controversial artist like Gilles Mimouni, it could be considered a small tribute to the masterpieces of cinema. It's a French film, and like everyone, not for everyone, we could say an arthouse cinema. Although not so publicized, it could be remembered for several reasons.
