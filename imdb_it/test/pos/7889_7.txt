WARNING: read this entry after watching the movie! Like "Easy Rider" published a year earlier, "Joe" tries to illustrate what happens when the counterculture and mainstream America (albeit on the right) meet: a violent end ensues. Although this film is for the most part a slow exposure of the traditional "old fashion" American costumes compared to the "do-what-feels-good" lifestyle of the 1960s, it is also a comment on the upper class compared to the medium-low class and their inability to meet in the middle as illustrated when the Comptons meet the Curranis. Boyle's Joe represents a generation stuck in the 40s and 50s, where 'Kill a commie for Mommy (or jap or hippy for that matter) is fine as long as it helps and saves America. Joe and his wife Mary Jo are clearly the archetypes of Archie Bunker and Dingbat's wife, Edith. This film - which will forever be known for its violent (but not bloody - no blood is seen at all) - the end is uneven anyway. Joe detonates (verbally) the hippie generation then (literally) establishes with them to infiltrate their numbers to locate Compton's daughter - when clearly he should have been rejected by the idea, but renounces the separatist idea for sex. When he is betrayed through theft (read: the trust of older generations to the new generations), he lashes out through an inexorable chain of murders. Perhaps it is due to the Hollywood Tarantines that the observer expects blood death in the final scene, but the bloodless shootings aspire to any kind of impact or realism. 'Joe' is not a great film, but it is an interesting demonstration of class and culture alienation and of animal extremes at a generational distance.
