Considering the film as nothing more than a documentary on skateboarding would fail to recognize several important aspects of Dogtown. Peralta (a well-known skateboarder) has made a film that not only deals with the birth of what we know today as skateboarding, but also examines the socio-cultural and economic circumstances in which this sport has emerged and gained great appeal. Furthermore, his film is rather personal: Peralta's first-hand association with this cultural phenomenon serves both as an informed cinematic investigator and as a participating participant. In this role, he is an "observer-participant" par excellence, while collecting a wide range of personalities who were an integral part of this movement and of those who have been deeply influenced by the advent of skateboarding as a competitive sport and subculture. The film employs a singular stylistic form of film and sound editing, and the narrative (by Sean Penn) and interviews adopt a rather genuine and uncollected form that is similar to the anarchist and nihilistic spirit of surf on the sidewalk. The film shows the kinetic attraction of a protracted sports music video, mitigated by the sensitivity of an archaeologist to the importance of time, place and circumstances.
