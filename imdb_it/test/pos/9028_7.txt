This is not a serious film, nor does it pretend to be, but it is not as bad as some of its reviews, it is the title, and the first ten minutes lead you to expect it. <br /> <br /> The plot is very silly, but this adds to the carefree fun and excitement that runs through the film. The characters are interpreted comprehensively and, while behaving in a manner typical of adolescent anxiety, they generally avoid the sickly sentimentality that is usually found in this film genre. <br /> <br /> Unusually set in London, pleasing to geeks, this is worth a watch if it happens to be turned on; if you want some playful stupidity, and don't worry about suspending disbelief.
