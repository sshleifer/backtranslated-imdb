Do you know sometimes you just have to have it? That's how this movie is with me. I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I like it, it's so stupid in some parts, but I find myself reaching it when I'm down and I just need a good laugh ... and trust me, I'm not just a "goofy movie" kinda guy . <br /> <br /> You can read the synopsis so you don't have to get bored with it, don't worry, if you like Kelsey Grammer you'll probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> Another thing, be SURE to watch the credits. It is not necessary to read them, just look at them and catch the performance of "In the Navy" by the Village People ... and friends.
