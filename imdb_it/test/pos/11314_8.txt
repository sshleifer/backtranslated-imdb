Before seeing this photo I was rather skeptical, I don't like films with a program, nor do I appreciate being afraid to think like the writer. I was also afraid that this would be like the two-part miniseries "10.4" which had an unlikely concept, a small relationship with the real world and a very poor execution. At the beginning he says: "This film is a fiction, but the events are portrayed and information on emergency planning in the UK is based on extensive research"; and the general feeling is that an idea is not sold to you, but that you are taught a lesson in civil awareness. The message that is transmitted is obvious from the beginning: it is coming and we are not prepared. The use of real places and a scenario that could not only happen - There are plans to do so - they all add to the disturbing effect that the film will have, even on the most cynical of spectators. The perspective of the film is that of society and moves away from upsetting personal moments, which will not convey the message, therefore none of the dramas of Romeo-Juliet to which we are accustomed.
