This is perhaps the television series with the greatest potential of any series around. Production values ​​are in a class of their own. The characters are rounded and interesting. This is entertainment at its best. Some of the aliens are rather grotesque, but there is a basic humor that makes it unmissable. I hope this series goes on for many years and has many spin-offs. Science Fiction has had its bad press, some justified, but this really is a flagship science fiction series and I thank Henson for that. Maximum grade
