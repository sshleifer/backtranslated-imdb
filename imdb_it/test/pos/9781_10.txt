My family and I enjoy this show and find a perfect sketch of what people have gone through. <br /> <br /> My father spent some time in Changi before going on the Thailand-Burma railway in "F" Vigor. As for the treatment received by prisoners of war, I will simply say that my father was 6 and a half and 196 pounds when he fell in Singapore, at the end of the war he was 5 feet 11 inches and 91 pounds tall. > <br /> No show can really convey what the prisoner of war has been through, but this is getting closer. <br /> <br /> As the former prisoner of war says, "If you didn't have companions, you can't survive". This show manages to convey this message.
