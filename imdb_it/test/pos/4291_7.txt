Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson together - how wonderful! With Rupert Everett and Linda Bassett completing the supporting roles for the quartet of lies and intrigue. And yet, at the center of everything, each character maintains a vein of decency - moral conscience keeps pace despite obvious contradictions. "Contradictions are the source of all movements and all forms of life." How true these words are. Anne Manning of Watson is at the center of this intrigue: it is the central consciousness to which the other three attach themselves. She is the undeterred decency. <br /> <br /> The circumstances of the lies are for each one: one to defend one's professional name; one to retain due to family / partner pressure; you simply don't want to face the consequence; ironically, one cannot believe the truth and lies to save friendship. These are all precarious situations. There lies the intrigue: fascinating to observe how each faces the truth and lies. Contradictions, really. Despite the apparent disgrace, decency and heart remain strong. <br /> <br /> The treatment of the subject involved and the way in which each of the characters behaves are masterfully provided in a simple and clear way. It is not as sensational or complex as another "Where the Truth Lies" 2005 film. Credits due to the writing of Fellowes and the nuanced performances of Watson and Wilkinson. There is heat somehow going through the seemingly daring or frustrated hidden lies. Below all, human fragility is not excluded, they meant well. And following the story, the turn of events provided satisfaction and smiles on how the two Manning seem to have grown and matured in their relationship. <br /> <br /> You could say that there is no obvious action drama or exciting scenes in "Separate Lies", but the intrigue is there and will attract your attention. Deserving production efforts include the cinematography of Tony Pierce-Roberts (a veteran of the Merchant-Ivory films) and the music of Stanislas Syrewicz, with mood and tone reminiscent of composer Zbignew Priesner (of director Krzysztof Kieslowski Trois Couleurs, in particular: Bleu 1993.) This is a British film not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson (Anne, his wife): Breaking the Waves debut in 1996; Hilary and Jackie 1998; The defense of Luzhin 2000; Gosford Park 2001; Punch-Drunk Love, Red Dragon, Equilibrium in 2002. <br /> <br /> Tom Wilkinson (James, her husband): The Full Monty 1997; The Governess, Rush Hour (as villain) in 1998; In the Bedroom 2001, Normal (HBO cable movie) 2003, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2004, recently as Father Moore in: The Exorcism of Emily Rose 2005 with Laura Linney. <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett (Bill): It's simply delicious in "My Best Friend's Wedding" in 1997 with Julia Roberts and wonderful in "An Ideal Husband" in 1999 d: Oliver Parker, an Oscar comedy Wilde. Recently as Sherlock Holmes with Ian Hart as Dr. Watson, in PBS Mystery: Sherlock Holmes and the case of 2004 TV silk stockings. <br /> <br /> Linda Bassett (Maggie): she was very effective as Ella Khan alongside Om Puri in "East is East" in 1999.
