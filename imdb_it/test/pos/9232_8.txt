Someone once defined what the definition of an INTELLECTUAL is like: "A person who can listen to" The William Tell Overture "without thinking about the LONE RANGER!" In this, we agree agree! It would certainly be a daunting task to achieve this and one that Leopold Stokowski, Arturo Toscanini or Leonard Bernstein would find almost impossible to do. <br /> <br /> And in this there is no dishonor. The radio series and the television series, together with some series of films, feature films, comics and comics, have played their part to make "the masked man of the plains and his faithful Indian companion, Tonto" a deeply rooted element of our collective psyche and of our literary folklore. <br /> <br /> As with most legends, it all started gradually, first with a series of Radio Plays, written for local use in Detroit via the WXYZ Radio Station. The Creator was a George W. Trendle and the main writer of the series was Mr. Trendle's brother-in-law, Mr. Fran Striker. The year was 1933 when the Ranger headed for "the plains of the early western United States!" The Lone Ranger, the Tonto and the radio series all successfully led the Americans of the Depression during the mid and late 1930s until the Second World War. But the post-war era found the country in the midst of a Super-Nova explosion of invention and technology. There had been a new means of communication ready on the wings, but unable to go on until both the VE Day and the VJ Day had been reached. Once these were accomplished and the World and America were ready to settle both in Peace and in Prosperity. The "New Technology" was, of course, was TELEVISION! And we would definitely need something different from "Roller Derby" and "Wrestling From Marigold Arena" to fill in the broadcast hours. And while at first, the time when a television station had something, except that portrait of that Mohican Chief (Test Pattern, Schultz!) Very soon and hastily post, the Networks began to exploit the existing natural resources, their existing programming! Virtually everyone would be ripe for adaptation to the TV screen. <br /> <br /> So the guys from Lone Ranger, Incorporated were very interested when producers Jack Chertok, Harry Poppe, Sherman Harris and Jack Wrather all came up with a deal to put The Masked Man and Tonto on the waves of television, as well as the radio. <br /> <br /> They immediately went to work and gave us the first season, which made use of the considerable rear register of Radio Drammi, all potentially adaptable to TV dramas. They chose Clayton Moore, a support actor in many feature films and with a dozen years of experience. He had also worked in Serial at Republic Pictures' "Thrill Factory", which would be a valuable experience in "THE LONE RANGER". Considered his "faithful Indian companion" and collaborator in bringing justice to various parts of the Frontier, we had the perfection in the actor who supports the characters, Jay Silverheels. ** We must mention that there was that split in '53, when Clayton Moore walked and was replaced by John Hart. After a season or so, Mr. Moore was back to having been missed so much! Now, let's get back to our story !! The first years of shooting gave the episodes a look and a sound of their own. They made good use of Narrator off screen, which gave these shows a touch of authenticity and a unique series, unique in its kind. The actors employed were all veterans of the late-age films of silence between 1930 and 1940. Many of them were almost exclusively "Cowboy Movie" players. A good example of this is the casting of Glenn Strange (Bartender Sam on "GUNSMOKE") as the evil Gang Leader Butch Cavandish. And it was the massacre of the Texas Rangers of the Cavendish Gang that led to the origin of John Reid (thought to have been killed with the other Texas Rangers) as the "LONE RANGER". <br /> <br /> In addition to the old cast timers, you will find many new emerging talents in the cast. We see people like Phyllis Coates, Dwayne Hickman, Denver Pyle and others in the cast from week to week. All this, along with a request for fair play, justice and peace in a Western world. <br /> <br /> The last couple of seasons has brought great changes. The first was the use of Color Filming. This made no difference as a color TV set was still a long way away for our family. The second was a new set of musical themes and queues. (In addition to Rossini's Finale of "U NO Wutt!") The new music was not a big problem for us, because we preferred the "old radio" material. <br /> <br /> With this series and two feature films made during this period, THE LONE RANGER (Warner Brothers, 1956) and THE LONE RANGER AND THE LOST CITY OF GOLD (United Artists, 1958), the character was permanently and indelibly impressed in our identity as a people, we Americans!
