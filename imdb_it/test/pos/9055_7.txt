Friend, it's nice to see Young's star and The Restless Melody Thomas Scott as something different from agent Nikki Newman! A doctor with a brain no less! And it's really nice to see her with the likes of Lorenzo Lamas instead of Victor Newman! <br /> <br /> Mel plays a university microbiology professor who goes to the islands with his son for the spring break, only to find himself a prisoner of the island infested with a rapidly spreading virus. Convenient for her is the hunky character played by Lorenzo, who has a daughter who is only the age of her son. <br /> <br /> Mel shines, as does Lorenzo with a little exaggeration from the younger couple. An interesting premise in these times to talk about chemical and biological terrorism. Worth seeing, especially for fans of Y & R.
