This film is about reality, the submarine war in World War II was not a precise and clean science. There were no computers that provided exact details of the enemy, there was no 100% accurate instrumentation that controlled the submarine. Not all the crew went to fight with a song in the heart and a smile on the dial. <br /> <br /> People with expectations of seeing a "good war" in this film will be seriously disappointed, ... ........... GOOD, they deserve to be disappointed, they deserve to have reality pushed in your face. <br /> <br /> The war is not clean, exact, fought by people who are about to break into the song. He is endured by frightened, cold / burned, hungry and desperate people willing to do anything to survive. <br /> <br /> "We Dive at Dawn" is a great example that represents a desperate situation that requires desperate actions.
