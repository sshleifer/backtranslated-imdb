WHAT A FANTASTIC FILM !!!!!!!! I left the theater feeling dizzy. The movie I had just seen was one of the best movies I've seen in my life. I kept my eyes glued to the screen. It is very symbolic, visually lush, beautifully filmed and beautifully told. Basically they are two people who move into an apartment and live next to each other with their partners, who are supposed to have a relationship with their respective partners. Assuming this, our two heroes act out what they think their partners are coming to. There is an evident repression of feelings for each other, with the use of a vocalistic photographic work, a body language and symbolic scales. It is a visual and difficult party not to love. Some of the stories get slightly confusing but it's nothing. The ending is one of the most beautiful (and anti-hollywood) endings I've ever seen in my life and visually surprising. The film's disturbing score adds to the mood. I highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind and respect. What a great movie.
