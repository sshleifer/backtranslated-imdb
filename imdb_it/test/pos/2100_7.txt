Beautiful combination of giant monster and samurai genres. The giant monster Majin, god of the mountain, is a detached and hostile figure who comes across much like the God of the Old Testament, which rains destruction and punishment on those who profane his sacred land - but it is interesting to note that what in the end it awakens it is not the suffering of the people, but an acute and personal affront. It is beautifully photographed, with solid acting, large miniatures and a wonderful soundtrack by the great Akira Ifukube. Majin is not a monster of more than 400 feet like Godzilla - he has a normal size of 2 1/2 times, so the evil samurai who treads in the ground takes a good look at his contemptuous eyes as he retorts them about their fortress and shatters them into a thousand pieces . Not much in terms of extras, but it's nice to see this classic forgotten minor saved and restored in digital format.
