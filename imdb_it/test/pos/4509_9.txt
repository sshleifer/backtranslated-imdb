I've never read the book, but I've always heard good things about it. So when the movie came out I thought about going to see it, but I never did. Now it's released on DVD and I thought about renting for a few weeks. Last night I finally got it. I'm very glad I did it. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was incredible in this film. The scenery, etc., Everything made you feel like you were in Kabul. The acting was very good, although I'm sure some of the emotions got lost in the translation. And the story itself was beautiful, pure and uplifting. Yes, the story was very sad, but at the same time uplifting. <br /> <br /> And I'll be honest, like a white American, ... he showed me apart from Kabul and Afghanistan that I never imagined in my mind when I think about it. He showed me an Afghanistan before the Taliban. He showed me a place that was beautiful. He showed me a place with kindhearted people. The community was like a family, apart from a few bullies. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend this movie to everyone. It's one of the best I've ever seen.
