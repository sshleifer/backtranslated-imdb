I don't cry easily in movies, but I have to admit that this brought me to tears. Even though I'm not a fan of Ms. Streep, her performance was excellent. The title defines the love of a mother in a sentence. I didn't like any of the characters for the first hour, but this changed as the film went on. The film also explained why some marriages last even if there are obstacles. A movie to see.
