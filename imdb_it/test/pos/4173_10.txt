There are two ways to consider "Head". Or it's a dazzling, amazing music collage, old movies, psychedelia and sitcom style comedies in T.V. style, or a less pretentious and rambling storyline. The truth probably lies in the middle. It is also one of the best films of all time. <br /> <br /> 'The Monkees' - Davy Jones, Peter Tork, Mickey Dolenz and Mike Nesmith - had just finished their hit series, and wanted to make a movie film. In collaboration with writer Jack Nicholson and director Bob Rafelson, they did "Head". <br /> <br /> It begins with a ceremony to open the bridge in San Francisco, where the gate of the Monkees causes the proceedings to collapse. Mickey Mouse leaps over the safety railing, falling into the water for hundreds of meters. The sirens save him with the accompaniment of a splendid composition by Jerry Goffin and Carole King called "The Porpoise Song" and images that make the Stargate finale of "2001" a bleak look by comparison. By now you will be turned off by the perplexed disgust or you will be completely fascinated. <br /> <br /> The most bizarre events take place; Mickey Mouse uses a tank to destroy a Coca-Cola machine in the middle of the desert; the whole Italian army surrenders to him; the group is hired to play dandruff in Victor Mature's hair for a TV commercial; an overweight waitress insults the group, describing them as "the eight-year gift of God"; a surprise birthday party for Mike goes wrong; the group is sucked into a vacuum cleaner, and to plug everything, they are taken away inside a giant glass tank. <br /> <br /> You will either hate it or love it. I found a refreshing change from the musicals lacking the mind of the variety 'let's do the show here'. The songs are good too; 'Daddy's Song' is superbly choreographed by Toni Basil (later appearing in "Easy Rider" by Rafelson) and boasts wonderful touches, with Davy's clothes changing color at the speed of light. 'As We Go Along' is an adorable Goffin & King issue whose accompanying images convey a strong environmental message. <br /> <br /> Frank Zappa, Annette Funicello are just two of the guest stars to appear. Victor Mature read the script before agreeing to do it, one wonders? But it's hilarious. <br /> <br /> So crazy there must be a true genius, "Head" is a little jewel of the '60s and worth revisiting over and over again. Too bad he didn't find an audience at the time. If only "Spiceworld" had been like this!
