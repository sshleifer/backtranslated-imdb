One wonders about the state of a society that produces a father like Albert T. Fitzgerald, whom we meet for the first time on a plane, while he is heading to the place he abandoned a long time ago, and where he left a wife and a child who is now accused of killing a boy with mental problems. When we see him for the first time, he took a headline in the newspaper that the woman is reading in front of him. Rather rude, he asks her if she can get the newspaper, and the lady offers other sections. Well, that's not what he asked, what he wants the woman to do, is to give him the front section he's reading. <br /> <br /> Matthew Ryan Hoge has written and directed this disturbing film that reflects, in many ways, our society as it is today. In fact, Mr. Hoge indicates exactly what's wrong. <br /> <br /> The film features Leland, a teenager who cannot even distinguish between fantasy and reality. It is evident that killing a human being, even the sweet and innocent boy who did nothing to deserve it, will have fatal consequences, not only for himself, but for his own family and the family of the killed boy. In fact, Leland seems to have no idea what prompted him to commit the crime because he shows no repentance in this regard. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that Leland was traumatized by her parents' divorce. His father is a detached man he couldn't care less about. It's Pearl, the teacher in the juvenile detention center who sees the turmoil inside the young man and wants to help, but unfortunately does not have a chance. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is Don Cheadle, a great actor who always offers. The ensemble cast does a good job under the direction of Mr. Hoge. Kevin Spacey has a good opportunity to play the selfish father of the accused murderer and makes us hate to be an arrogant idiot. <br /> <br /> Although a little long, the film leaves us with more questions than it answered.
