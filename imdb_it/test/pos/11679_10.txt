I LOVE this movie. It was made ONLY before the LA punk scene changed for the worse. It perfectly preserves the mood and attitude of that time and place. I feel really lucky to have been present at the shooting of four of the bands at Fleetwood that evening. The only part that does not fit too well are the sections with the Catholic disiplina and their socio-political comment. I have not seen too many people who were part of it. The rest of the film shows attitudes that I witnessed a lot; people who deal with difficult lives or who go for a ride in the music industry and / or crappy hippies. I don't think I saw a documentary that captures the subject matter so authentically and personally.
