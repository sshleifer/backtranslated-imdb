I admire Deepa Mehta and this film is a masterpiece. I would recommend buying this movie on DVD because it is a movie that you might want to watch more often than once. And believe me, you'll still find small, significant details after looking at it several times. <br /> <br /> The characters - except perhaps the grandmother - are all very balanced, not in black and white. Even if you follow the story from the point of view of the two protagonists, there is also empathy for the other characters. <br /> <br /> I think IMDb's rating for the film is too low - probably because of its politically controversial content.
