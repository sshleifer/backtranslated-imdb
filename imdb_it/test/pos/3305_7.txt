This is the drama of a compelling woman that men can enjoy. The plot follows a young woman (Hope Lange) who goes to work for a publisher after college. We can forgive his leap into position from secretary to publisher (hey, it's Hollywood) and some other flaws. Here is one of the few films featuring a great producer Robert Evans (here, beautifully depicting a mouse with women). It also features a mature Joan Crawford and a terrifying support cast. Check it out.
