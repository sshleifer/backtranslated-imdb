I liked this film which is all about an average family, so it seems. Ben Travis, (Jeff Daniels) plays the role of father who is only interested in a son who is excellent at swimming and wins many trophies, however, he hates him very much and even his father. Ben has very little to say to his other son, Tim, (Emile Hirsh) and even to his daughter, Penny, (Michelle Williams) who is lucky to leave college. The mother, Sandy, (Sigourney Weaver) tries to keep the family together and she too is completely ignored by her husband. A very tragic event happens in the family that changes the personality of everyone, young and old start using drugs, smoking weed and drinking all the time at parties. There is also a homosexual scene and at the same time there is room for comedy and of course there is a very dark secret that Sandy Travis finally tells his son Tim.
