This film is full of little surprises, many of them fun. The fact that it is written and directed by a 24 year old drives me crazy. Some scenes in which high school children use ecstasy made me feel very uncomfortable because I have a child of that age and I could imagine using it. As a parent of a teenager, I found the depictions of parent-child interactions as correct. <br /> <br /> I liked the many little jokes in the film, and I liked the fact that not everything made perfect sense and not all problems were solved at the end. To paraphrase Mark Twain, truth is stranger than fiction, because fiction is necessary to stick to what is possible, while truth cannot. <br /> <br /> This is a film that plays with the viewer, allowing us to believe that people are what other people think they are, only to allow us later to realize that the people we hired were right they were completely unaware of the real situation. One of the strongest scenes in the film, a scene in which we feel very relieved and understanding about what the character is doing, turns out to be based on a completely wrong assumption, and the character, while admirable, is completely wrong. It is very subtly done, I think. Very realistic. <br /> <br /> I really liked the soundtrack - I thought it really helped the film, it really helped me set the mood - the movie has a couple of crazy moments and background music helps establish that. <br /> <br /> The valedictorian speech is a hoot and a half - he has a great laugh! The film is really in my head now - I saw it this morning. I will try to see it again, weather permitting. Dozens are hard to find, but a solid nine in my book.
