When you read about this movie you want to shudder. I've seen it countless times and yet I make myself shudder! So what's the attraction here? I think for me it's the unusual romance. I find it super refreshing to have a bizarre pairing between this New York journalist Jimmy-Breslin and an unfortunate dancer (for health). You feel embarrassed for Paul Sorvino in his inconspicuous approach to courting this woman. Like the guy in the bar who can't make a suggestion. She's a little overweight (at least as an aspiring suitor for a dancer, I hope you don't look rude) and possibly a little too old for her. Nice change of pace from the Greek god who woos Super-model. The soundtrack of Bill Conti has remained etched in my head all these years later, which is a good sign. However some of the acting are simply terrible. A subplot involving a young Puerto Rican boy who makes friends with Sorvino's character is simply hilarious. But the opening scene in which Ditchburn is warming up with Carole King takes you directly into this story. Good luck finding it. You would think that Lifetime would air this or even WE, but I haven't seen it for several years.
