I liked this play so much. Will Smith does nothing slow. He's always on target with the biggest scripts and comedy that make you laugh and get involved in the plot. You're watching a good comedian, who plays all his parts well. One fully believes that he is who is playing. I loved him and Tommy Lee Jones in Men in Black. This comedy lives up to that movie. Humor is rapidly moving and Will Smith is as confident as he was in Men in Black. Intelligent and skilled in the art of making others mark each time, but doing it in a refined and refined way. Will Smith seems to have refined his comic routine well. It was so damn funny. I loved the part where he had an allergic reaction to something he ate, and his face swelled, and he looked more like Cassius Clay after a fight, then he acted alone. Then seeing him as he sipped the Benadryl bottle trying to get his head back to the right size. I laughed so hard. He knows how to make us all laugh.
