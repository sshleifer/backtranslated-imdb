I was very excited to see a documentary about one of my favorite Italian directors. D'Amato dabbled in everything from post-apocalyptic horror to hardcore porn. He touched the genius a couple of times with films like Buio Omega and Emmanuelle & The Last Cannibals. This documentary is a comprehensive and informative guide to D'Amato's films. He is interviewed with English subtitles at the bottom of the screen. Extracts of his films are narrated by a narrator (with English subtitles). The documentary proved to be very interesting when he analyzed the often-censored "Emmanuelle In America". Qui D'amato explains in detail the fake scent scenes and recalls some funny stories. In fact, good old Joe is very warm and fun everywhere, always with a smile and smoking a cigarette. The only disappointing aspect of this documentary is that it spends little time on D'amato's horror films like Anthropophagus and the brilliant Buio Omega. He spends too much time in erotic cinema and hardly touches post-apocalyptic films. But I can't complain. It is wonderful to see D'amato have the respect he deserves. Highly recommended for D'Amato fans. May she rest in peace.
