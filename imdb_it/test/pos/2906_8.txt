I was going out one morning while I was checking something on the T.V. and I found this movie. I never remember seeing or hearing it. What fun and interesting to watch. Well, my meeting was rejected because I couldn't get out of this movie. There were some really interesting things that have marked his time in history, and some fun things that people don't have in today's movie, because it's not nice. Well, there was a lot of realism in it. The acting was good for a 1954 film. Subtle and genuine actions by the characters who showed me what they would do next. That's why I ended up watching it. I don't know why they don't show it more often. I'd rather see it than some movies that sound more than necessary. For history buffs, people who like vintage movies and those who are part of the film's appreciation groups will appreciate this. "The Egyptian" has a variety of flavors that treat a lot of things to look at in human nature that has not changed since it's time. What does it say about us? Those who do not like films that take their time to unfold and tell a good story ... are not in the cinema. <br /> <br /> I haven't had time to rent it if it's available, but if I get the chance to see it again, I'd probably vote for a 10.
