I have just witnessed a film that should have been forever a fodder for a second MOW on Lifetime ... but trust the Irish to prevent it from being anything but mawkish. The set-up all but SCREAMS "Here is a message about what is REALLY important in life", but the execution was the way in "Let's just see what we can get away with here". <br /> <br /> Helps to have two fantastic actors in the main roles: James McAvoy (as Rory) and Stephen Robertson (as Michael). While Rory is offered as the holy neighbor - no matter the language and attitude, he is the "life force" in this piece and could easily have been unbearable in his "caring" attitude - McAvoy keeps him strong enough to keep him from the be too sweet. But the revelation is Stephen Robertson like Michael. Not since Leonardo Di Caprio in "... Gilbert Grape" so perfectly captured a person with an affliction that I started to believe he was really an actor with cerebral palsy. And his eyes ... my God, he can tear you away with them. <br /> <br /> This film is, to paraphrase Rory, f **** n 'amazing. Go see it. Grab a box of Kleenex and enjoy every well-deserved tear ... and laugh.
