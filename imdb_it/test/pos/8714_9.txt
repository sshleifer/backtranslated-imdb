Bridgette Bardot, who looks as sexy as ever, plays a spoiled but innocent daughter of a French ambassador. Consider one of his father's best helpers (womanizer MICHEL) to marry her and it turns out to be the best thing for both. Michel is soon flirting with his old girlfriends and to teach him a lesson, Bridgette flirts heavily with a married PRINCE CHARLES. Michel is surprised by his jealousy. Between Brigdette and Michel ("I'll have a relationship" ... a cat and mouse game ... "No, you won't" ...) And finally Michel realizes that he could only swear to give up all the other ladies in his life. Bridgette and Michel are happily satisfied forever while Prince Charles arrives home in England. It is clearly a light but incredibly fascinating piece. While some may criticize it as a product of its time, I found it completely enjoyable. Worthy of a rent.
