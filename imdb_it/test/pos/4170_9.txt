My friends and I went through a period of time in which we would have rented films that none of us had ever heard of. The only good that resulted was this film, "Take it to Limit". As soon as the film started, we could say that we were ready for a true classic. The music is probably made by rural white kids from Colorado, but it sounds just like the rap of the 90s. The star of the show, actor Leo Fitzpatrick, plays the bad guy so well, especially showing off a bad joke throughout the film. This film is based on climbing, and I'm not a climber, yet I think it's fun when they have the climber struggling to climb and there's a guy in the background who is practically walking up the 'cliff'. You don't want to lose this movie, you will always see the same clips over and over again. You'll get surprises at every turn. You'll find yourself citing unforgettable lines. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Get the snow. Disclaimer: this film is badly made, but this is what makes it fantastic
