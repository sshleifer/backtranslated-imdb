Made in beautiful watercolors, Ponyo At The Cliff is certainly a sight to behold, vaguely recalling the trailer, a witch that I did not find impressive, I was surprised by how beautiful and detailed it was. This film has just overwhelmed me with its purity. <br /> <br /> At the center is a boy who comes into contact with a sea creature and their relationship that brings the film. Miyazaki is a teacher both in the creation of memorable images and in the visualization of young people who interact in a credible way with their little intact whims. <br /> <br /> There are some parts that don't fit me well. It would be a euphemism to say that music during a given scene "resembled" Ride Of The Valkyrians, it's a shame because such a precious movie can't afford to take liberties and hurt an otherwise really great scene. Even the antagonist and his background didn't interest me, but I imagine it served more as a background than anything else. <br /> <br /> Anyway, great movie. The scenery of the boat trip with all its images and sea creatures struck me. Pure and magical. And yes, hand-drawn artwork is more intimate than computer-animated artwork, now I'm really pumped for Princes And The Frog.
