Centers on Czech pilots of the Second World War ?? the old Frantisek, the impulsive boyish Karel and in the background the silent Honza piano. As the film opens, it is 1950, the war is over and Frantisek and Honza are imprisoned in a former monastery. In their native country now controlled by the Soviets they are "enemies of the people". Honza is badly abused by his communist compatriots and dies. <br /> <br /> In 1939 many pilots managed to escape from the German-occupied Europe and made their way to England, where they joined the RAF. Despite their high motivation and experience they face the reluctance of the RAF and the rigid British upper lip. Finally they fight gallantly in the Battle of England. However, Frantisek and Karel find their friendship seriously felt when they both fall for the same woman. <br /> <br /> In terms of romantic sub-plot, this is very similar to the Hollywood production of Pearl Harbor. However, given the context of the film and the final fate of Frantisek, it is also possible to read the treatment by the English woman of the two men as a symbol of the British treatment of the Czech and Polish RAF pilots: conveniently forgetting them once the war is over. br /> <br /> Furthermore, the film is much less clich√© than Pearl Harbor and the characters are more fully realized. Dark Blue World also marks in terms of incredible aerial fights, which were created seamlessly using a combination of models, actual live aerial footage and the 1969 epic The Battle of Britain. <br /> <br /> In short, Dark Blue World is a well-made, moving, stimulating and stimulating drama that shames Pearl Harbor. Highly recommended.
