- A group of bandits rob a train from the gold expedition it is transporting. In their escape, the bandits separated. The only thief who knows where the gold is hidden is killed before he is able to speak. Three men have a different part of the "clue" that will lead to gold. Can the banker, the bandit and the bounty hunter work together to find the missing loot? Or will they kill each other first? - The plot is an obvious take-off of Leo The good, the bad and the bad. Several scenes from the film are also removed from other films by Leone, Corbucci and others. But, for me, it's done in a way that shows no disrespect for the original work. Instead, Any Gun Can Play lovingly interprets some of the greatest films in the history of western spaghetti. The opening scene of three men in the city and the last comparison between the three main stars are a wonderful tribute to the previous SWs. <br /> <br /> - Castellari adds many beautiful touches - the reflection in the poured wine, the entrance of the stranger with the bright red background and the playful way in which the gold is finally discovered. Although highly incredible, many combat scenes are well represented and direct. Two combat scenes in particular (the market struggle and the fight for the bathroom) are very well done. He is not afraid to try different things with his camera. Close-up close-ups, top-down shots and shots around the corners are common in Any Gun Can Play. <br /> <br /> - Another advantage is the cast with which Castellari had to work. George Hilton is always good at these movies. Gilbert Roland is literally playing Gilbert Roland. And the newcomer SW Edd Byrnes holds his with the two veteran SWs. The supporting cast includes, among others, the regular SW Gerard Herter. <br /> <br /> - Any Gun Can Play should not be taken too seriously. Pleasant touches of humor can be found throughout the film. If this is possible with a SW, it's more of a "feeling good" movie - it is reminiscent of some of the Terence Hill / Bud Spencer films.
