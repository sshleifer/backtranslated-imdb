I love this movie! Kick it old school! I love the idea. I love the script. I love the characters. I really really loved the Geeks! I was excited to see the stupid slapstick horror films still honored. This was my favor, like Saturday 14 and Pandemonium. If you are a big fan of scary AND silly, then this is your movie! I only removed one star because I would like to have a better sound. Not bad sound, but would have liked to have more. Big splashes of blood. Big arms of the crime. Great costumes! I love the nod of the great stereotype wing breakfast club of the 1980s. And I can appreciate the non-CGI suspense. Really good camera action and slight suspense instead of CGI cutting. I'd rather have a fake good that is really fake. <br /> <br /> Kiss the cast and the creators! oh, I also love the "making-of"!
