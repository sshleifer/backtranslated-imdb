In Spain, former sailor Ramón Sampedro (Javier Bardem) was quadriplegic for twenty-eight years and is fighting in court for his right to practice euthanasia through an association that defends freedom of choice and is led by his friend Géne ( Clara Segura). Ramón is presented to the lawyer who defends his cause, Julia (Belén Rueda), who has a deadly degenerative disease; and meets Rosa (Lola Dueñas), a solitary worker who has been abused by men. Their relationship changes the behavior and point of view of Rosa and Giulia's life. <br /> <br /> The Chilean Alejandro Amenábar is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary directors. His filmography published in Brazil consists of excellent and original films: "Abre Los Ojos", "Tesis", "The Others" and "Mar Adentro". Javier Bardem is probably the best actor in Spain today. Their association has produced this delicate drama on a very controversial topic, the right to commit euthanasia. This drama is never trivial or depressing, since the script uses humor as an outlet in the most dramatic situations. The cast's performances are perfect, with characters who have and defend different positions with respect to this unpleasant theme. The dialogues and lines are very solid and intelligent. I noticed in the IMDb plot that this film is based on the real life story of Ramón Sampedro. Unfortunately, neither the film nor the DVD provides this important information. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Mar Adentro" ("Sea Inside")
