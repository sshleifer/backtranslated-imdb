Altman and Scorsese intertwine sexual relationships in one of the greatest American films of the last 20 years. Boogie Nights has not had a huge initial success and I still don't think it received the credit it deserves. The immediate clamor surrounding the film ("Some porn movies with Marky Mark") was completely worthless. What Paul Thomas Anderson has created is no less a stunning representation of the search and subsequent loss of the American dream (if such a thing still exists). <br /> <br /> For those of you who have lived in a box (or confessional) for the last 8 years, Boogie Nights tells the literal story of the rise and fall of young Eddie Adams (Wahlberg). Eddie is just a drugged kid from Torrance, California, who wants more out of life. His room is imbued with a naive America tied to muscles. His dreams are much bigger than his potential, but not as big as his ... special gift. His bald southern gentleman quickly raises the attention and eyebrows of the booming, ubiquitous adult film industry. Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds as the film's glittering dad) discovers Eddie's hidden talent and decides to put it in a movie. <br /> <br /> Before he could say "deep-throat", Eddie changed to his name was Dirk Diggler and exposed his massive member to an audience with wide eyes. Fame and fortune make the acquaintance of Dirk, as well as a group of local porn celebrities. His friends and co-workers become his makeshift family, but soon he will turn out to be a Sunday picnic like no other. While the '70s of common sense give way to the eighties coke-commented, Dirk & Co. begin a dangerous relegation. <br /> <br /> Anderson put everything he had into this glorious and touching epic. He snorts and never runs out. Nary is wasted by a frame of this monumental picture, and the characters and their dialogue live with us long after ELO fades from the soundtrack. See this immediately. And then look at it again. <br /> <br /> And again.
