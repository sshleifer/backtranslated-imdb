Tim Burton is essentially an expressionist filmmaker, uninterested in the size of the character and obsessed with the Gothic purpose, who opted for style and substance incessantly throughout his career. However, since his style is so keenly captivating, I, like many spectators, lose all the innumerable flaws that can be found in many of his films and are absorbed by what are essentially films worth a hundred million dollars. <br /> <It is almost embarrassing for me to see a poetic and emotionally engaging spirit in the second installment of a mediocre franchise, especially when the franchise recipients are 15-year-olds. Batman Returns should have been as commercial as its predecessor, ensuring box office and economic emotions (actually very expensive), enjoying itself without ever really involving the public. If this had been the result, Tim Burton would certainly have been asked to direct a third installment. Instead, Burton offers something that can really only be defined by the phrase "out there". <br /> <br /> From the melancholy opening in which an upscale couple throws a small bassinet like a prison containing their deformed newborn baby in a river, it is clear that Batman Returns is not a picnic at Buckingham Palace. Cut to thirty-three years later, during a political speech made by bad business magnate Max Shreck (portrayed ominously by Christopher Walken), the red triangle of the circus band attacks Gotham City. Batman (Michael Keaton returns to the role) makes his first appearance by showing off a new logo, saving the day. Shreck is soon kidnapped by the circus band and sent in black to approve the child's political return, now a grown penguin (Danny DeVito in a horribly perfect trick), whose reasons for the return are only suspicious for Batman. /> <br /> Meanwhile, Shreck tries to free his nosy and awkward assistant Selina Kyle (played to perfection by Michelle Pfeiffer who frankly deserved more awards for her performance) that turns into a deliciously sexy and psychotic Catwoman, in seeks revenge and carries, for some inexplicable reason, a mortal revenge against the dark knight. <br /> <br /> Batman Returns is bleak. The design of the production is breathtaking and gives a cold and haunting city of Gotham with an even more apocalyptic touch than its predecessor. Danny Elfman's soundtrack brilliantly supports the film, from the corroborating to the tragic. The tone and direction of the entire film is intensely brooding, filmed as a sad nightmare, directed by Burton obscures what is unmistakably a diabolical script with a plot that is almost completely irrelevant and at the same time perfect for Burton's visual style. . And while Burton's action sequences strive for euphoria, the real excitement lies in the directional choices that show the fall of each of his main characters, the disappearance of the Penguins, the mental state of the Catwoman and the solitary fate of Bruce Wayne . <br /> <br /> Warner The brothers hated him while the critical and public reaction was mixed. After all, they wanted a sequel to Batman, not a strange and rather horrible horror film, in which a deformed psychopathic orphan tries to kidnap and drown a group of children, spewing out everything that can be described as a green mucus. The production company wanted a film for the public, something for the McDonald's clan to promote their happy meals, not a film of terrible irreparable characters, including a sexually repressed secretary who is pushed by a skyscraper and picked up by a gang of cats that he wakes her from unconsciousness by chewing his bloody and icy fingers. <br /> <br /> It is easy to understand the mass disappointment following the release of Batman Returns. The film never looked like a Batman blockbuster. It is questionable if Burton really knew who Batman really was or even if he cared about the character as much as he cared about the movie that suited his usual wonderfully haunting art direction themes and misinterpreted and lonely characters who rarely conform to the standards of societies and expectations. This is why Burton failed to create a great Batman movie. He did it anyway; create a piece of nostalgic and breathtaking cinema, which remains my favorite and nostalgic favorite. <br /> <br /> It may not be a great Batman movie. But it's a great film by Tim Burton.
