I saw Marigold a preview a few days ago, and I discovered that it was a really compelling and fun movie. The film is about an unlucky American actress who goes to India to star in a low-budget film, only to find herself stuck there when she finds out that the film's funding has vanished, along with producers and investors. A chance encounter with an Indian film that was going around nearby leads her to be hired for a small role as a dancer in this. Since Indian films incorporate a significant amount of songs and dances, this is a problem for Marigold, who has two left feet, not to mention a personality so closely hurt and thorny that he can barely hear the music, let alone hear it , as Prem, the film's choreographer, advises her to do. <br /> <br /> But "prem" - the word, not the person - means "love", and Prem - the person, not the word - seems to embody that emotion in the way it takes care of everything it surrounds him, whether it is his production assistant who presented Marigold at the shoot, the narcissistic and arrogant leaders of the film, or the cursed and tense Marigold herself. Soon, under his expert tutelage and captivating treatment, Marigold finds his feet - literally and figuratively. <br /> <br /> I have to say a word for those unfamiliar with the use of song and dance in Indian films. Unlike American musicals, the story proceeds through these dance numbers, as plot developments take place and the characters' transformations take place in parallel with the dance. It should also be emphasized that Indian dance is much more than just a movement. An essential part of it is the enactment of the dancer's feelings and emotions as he tells the story of the dance. This is the main purpose of dance and dancer. <br /> <br /> That Marigold achieves this stage of realization is demonstrated in a surprising dance number midway, when Marigold, while performing the dance he is required to do for the film within the film, also expresses his love for Prem. It is an extraordinary performance by Ali Larter, especially considering that she is not used to dancing in her films, nor to emulating her character's feelings through dance. He shows his talent as an actress and also the hard work he has done in the role. <br /> <br /> Obviously no romantic movie can work without a credible Prince Charming. Salman Khan, who plays the role of Prem, adapts to the role of a T. Even when he discovers that he is not such a charming prince, he does not lose the sympathy of the public. Salman has been ruling Hindi cinema (sometimes called Bollywood) for many years and it is worth remembering that his first starring role was also Prem. She is completely charming, sweet, adorable, sexy and vulnerable. For those who have never seen it before on the screen, be prepared to be hit by mega doses of pure magnetism! He and Ali Larter are a lovely couple, and they are equally matched to acting as their appearance. <br /> <br /> Will they solve their problems? It doesn't seem possible when we listen to the last song of the film, a delightful fusion of reality and fantasy, reality and metaphor. The finale certainly took part of the public with whom I saw him by surprise, but they were satisfied. The songs are used very skillfully. They are in Hindi, without subtitles, for sequences filmed within the film, and in English for other occasions. But their meaning is always clear from the context and the choreography. <br /> <br /> Marigold is a very satisfying romantic comedy - yes, there is also a bit of humor. The Indian locations and costumes give it a fabulous quality, which is suited to a story that can be compared to a modern fairy tale. <br /> <br /> If you are or have been curious about Indian cinema, but you hesitated to try it, this is a great introduction. It captures the color and vibrancy of Indian films, not only in costumes and jewels (which are quite impressive), but also in lively dances and worldwide sound music. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Ali Larter, you should watch him for his excellent acting in portraying a selfish, demanding, "high maintanance" woman who has an inner attraction that inspires the love of two men. If you are a girl, you will enjoy admiring Ali's adorable costumes and watching his important man piece. If you're a boy, you can't just admire Ali in his sexy costumes, but learn from Salman Khan what it takes to bring out a loving heart from someone as angular as Marigold.
