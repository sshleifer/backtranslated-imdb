If you like Madonna or not, this movie is fun !! I'm a fan of Madonna and I saw this in the theater when it came out. However, over time it has not lost its nonsense and pure entertainment. Sure, there are some bad lines and a mischievous acting, but the whole movie is just a comedy wrapped up with Madonna carrying the whole movie with a big bomb. She is cute, funny and is the only comic role in her film career. Usually Madonna plays herself in the roles but looks like Nikki Finn in this movie, she really looks like someone else for once. Of course the film is directed by James Foley (who shot the dramatic and disturbing film 'At Close Range' with Sean Penn and Christopher Walken) and co-star Griffin dunn ('After Hours') who is also brilliantly cast and having fun with Material. The story is not brilliant and you do not expect a climate ending, but if you want to watch a fun, clean, fun of the 80s or if you are a Madonna fan of this is a must see. The soundtrack is also very remarkable and contains 4 Madonna songs: the success number 1 "Who's That Girl", the success n. 2 "Causing A Commotion" and the beautiful and one of his best ballads "The Look of Love" (Top 10 Hit in the UK) and "Can not Stop" is a pop synonymous with the previous year's 'True BLue' sessions, only on VHS, but will soon be available on DVD.
