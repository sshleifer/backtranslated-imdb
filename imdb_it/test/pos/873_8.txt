On the Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, the owner of a cigarette factory Louis Mahé (Jean-Paul Belmondo) is engaged through correspondence with Julie Roussel and he does not know it. When Julie arrives on the island to marry Louis, she waits for her in the harbor, but Louis does not recognize Julie in the passenger ship and discovers that she is totally different from the picture he sent to Louis. They get married and Louis shares his bank accounts with her. When Julie's sister writes a letter to Louis asking her sister to write to her, Louis discovers that the woman is not Julie missing. Furthermore, he finds that the woman has canceled her bank accounts and left the island. Louis and Julie's sister takes on an efficient private investigator Comolli (Michel Bouquet) and Louis goes to France in search of the woman, but has a nervous breakdown in Nice and undergoes intense sleep therapy in a clinic. He recovers and discovers that the woman, actually Marion Vergano (Catherine Deneuve), works in the Phoenix Club Privé of Antibes and lives in the low budget hotel Monorail. Louis breaks into his room and when he arrives from the club, he says he is happy with him, but his dangerous former lover Richard has blackmailed her. Louis is still in love with Marion and flees with her to the country. But Comolli chases Marion in France accused of killing Julie. <br /> <br /> "La Sirène du Mississipi" is a noir film by the great director / writer François Truffaut, with an unconventional love story of passion, murder and love that hurts. The femme fatale Catherine Deneuve is amazing, probably at the top of her beauty and is happy to see her face and topless scenes on the street and in the room. Jean-Paul Belmondo is very athletic, and the sequence when the hotel wall intensifies is impressive. Catherine Deneuve makes this film worthy of note and gives credibility to Louis's passion and lust. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Sereia do Mississipi" ("The Mississippi Mermaid")
