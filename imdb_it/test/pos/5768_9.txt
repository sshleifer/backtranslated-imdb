I saw it when it came out for the first time and I discovered that it was a work of a genius; but I must confess that at that moment I was clearly in the minority. <br /> <br /> For me, the progressive madness of the owners of Paradiso House House improves more and more during the film, with one of the most exhilarating climaxes in a film of all time. <br /> <br /> But I wouldn't recommend it to my mother. <br /> <br /> Lovers of coarse comic humor will appreciate this film; there are thin hidden jokes, but they are usually quickly flattened by a comic pan. Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson are superb, and even the unsuspecting and impeccable guests are excellent.
