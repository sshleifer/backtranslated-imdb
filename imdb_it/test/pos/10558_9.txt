This is a funny, intelligent and, in a way, realistic comedy about a fourteen year old who tries to live his first love while on vacation, and also on the complex, sometimes funny, sometimes touching relationship between a divorced father and her growing daughter ... and how far a woman (not just Nicole, the teenager) can go to get the man she loves! I laughed a lot with this lively scenario that never drags on.
