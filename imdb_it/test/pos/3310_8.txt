It is interesting to see how the society of the 1950s is depicted in this film. Men are lustful, chain smokers who have one thing in mind (time has not changed men much, but "sexual harassment" has) and women are at work only spending time until they find a husband and they settle down. Some of the dialogues are worthy, but nevertheless it is fascinating in an innocent, pass√© way. I love the opening credits that show a romantic and exciting view of Manhattan with Johnny Mathis singing "The Best of Everything" in the soundtrack. I want to go straight into some scenes, shot on the streets of N.Y, around 1959 and have an experience that I only saw on film and in photographs. Some scenes in this film reminded me of Melanie Griffith's "Working Girl". Especially when Hope Lange (who is a cross between Grace Kelly and Dolores Hart) is bombed in Stephen Boyd's apartment, slips it in and watches her sleep (like Melanie, wants to know if "something" happened between them the next day) . Joan Crawford is certainly comparable to the horrible female chief of Sigourney Weaver, except that she was externally bad (with a soft core), but the character of Sigourney was sweet on the outside and horrible on the inside. I found the way in which the character of Suzy Parker (Gregg) started out as an independent woman with actress career goals, which apparently didn't need a man to complete her, is over. Become a stalker / crazy / crazy when he lets the man he falls in love bring him the bananas after he is done with her. I loved the character Mary Agnes, the office gossip, with her strong New Yawk accent. If you like movies like "Valley Of The Dolls" you'll like this too.
