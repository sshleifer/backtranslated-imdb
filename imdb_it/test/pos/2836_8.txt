This film, released in 1951, has the usual elements typical of westerns released in the 1950s; the cavalry that needs to protect the territory from a murderous band of Indians, an officer determined to see that task, and the men with him with various defects of character who must merge together into a cohesive unit. This small band must cling to a fort located near the Indian village until reinforcements arrive. The Indians know, all right, that the little band is undefined, and could be wiped out before help arrives. One of the main differences for this film, "Only the Valiant", is that it tries to reproduce the usual plot, but at the same time to convey the message that duty is a fundamental concern to share with everyone, even if they don't accept it that charge. <br /> <br /> Gregory Peck embodies the tight-lipped captain of the troop who must prevent the Indians from breaking into the territory. The soldiers he brings with him to the small outpost are the scum of the troop at the fort; they, in turn, have flaws or weaknesses that cause them to wonder if the captain has not taken them out because of their general lack of devotion to a cause. In the end, the captain and the small band face the hostiles, and at the same time, everyone faces his own flaw. The cast includes Western supporters such as Ward Bond, Gig Young, Neville Brand, Lon Chaney, Jr. and Warner Anderson. <br /> <br /> A movie sleeper and a good solid western for fans of this genre.
