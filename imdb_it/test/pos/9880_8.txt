I loved this movie when I was younger, and actually tried it again !! I'd like to see it again !! The information is all correct, but the cover doesn't seem to match - I can't say for sure though. From what I remember, the film was about these guys (Alyssa Milano, Tina Yothers, etc.) In a driving class, and also shows the damage they feel outside the classroom. Edie McClurg was the mother of Alyssa Milano in the film. I remember that I really liked it so if anyone knows where I can get a copy (preferably DVD) of the film listed above (with those stars in it) I'd like to know. Thank you :)
