Surely the highlight of this film is the cast. <br /> <br /> Diana Rigg, George C. Scott, Bernard Hughes to name a few. <br /> <br /> I have accumulated more time in hospitals and with doctors over the years than I care to think. <br /> <br /> This comedy attacks pomp and pretense in all aspects of our society, through setting up one of its "most haughty" institutions ... the profession of medicine. <br /> <br /> The idea that such an event could be possible could be a shock to some, but it is a delight for anyone with an experience perspective. <br /> <br /> Dr Brock (Scott) suffers a mid-life crisis of monumental proportions before our eyes as we, and he, fall in love with the prospect of his involvement with Miss Drummond (Rigg). <br /> <br /> The thread of the absurd is woven into this wonderful mix in the form of irony that the Hospital seems to be killing its own workers while they mismanage their business in it. <br /> <br /> The climax is unpredictable (unless you have it it) and made even more fun if you happen to guess. <br /> <br /> Not everyone's brand of humor, to be sure, and it has incredibly fun "Dark Moments" if you are open to them. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute, and I was happy to see it on DVD.
