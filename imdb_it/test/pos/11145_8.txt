The story takes place in rural Germany on the eve of World War II, a unique environment, with a pair of British agents held by the Germans in a farmhouse. Since they are not technically at war yet, it seems that both sides must have understood what was going to happen. Both agents (Bruce Lester and Ray Milland) flee into the countryside and separate. Milland happens to the gypsy Marlene Dietrich one evening while she is alone in her field preparing dinner. Their meeting is an incredible and captivating scene, not so much for Milland, but for Dietrich, who brings the sexy afa in a new plane. Milland disguises himself as a gypsy to hide from the Germans, but remains faithful to his mission, dealing with the location of the scientist who knows the formula for a new toxic gas but who is not even a committed Nazi. The Hollywood interprets the life and habits of the gypsies, as is to be expected, but the basic awareness that it would be one of the goals of extermination of the Nazis adds a certain tension. The film straddles being a serious story about poisonous gas and the urgent quest to get the formula, and a colorful but not too convincing love story between Milland and Dietrich. However, they are both very good; it is the fault of the film that did not give them or their relationship enough dramatic realism, relying on obvious cultural differences for questionable comic purposes. Nevertheless, there are some tense and interesting points here and there, the surprise encounters with German soldiers and Gestapo agents, where Dietrich makes a great read and Milland almost like a fake, and a dinner of Germans of various stripes in which the announcement arrives on the radio that Germany has been attacked by Poland and everyone is standing and doing a strict greeting to the arm. Mitchell Leison may have missed some opportunities here and there, but he took full advantage of the others.
