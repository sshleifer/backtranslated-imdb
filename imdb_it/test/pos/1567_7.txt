There is not much in history. A young woman steals some money from the sad Vermont supermarket, where she works, decides to flee to Florida where she dreams of attending school with her friend Julie and meets a strange couple on the highway. If you remember the elderly couple from "Rosemary's Baby", you have an idea of ​​how these two are. Bill has a funny face and is retired from the army. Sandra is a former stripper now become a whore, even if we don't find out right away. They are affectionate, helpful and full of common sense. <br /> <br /> They adhere more or less to the girl, Alice, and promise to give her a ride in their elaborate RV, even if they are not driving "directly" to Florida. <br /> <br /> Here is where the film could have been one hundred percent wrong. All filmmakers had to transform the elderly couple into a personification of evil. They would take the virginal Alice (handcuffed to the bed or whatever) and sell her body to any greaseball driver who has a lot of money and loves rough sex. (Alice would have had plenty of time to escape, with many abortive attempts, before the final shooting.) But, no. The couple is really pretty, and Alice is anything but virginal. Alice listens to Sandra with a client, asks for information about the business and tries to turn a trick herself. Bill prevents something from happening and insists that he does the right job if he does it at all. They don't talk to her. They drive it. <br /> <br /> Alice makes several hundred dollars, which is several hundred dollars more than when she met the couple. Bill and Sandra keep her money in the safe where customers won't find it. Alice misunderstands. He doesn't find the job very pleasant and he thinks he is never repaid because every time he asks to be left, Sandra replies: "What? Not here, honey, not in the middle of nowhere". However, after she spoke in handing over the gun to Sandra, the couple gave her the money she wanted and rather lovingly released her to continue her trip to Florida. <br /> <br /> Do you know what I found the most tragic moment in the film? It had nothing to do with prostitution or theft. Alice expected to go to bed with her friend Julie after arriving in Miami. After all, Julie is a legitimate student. But when Alice calls her friend somewhere in Alabama to assure her she's coming, but she'll be late, Julie hesitates and says, "Well, my mother doesn't think you should have a place with us. And to tell the truth, too my roommate is not nice, I invited you, sure, but I thought it was like a visit for a week or something like that. Back to Milford, Alice "There's a long silence before Alice hangs up. <br /> <br /> Only one shot is fired (some white frames of the film) and no one is hit. Tears appear only once. No one limits someone else. No machine explodes in a fireball. No policeman pursues them in the Interstate. <br /> <br /> The management is occasionally clumsy. Too much crossing between Sandra trying to disarm Alice and Alice's hand holding the swinging gun. There is almost no musical score. There is a brief male and female nudity and it is embarrassing, as it probably should be. Alice is not unattractive, but neither is it harmful. He wears Asian eyes, a kind of robust version of Molly Parker. The cinematography looks cheap and the colors are faded. The direction is a simple narrative, with some illuminating flashbacks. Nothing is wasted. And it was evidently filmed around Danbury, Connecticut. The city remains in my mind because I crossed it after one of its floods and I remember the cars encrusted with a mud film up to the door handles. <br /> <br /> I don't know exactly what Alice Found. (I am even afraid to THINK that the answer to the riddle is "found"). Acting is not bad at all. Judith Ivey is better than that. It is certainly worth seeing, a quiet and orderly film that treats the public like an adult.
