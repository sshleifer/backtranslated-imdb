I gave this film a 7 out of 10. I think the general antipathy of this film is due to people who don't really understand the plot. If you think about the plot, this movie really makes sense, it never gives you a stupid explanation. It is true that the special effects are sub-par and seem like a semi-low budget, but I think the originality of the plot involves you. People say that the vampire genre is exaggerated and clich√©, but with Bled, what you get is not your classic vampire stroke. It is an alternative dream / reality plot with an eternal vampire / life revolving around it. I loved it. The only thing that kept me from giving a higher score was the lack of special effects and I personally don't like films where most people have accents. But like I said before, if you really get the plot this is not a bad movie ..
