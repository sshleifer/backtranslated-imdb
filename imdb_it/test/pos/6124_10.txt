Do you know the saying "Curiosity Killed The Cat"? Well, I've heard so much about this movie, about a magazine that called it one of the most shocking movies of all time, my 1001 movies to watch before I die, my sister who saw it at a film festival, and I love the spectacle of the 70s on VH1. I've had to see this film since it was named the grossest film of all time, and well, after watching this movie last night, I have to say that it really lived up to its title. My God, this movie was so weird! I thought I had seen it all with some of the sickest movies and TV shows I've seen, some things I imagine will always be shocked. <br /> <br /> Well, Babs Johnson, aka Divine, the dirtiest person was named alive and a jealous couple named Marmi compete for that title. They want to take Divine and be named the dirtiest couple by kidnapping women, raping them, impregnating them and selling their children to lesbian couples. But it seems that Divine and his family of good ... I do not know, seems to keep the title by having sex with chickens, lip-synching, eating dog faeces, filling the flesh on their skirts, incest, and becomes only coarse and coarse. <br /> <br /> The pink flamingos are horribly recited, made horribly, and well, simply horrible. The reason why I will vote 10 is due to the fact, well, how could you rate this movie? I always value, so I just figured out what the hell? Through the coarseness of this film, you have to give some credit to John Waters, who the hell would have thought of this movie over 35 years later? For the cast and crew that worked on this film, you are simply bad! <br /> <br /> 10/10
