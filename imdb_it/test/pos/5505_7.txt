A sick Carleton Hendricks (Dee Snider), goes around the Teen Chat lines like Captain Howdy. He poses as a teenager and invites other kids to his house to party. Instead he throws them out, strips them, sews his mouth shut and tortures them (especially with needles). Capture cop's daughter Mike Gage (Kevin Gage). He finds it, stops it and is institutionalized. Four years later he came out ... totally cured. But a lynching (driven, in a funny way, by Robert Englund) attacks him and hangs him. He doesn't die but shoots and Captain Howdy is back ... A very sick, scary and twisted horror film. Captain Howdy loves pain and torture and is trying to show children that he also kidnaps how to have fun. The torture scenes are not so explicit (hear more than you see), but what you see is very, very sick. There is no humor and the screams (seals) of his victims sound too real. During most of the scenes I was moving away from the TV. <br /> <br /> Acting varies. Kevin Gage isn't as good as the cop - it's not terrible, but it could have been better. Dee Snider is very scary as Captain Howdy - his attacking scenes are not pleasant. <br /> <br /> All in all, not the typical horror movie. I will probably never see him again (this film really takes you under your skin) but I recommend it to all horror fans, at least those with strong stomachs. I give him a 7.
