This is by far one of the best films India has ever made. Below are the positive points of the film ... <br /> <br /> Wonderful direction, cinematography and editing, the editing is very fluid and the timing of the changes is excellent. <br /> <br /> Although the film shows the lives of the Mumbai cops and their difficulties, it never becomes boring or understanding. <br /> <br /> The amazing acting of the protagonist Nana Patekar. One can certainly hope that he will be nominated for the best actor for the Academy awards. <br /> <br /> Controlled violence. Violence is controlled and the film does not become a bloody mess. <br /> <br /> No stupid songs like in the usual Indian films. <br /> <br />
