When I started watching 3 of the episodes of this series on Action Channel, I must say that of all the shows I've seen published on ADV, this is one of the best shows of all time. I had to see it again, and that's when I had my chance. I bought the entire set of this series at Best Buy for my 20th birthday. And I got to enjoy it, and see more of the episodes I missed on the Action Channel and the same 3 episodes I saw. My favorite characters in this show are: Sylvia, Leon and Nigel. The animation of this series was the best and even the heavy suits were fantastic. But the show also has a great voice like: Chris Patton, Jason Douglas, Christine Auten and Hillary Haag, and more. So if you like this show on the Action Channel, you have to own it on DVD. It's the best, and you'll see what I mean.
