This film sees Peter Lorre as an exceptionally kind boy who emigrates to America. Unfortunately, shortly after his arrival, he is in a horrible fire and his face is horribly burned. Because it seems so terrible, nobody wants to take it and out of pure desperation, it uses a life of crime to earn the money needed to buy a mask to hide its ugliness. Where exactly the film goes from there, you'll just need to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I marked this movie as an 8 because, for the money spent on it, it's a hell of a good movie with a lot of good plot twists to make it interesting. The film may have degenerated into a simple horror or crime film, but it goes far beyond that and offers some real surprises. Furthermore, Lorre's excellent acting shows that he was capable of more than just a supporting role. This is an excellent film and offers more than most "A-images" of the day.
