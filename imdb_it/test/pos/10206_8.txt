If Western Union is not exactly the true story of the construction of the Transcontinental Telegraph, it certainly captures the spirit and dedication of the people involved in the project. <br /> <br /> Dean Jagger is the responsible man and one day he is thrown from a horse and supports some broken ribs. An outlaw on the run, Randolph Scott, finds Jagger and is ready to steal his horse, but changes his mind and takes Jagger to help him. He was later hired by Western Union and worked for Jagger. <br /> <br /> Jagger also hires an oriental young man played by Robert Young, who is an engineer. Young is making one of his few films on loan from MGM for 20th Century Fox. Both Young and Scott become friends, but rivals for Jagger's sister, Virginia Gilmore. <br /> <br /> Western Union has a lot of action, enough to satisfy western fans. The telegraph crew has to do with outlaws, Indians and garden labor problems. <br /> <br /> Slim Summerville as the shy cook and Victor Killian as a frontier character assigned to guard it, has some of the funniest scenes. Both provide good comic relief. <br /> <br /> Fritz Lang got good performances from his cast and kept the film moving briskly. Western Union is solid western entertainment.
