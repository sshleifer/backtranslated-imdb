I do not want to write too much about the film, but basically it is an action / comedy with a bit of romanticism launched in about two men who meet in unlikely circumstances and become men of the road together. Fantastic show of Robert Carlysle and all the others involved. A brilliant 'bad guy' that really makes you hate. Some great comic lines - actually they laugh out loud, surprising action and a great plot. Choice of music and setting all fantastic, basically brilliantly direct and brilliant writings. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good English movie or a lot of action, I don't know why the film never took off, I thought it wasn't the closest recognition it deserved. If nothing else, watch this movie for one of the greatest finals of all time. Don't give anything, but this is really the heart that beats!
