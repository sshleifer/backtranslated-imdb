Or at least you feel pretty high after this movie. It is the kind of film that the word "rollicking" can really be applied to, even if it is rollicking in that completely random, intelligent and open-minded way that belongs to the French. <br /> <br /> No, Catherine Deneuve does not spend the whole movie upstairs (I'm sorry to disappoint the Puritans with a diary) .. but the only scene I'm referring to involves all the members of a party of wedding - And it's a musical number! In any case, everything fits perfectly together, and the unusual, bright and colorful family (Deneuve's mother is a lesbian, Deneuve is her beloved daughter) alternately entertain and annoy us like royal families do ... but since it's a film they mostly entertain. <br /> <br /> I don't want to say too much about the ending, but Deneuve ends up marrying a man about twenty years younger. This is completely credible when we see that the relationship develops over time and that the two are naturally closer and closer together. The ending is happy; and like the rest of the film, satisfyingly eccentric as well as perfect.
