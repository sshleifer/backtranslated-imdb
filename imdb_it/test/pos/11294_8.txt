I saw 'Begotten' last night, and I'm two minds in the movie. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, I appreciate him for being the reverse of a Michael Bay movie. No dialogue, an extremely stylized and grainy black and white photograph, some of the most horrendous images ever set for the film, and a very compelling use of sound (which no one else seems to have understood yet). It is a reflection on a theme, and dares to go where most directors do not only in terms of images, but of production and concept. It is a film that most people do not understand, and if you read these comments you will find a lot of people whose lack of ability to interpret this film results in screams of "pretentiousness" with the fervor of a gibbon that makes the bars sound of his cage at meal time. It really shocked and disturbed me, and the last time a movie was able to do it was a while ago. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is a thirty-minute short that spans over an hour and a half. I understand that there may be an artistic merit in using monolithic repetition and pacing as a club, but in this case it simply does not help everything that remains together. Imagine being approached by a ragged man on the street who takes you by the shoulders and says something that completely confuses the core of your being ... but then, instead of leaving your shattered and babbling in his wake, he continues to talk and talk and speaking At the end of the film, I found myself looking at the clock from time to time. <br /> <br /> This is not entertainment, people. This is disintervention. This is how you deprogram people who just looked at "Glitter". If you watch movies for fun, it will frustrate you, confuse you and probably make you angry. Don't get close to 'Begotten' like a chocolate cake you want to eat because it tastes good. You approach it like something on the menu you've never heard of before, something you see stealthy looks through the kitchen door, something that is dark and glitters and contracts on the plate; something you order not because it will taste good, but because you just need to know how it is.
