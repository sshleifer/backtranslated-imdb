"Classes tous risques" is one of the best "gangster" films that France has ever produced. A perfect cast: Lino Ventura, a young Jean-Paul Belmondo (who made "a souffle meeting", by Godard, the same year), Marcel Dalio and a nice supporting cast, a brilliant script by José Giovanni - who has also written "le trou" the masterpièce of Becker the same year! What a year for him, a splendid black and white cinematography by Ghislain Cloquet. And tesa action, first-class directing by Claude Sautet, which surpasses Jean-Pierre Melville. While the second film of gangsters with metaphysical pretensions, which sometimes last more than two hours, Claude Sautet directs men of flesh and blood, and the presence of the two children adds moments of extraordinary intensity that Melville has never been able to generate . And Sautet avoids pathos, excessive sentimentality: the last time Ventura sees his children, getting off the subway (underground) is a peak of contained emotion. <br /> <br /> Ventura portrays a gangster whos When the film starts, it dies. He thinks he can count on his previous knowledge, but they are all cowards - we are far from the virile friendship dear to Jacques Becker ("touchez pas au grisbi") that Melville had to continue throughout the sixties - sometimes encouraged by bad women (the film noir misogyny par excellence), who live in a putrefied microcosm, ready to get informed - we are far from the simplistic behavior of Jean Seberg in the work "by Godard" -. <br /> <br /> Cloquet works wonders with the photo: the scene on the beach in a starless night when the two children see their mother die after the clash with the customs officers is absolutely mind-boggling. <br /> <br /> There is a good use of the voiceover, which Sautet uses only when needed, so the last few lines make the ending even stronger than if we witnessed the scenes. Claude Sautet had found a good niche, and he followed the rules of the "Classes tous Risques" quite well with his entourage "la arme à gauche" (1965) which saw Tura again and made good use of an island deserted and a ship. He had continued in that vein, France would have had a Howard Hawks. In his later works, only "Max et les ferrailleurs" (1971) showed something of brilliance he exhibited in the first half of the sixties. He had become, from "le choses de la vie" onwards, the director of quality cinema, which focused on a bourgeois with a tender heart in works such as "Cesar et Rosalie" (1972), "Vincent François, Paul et les autres "(1974) or" Mado "(1976)
