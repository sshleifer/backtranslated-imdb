Every high praise has fallen far before the height of this film. This film is the true example of what a psychological horror film should look like. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to be a little confusing at first glance, but surely it will explain a little what is happening and you would really like to see it for the second time. But after the second vision you will begin to join the pieces and then you will know how surprising a film can be. <br /> <br /> A tip for fans of the runaway movie will stay away from this movie. This is not your stupid teenage slasher film, where you just have to turn off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big b ** bs and lots of blood. <br /> <br /> If you want to increase the psychological horror factor of this movie and then watch it all by yourself with a great home theater system that supports Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1ch, without any of your rude friends making jokes on a really tense situation. And don't forget to turn off the light. <br /> <br /> My points on different aspects: - <br /> <br /> Direction = 9/10 Acting = 8/10 Atmosphere = 10/10 Sound Effect = 9/10 <br /> < br /> Total = 9/10
