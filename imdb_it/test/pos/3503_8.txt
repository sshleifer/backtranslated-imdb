Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Even though the film hardly reaches the quality of the TV show, it is still a lot of fun and has some really bad moments! I liked Ali G from the first time I saw the show material. I think he's one of the best characters in comedy of all time ... up there with Peter Dragon ("Action") and The Blues Brothers. The biggest surprise with this film was the presence of serious actors to do it (Dance and Gambon). After that, I will respect them even more, to have the good sense to take this opportunity. I have nothing negative to say about this film, it's very funny. Very youthful, but hey, so what? <br /> <br /> Another thing to do to Mr. G: SEQUEL, PLEASE! <br /> <br /> **** / *****
