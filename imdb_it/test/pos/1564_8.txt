A great performance by Emily Grace! I came across this film while browsing my satellite lists and was curious about the summary of the plot my satellite service provider gave me. I was very amused and I had a lot of compassion for the "Alice" character played by Emily Grace. History has led me to imagine what would have happened to Alice and was not predictable. The general story was refreshing and had great twists for the supporting characters. The ending of the story ended quite fairly. I will purchase this DVD to add to my library. I'm a new fan of Emily Grace and I expect a lot to see more from her performances.
