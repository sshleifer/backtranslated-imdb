I'm a fan of the action movie, but until now I've never seen a preview or commercial for this film in Italy, so I went to see "The Long Kiss Goodnight" on pay-TV hoping for nothing special. <br /> <br /> What a surprise! This movie is fantastic! The only problem I encountered is the presence of some holes in the plot, but the rest is the most fun, intriguing and fun action movie ever made. <br /> <br /> The transformation of Samantha / Charly from ordinary teacher-wife to the cold-blooded agent recovering from amnesia seems to be a good idea. Action scenes and stunts are the best I've ever seen. Samuel L. Jackson adds some of the best phrases he has ever heard and his chemistry with Geena Davis is good. <br /> <br /> And Geena? She is wonderful, plays the best action heroine ever seen and performs strongly, convincingly and fantastic stunts. <br /> <br /> So I think this film has had weak box office performances and bad criticism because most reviewers and some kind of audience have difficulties with strong female lead roles. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
