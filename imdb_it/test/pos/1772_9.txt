Sometimes it's hard to be a pirate ............... but fortunately Miss Jean Peters is having a great time trying - and she shows it, especially during her first friendly fencing spot with Blackbeard (Mr Thomas Gomez - eminently hissing) when the joy of performing is evident on his face. With fifty years of hindsight, feminists seem intent on grabbing this film as a kind of hymn to empower women in a male-dominated society, but I have serious doubts whether M.Tourneur or Miss Peters had any ideas head to the weather. It was an exciting and fun family movie, unpretentious, hidden meanings or alternative agenda. It was fun. M. Louis Jourdan is both captivating and treacherous as his love interest. Mr Herbert Chapman is wise and philosophical as the wise and philosophical doctor. James Robertson Justice is just a bit incredible like the bosun. But it is Miss Peters who remains in the memory. A skilled adolescent, illiterate, tough but vulnerable, wonderfully agile and, in the end, brave, it's everyone's idea of ​​a pirate lady. There was a definite window of opportunity for her in extravagant costume roles - which she didn't choose to take it on is a matter of regret.
