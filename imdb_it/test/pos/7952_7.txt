Korean "romanticism" about the owner of a camera shop diagnosed with a deadly disease. While doing his daily routine and getting ready to finish, he meets a girl who is a client. A friendship and a romanticism grows, but neither of them expresses any kind of affection for the other. The good movie is unlike anything you can see redone in America simply because the studies would insist that the "couple" act on their feelings. He will not say anything because he does not have much to live, he will not do it because it is not the thing that is made and he does not respond as he thinks he should. Of course, it's much more complex than what I'm doing and in all honesty it's the kind of thing you should find out for yourself. Is it a great movie? No, but it's a good thing that will move you emotionally. The final lines of the film haunt me again: "I have always known that love would vanish like a photograph, but you will remain in my heart as you are in my last moment. Thanks and goodbye" It may seem strange out of context but in the context of the film it is very moving.
