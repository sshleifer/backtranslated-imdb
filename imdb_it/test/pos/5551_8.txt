Lauren Himmel's debut film is well directed with a nice polished touch. There is a strong plot in progress with a significant point to all this even if in the end nothing is resolved, hence the name Treading Water. The plot revolves around a lesbian couple and their battle with the mother for acceptance. 7.5 / 10
