Although the concept of a 32-year-old woman portraying a 12-year-old girl might be a trait for today's sophisticated audience, this was what Mary Pickford fans wanted and expected from their favorite star in the 1920s. The opening scene shows the tomboy character of Annie as the apparent leader of a multi-ethnic street band in a comic "battle" with a rival group. The sight of a little girl being jawed and kicked can be a little vulgar, but the scene is so "Our Gang" interpreted that it would be difficult to take this situation seriously. However, Annie can emphasize and take it. Once Annie returns to her rented home and replaces her street cops with more feminine clothing, it becomes more difficult (especially in close-ups) to imagine this beautiful young woman as a street kid. However, for those who manage to collect the necessary suspension of disbelief, the rest of the film has its fruits. Staggering between the comedy (Annie's band puts on a show) to the feeling (Annie plans a birthday surprise for the Irish policeman father) to the tragedy (her father is killed on her birthday), the film offers Mary ample opportunities to show a range of emotions that would please his fans of every age. <br /> <br /> Obviously the necessary "happy ending" is finally achieved; the wicked are arrested with the help of Annie's friends and rivals and are seen for the last time in the company of his friends riding along a busy artery on a sunny day. Which is a good way to finish a Mary Pickford film. <br /> <br />
