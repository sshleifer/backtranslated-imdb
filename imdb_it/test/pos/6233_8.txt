After a group of young friends had problems with the car while traveling off the beaten track, they accepted an offer of help from the lonely local Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors), owner of a nearby museum full of historic wax mannequins. Once on the frightening attraction of the road, friends are chased by a masked madman who can bring the mannequins of the museum to life through the power of the mind. <br /> <br /> The Tourist Trap villain is a demented cross between The Texas Chain Saw Massacre's Leatherface and Anthony, the scary kid from the classic Twilight Zone episode "It's a Good Life", while the plot is a mixture of elements of the aforementioned TCM, Hitchcock's Psycho and House of Wax. The atmosphere and execution of Tourist Trap, however, is so totally out of place that, in this respect, it is practically impossible to make a comparison with other previous films. <br /> <br /> The treatment of David Schmoeller, continually inventive and unpredictable, of his script gives the film a decidedly nightmarish quality and with a brilliant interpretation on the left of Connors, an incredibly gruesome score by Pino Donaggio, a collection of really upsetting mannequins with detachable jaws, and the presence of the super sexy Tanya Roberts, who spends the film in (and briefly out of) tiny hot-pants in denim and a figure that hugs the asshole, Tourist Trap is an experience of absolutely unforgettable and ultimately unique horror that deserves its cult following.
