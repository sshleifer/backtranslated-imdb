Five years after collaborating with James Cagney on "The Public Enemy", Mae Clarke makes another appearance, this time as a girlfriend to Cagney's character on the other side of the law. It seems that you are calling more shots in their relationship, trying to make Johnny Cave a little more practical with his money and his career. You had to understand that they would come back together after giving him the boot to challenge his crooked boss; those things have a way of working in images. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching Cagney in this. I usually do it, and here it seemed that he could audition the characteristic shrug move he had successfully used in "Angels With Dirty Faces" playing Rocky Sullivan. It was immediately after he threw Cavanaugh (Robert Gleckler) out of his office during the first corruption attempt on the new head of Weights and Measures. He turns to the camera and freezes as if he were completely satisfied with his reply to the scammer - very nice. <br /> <br /> I understand that this was not one of the Cagney's Warner films, but it could very well have been. Warner has often taken the cause for the common man, and the display of crooked merchants and the politicians who protected them would be their own alley. You also have those fantastic New York street scenes that depict cars and shops from the era, with homemade signs that cost flour at eighteen cents a pound. Hey, how about the furniture store that sells the living room for a hundred and eighty-nine dollars, you could have a single chair for that price today. <br /> <br /> The best part of the photo could be just that meat counter scene where Cagney, James Burke (Aloysius) and the butchers play fishing with an underweight chicken. One of the lightest moments of the film, but you have an idea of ​​how tense people manage to get when they are caught cheating. The same goes for the truck driver who is under pressure from Johnny in signing for an accurate delivery; he wasn't used to it. <br /> <br /> All in all, a nice diversion from the presence of Cagney's more typical gangster, even if not up to his films. It's quite easy to get as one of the few Cagney images in the public domain out there, and it's often found in relatively inexpensive compilations.
