a very surprisingly underrated film. very realistic. and authentic. with great dialogue. being Italian, I can definitely relate to the situations and phrases used. I thought Joe Cortese was great. like a crazy cowboy guy, and even fish and Vincent were great. I liked the actor Criscuolo who played the leader. It was very authentic. I think director Ralph Devito was on the right track, but he was cut too early, perhaps because he knew too much. I thought it was great it deserved more listening and recognition. it was a sleeping film. great. very good. it really has a good authenticity. it was well done.
