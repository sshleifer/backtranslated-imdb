This is not particularly well written. The songs are not memorable. The cast, however, squeezes a lot from this Martin and Lewis in the Navy situation. Both look as big as young sailors. They are credible. The scenes on the submarine show how tight it must have been in those underwater missions in the 1950s and before. A lot of sailors in many scenes. Hundreds perhaps, in a large field of outdoor exercises, and again in a boxing arena. <br /> <br /> You will see James Dean in his scene. It stands out even if it's an extra here. In a scene where Jerry crosses a busy street we see some of his comedy "near accidents" that he would bring into play years later in The Patsy. <br /> <br /> Dean giving boxing instructions Jerry is a good comic skit to watch Jerry in the ring shows his great energy that was his trademark between the late 40s and early years 50. Dean and Jerry dancing is a bit of a surprise. Not great, but better than most non-dancing films. <br /> <br /> To see if you don't mind the black and white. Good ending. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
