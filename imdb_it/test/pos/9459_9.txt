Shes the man is great. it's fun, original and made me laugh so much that I almost wet my place. the day I went to see him in the cinema I was not in the best mood (woe to the man) but leaving the film I had a smile on my face. The story is a bit out there with the whole nobody noticing that it looks too much like a girl but hey who am I to say what is credible, the jokes are great and some of the unique pieces in this 2006 success could go down history. Amanda B. did a great job as a protagonist and Channing Tatum seems too good to be true as his opposite as the wonderful duke. So the girls go to see this because it's a good laugh and there's a hot guy and guys, go see it because you could learn something about the girls! <br /> <br /> All in all a fantastic, fantastic and fun movie that I will buy on DVD when it comes out.
