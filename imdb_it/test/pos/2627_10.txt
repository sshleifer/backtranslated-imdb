I never forgot this movie. All these years and remained in my life. I searched this film on many sites and stores. If someone reads it and has a copy, I'll pay you a copy or please let me know where to find it. This is a movie that should be a classic novel known as my other favorite, Somewhere in Time. It was really brilliant. If the right actors would do this movie and give it the patience it needs, to be the right acting, it could be an obstacle. A love story as powerful as this should be around for all lovers. I remember how sad I was in the end and it was really a shock. I believe with all my heart that Johnny really loved the woman and she loved him. This was an exceptional film and it is a pity that it is not available for us to purchase. Please contact me at shawe49@aol.com - I want to thank a wonderful lady who responded to my message almost a year later. She had a copy of the film and was kind enough to send it to me. You are a big fan of this film as I am. With his help, there were 3 happy women to receive these DVDs. "He's waiting for the book he's based on. I'm consulting my local library, entitled" Mrs Maitlands Affair "by Margarett Lynn. I'm sure it's great too. Many thanks to Julie for her kindness and friendship, I am always your friend, / Sharon
