I found this movie on one of my old videos, after "Godzilla vs the Sea Monster" (which should IMMEDIATELY give an idea of ​​its tone) and I haven't seen it for a while so I decided to watch it. I didn't remember much about Rainbow Brite, except that I liked the cartoon and it was nice. Most people think so. You probably will. <br /> <br /> Well, when the film started, I wondered if it was the right one! It didn't fit the Rainbow Brite mold as I remembered it. But it turns out he kicks! This must be the weirdest animated film EVER! I can't believe these characters were so popular (the series is not very different) despite being so bizarre. As soon as I saw this movie again, it became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> I really don't want to give too much. Just know that if you see the movie in the video store, let's rent it and watch it. No questions asked. You will get a kick. Above all the outrageous character of the Princess. And the robotic horse. And the hypnotized sprites. <br /> <br /> If you can't say for sure, this is a cartoon from the 80s that is really a "head" movie not hidden in disguise! Have a good time!
