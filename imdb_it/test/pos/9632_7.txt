Friend, I think people have forgotten how to watch a movie. Everyone thinks they're critical. They comment on things that the average movie-goer doesn't even know or don't think. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie. It was what I expected so I was not disappointed. Steven suffers a nasty shock for having included his opinions in his films, but this is also a reason to watch. What is even more fun are the people who complain about his films, they say he is the worst and we shouldn't watch his films, and still watch his films. Everyone can comment on how bad they are. Who is the dummy? If you don't like his job, don't watch it. So you won't have to go through this seemingly painful event. <br /> <br /> Stop comparing movies with other movies and watch a movie on an individual basis and you could start enjoying the movies again.
