Riding the success of "Rebel without a cause", a wave of "adolescent" films arrived. Probably this is one of the best. A very young McArthur excels here as a teenager not really too tormented. The story focuses more on the perception of delinquency than any traumatic event. The supporting cast is memorable, Frankenheimer directs like an old professional. Just a story of a young man who finds others taking his actions too seriously.
