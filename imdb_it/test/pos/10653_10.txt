the film touches very much the soul of the audience, some scenes from the film are definitive and tears come out automatically, I am surprised to see this film that every director can direct this type of film in the year 1925. a film student can say that film helps a lot to understand the use of editing. The first time our teacher told us about this film means genre of this film we thought there was nothing to understand in this film but in the end, when he explained it, we came to know how good this film is, I can to say that it helps movies a lot. And being a film student, I can see viewers who can watch this movie.
