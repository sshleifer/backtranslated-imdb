I can't comment on the accuracy of this production, historical or literary, but I can say that I liked it. If there is a God, the soundtrack will be released, Ilona Sekacz's work is really lasting. Twenty years later I am still moved by the disturbing themes of this production and I return often. <br /> <br /> History surrounds the entry into Catherine Moreland's company. A little awkward and in possession of an unhealthy interest in gothic stories (early pulp fiction?), Catherine goes down to Bath with Mrs Allen, where she meets Henry Tilney. She is invited to visit the Tilneys at Northanger Abbey, home of the formidable (and somewhat financially) General Tilney, who has the unfortunate misconception that there is wealth at hand. <br /> <br /> Where mutual attraction mingles with family finance, dispute is inevitable. This, combined with Catherine's vivid imagination, leads her to fear for her safety. His eventual departure is marked by accusations and accusations of deception and connivance. <br /> <br /> But the attraction between Catherine and Henry lies in these tests. Back to offer a happy ending. This final scene is particularly compelling, given Ilona Sekacz's incidental music. <br /> <br /> It could be a "bad" production from the point of view of purists, flamboyant costumes and shaky non-resistant performances, but for me it's 88 minutes of bliss.
