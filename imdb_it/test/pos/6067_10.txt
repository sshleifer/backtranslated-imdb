I have just seen the last episode, n. 32, (although the site says that only 30 episodes have been made) and I have to comment on the fact that this series was indeed very good and I will strongly recommend it to anyone who loves crime / police stories. Presumably all 32 were based on the fact with information at the end of each episode of court rulings imposed on the perpetrators of the crimes, this was sometimes a gritty, well acted, credible and dare I say, funny series. The fact that the powers in Denmark decided to dissolve the unit was almost unbelievable as they did their job so well and, at least in the series, they never failed to "conquer their man"! It's a definitive score for me.
