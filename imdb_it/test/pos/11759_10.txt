Homegrown is one of those movies that have gone through the cracks, but it deserves better. When I saw it for the first time, I had a warm reaction. But, over time, he's really grown up with me - no pun ;-). The more I see it, the more I appreciate it. Writing is top notch, as is acting. Throw a couple of amazing cameos and good direction, and finish with a great little movie. <br /> <br /> It is also nice to finally see Hank Azaria having the chance to shine in a leading role. And Thornton offers its usual quality performance. Even relatively newcomer Ryan Phillippe offers an innocent friendliness with wit and subtlety. <br /> <br /> On a side note, Homegrown is simply a "must see" if you are a Billy Bob Thornton fan. It seems that Stephen Gyllenhaal was influenced by previous Thornton projects such as One False Move and Sling Blade (although Homegrown is certainly much more ironic than either). And the role of Thornton as a character who is both sophisticated and down to earth is a perfect match for the actor.
