Seeing this show gives me respect for MTV, although I imagine MTV considers this random and edgy material to be its main strength and is much less interested in the relevant truths it expresses. <br /> <br /> I write and play music to live and this show really excites me. For me, Wondsershowzen serves a completely separate function from most TV. Instead of obfuscating or distracting the senses, (which can sometimes be really beautiful), it awakens my spirit of right and wrong. It makes me very uncomfortable, but in a very comforting way. <br /> <br /> I don't think that many viewers absorb most of the content of this show, but if they do, congratulations to TV viewers around the world.
