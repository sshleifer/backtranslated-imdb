I thought this movie was fun. I've never seen the old movies before and this was a really great movie. He had warmth, heart and spirit. It was a kind of cheese but in today's film industry, cheese is nice. I gave a ten and I highly recommend renting, buying or viewing the film anyway. Gene Kelly was very dreamy and a little sarcastic and you knew the character thought he would have everything. The female lead was perfect because their two personalities had a spark and you wanted to hold on and see what would happen. The grandmother in the film is priceless. The perfect addition to a great old movie. I love the fact that it was black and white and Gene Kelly is so sweet with all the kids in the movie that you can't help but like him. Watch it.
