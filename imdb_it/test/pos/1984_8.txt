WARNING: PLOT SPOILER <br /> <br /> David Cronenberg's always abnormal films are certainly an acquired taste. Fans of his previous films will probably like `eXistenZ ', but it certainly isn't for the squeamish. All the usual elements are here. A game capsule made of skin (attached to the back), buckets of blood, a gun made of bones and a manic mechanic to name just a few. The result is good in parts, bad in parts and simply normal in others. But one thing about the film is the undeniable originality. <br /> <br /> Despite the excessive use of ?? strangeness shows that virtual reality games can have a dangerous effect on some people. In the film, a character shoots someone dead claiming he was "boring" (assuming she was still in the game). But he leaves the question of whether this really happened or whether it was an event in this incredibly life-like game. `eXistenZ 'leads to a conclusion that can be answered in different ways. <br /> <br /> Despite some gadgets and extra gook, it was simply your classic "it was all a dream ?? or it was a breakthrough. It is a clever surprise and answers some questions, but giving a little disappointing was the entire film that he has brought up to this moment. He could have gone a little longer in just 97 minutes. In a particular way, the film raises moral questions, but responds in a violent and inappropriate way. <br /> < br /> Jennifer Jason Leigh appears here in her first big role in quite a while, but her character doesn't have enough quality to make her jump off the screen or even give her a nice character. On the other hand, Jude Law (equipped with a curious American accent) is as good as your average Joe sucked into this abnormal world. We see the film through its perspective. <br /> <br /> "eXistenZ" is far from impeccable but it is certainly a cinematic experience from remember.There are tons of strange features p to match the similar styles of David Lynch (what will happen?) Consumed with a question mark?!?!?!). Certainly it is not for everyone but it is quite rewarding to recommend. My IMDb rating: 6.2 / 10.
