And a difficult point somewhere else. I haven't seen this movie since I was young enough, maybe 12 or 13, who knows. But what I do know is that this is the film that taught me to masturbate. I'm not kidding. I have no idea if it's a good thing for any real standard today, but for me, at the time, that was all. <br /> <br /> The only reason I feel comfortable writing is because I'm sure no one can ever go around reading it. I mean, really, who's going to look for this movie these days? <br /> <br /> I have just found out that I have not yet run out of the minimum of ten lines for the amount of length I have taken in a review. I had no idea that there was a minimum length, but I go there, like a student trying to fill a page of a diary, my ten lines. Thanks a lot.
