Based to some extent on writers, David Croft and Jimmy Perry, personal experiences as animators of Butlins holiday camp in the UK during the same time period that the program follows, "Hi-De-Hi!" it embodied the "slap, postcard humor" of post-war Britain. Set in the fictional seaside town of Crimpton-on-Sea, "Hi-De-Hi" tells the story of comedies in the Maplins Holiday Camp - one of many scattered along the British coast owned by the mega-rich, but never seen ( on screen) Joe Maplin. <br /> <br /> Although the actual show began in 1980 with the pilot episode and worked until 1988, when the BBC considered it too docile for its avant-garde comedy department, seasons 1 -5 focused on 1959, while seasons 6-9 brought to light the 1960s - an era in which the old-fashioned British Holiday Camp began to decline: during the first 5 seasons, Jeffrey Fairbrother (brilliantly played from late , great Simon Cadell) was the camp's entertainment manager, a well-intentioned but somewhat thoughtful former university professor who got rid of his upper class background and ventured into the "real" world to direct his team of animators who they were in stark contrast to his relaxed personality. From the sea No. 6 onwards, Fairbrother was replaced by Clive Dempster (played by David Griffin when Cadell left the show at the height of his popularity), a former RAF hero who, in many ways, was similar to the Cadell character in background, but more a villain than a gentleman. <br /> <br /> However, the real "Hi-De-Hi" stars in the nine seasons were Ted Bovis (superbly played by Paul Shane), a stereotypical working class, ale drinking, obscene comedian - someone who couldn't never resist the opportunity to cheat campers; Gladys Pugh (played by Ruth Madoc who is experiencing a career return with appearances in the BBC comedy, "Little Britain"), the chief Yellowcoat (which the animation staff has been called for its bright yellow jackets) and the sports organizer - but above all, the only person who saved Jeffrey Fairbrother and Clive Dempster from embarrassment by covering their inexperience in running a holiday camp; Peggy Ollerenshaw (Su Pollard), the rude waitress, a little tired but at the same time amiable, with the ardent ambition of becoming a Yellowcoat, and Spike Dixon (Jeffrey Holland), Ted's innocent protégé who studies more on " show "than he hoped. /> <br /> As usual with a Croft & Perry production, the cast of characters gathered was a group of misfits superbly interpreted by the actors involved. Mr. Partridge (played by the late Leslie Dwyer, who was 70 when he left the show), the alcoholic entertainer for children who hated children; Fred Quilly (Felix Bowness), former jockey champion with a past doubt; Yvonne & Barry Stuart-Hargreaves (Dianne Holland & Barry Howard), the former snob dancing champions who were in the twilight of their careers; and Sylvia and Betty (Nikki Kelly and Rikki Howard), the two main Yellowcoat girls who were always looking for the kind of fun that Joe Maplin would never have allowed in one of his fields. <br /> <br /> "Hi-De-Ciao" characterized the slapstick era of the late 1950s with its jaunty humor and, to some extent, vulgar "iron-ironic" (the jokes about people sitting in the bathroom and anecdotes about "women with big blows" were the order of the day). But despite being the breath of the "Carry On" funeral, he was always so innocent and became something recommended for the vision of the family in the 1980s. Of course, critics of the show have remarked that the show had been passed for two years, but I disagree. While the early seasons focused mainly on bawdiness and slapstick humor, this latest "Hi-De-Hi" series saw more thought inserted into the scripts and the main characters (especially Spike Dixon and Gladys Pugh) were able to grow with a more sensitive story Lines. That said, there have been some criticisms of the show. Clive Dempster wasn't Jeffrey Fairbrother, and the first one didn't really have the chemistry on the screen with Gladys like Jeffrey (personally I think it would have been more credible if Gladys had married Jeff); five seasons dedicated to 1959 and four to 1960 caused not only a few errors of continuity (the disappearance of old faces and the introduction of new characters were not correctly explained, especially with the jacket men who came and went very regularly and the character of Gladys Pugh, who in the pilot episode turned out to be a man-loving eater of freedom who suddenly turned into a naive virgin as a character! Also, to put it quite pedantically, most of the Christmas 1959 was covered in the first season, so extending the rest of the year into five other series was something really incredible, but the show was not to be considered meticulously, and the comedy more than made up for its shortcomings. <br /> < br /> All in all, "Hi-De-Hi" was probably one of the last comedies of the BBC's golden age, and although it never managed to co mpeter with these British comic pillars like "Only Fools & Horses", "Porridge" or even "Last" Of The Summer Wine "," Hi De Hi "will be bes I remembered as a comedy for the whole family. If you haven't already checked it by yourself, I beg you to do it.
