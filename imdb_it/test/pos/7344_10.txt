Now maybe it had something to do with the fact that I saw this movie at a low point in my life, when I was really trying to figure out where I was going and what I needed to make me happy, but this movie was really about me. Jane is a respectable woman: although she has many positive things for her, she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life. She is strong and intelligent, but has been betrayed by realizing her potential from an unfortunate accident and is experiencing a second life choice. Look for new challenges and happiness, trying desperately to fill the hole in his heart. Dreya Weber is an exquisite Jane. As we travel with her we feel the depth of her despair, the torture of her despair and, in the end, the strength of her conviction. Even the beautiful Addie Yungmee is very well designed and a resource for production. Allison Mackie is a scene thief like a perky character with impeccable timing. I highly recommend this film; although it is low budget, it has a large writing budget and production values. PS: great aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women. Women will love the story and the characters, but there is also something for men here. :)
