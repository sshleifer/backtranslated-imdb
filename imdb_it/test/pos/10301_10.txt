This film is based primarily on people's emotions and interactions. There are only three places (the school, the shop and the coach's house) that are really used. He is mainly at the coach's home, however. A film does not need special effects or surprising views to be extraordinary in itself. <br /> <br /> Four friends meet during their basketball days. One is rich, important and has no real love outside of money. One wants to be mayor again, but his competition is making him angry. One wants to be superintendent of the school and take care of his family. One is an alcoholic on the go. <br /> <br /> First of all, I love the actors in this movie. They were all familiar names for me. They have proved their worth here. <br /> <br /> One of the most crucial moments is when Tom, played by Gary Sinise, blows up the coach. He screams and complains about how the coach betrayed the winning game. His coach whistle and shouts his sentences: "Forgive me, Father, because I have sinned!" It's incredible to look at, with an energy that will chill you. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended to anyone who understands human emotions and does not need brilliant effects to interest them.
