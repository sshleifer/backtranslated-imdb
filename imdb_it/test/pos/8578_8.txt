I love this movie. There is something for everyone. It's funny, sad, passionate and dramatic. The mixture of two completely different cultures creates a completely new world to which the viewer cannot help but want to be part of. I have to admit that I am a bit biased, since Colin Firth is my favorite actor and therefore has nothing to do with my eyes (!), But in this film his incredible acting talent is evident and he is promoted even more by the beautiful recitation of his co-star Nia Long. The problems that their love affair suffers make it, ironically, more credible and the simple features like the contrast between the colors of Matthew and Nimi's clothes, make this film even more enchanting. I challenge anyone who cannot be moved by this story. I find it lovely and I've seen it at least ten times since I bought the movie a week ago!
