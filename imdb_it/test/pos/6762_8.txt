This is a novelty in the Danish film. The mood is no different from that of Blinkende Lygter, also by Anders Thomas Jensen, but with a new twist. A difference is represented by a smaller number of characters, leaving much more space inside them. And what characters? The two butchers are perfect. Mads Mikkelsen is a dominated and unbalanced parody and Nikolaj Lie Kaas is an indifferent loser with a twin brother more or less a tireless coupling of the two.
