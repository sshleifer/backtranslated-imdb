I can't see how a film of this quality gets only an average of 5.7 votes from IMDb voters. It is a classic Australian production that resembles recent efforts such as LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHS, THE SUGAR FACTORY, OCCASIONAL BIG LANGUAGE, RUSSIAN GIRL, SAMPLE PEOPLE, THE SECRET LIFE OF THE UNITED STATES, THE SPANISH, THE STRANGE PLANET, THE FRESH AIR , THE DUST IN THE WINGS, TO MAKE TIME FOR PATSY CLINE, etc ..., as a 19-year university student (Newton, perhaps his best role yet, on par with CHANGI at least) with a bored and too religious mother gets the shock of his life when he decides to enroll in the same course as him - and before going to think of ANOTHER GOOFY FILM, it is not true, here is a real substance. Of course, it's a simplistic view of life in general and of art students in particular (but then they are rather simplistic under all those philosophical mumbo-jumbo, aren't they?), And maybe the study of Sinead Cusack's character is a bit confusing sometimes, but the film is brilliant, fun and has some important messages. The main cast is terrifying: Cusack and Newton are wonderful, and Rose Byrne (we also see her in THE GODDESS OF 1967) is so underrated that it's not funny. He is a handsome, fresh and confident actor who deserves every recognition he receives. I gave MY MOTHER FRANK 8/10.
