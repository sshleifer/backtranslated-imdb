Wolfgang Peterson directs this thriller that sees Clint Eastwood play secret agent Frank Horrigan, who combines intelligence with an intelligent psychopath (John Malkovich) in a cat and mouse game that involves the protection of the president. Mitch Leary (Malkovich) keeps in touch with Horrigan by making fun of the agent with discouraging comments about his abilities, as well as the protection of presidents in the past from secret services. Agent Lilly Raines (Rene Russo) tries to keep Horrigan on the ground; but it is strong in stopping Leary from making his assassination threats. Very good FX and fast pace support the plot. Eastwood and Malkovich are superb. Russo has a way to get your attention. Completing this cast are: Dylan McDermott, Fred Dalton Thompson, John Mahoney and Gary Cole.
