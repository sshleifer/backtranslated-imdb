For me, dolemite is an object of my deepest affection. He has everything: a band of prostitutes fighting karate, Dolemite punching his fist through the stomach of Willie Green (director Martin), tall pumps and 100 gallon Dalmatian hats. Moore's extraordinary comedies, actually toasts, are close to the roots of hip hop. No wonder Dr. Dre mentioned "Dolemite" 3 times on his album "The Chronic". Add the best list of characters that could ever embellish a film, such as the horny preacher, the burger pimp and, of course, "the one nobody knows until now". The credit should be given to director D'Urville Martin, a guy who probably doesn't get all the attention he should in movie fan circles (I searched for a copy of his films and Fred Williamson's from the early 70s and not I can find them. <br /> <br /> A lot of people are really down in this movie and they say it's really bad, and it's true that you can see the microphones that appear everywhere (see The pd Nicholas Josef Von Sternberg, for which I think was an effort very soon, there are many things for this movie, number one, there is no other film like this, number two, you can see Rudy Ray Moore making a (highly sanitized, anyone who has never seen the outrageous act of Moore will have to use their imagination) the film version of his toasts, the more he who lives the life of his superpimp comic character come to light.The action scenes are pretty bad, but the dialogues of the characters when speaks no rubbish are more than compensating. Is it full of strange little details (like the fact that the Hamburger Pimp wears a Dolemite shirt inside) was it intentional or did the guy just take his shirt out on the set and put it on? yet. <br /> <br /> At least I have. <br /> <br />
