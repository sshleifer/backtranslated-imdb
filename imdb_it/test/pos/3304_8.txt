Funny bad movie that should have fun. One of the latest interpretations of Joan Crawford as a successful editor guided against all those young and eager beavers eager to leave the elite Seven Sister Colleges. Great New 50s atmosphere. Splendid period costumes and hairstyles. Fantastic art direction. Trivial story, but tear-jerky. Interesting cameo by Robert Evans as a rich cad.
