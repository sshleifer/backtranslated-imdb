I have to admit, at first I was worried about Farscape. The opening segment wasn't very strong, and I started to worry about what was going to happen. However, once set in the familiar Henson territory with the ironic sense of humor, the unique and enduring characters, and the compelling story combined to create an excellent piece of science fiction. The story follows John Crichton (played by Ben Browder) a scientist who developed a spaceship and a theory based on sling propulsion. However, during the first test, his boat encounters an unknown magnetic field, and he is pushed into an unknown galaxy, where he is in the middle of a fight between the fleeing prisoners (on the starship Moya) and the Peacekeepers (human performers) . He is literally attracted to the prisoners' ship, and after many twists and turns he is joined to the prisoners (Ka D'argo, a Luxom warrior, Pa'U Zhaan, a disappointed priestess, Rygel XVI, a deposed leader and Aeryn Sun, a Peacekeeper who reluctantly joined the crew). With excellent special effects, moderate make-up and puppets and robots that exceed the Henson standard of perfection; as well as a well-written plot and a character-driven plot, FarScape seems to be an extraordinarily original, creative and intelligent science fiction series.
