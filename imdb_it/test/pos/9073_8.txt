The flatliner left an obvious impression on my head. The plot is fast and leaves you constantly absorbed and often very tense. There are about five extraordinary doctoral students (in particular Julia Roberts and Kevin Bacon) among whom, one of them has devised the mechanism of remaining dead (or being flattened) for a few seconds and then returning to life. <br /> <br /> The procedure is quite "complex" involving a plethora of medical junk - injections, electric blankets, oxygen masks and a variety of esoteric medical terms. I strongly suspect that doctors have coined all these words so that they should never be fired. But strangely they follow the KISS (original version for the engineers: Keep It Simple, stupid) (the extended version for the doctors: Keep it Stupid, Simple). With the risk of being suppressed by an avenging doctor reader, let me continue. <br /> <br /> So the first one who gets flat hopes to find the answers to life that philosophy and religion cannot answer convincingly. He hopes to get an answer (and become famous) through applied science. He has a flat line for about two minutes and then comes back to our world left quite shaken. During his death, he had a vision of an accident, when he was young, which left the strongest impression on his life. He killed another boy when he was a child, by mistake, and still feels responsible for this. <br /> <br /> With the success of the first flat-liner, others follow suit each by extending their flat line time again and again to test the limits of how long you can stay dead and experience life after death. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, monsters of the past and the future, keep coming back to haunt them after their flat line experience. The first flat-liner is infested by a boy who tortures him when he is alone. The second one who photographed all the women she brought to bed, sees the televisions playing her videos. The third is haunted by a girl who has been teasing at school. The fourth is persecuted by his dead suicidal father, for whom he feels responsible. <br /> <br /> Everyone is crazy about these obsessions and obsessions and they think that the past seems to want to take revenge on them. The main objective is to get a flat line is that your whole life goes through your eyes, at the moment of 'dying', whatever stage it is, and you are left with the strongest impressions of your mind. Since they are not dead, these strong impressions have somehow resurfaced and become the focus of their lives. <br /> <br /> Everyone somehow came to terms with (and have extinguished) their past demons. Everyone except the first who realizes that the only way he can go through life is becoming flat again. During this flat line session, he sees himself getting dressed for the first time and also sees the boy he killed, trying to kill him this time. The boy kills him this time for a few minutes and in doing so he sought revenge. For a few minutes in the film one remains to wonder if he will come back. Fortunately (because most of us have a happy ending), the boy absolves him from his past and returns to life.
