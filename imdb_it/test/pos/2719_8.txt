I thought I was wasting my precious 50 bucks going to see this movie. But at the sincere request of my friend who is a passionate fan of Aparna Sen, I decided to introduce myself for the film. Going to this inexpensive theater really annoyed me, because I had seen King Kong for 50 dollars in one of the best theaters in the city. In any case the film starts and surprisingly I don't complain. <br /> <br /> A beautiful story and some wonderful wonderful recitations for Shabana Azmi and Konkona Sen Sharma. Shabana Azmi is a divorcee who has dedicated her life to the welfare of her mother and half-sister. Konkona Sen Sharma is schizophrenic (spare me the spelling), which always imagines everything. Rahul Bose also gives a stellar performance. <br /> <br /> The story is that Mithi (Sen Sharma) is schizophrenic, and after being brutally raped in his field work as a reporter, his levels really increase, the girlfriend leaves the girl, for the person who became. Throughout his world he descends on her. Shabana Azmi, her older half-sister, takes care of her, and Mithi in her imagination believes she has been married to his girlfriend, has 5 children and they stop at 15th Park Avenue (which is really a place in New York). The plot continues as Mithi becomes suicidal, since he believes that no one believes her and is held captive in her home by her husband. As fate would have it, Mithi and his girlfriend meet when both are out on a trip. 11 years after the brutal rape, his girlfriend has no existence in her real world, she can't recognize him. His fianc√©e, now married and father of two, feels that it is his duty to correct the wrong he did 11 years earlier and promises to take her to Park Avenue. and does it. He takes her to a place in Kolkata that seems to be her husband's home. Like Joydeep / Jojo (Rahul Bose), his girlfriend is talking on a cell phone, he loses the track of Mithi. Everyone comes looking for her, but she is nowhere to be found. In the end she gets what she was denied, her family, her own imaginative family in her world at 15 Park Avenue. <br /> <br /> I must say that it touched my heart. I myself am now a fan of the direction of Aparna Sen. The camera work is exceptional. And the quality of the services is the limit of the spells. Konkona Sen Sharma offers a solid performance as a schizophrenic child. Shabana Azmi has another mind-boggling role as her divorced elder sister, whose job is to support her family. Rahul Bose, another clean and quiet role (I don't know why this guy doesn't get big breaks, he has so much potential). Finally Aparna Sen, continues to conquer the public, even if it is not in front of the camera and behind it. <br /> <br /> A well deserved 8/10 ....
