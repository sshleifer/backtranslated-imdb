Ok, I don't agree with the past comments that criticized this show. I think that this show is fantastic. (I mean when Jasmin Weber was still up and Franzi was still alive, so compelling!). And I was surprised to learn that this was classified as a soap because it simply does not look and taste like soap in America. The soaps here are absolutely horrible! At least GZSZ movies in place, featuring real music and more plausible story lines. Furthermore, the acting on GZSZ, for the most part, is quite credible especially with Josephine Schmidt and Felix Jascheroff. (Furthermore, soap actors are some of the toughest workers in the industry as they have the most demanding working hours). If the evaluations are so high, he must do something right; soaps in America are shown during the day and, historically, have always had basic evaluations. Give GZSZ a chance! Trust me, it's good!
