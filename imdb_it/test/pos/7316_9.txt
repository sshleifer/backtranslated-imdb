The favorite trio of bizarre idiots go wild in a hospital in this incredibly fun and often hysterically fun game. These guys are undoubtedly the only group of incompetent doctors who manage to make their way across the screen. The highlights of the comic include the Stooges who constantly break a glass plate in a door, their meeting with a deranged patient who claims that the rats came out of the buttonhole of his shirt, the Stooges crossing the corridors on a giant bicycle, a huge horse, and miniature racing cars, and our sublimely stupid trio who accidentally leave the instruments inside the abdomen of an unfortunate patient after they have finished working with the poor boy. Director Ray McCarey reports the frantic comic scams at an appropriate frenetic pace and stages the slapstick gags with remarkable enthusiasm. Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Curly Howard are all in excellent cyclical form, with support from Dell Henderson as supervisor of the Dr. Graves hospital, the shrill voice of Jeanie Roberts as a sobbing nurse (the scene in which the Stooges make a "Absurd, the makeshift singalong group with this girl is absolutely lined up!", Ruth Hiatt as a whispering nurse, Billy Gilbert as the mad mad patient, and "Little Billy" Rhodes as a tiny, exuberant patient. The witty madness never gives up for a minute, making this wonderfully crazy little girl one of the best releases of Stooges.
