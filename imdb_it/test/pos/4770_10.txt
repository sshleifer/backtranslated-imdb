The first fully synchronized sound comic, Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, makes its big screen debut in the extremely fun short film "Steamboat Willie". Mickey is a worker on a steamboat under the supervision of Captain Peg Leg Pete (or Pete as he would later be called). Mickey Mouse goes on board his longtime companion Minnie Mouse while they play, while Mickey tries to impress Minnie. This short was wildly fun and positively fun. Animators Ubbe Iwerks, Rudolph Ising and Hugh Harman assisted Walt in creating the short "Steamboat Willie" essentially marks the beginning of the Walt Disney Company's success.
