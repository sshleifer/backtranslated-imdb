I liked this for a couple of reasons. The emotional tangle was sometimes confused and resolved imperfectly, but the mixture of newsreel footage with the narrative of the film was often compelling. The other element that I appreciated is the depiction of werewolves, the Nazi fanatics who continued to fight after the formal surrender. I don't know another film that deals with them. The Burgomaster Oppenhoff of Aachen was killed on Palm Sunday in 1945, for example, and created problems for the occupation. The film therefore challenges the sterilized version of victory and occupation with some gritty realities. The "human questions" are presented not so much through the characters here, but through the historical reality that gripped those who had survived Hitler - both conquered and winners.
