This is not a film, it is an intelligent, witty and often touching film. It's a retrospective of a failed relationship between Michael Connor (Michael Leydon Campbell) and his alien Irish girl Grace Mckenna. Michael, unlucky, decides to make a documentary to review his whole report and what went wrong. He uses his friendship with an actor he met in the gym Nadia (Nadia Dajani) who plays Grace. The concept of this film is very original. The relationship of Michaels is shown from every point, whether it is high or low. Michael Leydon Campbell brings out a fantastic performance that makes you want to help him find Grace. If in fact most of the characters pull out great performances except the puzzle. The puzzle is necessary to move the plot along but it seems too surreal to exist in a coffee shop. His monologues are often distorted and useless. This is proved when he says "Out of this chaos, we are all trying to create order and out of order, in the sense, but in reality there is no meaning." Something makes sense only if we can make it meaningful. "<br /> <br /> The comment saves this film. The comment is made in vain by This is Spinal Tap and Michael and his brother explain the problems they had during the making of the film. Michael offers a very self-conscious comment. fun that makes some belly laughs. <br /> <br /> In general I would give this movie a 7/10.
