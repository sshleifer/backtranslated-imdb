Before reviewing this film, I have to make a confession which is rather a bold statement to make as a film reviewer. Anyone who has already read one of my previous reviews might know that I have always been controversial in a broad sense, giving my best for flops such as "Captain America" ​​and "Creatures" from 1985 and showing fashion shows like Alistar Sim A Christmas Carol "and" Shakespeare in Love ". With this in mind, this confession might not be a surprise: <br /> <br /> The simple fact is that Christopher Lambert is probably one of my favorite actors. Woah, now, don't start going crazy for me yet. Let me explain: I don't think he's the greatest actor in the world at all. I clearly confess that it is not. Certainly it is not Morgan Freeman or Anthony Hopkins, but I would say that his acting ability is probably somewhere up there with at least Bruce Willis. What I admire about him, however, are the human qualities he brings to his action heroes. It's just an average guy who laughs, cries and bleeds, who is a hero because he has to be, not necessarily because he wants to be. It takes a lot, in my opinion, to be able to bring out those qualities in a character (especially in the films in which he worked), and Lambert's heroes are far from those of Schwartzennegger or Stallone. Frankly, Lambert's characters are easier to interpret for me. Therefore, he is not the greatest actor in the world .... He is only a personal favorite. <br /> <br /> I can't say the same, however, about his films. As much as I approve his acting, it would be foolish not to confess that his choice of films leaves something to be desired. Most of them are, frankly, terrible, and any derision he has had over the years is not due to his acting, but rather to his bad choice in scripts. <br /> <br /> With this in mind, I can say that his debut film, "Tarzan", is one of his best films and probably his biggest performance. As I have already said, it is effective by virtue of the humor that leads to the role, and however seriously the director, writers and actors treat the material. This is a nice leap from the action adventures of the B movie with Johnny Weismeller from the 1940s. In fact, I would hesitate to call it an action movie. Instead, it is a serious drama that takes all of E.R.'s material seriously. Burrough, showing Tarzan's quest to discover his true family in Scotland after realizing that it does not fit like a "white monkey". He is divided between his old family and his new one, which includes a wonderful Sir Ralph Richardson in his final role. In an attempt to adapt to humans, even his monkey instincts go into action, and he can't decide what he loves most: his real family, or the one he has always known. All in all, it's a wonderful commentary on society, and a wonderful study of the character. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, he launched Lambert into international celebrity, which continued into the 80s with films like "Highlander" and "he Sicilian." Unfortunately, it didn't last. But wait just a moment ... His latest career moves like "Gideon" and "Resurrection" have shown that although he still has a long way to go, he is competent enough to be able to ... ahem .... comeback if you will choose your roles better. <br /> <br /> For now, however, here is the verdict of his first film: <br /> <br /> *** on ****
