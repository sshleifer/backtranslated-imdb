I loved this movie so much. I'm a big fan of the recently concluded show of Amanda Bynes. I admire her (in addition to her body) for her ability to act. She is a good actress. <br /> <br /> The film was great. It's about a girl named Viola who wants to play soccer, but when her school cuts the girls' soccer team she gets angry. His brother is ready to go to a prestigious school and decides to leave for England. So Viola wants to make an impression by playing on the college football team. She goes to school and tries the soccer team. Come in. Meanwhile he meets Duke, a sensitive boy who plays on the soccer team. He really likes Olivia (Laura Ramsey) who likes Sebastian, who is really purple. Sebastian is dating Monique and suspects that Sebastian is not himself. <br /> <br /> This is certainly NOT a hit movie and I really enjoyed it. It's so funny and lovable. I don't think I saw AManda doing better.
