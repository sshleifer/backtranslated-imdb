I must confess that I slept in the cinema while watching Asterix's first film ... but this is simply FANTASTIC! It's really fun and leaves the first ones miles away. It has enumerated gags and funny situations that have made me laugh since the first minutes of the film and I stopped laughing only when I reached the car to go home. I repeat: this film is spectacular ... Obelix is ​​really funny and Cleopatra is a real girl !!
