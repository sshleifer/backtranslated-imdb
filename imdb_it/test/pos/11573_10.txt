This is probably the best film shot for at least the last five years. I have always believed that making people cry was much more difficult than making them laugh. If you want to see 400 adults shouting aloud in the same room, go see this movie. It's breathtaking. Javier Bardem plays the role of his life. You will cry, you will laugh, you will smile ... The most worthy fact is that in Spain everyone knows Ramon Sampedro. Personally I knew the complete story and also the end of it. Thus, the excellence of the film is in the way the story is told. And in this field, Amenabar is a THE master. <br /> <br /> This film is a MUST.
