I hope we will never become cynical as a society to appreciate the simple beauty of this film: Nice to see with its romantic English countryside, and beautiful in its message of faith and loyalty. Watch this with your children, especially your little daughters - Velvet Brown is a wonderful model for girls. This was one of my daughter's favorite movies. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a best-seller by Enid Bagnold about a girl, Velvet, whose whole life is her horse, Pi, and her unique mind searching for her "impossible" dream. I will not say anything more about the plot, the less I will ruin it for the first time. He lives with a large, loving family in a small coastal village. <br /> <br /> This is the film that made Elizabeth Taylor a star, and to watch the film is to understand why. She is a natural actress who radiates an inner beauty that marries her external beauty - confident, passionate, innocent - is the emotional core of the film. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney gives a wonderful performance like Mi, the young man who comes to their house one day, stays, and helps Velvet train Pi. This is one of his best performances. Anne Revere also stands out as the mother of Velvet in an Oscar role. His strong, loving and wise character understands that life does not have much value if you do not follow your dreams: "We are the same, I also believe that everyone should have a chance in a piece of breathtaking madness once in their life" /> <br /> I heartily recommend this sweet, very inspiring classic of the golden age of Hollywood.
