I imagine that Melville intended this film as the definition of beauty; has the fresh approach of the late 60s / early 70s thrillers, the same discrete bizarre. LE CERCLE ROUGE, a bitter and fatalistic story, is also the playing field of Delon, Bourvil, Volonté and Montand in defining roles. <br /> <br /> Bourvil is a policeman who has three cats and a daily routine in his apartment. Delon is a hooligan. Montand is a sick and failed cop. Volonté interprets an escaped suspicion. LE CERCLE ROUGE is obviously far above a robbery film; Melville uses his techniques ?? long detailed descriptions without words of each step of the robbery, etc. However is this particular action drama much better than his other films ?? and it is very unlikely that they are much better. The appearance of LE CERCLE ROUGE is very particular for Melville, very Melvillian. <br /> <br /> Delon was sharp and cool; Bourvil brings his art and Montand perhaps plays the most beautiful role in this film; his performance has an unexpected warmth. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the characters are barely sketched, no longer strictly necessary, and are personages. Or masks; however the portrait is inspired, economic but suggestive. <br /> <br /> Another of the films that shows that Delon is a good, a great actor; and the fact that he is not a genius does not imply that he should be despised as a fourth-rate actor. He's good, he can stand the proximity of a Bourvil and Montand. <br /> <br /> Only ten years. before LE CERCLE ROUGE, Melville was doing, in the late 1950s, a very boring and insipid black noir mess (starring himself) and after only a decade, here he is, in full form, with this drama of action enough amazing. Stylistically, it's a success. <br /> <br /> Before seeing LE CERCLE ROUGE, I was not a Melvillian fan; now I suppose I'm rather one. <br /> <br /> LE CERCLE ROUGE is a drama, or action drama, one of the most demanding genres. Melville marks.
