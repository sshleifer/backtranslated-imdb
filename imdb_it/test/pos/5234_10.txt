I never expected a film so old to be as impressive as this 1930s western turned out to be. The scenes of the pioneers headed west in their covered wagons, which encounter storms and mud, river crossings, Indian attacks and all sorts of trials and dangers, are surprising in their bitter credibility. Much of the film was shot outdoors, and the film has a truly epic feel about it. The actors must have experienced the same conditions as the original pioneers and the results are astounding. The wagons, the clothes, every single detail appear and feel good. The characters are simple but credible, with a simple story that travels like the train car to its destination. <br /> <br /> John Wayne is thin and young in one of his first roles, like the scout who drives the wagons, and does a great job as the young frontier idealist. He clashes with a terrifying reef of criminals, including Ian Keith in the role of a gambler, Charles Stevens as a Mexican helper and Tyrone Power, Senior, as the trapper more and more like a bear. The bearded, snarling, larger portrait of Power's life is both comic and threatening. I continue to imagine him with a bandana, a gold ring earring and a black bandage, with a parrot on his shoulder, while grunting and growling various threats and insults. His character could easily be transferred to a pirate ship without any difficulty. Almost steals the whole picture. <br /> <br /> Tully Marshall is delightful as an old and shrewd frontier rider who is Wayne's best friend. The adorable Marguerite Churchill is a lively heroine, whose initial encounter with Wayne is an exhilarating mix-up, which translates into a long-standing courtship of insults and feigned indifference on her part, to trouble perseverance towards her . The results are rather amusing and one is pleased to see them finally reunite at the end. <br /> <br /> The scenery is amazing, with the wagons crossing real prairies and having to be lowered by ropes that descend downwards. Indians who are clearly the original article, and not white actors in makeup, appear as friends and enemies and are treated with dignity. Wayne's character tells a group of young admirers that the Indians are his friends, who have taught him everything he knows about desert survival. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail is a story without complications told by a talented cast and crew. It will probably seem naive to many modern viewers, but there is a decent dignity that never makes it trivial. There is a lot of intentional humor, including a mischievous pioneer scoundrel who makes noisy animal noises whenever the playful Ian Keith tries to convince the beautiful heroine to marry him. His flowery speeches on the plantation that he presumably owns are interrupted by very realistic imitations of howling and dying cat cats, making the seducer look around annoyed by the invisible creatures. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended, both for Western fans and fans of old movies in general. This is truly a classic film for the ages.
