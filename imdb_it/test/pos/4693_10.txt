This HTV series is beautiful. I highly recommend watching the movie. It has everything it should: extraordinary script, strong characters, wonderful landscapes and exceptional atmosphere. Add an environmental rating from Clannad and receive an unforgettable image. I love every HTV adventure movie I've seen: Return To Treasure Island, smuggler, adventurer, but Robin of Sherwood beats them all. I would like to thank the whole HTV and Richard Carpenter production team in particular for giving me a lot of adventures and excitement. I got the DVD release in my little movie collection. I am very sorry that films like these are no longer made.
