I'm a fan of the class B movies of the 80s where the hero is a bit naughty, a strong male, who finds love - and this movie offers! <br /> <br /> Towards the finish line you don't know how Sharky won't be killed (and he doesn't take a joke! Realistically portrayed I think). However it does and it is not through an exaggerated "Die Hard" acrobatics. The "past" team he works with works together, hence the title. His team are all characters - people at the sidelines at work because they don't adapt. These portraits are nice and understanding - they have a real feeling for them. I am in front of a man who came from the ice of a murderer, with a good team of his own. The result is a great film noir.
