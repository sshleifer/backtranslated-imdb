I loved this movie! It has a big heart and big bones. I came across by chance and I didn't have any memories, not even a hint, of this movie from promo or reviews or word of mouth. I remember reading, many years ago, a journalist who commented on the value of watching movies without having contaminated them by the pre-judgment of the reviews or by the false advertising of the promos. And this seems to be the most common source of the criticism's negative reaction to the film: it failed to meet the expectations of being a comedy, a slice of life or a driven character. I had no expectations for the film, so it was comical - but I only laughed once or twice - without being a comedy; he spoke of a person, but he was so eccentric that he was not a slice of life; it was a character, but the character was so cleverly optimistic and confident of his instinct for life, that it was not the sentimental melodrama driven to the anguish typical of the "serious" American film - as I wrote that I realized that writer / director Lisa Krueger has managed to make fun of this American sentimentalism in her husband's schlock! And also very cleverly! And Kreuger managed to keep the ending cloyingly sentimental from the screen, when the rebellious, not prodigal, returned with his tail reduced between his legs. Bravo, Mrs. Krueger, bravo! (Now I'm going to watch this movie again, as it is getting better and better over and over again.) <br /> <br /> Graham's performance as Joline is brilliant. I loved how subtly but completely she was able to portray and convey the intelligent awareness of her commissary commitment to honor her words and actions - she knew that by keeping her word with a band, or friends, or husband that she was putting on in ridicule and / or disappointment in a world that was unable to honor the commitment as she was able to do. But even with that strength, she was completely connected with humanity and embraced their frailty and failures with a fully committed heart. Joline's character was incredibly well played, and I left the film surprised that I had no recollection of nominations for this. Ok, he's not that surprised, since the American prizes tend to go to women in "serious" roles, full of anguish and the right amount of nudity, which this film didn't have. What was far better, which was the heart of self-discovery of herself with the help of new friends and a self-deprecating shaman. <br /> <br /> I admit to being a little soft for the eccentric characters who manage their peculiarities by remaining honest and true to themselves as they move through the minefield of what includes "adequate" social behavior and a "acceptable" interpersonal discourse. So if people have to conform to normality in your world, then this movie will not be to your liking. And it was, apparently, one of the fil rouge of criticism. <br /> <br /> And I'm always a sucker for a good pun when it raises questions of human behavior and ethical / philosophical values. Until this film I had not realized the emotional connection between being committed (for a cause or for honesty or something like that) and commitment (in a madhouse). At what point does someone's commitment to a personal sense of truth and action in life become a one-way ticket to madness? It seems a simple question, or one that can easily be dismissed as rhetoric. But it is so? Yet few critics - I think maybe two - have commented directly or indirectly on this aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> A beautiful film. 8/10. <br /> <br />
