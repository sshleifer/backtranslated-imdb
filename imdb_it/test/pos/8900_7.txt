I was a big fan of Asterix comics when I was a kid and I watched everybody. I never heard of this movie when it was released, but I saw it with my kids last night. I remembered the comic well enough to know that a lot has been added to the plot of the film. Some of the changes I thought were a bit mushy (like the "modern" dance of the nephew, and the Viking chief's daughter - almost all about her), but I found it quite amusing. Above all, seeing the reactions while my children watched him, he confirmed that the film appealed to his target audience. As a family movie it works better than other Asterix titles I've seen. Many of the names that were not in the book I found had the same charm as they were. Overall, a fun family movie, regardless of whether you're a fan of Asterix or not.
