Many reviewers seem to prefer the original version of The Man Who Knew Too Much, which I didn't have the opportunity to see. In itself, the '56 version is a very well made film. The Hitchcock film series of the mid and late 1950s (including "Rear Window", "Dial M for Murder", "Vertigo" and "To Catch A Thief", as well as this film) is one of my periods favorite in his career. In the man who knew too much, Jimmy Stewart threw himself energetically into his role as always. Doris Day is very credible in the role of an atypical blond Hitchcock. I thought there was nothing fake about his performance. His character may not have been written as strongly as the original, but it is certainly not reduced to the role of passive, "Yes, dear", beautiful thing on the arm of Jimmy Stewart. <br /> <br /> There were some really clever lines written for Hank (the son of the couple who is later kidnapped) in the opening scene on the bus - it's a pity that Christopher Olsen read them that way in wood . However, it is rare to see a good performance by a child actor in the 1950s. Most of the secondary actors in this film were very competent, however - especially the murderer (played by Reggie Nalder). <br /> <br /> Some small touches that make this film undeniably Hitchcockian - the use of non-English dialogues, especially French (something that Hitch did on a much larger scale in "To Catch A Thief"); the use of the omen, Arabic music in the hotel when the murderer appears; Stewart and Day talk to each other in church, singing their words about the melody of the hymn; the scene of Albert Hall, which shows in particular the musicians and the accomplice of the murderer who follows the score, increases the tension, as does the percussionist who prepares the cymbals; and finally the murderer's gun as it appears from behind the curtain. It moves so slowly and precisely that it must have been done mechanically (an effect that Hitch used at the end of "Spellbound", too). <br /> <br /> All in all, The Man Who Knew Too Much is a fun movie to watch. It's not as deep or heavily laden with symbolism as some of his films ("Vertigo", "Strangers on a Train"), but at the same time it's one of my top five Hitchcock masterpieces.
