I really don't know what it is about Dirty Dancing .. there is a sort of absolute magic in this movie .. I can't possibly tell the hundreds (yes, hundreds) of times I've looked at it, starting to end .. But every Once I find it on TV, I am ecstatic and disoriented and sit down and there, for two hours, I love the movie as if I were watching it for the first time. Although Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray absolutely hated each other during the making of this film, they have a beautiful chemistry on the set ... it makes the viewer appreciate it much more, see this passion and this commitment ... and I don't I can help to make a small break at the end, when Patrick approaches the Houseman family and tells his father: "No one puts Baby in a corner." (classic moment) For all those people who believe that this film is trivial and mushy, maybe in a sense it is, but it was the peninsula of the films of the 80s, and put Patrick Swayze on the map; his performance was immaculate. <br /> <br /> Three Cheers for Dirty Dancing !! <br /> <br /> Ps - The soundtrack is fantastic, an absolute masterpiece
