Everyone seems to compare this to The Matrix and The 13th Floor, and when I saw it for the first time I would have accepted: I was expecting Matrix and was a bit disappointed. But on repeated visions my respect for this film has grown immensely. <br /> <br /> The thing to keep in mind is that The Matrix is ​​a great action movie with some philosophical mumbo-jumbo. The 13th floor is a passable action film with some slightly more interesting philosophical mumbo jumbo. Existenz is not at all an action film, and it is not (as many believe) on "reality" or on such a "profound" concept. It concerns the human tendency to intentionally replace reality with an artifice (both in its origin and in its behavior) world of fiction. <br /> <br /> The most chilling moment in the film is when Allegra Geller repeats her "" script. It is at that point that you realize that the people in the game have voluntarily given up their free will to participate in a story This is made even more terrifying at the end when D'Arcy Nader (or rather his player) comments on the possibility of spending his life in the game I am sympathetic to the "realist" philosophy, which provides interesting worlds in which people simply identifying the correct predefined path to the final goal is ultimately a recipe for a soulless existence Living "in the game" is not living at all, but an attractive way to spend one's time on earth. on the real world, "nothing is happening here." I could also take someone else's imagination and pretend to do something interesting. (Although I have to ask if Cronenberg considers it a self-accusation, I believing that he himself offers worlds to live in 90-minute fragments.) <br /> <br /> After leaving the theater after seeing this film, I thought it was one of those movies that was watchable just to see how it ended. But after seeing it a couple of times more (thanks to SciFi Channel), I realized how much deeper it is. Seriously, if you've only seen him once, he deserves another vision.
