I just saw the "15 park avenue" movie, which was the first night time presentation film for the Asian human rights film festival in New York. I was really moved by the subject of this film and also by the excellent portrait of "mithi" by the main actor konkona sen sharma.i I have only one word for all those who are reading this comment, run for a copy of this gem and look at it. A sincere thanks to the director aparna sen who did a great job again. Movies like this happen once in a blue moon and I was lucky enough to see this film on screen and I also took part in a post-movie / session discussion of questions and answers with konkona sen sharma.in a simple word "a wonderful experience.
