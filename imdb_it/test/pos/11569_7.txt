OK, the show was a little bumpy, but I always liked it. I found the two annoying main rabbits, but Hamton and Plucky were always fun. <br /> <br /> I really want the episodes of Baby Plucky on DVD (or even VHS). Please release those! <br /> <br /> In particular the episode "Potty years" broadcast on 11/22/91; the "Going up" episode broadcast on 9/17/92 and the "Minister golf" episode in 11/92. <br /> <br /> They are the most enjoyable pieces of the entire series and even after more than one decade we still refer to these bits! <br /> <br /> (I have nothing else to say, please reduce the minimum to something like 5 lines and reward us for brevity!)
