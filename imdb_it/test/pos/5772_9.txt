This bizarre film rivals Ghost and Mr. Chicken as one of Don Knott's best films. Knotts is an accountant for a Podunk municipality that is good for defrauding citizens. They shoot "the three competent accountants and keep the stupid one" (of course Knotts is the mute). When his cohort picks up trash he accidentally empties the wrong garbage can, Knotts finds himself wrapped in a bizarre trap set by the city council for him. The film's funny moments include the Bowling Alley Restroom scene, and the cemetery scene is absolutely fun. Typical Knotts, the nervous and ninny act is well used, and as usual is surrounded by a lot of crazy actors from the sixties. Actors of the caliber of Frank Welker and Pitt Herbert contribute to the chaos. As can be expected, Knotts is armed with a big car, a pretty girl, and no real indication of what he is doing. Fun for anyone, especially for nostalgia lovers, but anyone will love it.
