I went to the cinema to see Claudine and I loved every minute of the cast and the soundtrack. Diahann Carroll has never been better than this role. We saw Mrs. Carroll minimize her looks barely saw her naked, smoked a cigarette, drank beer and oh cursed. Every time this movie was shown on TV and finally by cable, I called my friends to watch it. Only the soundtrack from the beginning of the film is fantastic, thanks to Gladys Knight and Pips. We saw a black woman struggling to raise her children, face a teenage pregnancy and everyday life meets a man who learns later has problems with himself. Finally this film arrived on DVD and well deserved.
