I saw this movie for the first time in a video store and, being the fan of Bam Margera, I had to rent it to see what it was. Since I have a huge and stupid sense of humor (note the stupid word), I found this film absolutely hilarious. Some parts are useless and random, but this is what makes them so fun. You will need to think that things like being slapped in the face and hit the head with a watermelon are fun to enjoy this movie. I was really impressed. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised by the acting. These people have really done a good job. No Oscar worthy, but well enough to pass the amateur level. Boys and young adults will probably find this more enjoyable because of the modern jargon and the situations used. I wouldn't suggest looking at it with your parents and vice versa. <br /> <br /> All in all, the acting was great, the script was hilarious and the story is really something you can relate to.
