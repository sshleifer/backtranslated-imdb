River's edge is not a PLEASANT movie to look at but it's incredible. After seeing it many years ago, I really think he would still have the ability to shock me if it was re-released or redone or something like that. Perhaps no film ever made has captured the essence of young suburban inertia like this scary and scary movie. Since this is based on a true story, it is even more disturbing. Very well acted and simply VERY FANTASTIC to watch many times but also a little-known masterpiece and a really important film. It should be mandatory to observe the nation in all high schools. Fantastic.
