Five teenagers have decided to camp in the Oregon reserve, and despite having been warned by the park ranger, they soon realize that something is wandering in the woods waiting to strike. <br /> <br /> When it comes to old horror movies, the only one that continues to appear in every conversation is Friday the 13th, so I took the trouble to find those old horror movies that weren't going just to be compared to Friday 13th, JUST BEFORE DAWN just happened to be among the ones I found, and it was really very impressive, it wasn't as insignificant as some of the things you find today, it was very sharp in terms of character development in as he had a lot of nice ones, and he has this very casual pace, he is in no hurry to get to the hack and slash pieces, it takes some time to set the mood and the right tone and it is very atmospheric and builds some deadly suspense allowing you to always have that sense of terror like, something out there but you don't know where it is or when it will be trike. <br /> <br /> Where I live is a gem undoubtedly overlooked simply because people have never heard of it or will not give it a chance, but I will affirm that it is not a Friday frigit THE 13th, the two concepts do not come close not even each other, but in my mind, it's one of the most impressive snipers I've seen in a while.
