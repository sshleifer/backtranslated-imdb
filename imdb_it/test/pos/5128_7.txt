This is a good family movie with a few laughs. I wish he didn't have as much school stuff as the bully to fill the movie. Furthermore, it seems a bit too easy to save a piece of land from the building. I mean, it simply flowed too easily. It makes you aware of wildlife. He had a nice way of introducing the piece of land that the fast runner but a little too slow for me. A little too hokey for me and reminded me to go back to school. Oh, the DVD is full of gadgets so don't miss it. 7 out of 10 for the 10 out of 10 movie for the DVD with extras worth seeing. It's worth your time to see it!
