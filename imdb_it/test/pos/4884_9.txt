the gentlemen's league was the most disturbing British sitcom of being on TV and how can a funny movie be rated so badly, have no taste this movie will make you want to watch over and over again and still find it funny. /> <br /> it is surprising that he did badly but it is English cinema that sucks most of the time, but this time (in my opinion) a push with a comedy with a giraffe on Lady's, this is a top British Comedy and better than the dodge-ball, so from this and you won't be wrong, because I didn't really laugh in the movies, but this movie was fantastic through comedy with the best characters but I was a little disappointed with how Edward and Tabb's were there to come back to type in buy this movie and it won't disappoint you.
