A film of high intelligence and activity. Besides being a strong capsule of time and personality of the 1960s, the film is also REALLY a surprise in its forward-looking themes and the unique presentation of the power system in a group. William Greaves is named in the authoritative role in the group. He asks his crew members to film, film and continue shooting. First the two actors, then the troupe that filmed the actors, then the whole set including bystanders, policemen and finally a homeless man who lives in bushes in Central Park for 9 weeks. <br /> <br /> Greaves modifies the film (thousands of feet) together and surprisingly makes a strong narrative with a bow and interesting motivations. Don't expect to be bored with this movie. Each crew member is passionate about conversations and often times express the thoughts that the observer observed in this film. Greaves does very well with the integration of multiple shots using three-part synchronized images and other methods of shifting attention. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film will be really effective only if it is what you are looking for: if you are looking for an abstract arty film that nourishes your self-indulgent ego while never having a point, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a film that will make you talk and think long about the desire for honesty and sincerity in the documented "reality" and the inevitable transparency that derives from it, then this is the perfect film.
