I saw this film for the first time about 15 years ago and have been enchanted ever since. It is such a pleasant experience that I could see it happily at any time of the year. Anyway, for me, it's the last Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> The fact that it is in B & W is irrelevant, although I often wonder how it would be in color. You can have that warm and bright feeling by watching the Christmas events taking place. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck and Morgan are perfect together, and Greenstreet is the antithesis of his usual character, Sakall is a spooky joy to watch. <br /> <br /> The brain is light and certainly not taxable, but it leaves you happy to have seen it. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for it to become available on DVD in the UK. I will certainly be in the front row to buy it.
