Since the collapse of the opening theme, "The Man with the Golden Arm" is the classic entertainment of the 50s. No subtlety here, Frank returns home from the prison with a monkey on his back and immediately returns to the old neighborhood, where the old flogged are still hiding. This is a story of his dark ride with all his intact emotional baggage. The shows are a bit too mature, but it's part of the fun of watching. Darren McGavin and Arnold Stang are unforgettable and almost steal the show. This and "The Manchurian Candidate" are the two greatest films of the President of the Board, in my humble opinion. Don't miss either of them.
