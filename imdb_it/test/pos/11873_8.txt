I have to admit, I liked this movie, and I didn't find everything misogynistic. It could be subtitled, three ways of looking at LiV Tyler. Three different men become obsessed with the same woman and tell their stories to very different characters: a man (John Goodman) tells his story to a priest (the very funny Richard Jenkins). For Goodmans' sake, the character of Liv Tyler is an idealized saint, the second coming of his holy wife, Theresa. For the character of Paul Riesers (who tells the story of a shrink (a refined and discreet performance by the great Reba Mcintire), the character of Liv Tyler is simply an object of sexual fantasy (vicious), finally the character of Matt Dillons rather faded, it tells the HIS side of the story to a hit man, played by Michael Douglas. All three of these narrative obsessions are told simultaneously, and they are all fun. Finally the film ends in a bizarre climax, which I don't want to give away.
