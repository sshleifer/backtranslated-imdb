I am proud to say that I am a student from UW-Milwaukee, where parts of the film were shot. Yes, I recognize Mitchell Hall, where I took a film class, perhaps the same course as fellow student Smith. <br /> <br /> That's where I learned about "American Movie". Our professor told us about this just before his release. Actually, I was intrigued, but for some reason, I put it off for several months (it must have worked pretty well if it was still playing, at least in Milwaukee). <br /> <br /> When I finally managed to see it, I thought it was a fun documentary. It's not a masterpiece, it's a little too long, but I find Mark's passion and commitment to be stimulating. I hope this movie signals the beginning of bigger and better things than him. Perhaps his next "Northwestern" will push him to luck. Who knows? <br /> <br /> Rating: *** (out of ****) <br /> <br /> 108 min / Released by Sony Pictures Classics
