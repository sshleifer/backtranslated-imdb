Of all the Star Wars parodies I've seen, this is probably the most fun. Not because of the premise, Star Wars with simple electronics instead of spaceships, but because of how bad it is played. This is deliberately overcrowded, and makes it hilarious, and since everyone knows that it is intentionally exaggerated, no one complains. The special effects were also deliberately horrible as can be, and include a toaster on a visible rope that shoots toast and an egg beater on a rope. This short film is fun for all Star Wars fans (which I am not), or anyone who has 15 minutes to kill. Great short !! <br /> <br /> My rating: *** on ****. 13 minutes Not evaluated.
