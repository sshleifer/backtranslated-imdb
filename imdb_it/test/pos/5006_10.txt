I'm shocked and dismayed that the Network has canceled Talk Show with Spike Feresten !! <br /> <br /> What's wrong with The Fox Television Network, Cancel Talk Show with Spike Feresten and replace it with Wanda Sikes? For those of the Net with a poor attention span, Wanda At Large was canceled because the public got tired of its ugly insults that would have made the public shudder, and Wanda Sykes who launched his brand of vindictive and muddy jokes it is not humor, it is ugly and repulsive. <br /> <br /> Apparently The Fox Television Network awarded Wanda Sikes for collecting an authoritative look from President Barak Obama. There is no doubt that Wanda's recent bad temper in front of the President of the United States is not funny and the audience's laughter was just to patronize and satisfy Barak Obama. <br /> <br /> Talk Show with Spike Feresten has a genuine sense of humor and has never deliberately or vindictively offended guests or artists. Spike's well-rounded personality has always been cheerful, attracted the fun of life and himself. And his Feathers during the first two seasons with the AFTRA actress Mary Mae Atwill, while the 21st century Mae West were absolutely hysterical with Spike Feresten's scenes: Judge Joe Brown, Trading Spouses and James Kyson Lee Last season's episode in which Spike chats with Erica over the Internet on the show. <br /> <br /> Despite the budget constraints of the network for elaborate field pieces and the WGA Strike of the second season, Spike Feresten has not given up his sense of humor or integrity. Talk Show with Spike Feresten has always had a new talent and his comedies for Nanny 911 and Idiot Paparazzi's Stoners have been considered avant-garde and have excellent production value. <br /> <br /> On a professional level, Spike Feresten, was the best executive producer and Set Producer, Brett Webster and his fabulous production team were one of the best production teams I worked for in my AFTRA career It would really be a crazy and sad shame to cancel the Talk Show with Spike Feresten. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, its success could be taken at Comedy Central or another Network and Financially speaking, it would be a valuable loss of revenue for FOX television. <br /> <br /> On behalf of Late Night the audience of Saturday Fox Television, Talk Show supporters with Spike Feresten, including all cast and crew members, we beseech the network to maintain the Talk Show with Spike Feresten Franchise and give the crew a second chance to become a successful Fox Show.
