Oppenheimer was a GREAT series (it was the first thing I saw in Waterston) and the copies are not available. A similar situation exists for "Glory Enough for All", a British series of about the same time, on the discovery of insulin. I would pay a good price for both on DVD. Is it really that hard to get Oppenheimer on a DVD that can be played in the US? Another very funny series, always in the same period, was "Danger UXB". A series of defusing UneXploded bombs, hence the name. The one you can get from your local library. <br /> <br /> Pete
