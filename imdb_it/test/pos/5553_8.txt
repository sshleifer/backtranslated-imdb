This is an unusual romantic comedy about love, work, taste for the public and mid-life crises. The main character is a talented director who decides to make a silly PG-13 movie to get himself out of trouble with the IRS. He has an excellent cast, a wide range of humor (from impassive to slapstick) and excellent writing. It is also an involuntary grimace of the film industry. The metacommentary includes several excellent cuts between reality and the film that was made, and in some places the film moves away from rigorous realism. The result is a multidimensional masterpiece of middle-aged humor.
