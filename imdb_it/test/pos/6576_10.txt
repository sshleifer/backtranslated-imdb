almost 4 years after the events of 911, if asked what came to mind that day, most people would probably have commented on things like the sight of crashed planes and the collapse of the twin towers, the number of people killed , acts of terrorism and heroism mixed together, etc. all those who were alive at that time will never forget that day. however for most of us the memories, although moving, are not on a personal level. now comes an extraordinary film that gives all those who haven't lost a friend or family member the chance to be personally involved in what we lost in 911. this is a film that must be seen.
