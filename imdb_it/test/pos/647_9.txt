Thought to be some kind of social commentary on the way our lives got out of hand in the 1970s, this film looks more like something that Mr. Schlesinger threw together after a bad day on the highway. A mixture of nut fragments encountered along the highway in Florida, and along the highway of life, the cast is mostly wasted and probably ended up on the floor of the editing room. The problem is that what is NOT finished on the cutting room floor probably should have! Now available on DVD, it's pretty fun to see a comedy that would have cost $ 100 million if it was produced in 2004. It rolls and isn't too hard to seduce and, oddly enough, we're all more or less simply in 2004 <br /> getting on our cars and going faster and faster, going nowhere.
