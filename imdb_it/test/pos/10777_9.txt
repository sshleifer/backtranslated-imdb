Oliver Stone hits the target with this film, aided mainly by the electrifying presence of Bogosian's screen and a biting and brilliant script. Every moment crackles with a constantly increasing tension, culminating in a truly memorable movie experience. If ever there was an indication of a writer and of a director's ability to merge two highly volatile temperaments into a perfect union of creativity, then it is so! The result is a success of power, made more current now perhaps because of the disturbing charm of our culture for celebrity, and is distorted interpretations of fame. A definitive accusation of the growing morbidity of our society and of the self-bewitching hunger for the next great emotion. <br /> <br /> A film not easily forgotten. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the dark side of human nature.
