... and my reasons why they are simple: there are so many great films presented and discussed here (many of them by their own directors and actors), so many infamous clips of infamous moments in the history of the 70s, and indeed a certain number of films that I have yet to see, that it would not be fair to classify this work. With this logic I should not have given votes to other documentary films such as My Personal Journey through Martin Scorsese's American films and My Journey to Italy. But while those films were based on a man's vision of cinema, narrating most of the way, Richard La Graravanese and (the late) Ted Demmes' A Decade Under the Influence let the movies and the creators speak entirely for themselves. <br /> <br /> What makes 'Decade' worth at least a watch for movie fans, or just those who like movies from the late 60s and 70s in America, are the levels to which it goes, that in the version (three hours, not the theatrical version, which I have no comment on) a lot of land is covered. Interviews include artists such as Scorsese, Robert Altman, Sidney Lumet, Julie Christie, Jon Voight, Francis Ford Coppola, Paul Schrader, Pam Grier, Bruce Dern, Peter Bogdanovich, Roger Corman, Dennis Hopper, Robert Towne, etc. And there is a constant stream of intuition from beginning to end. The way clips, directors and actors appear, modified together in a flashy and fast style, is also fascinating. <br /> <br /> The only comment I have on the documentary is that most of the information presented has been reported in various books, such as Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, and even if I have not seen the film version of that book , I'm sure it would have covered many of the films and directors and incidents like here (in fact, the book of this is one of the best I've ever read. HOWEVER, this documentary serves as something special for the movie buffs and occasional viewers of the future - they can look at this and learn not only about well-known images like Easy Rider, The Last Picture Show, Annie Hall, Coming Home, and lessor known as Scarecrow, Panic in Needle Park, The hosts, Joe, they shoot they can't even know who influenced them (new waves of Europe and Asia), who they served as influences, and how the argument that created controversy after controversy is still intriguing and the chancy material for the foll to contemporary ut!
