I remember seeing it when it was done and thought it was brilliant at the time. Looking at it for the second time almost 20 years later, I still think Traffik is brilliant and much better than the US movie based on this drama. <br /> <br /> Politicians who think they can win the drug war should also be looked at today by all our comers today, as the issues raised in this film are as relevant today as they were then in the late years. 80 and, unless they change their policies, they will be in another 20 years. <br /> <br /> Well written, well crafted, beautifully recited and superbly filmed. A thought that causes drama that entertains and highlights some of the harsh realities of the criminal drug trade.
