For the late 80s cheeses, this is not so bad. There are many disposable one-liners ("That was grand theft!" - "Thanks!") And Madonna performs beautifully; nothing worthy here, but this applies to both Razzies and the Oscars. I'm curious if the film would have been better received if he had used his regular (pre-British influenced) voice rather than the hyper-Bronx accent used in his place. Oh good. As a side note, I met one of the actors who played one of the motorcycle cops through my work; he said it was a funny movie to work on, but he gave me the sad news that the actor who played Buck the UPS bellboy died about a year after Who's That Girl
