This film promises a lot but offers little. The basic problem has to do with the inclusion of the character of Charlotte Gainsbourg in this film. The immigrants from Sicily did not need a red-haired Anglo in any way - the film might have needed her, but certainly the new citizens did not. In my opinion, the decision to include it destroys the continuity of the film. This is particularly worrying as it seems to debase not only the characters of the film, but also the history of immigration itself. The immigrants themselves were heroic figures, fully capable of getting along without having to satisfy what I thought was a veiled image of the "white man's burden". I wonder if anyone will make a film of Irish immigrants that will include a Sicilian woman as the main character. The Left Elbow Index considers seven aspects of the film - acting, production sets, dialogue, artistic ability, film continuity, plot and character development - on a scale of 10 for excellent, 5 for medium and 1 for help. Both the continuity of the film and the frame rate are low by 1. Continuity as discussed above is further degraded by the surrealistic ending. Does not such an important historical film deserve more than a conclusion that recalls Marc Chagall? The plot is quite simple, until it seems to become too complicated in the old country, too little time on the ship and too much emphasis on the ending. The development of acting and character is average since all the characters are fixed throughout the film, and the inclusion of the perfect Anglo-Saxon English almost turns the film into a satire. Where is Groucho when you need him? The production sets, the dialogues and the art are very good, each of which has a value of 10. The sets in Sicily, on the ship and on Ellis Island are as good as can be found. The dialogue is wonderful and the ethical song is superb. I agree with Scorsese that listening to the Sicilian dialect is a pleasure. Note that immigrants speak of "America", not "United States" - the ideal against political reality. There are many good artistic scenes, with dreams of America, golden coins that rain and giant vegetables among the best. The average left elbow index is 5.25, raised to 7.0 when compared to the IMDb scale. Another notion seems to go through the experience of Ellis Island: the tribulations of the immigrants were exhausting, later, in 2006, a coyote or boat owner had to be paid and sneaked into the county in the darkness of the night, no questions asked! The film deserves to be seen, but it seems that what is seen is problematic.
