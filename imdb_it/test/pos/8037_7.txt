I found this movie quite funny and quite funny. Good characters, good actors and enough suspense to keep your interest alive. The twists could have been a little too much, but overall a decent thriller. If you enjoyed this movie, I would recommend The Spanish Prisoner, The House of Games and No Way Out.
