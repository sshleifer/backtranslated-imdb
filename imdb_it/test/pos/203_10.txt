It does not surprise me that this short film (91 minutes) in black and white made 50 years ago in the Soviet Union during the short period called "ottepel" or "the thaw", has gained so much love and admiration among the cinema lovers of everything the world. It is sublime and wonderfully filmed. Some scenes look like they were made ahead of their time. Sergei Urusevsky's camera and creative discoveries have been included in textbooks and widely imitated. The film tells the moving and timeless story of love destroyed by a ruthless but eternally alive war in memory of a young woman. It is also the film about loyalty, memories, the ability to live when there seems to be nothing to live for; it's about forgiveness and hope. The film received (absolutely deservedly) the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival and Tatiana Samoilova was chosen as the winner of a special prize at Cannes to play Veronika, the young girl happily in love with the best man in the world at the beginning of the film. After the separation with her beloved who went to the front, the loss of her family in the bomb, and the marriage with the man she never loved and only wished she had never existed, she turned to the shadow of herself , became dead inside. His long journey to redemption, to finally accept the death of his beloved and learn to live with it, is fascinating and heartbreaking and simply will leave no one indifferent spectator. <br /> <br /> For me, the film is very personal and expensive because I was born and raised in the city where its characters lived and I was so happy at the beginning. I walked the same streets, squares and bridges over the Moskva River. Every family in the former Soviet Union had lost at least one, but often more than one family member, in a fight or in the concentration camp or in the ghetto or hunger, cold and disease during World War II and my family no exception. My mother and my grandmother knew the horrors of war and never cared about the pain of losses not only from movies and books. "The flying cranes" speaks to me clearly and honestly and touches me deeply. It is a masterpiece of cinema but it is part of my life, my past, my memory and my past.
