I don't remember a film that so cleverly shows the emotional destruction of war, as reflected in a single marital relationship. The focal point of the film is the union between Ullman and Von Sydow - the two are in every scene. Through the course of the film, they experience a role reversal: one has the strength to survive and the other is reduced to emotional evasion through dreams. Both will lose a measure of humanity, but to a greater extent than the other. The characters and the spectator go through periods of fluctuation as far as proximity is concerned - the camera moves away and moves away, the sound disappears, the words are lost, only because the camera returns to the first pictorial plane of its facially expressive stars. The confusion and fluctuations can make this film difficult for some viewers, but this is all intentional under Bergman's expert hand. I think the use of a "fake" war makes the film timeless, relevant today as never before, and focusing on the human relationship through war, makes the film relevant to everyone. The couple could be anyone. The film is not rooted in place or time, but rather in emotion. A unique and effective war movie, unlike any other. Bergman's films are virtuosic in presenting human relationships - which would lead to a war movie is masterful.
