Being a big fan of hip-hop and turntablism to begin with, I always knew I would like this movie. However, I was not prepared for the quality of the documentary. It covers almost all the important aspects of the only element of hip-hop that has been present from the beginning. The "story" begins in the early 1970s, and follows the evolution of turntablism as an art from the beginning until 2000 (turntablism enthusiasts will underline it as significant). <br /> <br /> Assembly is almost perfect throughout the film. Apart from the excellent "scratch" visual techniques they have used, the quick cut between interviews and archive material is excellent, giving the rhythm of the film when it is needed. Sound editing is also very good, with some nice sounds that are used to help with transitions. <br /> <br /> Even the absence of a narrator was welcome. We are not taken by hand from history, and consequently the public is able to make their hypotheses easier. Each DJ adds another side to the story, and it's so interesting to hear the unknown stars of hip-hop, especially those that were present when hip-hop was left to the left, right and center of the music world. <Br /> <br /> Although there are many excellent things about this film, I have some complaints. The biggest of these is the absence of several noteworthy DJs, such as Ca $ hMoney and Jazzy Jeff, as well as DJs from other countries, such as Scratch Perverts and DJ Noise. However, if you look at the commentary on the DVD (which I strongly recommend), the producer and director go into depth about how they regret not being able to present them. The deleted scenes contain many interviews with Ca $ hMoney, Jazzy Jeff and Scratch Perverts. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best documentary I've seen on hip-hop culture and music. It doesn't just show the true potential of turntablism; so I highly recommend checking out DMC and ITF videos. However, this is a minor quibble. I highly recommend this film, not least for Phat's soundtrack, with excellent music everywhere. (9/10)
