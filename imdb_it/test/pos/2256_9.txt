This is a beautiful but simple film about a man, driven to find an answer, a response that he does not necessarily need but that has structured his whole life. It's heartbreaking, it's hilarious, it's glorious, it's tormenting, it's delicate and dynamic, I say it's brilliant. <br /> <br /> I read Jonathan Safran's book Foer Everything is Illuminated (mainly because I heard Elijah Wood starred in the film adaptation) and I was entranced by the characters. I laughed louder than once. And every time someone talks about what's going on, I feel the same trivial answer, almost as if it's a long and long word: "He's almost affected by a woman who saved his sword from the Nazis". Yet this story is so philosophical; it goes deeper than that. That conversation on the ring is "just in case". It really makes you think. Suddenly, this story blends from a simple search to an inner metamorphosis, and now I find myself looking at things a little differently. <br /> <br /> I advise you to rent it before, if ever, to read it, because the book had many obscene and perverted stories that were not included in the film, mainly the story of Jonathan's family that was not necessary for movie. <br /> <br /> A bit of curiosity, I heard, is that Wood's current girlfriend has a cameo in this film as the drummer of the band that Alex organizes to play while Jonathan gets off the train in Ukraine. > <br /> You spend half of the film trying to figure out what it is, exactly, and what Jonathan is about, because his character is so withdrawn, like a turtle in a shell. <br /> <br /> is magnificent, and in my opinion one of the best films of Elijah Wood.
