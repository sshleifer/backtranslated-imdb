I found this movie on Netflix and had to add it to my queue. I wasn't disappointed when I picked it up as it's fun now like when I saw it at a local drive-in theater at the time. <br /> <br /> It builds the climax nicely with you various characters who begin their journey through America on the "Honky Tonk Freeway, America on wheels". This was a strange comic role for William DeVane as I remember him as Kennedy in the 1974 TV movie "The Missiles of October" and felt that no one could eliminate that dramatic character like him. <br /> <br /> It reminds me a little of Dick Van Dyke in "Cold Turkey", where Van Dyke played the local minister. The role of DeVane as mayor, minister and activist is typical of small towns, so the his character looks funny and real. > <br /> Howard Hessman and Teri Garr, like the spoiled camper family, were also targeted for the time. Anyone who has traveled all over the country with young children (are we still here?) Will appreciate these scenes. /> <br /> The scenes of a small city struggling to survive reminded me a lot of the small city I grew up in, but they managed it with the charm and humor that was often seen only in small towns. the cities have disappeared because of the highway system and offer a realistic, albeit humorous, view of what they had to do to survive. (Any zoo animals used?) <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a light comedy without a particular message but a humorous look in America during the early 1980s. It is worth looking at if you just need some fun.
