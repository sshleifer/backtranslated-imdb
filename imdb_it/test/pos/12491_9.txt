This is an exceptional photo with so much to recommend it. The acting and writing are fantastic and there are lots of great twists in the plot. Like a French film "Noir", his language is certainly much healthier than his American counterparts, but for me this was added to realism. Besides, I liked how un-glamorous they all were, especially the husband and the lieutenant. Regarding the only negative aspect, and the reason why the film gets a 9 and not a 10, is because there was a glaring hole. Like another famous French film, Dr√¥le de Drame, the confusion between the policemen and the defendants may have been resolved at the beginning, but the characters made rather stupid decisions. For this, you just have to suspend disbelief and keep watching: the reward is worth the wait. <br /> <br /> This is simply one of the best French films I've seen. Period.
