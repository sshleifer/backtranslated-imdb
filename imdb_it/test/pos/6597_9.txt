This film was fantastic. It's a documentary about how surfing influenced skateboarding in the early days. He has interviews with skaters like Tony Hawk (my idol) =), and Stacy Peralta to name a couple. Dogtown is a so-called part of the "ghetto" of California, where once there was an amusement park that had been demolished. People started riding along the dangerous ruins of the park. Soon, the Zepher Surf team was formed. This led to Skateboarding the first real start to Dogtown. Z's boys were a team of radiant teenagers who loved skateboarding and started the phenomenon known as skating. They started skating in drained pools. This is just a little bit of the story behind it. It also contains rare movies of Charlie's Angels of Stacy Peralta that make a cameo. I think you should buy this movie if you are a skater. It will teach you that skateboarding has not always been popular. Even if you're not, BUY!
