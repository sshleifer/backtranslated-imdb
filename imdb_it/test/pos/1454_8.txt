I always liked Frank Sinatra's music and recently wrote an article about his life story. I was fascinated by the life and legend of Ol 'Blue Eyes. However, I've never seen any of his films. So I wanted to see if his acting was as big as his way of singing. Well ... it was! I was amazed by his performance in this movie! He really does a tremendous job like the recovery of heroin addict Frankie Machine, who is trying to put his life back together and audition as a drummer for a local band. <br /> <br /> The management of Otto Preminger is also exceptional. I didn't see any of his other films. I read his biography on the IMDB. He looks like one of those filmmakers who was seriously misunderstood, and people had conflicting thoughts about him. He looks like the kind of person most cult worshipers like. I haven't seen enough of his films to know if he's really brilliant, but now I'm curious. I want to see more of his films, because judging by his attempt on "The Man with the Golden Arm" this guy has talent. I also loved music for this movie. The score certainly contains the kind of music I will remember if I happen to hear it again. That's when you know you have a big score. <br /> <br /> Support performances are also fine, including Darren McGavin as a local drug dealer, Eleanor Parker as the wife tied to a wheelchair by Frankie and Kim Novak as a lover. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see how the directors handled the topic of drug abuse, as opposed to modern attempts at films like "Trainspotting" and "Requiem for a Dream". In 1955, only mentioning the word "drug" caused controversy, and if you watch the film they kept the subject at a very discreet level. There's only one scene where Frankie is actually injecting heroin into his arm, and they showed a close-up of his face's reaction rather than showing the needle sticking out graphically in his veins. But he delivered his message without making him feel watered down. In a drama as powerful as this, with powerful performances and direction like this, you don't need graphic portraits of drug abuse to keep your audience intrigued. <br /> <br /> "The Man with the Golden Arm" is a dramatic gem that all movie fans should try. It really is an incredible job! <br /> <br /> My score: 8 (out of 10)
