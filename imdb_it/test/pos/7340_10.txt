The Gymnast (2006) was written and directed by Ned Farr. Dreya Weber plays Jane Hawkins, a former world-class gymnast who is seriously injured and now earns her living as a certified masseuse. <br /> <br /> The promotional material leads you to believe that the plot depends on Jane's chance meeting with a former teammate. Although this meeting takes place, that plot is secondary to the main plot, involving Jane, her husband and a professional dancer named Serena (Addie Yungmee). The two women develop such an act performed by the Cirque de Soleil. The two complement each other - Jane is more experienced at heights and has an extraordinary upper body strength. Serena is more elegant and artistic, although, of course, she is also capable of incredible physical endeavors. <br /> <br /> The film works because we can understand how Jane would address Addie, who is caring and compassionate, while Jane's husband took her for granted for the many years of their marriage. <br /> <br /> Both women are incredibly fit and athletic, and Dreya has a lean body and well-defined muscles that are characteristic of gymnasts. Clearly they are really doing their act, and the results are so excellent that we can believe that they would really be a hit in Las Vegas, or anywhere else they have traveled. <br /> <br /> Sexual tension among women is obvious, and the situation becomes even more complex when the act requires them to kiss while hanging in the air. A woman with a negligent husband and an attractive woman make up an explosive situation that is not resolved in a clean and orderly manner. <br /> <br /> Of the six films we saw at the Rochester NY Lesbian and Gay Film and Video Festival, we thought this was the best. It will work on DVD, and it's definitely worth looking for it on large or small screens. NOTE: stay for credits!
