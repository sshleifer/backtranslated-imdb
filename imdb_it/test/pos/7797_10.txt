This film is a fantastic comedy ... the script is too funny ... if you look at it more than once you'll like it better. Even if the comedy is sometimes silly, but it's really funny !! Salman Khan and Aamir Khan have done justice to their roles. Since 1994 I have never seen such a funny Hindi movie.
