Like a circle around the human condition, 2001 begins at the beginning, skips the half, and proceeds to the end, right where we started. Noting the weakness of words with respect to the image / images, Kubrick wisely tests the dialogue, preferring the power and essence of the scenario and allowing the intelligence of the public to make the decipherment. Or not, depending on the audience. <br /> <br /> A monolith in the history of cinema, 2001 is a reference, performance and success brand. If we consider the film's ambition (a film on everything) and the measure of the success of the film achieved for this purpose, a very valid argument for this is the greatest of all films can be made. <br /> <br />
