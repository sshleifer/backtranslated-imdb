It's really a shame that nobody knows about this movie. I think if it was just a little nuanced and if it weren't so low budget, I think one of the biggest movie companies might have wanted to take it. I saw this movie for the first time at age 11, and I thought it was so powerful with the many long, but illegal lengths that Mitchell only does to keep his family together. It inspired me then and it amazes me now. If you are lucky enough to find a copy of this movie, don't miss it!
