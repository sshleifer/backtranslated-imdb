"Strike Force" or "The Librarians" is a funny action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. William Forsythe plays Simon, who is looking for a missing daughter of a wealthy client. He meets Sandi (Erika Eleniak) who is looking for someone, his sister. But there are bad villains on foot. The worst of them all is Marcos Canarious (Andrew Divoff). Marcos likes to kill people. So now, Simon and Sandi must work together to bring down the bad guys. The whole cast is fantastic, with Divoff stealing the movie. There are also cameos by Ed Lauter and Burt Reynolds. If you are looking for a good action movie, watch this and have fun.
