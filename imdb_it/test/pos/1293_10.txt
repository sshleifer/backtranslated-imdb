I saw this episode of Masterpiece Theater and I immediately came to IMDb to look for the film. I was greeted by a comment from another user, who believed it was nothing special, a 6 out of 10, and disappointing. I would feel morally negligent if I didn't disagree. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm a huge fan of Masterpiece Theater, but often the stories can be a little silly on television, for example, "He Knew He was right" was absolutely horrendous. "Carrie's War", however, is probably the best I've seen so far. The whole cast did an excellent job, and it piqued my interest more than any other piece I've seen recently. Mr. Evans' character is of particular interest, and through subtle images of, for example, an untreated birthday cake or a garnet ring, my opinion of him has gone from bad to true. Really. His final death, and the story of how everyone around him left him a cold and cold man, is what brought out the bittersweet in this story for me. <br /> <br /> The ending is rewarding in every sense except one; that everyone did not get what they deserved, but on the whole things worked. I absolutely recommend it to everyone.
