I love this movie so much: music, cinematography, acting, history and all the Mormon clichés. Just because they are clichés does not mean they are not real! This is not perfect, after all it is a movie. Although the excommunications take place in well-lit rooms with beautiful desks and chairs, it was entirely appropriate to portray it as the dark and cold scene they made in this film. I also liked the scene with the angel waiting at the bus stop, smoking a cigarette. I thought it was so beautiful. I mean, I believe the angels watch over us. What should you do while you wait? Smoking is a way some people spend their time while they wait. I loved irony, because Mormons make a similar deal on smoking. I saw this movie 7 times in Salt Lake cinemas, and I cried every time! He throws me away. And I've seen it 3 times on video now and it still makes me cry every time. I would skip the chance to see it again on a big screen. I hope the Salt Lake Tower Theater regularly brings it back to General Conference time, as a cult film (pun intended, but no offense intended).
