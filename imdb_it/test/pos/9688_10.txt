This movie was supposed to be the funniest movie I've ever seen in my life. I laughed so hard that I almost vomited. After the film was made, I laughed for about an hour thinking about the last appearance of the film. It's definitely 100 times better than the first Jackass movie. I enjoyed seeing them all together again. If you are picky or don't like childish and vulgar humor you will not like this movie. If you can come in with an open mind and not take it so seriously, you'll laugh at it in a crack. His incredible nobody was killed in this movie. Every visa in this film is so original and so different from the next one that you won't know what to expect. <br /> <br /> Mike Webber
