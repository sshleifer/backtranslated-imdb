I saw a TV movie about the destruction of Waco, Texas. He was evidently heavily inclined towards the claim that David Koresh was a murderer, a sectarian leader who raped children who wanted to kill as many policemen as he wanted and bring his people to the skies on a blood-stained staircase. <br /> <br /> The film was little more than propaganda that further detailed what we had already read in the newspapers. I've been getting more confident since I saw the great Waco documentary: The Rules of Engagment. Not that every statement made in this film should be taken as the truth of God, but tells the whole story rather than regurgitating only what the police have decided to tell. <br /> <br /> For those who have forgotten, Koresh was the spiritual leader of the religious movement called The Branch Davidians. Allegations of drug use, kidnapping, illegal arms ownership and rape of the law (among others I am sure) have raised suspicions from the local police, then from the federal law enforcement agencies. During an attempt to serve a search warrant, the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) and the clan participated in a shooting that left dead and wounded on both sides. <br /> <br /> It was then that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was involved. The communications between the two were animated but eventually broke. The FBI prepared for an invasion by assaulting the building with gas-flash and gas grenades. When the building ran aground, killing many inside, including Koresh, the FBI refused to admit responsibility by saying that the "cult" inside must have set it on its own. This provided images of Jim Jones and other violent religious organizations. <br /> <br /> The image puts many masks to tell its story. It starts with a sampling of congressional hearings, perhaps the "truth", as far as the record is concerned. What opens the eyes is how politicians have remained partisans even in a difficult and serious situation like this. The Democrats were worried about nothing but defending every single action taken by the police. It was the Republicans who seemed open on the other side. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to relate all the new information and analysis provided by this documentary. Also, a list would take away the movie that opens as it progresses. An example would be the fact that children died within the complex. The directors probably line up more with the Davidians in general, but remain relatively open to both sides. In this case the feds seem to be at fault for having mishandled a situation involving innocent children. But on the other hand, parents must also take some of the blame for leaving their children in this damaging situation when they could release them to any number of local authorities. <br /> <br /> Probably the most damaging information arrives late in the film and involves the FBI claiming that they did not fire on the building. This is left to interpretation, and I will reveal no more than to say that what can and cannot be said is disturbing and shocking. <br /> <br /> Federal officials are not held in a critical or corrupt light any more than Koresh. The biggest condemnation seems to be leveled in the media, not wanting to tell both parts of a story. This element seems prevalent in recent documentaries, so I believe it is so. It is time for the media to return to tell news stories and abandon this incessant search for what will attract the public and the most important assessments. <br /> <br /> It's difficult to get confused with a documentary. In most cases, turning on a camera and assembling interesting life pieces together is common and tells a fantastic story. What few can do is shed such a new light on a subject that the way in which it is thought is forever altered. Waco is that kind of movie. ***. 5 out ****
