If you are a fan of Jackass, Viva La Bam or CKY videos, you already know what awaits you. But this is one of those rare events where a sequel is better than the original! And the man makes this film a medium-low shot. But I mean that in a good way. It's the same kind of madness to challenge death, heartbreaking, that we all know, love and expect from Bam, Knoxville and Co. But this time with even more laughter than ever! With Johnny Knoxville's insane tolerance for pain, Bam Margera's love for harassing his friends / family and Steve-O's coarse factor, you have a really fun movie. The bar for the acrobatics, the scenes and the general chaos of the Jackass crew has been raised. Jackass 3? Doubtful, because it is almost impossible to improve perfection.
