"Flesh" is difficult to describe with a solid summary because, well, there is basically no plot. The film practically shows only the day of the life of a bully named Joe (Joe Dallesandro, who is in the underrated image of Louis Malle "Black Moon") while making his rounds, sleeping and modeling to collect the money to pay for the abortion of his wife's lover. <br /> <br /> Not much, and since the film is a good ninety-nine minutes, you would think that "Flesh" would be a slow and boring hour and a half. You think wrong. The film is made of improvisation, without a script, and even the corners of the film are rather in-the-spot, yet there is a kind of truth under each frame that gives the film its demented vivacity. Everything makes sense and serves the purpose in what happens to Joe on this day. Meet a normal guy who is lying when he says he wants to see Joe, a photographer who talks so much about boring Joe to tears, two drag queens reading tabloid magazines while Joe gets his head from a mousy-addict who mumbles later on how he wants to get a breast lift, an old friend of Joe who reads stories of male rapes to him, and then a final scene with his wife and his lover that echoes the scene at the beginning of the film (one of the best openings of a film I've seen for a long time) ?? and completely tells what the film is philosophically about. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how the film's messages and styles feel almost timeless, even though it's set in the New York City of the 1960s, in real time, in the real place, and it's filmed as a obvious independent film of that era. It is certainly not a film that could be made today, which adds to its delightful mystique. <br /> <br /> Powered by unexpected cuts; and absent a score to advance his images ?? "Flesh" is rough and gritty like a movie about male prostitution in the 1960s.
