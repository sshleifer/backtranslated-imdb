During the short Golden Age of the Super 8 Magnetic Sound Home Movies, we purchased a GAF Projector for $ 148.00 in close-out at a Downtown Camera Store in Chicago. GAF seemed to come out of the Camera & Projector Business; even if they would continue with their other companies, such as Sawyer's 3 dimensional Vue-Master color slide readers. <br /> <br /> Little did we know or expect the rapid approach of the video camera, Betamax, VHS and any DVD revolutions. With the Super 8 Magnetic Sound Camera that we also bought, we took some sound records like our daughter, Jenn's First Holy Communion and her younger sister, Michelle's Graduation from Pre-School. This was all around 1979-82. <br /> <br /> During this time we also purchased some Daddy Toys for use; like some Super 8 Magnetic Sounds LAUREL & HARDY Films and W.C. Shorts from FIELDS by Blackhawk Films, Davenport, Iowa. We also collected a sound film from Columbia Pictures Home Movies of a sort of forgotten classic Cartoon, GERALD McBOING-BOING from UPA (United Productions of America / Columbia, 1951). It was THE success of our movie Home Time! <br /> <br /> Being a member of that Baby Boomer Generation, his wife (Deanna) and myself recalled the character of Gerald McBoing-Boing; for Gerald he had a Network TV Show on CBS, on Sunday evening, ca. 1955. Bill Goodwin was Announcer / Presenter. But we had never seen this original UPA theatrical cartoon; nor was it known to us that the young Master McBoing-Boing was a creation of Dr. Seuss of the fame of "Grinch", "Horton" and "Mulberry Street". <br /> <br /> The assembled staff was very talented and profound. The exceptional production values ​​are evident. Director Robert Cannon and supervisor supervisor John Hubley were veterans of their trade. The writers were Theodore Geisel (Dr. Seuss, Himself), Phil Eastman and Bill Scott. <br /> <br /> Scott is remembered not so much for his written contributions to the UPA, but for partnering with Jay Ward on television properties like ROCKY & BULLWINKLE, MR. PEABODY, FRACTURED BLOWERS, JUNGLE GEORGES, HOPPITY HOOPS AND FRACTURED FLICKERS. With Jay Ward Productions he was a writer, a voice man and Kibitzer-General of the whole company. <br /> <br /> The comic receives his only "voice" from the narrator, actor of Radio / Film / TV Marvin Miller. Remember it? It was Michael Anthony for TV Ssries THE MILLIONAIRE (Don Fedderson Productions / CBS Television Network, 1955-60). <br /> <br /> The bold color scheme and imaginative design have contributed to giving UPA animations a special sense of solitude, fearing apprehension and possible triumph. And, we could add, the animation is certainly of the "limited" variety. <br /> <br /> AS with so many great stories, ours starts with a simple premise; one is born different. In this case it is the young Gerald McCloy, who was born to create sound effects in communication rather than speaking. Children can be cruel and soon he is nicknamed with his nickname not so flattering by a group of young taunters who sing: "Nya, nya, your name is not McCloy, it's Gerald McBoing-Boing, the Noise Making Boy!" At this point, the animation team does an exceptional job of transforming emotional emotions into the marginalized young person from happy and carefree to isolated and alone and finally to depression and despair at not being able to turn to anyone for help and understanding; not even to his mother and father. <br /> <br /> A dark scene frighteningly fashionable that involves a highly UPA stylized loophole scene involving a train and an equally stylized Snowfall brings Gerald right to the brink of utter despair. But then, he is interrupted by a gentleman who announces that the young Gerald is wanted by the producer of some radio programs to provide the sounds for the show in the studio. <br /> <br /> ONCE the show of the first is done with Gerald protagonist in the Sound Department, part in a large Limousine (which seems to have anticipated those Stretch Limos of our days) to the applause and admiration of his companions class and the world. <br /> <br /> IT has been said that there are only so many plots and, in that case, this story is most likely a variant of The Ugly Duckling; after all, a sad and lonely boy finds his place in the world and true happiness. <br /> <br /> NOTE: United Productions of America, or UPA for short, was an exceptional center of creativity in the field of the Cartoon. They were responsible not only for GERALD McBOING-BOING and several sequels and a TV series, but also for the popular MR. MAGOO Theatrical cartoons and the subsequent TV program (with vocal talent by Jim Backus), the original TV cartoon from FROSTY THE SNOWMAN and the bizarre DICK TRACY Cartoon Show (with the voice of Tracy made by Mr. Everett Sloane!).
