Ich will save Herr Hacke f√ºr den Filme. Mein Deutsch ist nicht gut. Enschuldigen Sie. <br /> <br /> First of all, I didn't know how different the sound of Istanbul could be, even though I lived in Turkey. Frank Akin and Alexander Hacke took a different approach to Turkish music. , to see Istanbul and Istanbul Music from a foreign aspect had given the true meaning of the music itself. <br /> <br /> In this film I discovered how different our (Turkish) culture is, how interesting our artists are, and how much respect they deserve. Unfortunately no one has been able to serve this type of documentary before.
