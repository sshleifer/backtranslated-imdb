I saw it for the first time on the Thames television and I loved it. Later I saw a terrible article from someone who certainly hadn't looked at it or listened to it. So, I bought a copy and then bought another copy! The only sad thing is that it is not available on PAL VHS or DVD Region 2. The Australian version is fantastic, but this one is better! I could buy another .............
