1959 was a landmark in the world of cinema. Several great directors of the classical era were releasing career classics that ranked among the best. Just a look at the titles is instructive, North By Northwest by Hitchcock, Some Like It Hot by Billy Wilder, Rio Bravo by Howard Hawks, Imitation of Life by Douglas Sirk. Add a couple of the previous year, Touch of Evil by Orson Welles, Vertigo by Hitch and Wind Across the Everglades by Nick Ray, and you got a pretty good summary of what was possible in the classic Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> At the same time, two films have appeared that have suggested a completely new way of making films. One was the breath of Jean-Luc Godard, the other was John Cassavetes Shadows. The two films had certain things in common, largely improvised acting by non-stars, portable cameras, low budgets and a certain youthful and lively bravado. In certain ways, however, they could not be more distant. Godard was still a supporter of the director as a style referee. He knew more about the film than most Hollywood producers, and Breathless was full of the iconography of the classic crime film. Cassavetes, on the other hand, was an actor and a refugee from the underground theater scene in New York. His first film shows him little impressed by the cinema and a great supporter of the actors. Godard's film constantly refers to his own artifice, while Shadows aims at a certain type of naturalism. <br /> <br /> He does not reach it, mainly because naturalism is a myth, particularly in cinema. But he feels powerful, kinetic but cadenced like the cool jazz on the soundtrack, certainly the main inspiration for the film style shown here. In the end it doesn't hold up, mainly because Cassavetes 'actors are amateur beatniks, where Cassavetes' style requires strong and imaginative actors. His latest works with Gena Rowlands, Ben Gazarra and Peter Falk take him out of the water. Due to the director's technical inexperience, some parts of the dialogue have been redesigned later, which defeats the freshness of improvisation. Yet it is fascinating to look at, both for the great moments (such as the scene in which Leila Goldoni talks about her disappointment at having lost her virginity) and to look at an innovative artist who finds her way.
