I thought this film was highly undervalued. The subject seems a bit strange, and at first I was discouraged, but once I was watching the movie, it didn't seem strange at all. I was fascinated by all the different possibilities that history had to offer and I couldn't wait to find out how it would end. Once it was over ... I thought about it a long time later. I enjoyed everything about K-Pax, from acting and history and scientific elements and psychological issues to the end. It is not a particularly optimistic or happy film, even if from time to time it makes you laugh out loud, but I found it particularly amusing and stimulating. Now I own it and I intend to watch it several times.
