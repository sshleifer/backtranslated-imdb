After reading the other comment on this superb piece of television drama, I felt compelled to balance things a little. If you like murders, the signature and the serial, your cops to be British, and to shout a lot, and the blood to be bloody and have a religious cut then this hits every button. Not quite enough to want to put the screams in the rarefied heights of Sweeney, but otherwise much appreciated. Ken Stott is excellent as a "policeman on the edge" and even the guest stars are well selected, including Edward Woodward and Art Malik. Recommended. (In response to previous comments, although I accept that "Red" does not "normally" dispel a blow and flee, he had just witnessed his brother's arrest for murder, and I am pretty sure he does not see the boy's movement.
