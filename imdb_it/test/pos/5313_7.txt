After stabbing a retarded boy, the tormented, pessimistic 15-year-old Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) is sent to juvenile detention. His teacher and aspiring writer Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle) approaches and tries to understand it, first with the intention of writing a book, and later becoming his friend. Leland slowly reveals his sad view of the world, showing that he is a sociopath. <br /> <br /> "The United States of Leland" is a depressing and interesting study of a character. The compelling script with a low rhythm reveals pieces of history like a puzzle; there are excellent lines and dialogues; the performances are great, even if the twenty-three Ryan Gosling does not convince as a fifteen-year-old teenager; but it seems like I'm missing a part to complete the puzzle and make "The United States of Leland" an unforgettable film. The disappointing clarification of the "why" for Leland's violent action against Ryan Pollard is neither convincing nor moving, in fact it shows that this character is a totally unbalanced sociopath with a strange and sick vision of the world. Also, the way Allen Harris gets Pearl's knife is ridiculous. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Mundo de Leland" ("The World of Leland")
