No blood, no sex (even if it exudes passion), no special effect, but only one of those pearls that cross the screen of your film when you are not really looking and attract your attention. <br /> <br /> Great acting, great scenery, great music, wonderful plot. If only there were many more films made like this! <br /> <br /> The sets move us over time and make us feel like we're there. <br /> <br /> The acting looks like in real life and elevates us to the level of awareness of "Tata", to which nobody is a lost cause, less than all the inhabitants of his house "halfway". <br /> <br /> Best of all is a true story of misfits who learn to "adapt". I was a little jealous of the good times that everyone seemed to have in the movie! Can we all spend some time in the babysitter's house?
