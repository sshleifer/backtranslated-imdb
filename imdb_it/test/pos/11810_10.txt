For all the spectators who have seen "The Cure" would agree with me on this comment which is a superb film and is very moving. Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro demonstrate their quality as stars in this film, along with Dexter's mother (Mazzello) Annabella Sciorra. <br /> <br /> When I first saw The Cure on TV, I didn't know what to expect, but as I watched this masterpiece, it quickly became clear what it was. Dexter, an 11-year-old boy with AIDS, sits in his backyard playing with his toys when one day he meets his neighbor Eric, who at first is a bit embarrassing for the two boys, but they soon good friends. <br /> <br /> During the film, I kept asking myself what would happen to the two boys, as they made me think. I wondered how on earth they would get to New Orleans, sitting on a door with a sea biscuit under which he was pulling an inflatable crocodile. There were other great scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> But the part that reached me was the part where Dexter's health started to deteriorate. You couldn't help but wonder if he could do it, but towards the end you'll find out. I thought about the first joke they played, that Dexter was really dead, obviously he wasn't, silly. But when the third one is playing, something is very wrong. Dexter doesn't get up to laugh or show any laughter. At that point the victim of their joke announces that poor Dexter is dead. In that part I lost it. I opened my eyes wide, and from that scene I was crying. You must only. As the end approaches, you begin to understand the loss of Eric and then the film ends with a nice note with the Dexters shoe slowly floating on the river. <br /> <br /> Overall this film was excellent. He has laughter, adventures, emotions and sadness etc. When you put it in a blender you get excellent, you have to watch a movie. Peter Horton did a great job directing this film and I think it's definitely one of his best. But for now I'll try to look for this movie on DVD, if it exists. Once again a superb film that will take you on an exciting word roll.
