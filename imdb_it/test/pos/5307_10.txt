This is a superb film and was immediately inserted into my top ten (believe me, I know the movies!). It is one of the films that really makes you think, not necessarily on the plot but on yourself! The film is about a 15-year-old (Leland Fitzgerald) who kills an autistic boy. is sent to the youth room where he meets Pearl Madison, his teacher. His relationship with Pearl grows slowly and in the end Pearl decides to write a story about Leland and his peers, but as he gets closer to discovering the reason for Lelands, he finds that he has to face his problems first. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie and a must see with great goblin music and a fantastic score! Watch it!
