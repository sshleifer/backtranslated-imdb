I saw this film for the first time in the early 1980s on cable. It was as unique as a statement about the sixties, culture, war, music, race and a lot of things that I'm sure I lost. However, about a year ago he returned to my life as I began to enjoy it with my son. He's a little young (9) for many of the themes it contains, but he understands that hippies are fun to watch, and he has the idea that the end is ironic. While I can't think of other films in this genre, it has a stand-alone genius that I love. It also does a unique justice in Central Park. Most musicals are lost on me, one way or another. "Tommy" was exaggerated and heavily taken in the direction, "Oliver" seemed to control the crowd on the silver screen, "The Wall" was a dribble so important and indulgent, but listening to "Failure of the Flesh" from Hair seems right for our times today, as it did in the eighties, as it should have in the 60s ... truly timeless.
