... and I'm so disappointed because I can't buy DVDs or VHS anywhere. <br /> <br /> It's kind of a mix of, Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors and Molly Ringwald is fabulous as the spoiled teenager. This was done when Molly was still a brunette, just before having a big hit with Pretty In Pink. I would certainly recommend it to everyone who likes a good clean family comedy, with an advantage! <br /> <br /> If someone has a copy, or knows where to find one ... please leave a message for me - it will be much appreciated.
