I'm so happy to have recorded this movie when it came out for the BBC last month! It shocked me, so strong and sincere. David Tennant is absolutely fabulous in this, even if his character is not always so easy to love or to identify. The final scene in which the song plays just broke my heart, those eyes .... <br /> <br /> I guess he made this film from the Dr. Who series, and that makes it even more than a result for me. I love Dr. Who yet I have seen absolutely nothing of him in the portrait of Mr. Tennants of this man who knows that he has changed and is struggling to create a sort of new identity and life. <br /> <br /> intense drama!
