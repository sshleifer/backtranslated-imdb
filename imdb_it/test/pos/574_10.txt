I'm glad this was the work of foreign filmmakers because they can't be accused of unfair prejudices. With absolutely no cause, the Jacksonville policemen are quick to judge in this case and choose the first black suspect to accuse the murder of a white foreign tourist. They chose a 15 year old. old boy who is almost as close to a saint as you could randomly find and then tease yourself trying to pin an unlikely case against him. In addition to the injustice resulting from the obvious prejudice, there is the question of 6 months of unfair imprisonment of a completely innocent black teenager. He asks a question whether as a society we should compensate those who are accused, imprisoned and subsequently found innocent. This docudrama is well done, professionally recorded and presented in a captivating package from which you will not want to take a 1 minute break. If you are interested in social justice, don't miss this. He certainly deserved his Oscar.
