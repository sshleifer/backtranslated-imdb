Supercarrier was my favorite movie in the late 1980s when it came out. My father recorded it for me and watched it all the time until my stepmother registered Oprah and my heart was torn. I'd like to know if or where I can get it. I looked for it I think they even came out with a Supercarrier 2. It wasn't as good as the 1st, but I'd like to have them all if I could find them. I don't think @ all that was a bad movie. It was a very interesting film with a lot of action, but somehow it had a plot of love story. The actors / actresses in the film were fantastic. It also helped me to understand that this is not just a man's world, but it is also the world of a woman and many women can do the same things if not more than what a man can do and women deserve a lot of respect for their duties.
