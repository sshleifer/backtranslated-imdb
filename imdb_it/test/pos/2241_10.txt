This is one of the best episodes of Doctor Who EVER. We have Cybermen, Cyber ​​conversion units (may frighten young children) and the rough doctor who does one of his best deeds. Bravo David Tennant. Good scenes as if it were a movie, with thrilling scenes in some streets, an invasion of the Cyberman and leaving the world different from ours, basically a 45-minute movie. <br /> <br /> Being part 2 of the Cybermen Rise, this would never be disappointed. With it it is accumulating until the final. <br /> <br /> The Doctor plus an evil enemy (Daleks, Cybermen, Master, Sontarans, Davros, Autons, or even Macra) is a battle to the death, just be careful with the small children watching this.
