The film was better than I expected. I was working on the film set for a short time when Damien was making this film. The gun fire, the stunt and the acting came out very well from the editing point of view. All the music wasn't that good. Better music would be on top of this movie. Some of the music sound like hippie days. Damien remembers that you have gangsters of violence like the old ones or hip hop would have done it. It was more realistic than the blood coming out of the blood. The casting was very well chosen. The successful film did a good job in this film. The film reminded me of a lifestyle I use to live. But in the end you don't always win. And in my story it went like this. I adapted to the film the first time I saw it. Congratulations to this film.
