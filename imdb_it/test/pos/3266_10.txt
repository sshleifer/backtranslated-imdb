A refreshing black comedy with some of Australia's best. In the same way that Lock Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels captured the fun side of London gangsters, Two Hands tears up the underworld of Sydney. It wouldn't be so funny if it wasn't so close to the bone. <br /> <br /> An Australian classic. If Australia could rip more rabbits like this, it could really have a film industry that is worth keeping an eye on.
