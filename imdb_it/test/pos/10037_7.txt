This film is good for entertainment purposes but is not historically reliable. If you're looking for a movie and you think to yourself "Oh, I want to learn more about Custer's life and his last position", don't rent "They died with their boots". But if you'd like to see a movie for the pleasure of an old western movie, with a little romance and just for a good story, this is a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Custer (Errol Flynn) the first day at West Point. Everyone loves his charming personality which allows him to get by with almost everything. The film follows his career from West Point and his numerous battles, including his battle in the Civil War. The film ends with his latest stand at Little Big Horn. Among the battle scenes, he finds love and marriage with Libby (Olivia De Havilland). <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays the arrogant, but sweet George Armstrong Custer. Olivia De Havilland plays the pretty and sweet Libby very well, especially in the flirting scene that Custer and Libby meet for the first time. Their on-screen chemistry made you believe in their love story. The acting in general was impressive, in particular the comic (though stereotyped) role of Callie played by Hattie McDaniel. His character will surely make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Heroic war music highlighted the excitement of the battle scenes. The beautiful costumes set the tone of the era. The script was sometimes trivial, although the film was still enjoyable to watch. The portrait of Custer's director was a hero and the story shows that it is questionable. Some will watch this movie and see Custer as a hero. The others will watch this movie and learn to hate it. <br /> <br /> I dedicate a comment to this 1942 western movie.
