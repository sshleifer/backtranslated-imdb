I loved this show. Ten minutes before closing I left the pub and ran down the street to get it. I remember the sketch of Daniel Peacock on Gandhi in the newsstands as a masterpiece. The set design and lighting were out of this world, creating an atmosphere where you really felt alive. Unusual for a comedy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I met only one other person (apart from the other reviewer here) who ever knew this program existed. In fact I have to thank the IMDb for starting to exist and proving that I had not actually imagined the whole series in a drunken fog, that I was seriously starting to believe!
