I included this second version of "The man who knew too much" in my 10 Hitchcock films. Along with "Frenzy", it is probably the most discussed film among Hitchcock fans. I consider it much better than, say, "Rebecca", which has gained unreasonably much appreciation. <br /> <br /> The film contains many ingenious scenes (most of them have been mentioned in other reviews), but it is something to be expected from Hitchcock. It takes almost half an hour before things really start to happen, but that time is used to prepare the following events, which are full of intriguing suspense. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the clumsy rear-projections, the only weakness of this film is the main villain, played by Bernard Miles, who is a rather flat and undeveloped character. Fortunately, there is a terrifying killer in the form of Reggie Nalder. And Hank, the kid, is not as irritating as most kids in old movies are.
