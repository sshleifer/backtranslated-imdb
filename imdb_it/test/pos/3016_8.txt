I don't want to get into a critique of the film I think it is - for a film with a big budget - rather exceptional and bold. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to emphasize that I'm really fed up with the policies of the different states and laws that treat their viewers like children. In the database we find at least 4 different versions of the film based on the execution time. But obviously, there are likely to be much more different cuts. <br /> <br /> The result is a complete confusion and you can never be sure of talking about the same movie (unless you live in Argentina where the film lasts 115 minutes, which seems quite complete. <br /> <br /> Later on DVD and Video, the studios try to rob us further by selling us an alleged directorial cut (in Germany, there is already such a version around, running about 110 minutes). <br /> <br /> It would be nice if the studios didn't only think about the money they make with their films, but also think about their products as a work of art, even at the risk of an unfavorable evaluation, so that I as a spectator should not feel cheated and taken seriously, not just as a resource of money.
