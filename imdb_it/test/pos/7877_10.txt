Oh man, this movie is incredible, it's very beautiful is a story about a man who doesn't accept blacks so much, he sits in a bar while drinking the night and complains about hippies who are against the war, and how blacks and the hippies do not deserve any control over welfare. This film is very realistic, because it portrays a boy "Joe" who represented many boys then, and even now. The story is so ... Joe is in a bar and shrugs off a rich guy who just accidentally killed his daughter's hippy boyfriend. And this rich man goes to the bar to rethink what he just did, and while he does it, "Joe" is in the bar in the grip of hippies and people who are against the war. The rich boy accidentally tells Joe that he killed a hippie; and obviously joe applauds the rich, Cause Joe hates hippies, Incredible movie look at him to see what happens next. I liked this movie because it reminded me of those days in the early 1970s, I liked the way the movies were shot back then, at that time, very good stuff, it's not like in today's movies. Basically the film gives you an inner look into the mind of the protagonist "Joe". I like the theme of the movie ....... on the man who works, who is breaking his ass trying to make a living
