I just came out of a preliminary screening, and wow was the hilarious movie. Perhaps better than the first, but at least it's the same. If you don't like idiots, or really useless amounts of male nudity (much more than in the first), then stay away, far away. But if you dig the whole thing about Jackass, then this movie won't disappoint. Toro Totter is the greatest invention ever. OK. so my review wasn't long enough ... All I have to say is poor, poor Dunn, they really kicked him like this. So, if you like masochistic humor and prolific male nudity, and by far the most disgusting female nudity of all time (John Waters is involved, do I need to say more?) Then this movie will keep you in a daze. I never stopped laughing, and actually I got soaked with sweat.
