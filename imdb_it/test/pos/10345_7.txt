Nynke is a classy movie in the same style as the Oscar-winning film (1997). But this comparison immediately pushes me to add that the latter was much more exciting ... <br /> <br /> Of course, Nynke is a beautiful costume and historical drama (with a fantastic performance by Monic Hendrickx!) In which witnessed the personal growth of "Nynke van Hichtum" in his marriage to Pieter Jelles Troelstra. The subtitle of this film is "a love". So it starts and ends with their marriage. <br /> <br /> But this is where the director makes a crucial mistake! Nynke's exciting and independent life began when the marriage ended. He has written several books for children and has traveled all over the world. What a beautiful life he lived. But Pieter Verhoeff puts Nynke back in the trap of the convention that depressed her and that she had struggled to get out: the thought that her life prolonged her marriage with Troelstra, being nothing but the mother of their children. <br /> <br /> We all hope for Nynke II!
