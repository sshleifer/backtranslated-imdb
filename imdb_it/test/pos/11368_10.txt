I saw this on KQED, with Frank Baxter commenting as a souvenir. I've never seen it since, but I'd like to find out where it's available. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how good something can be, but be black and white and have zero special effects. In fact, amazing how much BETTER is something like that!
