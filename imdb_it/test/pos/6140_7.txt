I hadn't planned to see this movie, but I wasn't disappointed when a friend dragged me. Although there are no big surprises here, the boys do quite well with their obviously modest budget. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the trailer you probably know what to expect from this kind of movie and there's a nice constant stream of jokes here, with a couple of classic moments, with the pinnacle that was probably a excellent flashback of what boys were like in the 80s. Also, I read elsewhere that the ending was a disappointment, but I found it very different from what I expected from this genre. <br /> <br /> In general, this film will not change your life, but it has enough Ride there to keep you entertained for everything.
