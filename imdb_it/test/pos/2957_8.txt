Clayton Moore made his last official appearance on the screen as Masked Man in the epic adventure of director Lesley Selander "The Lone Ranger and the lost city of gold", played by Jay Silverheels as his faithful Indian explorer Tonto. Selander was an old hand to lead westerns during his 40 years in film and television with over 100 westerns to his directorial career. This frenetic opera has embraced a revisionist perspective in its depiction of Native Americans that was gradually gaining acclaim from the 1950s in Hollywood aviators after director Delmar Daves led the way with James Stewart's western film "Broken Arrow". Racial intolerance is the main theme of the screenplay by Robert Schaefer and Eric Freiwald. Having written 13 episodes of the television series "The Lone Ranger", Schaefer and Freiwald were both familiar with the formula, but they raised the stakes for this theatrical release. Our vigilant heroes ride to the aid of Indians who are murdered by white hooded hombres for no apparent reason. The mystery of these killers' identities and the reason behind their murderous behavior is revealed early enough, so you don't have to guess what's going on. <br /> <br /> Although the violence in this Selander saga seems to have been tamed by contemporary standards, the fact that the Lone Ranger shoots a villain to kill in a scene rather than hurt and that a woman looks like an accomplice at double crossing throwing a tomahawk that sinks into his back between the shoulder blades was rather bold. The television series never went that long, and when the Lone Ranger brandished his six-shot gun, he shot the gun from the villain's fist rather than blasting it off. The other discrepancy here is that the Indians lynch one of the marauders and torture him for information, but they are never reported with the accusation of abducting this henchman. Douglas Kennedy did not have the evil statue of Lyle Bettger that threatened director Stuart Heisler's "The Lone Ranger" masked man, but recovered quite well from a cowardly outlaw who kills one of his own henchmen without the slightest scruple when the unbeliever threatens to divulge his name and the identities of his friends to a band of vengeful Indians. <br /> <br /> "Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold" opens with a summary of the origin of the masked protagonist in an ambush in the Texas Ranger and his transformation into Lone Ranger with Tonto as his companion. This two-minute opening update is a great way to start a series-oriented character so that everyone, including non-Lone Ranger fans, is at par. The main plot of a band of ruthless white hoodies to wear and called "not surprisingly" the Hooded Raiders begins with them killing Indians and stealing medallions worn around their necks. The Lone Ranger and Tonto arrive too late to intervene, but find a child hidden nearby. Taking the child and the dead Indian, they go to a nearby Spanish mission under the supervision of Father Vincente Esteban (Ralph Moody of "The Outsider") and give him the child and the body. Initially, the Father must assure an Indian maiden, Paviva (Lisa Montell of "Gaby"), that the masked man does not mean harm to them and is their friend. Father sends Tonto to town to fetch the doctor, Dr. James Rolfe (Dean Fredericks of "Gun Fever"), and Tonto promptly gets himself into trouble in the form of a taciturn citizen, Sheriff Oscar Matthison (Charles Watts of "Giant "), which abhors the Indians. Tonto tries to see the doctor who is treating the prisoners in the sheriff's prison and Matthison's men start to annoy him when Rolfe intervenes and returns to the mission. <br /> <br /> In the end, the Lone Ranger and Tonto are able to capture one of the Raid Hooded, but an Indian Redbird (Maurice Jara of "Drum Beat"), and his combat companions kidnap the henchmen and take them back to their village. They beat him and shoot arrows to loosen his tongue. Bad boss Ross Brady (Douglas Kennedy of "Hell's Crossroads") and his cohort William (Lane Bradford of "Devil's Canyon") go to the village and Brady uses his Winchester to kill his captured henchman. Brady doesn't know that his henchman spoke. Lone Ranger and Tonto arrive shortly after and reproach Redbird for his treachery. Redbird tells them what the man said before he died and the Lone Ranger decides to adopt a disguise so he can learn more. He masquerades as a gentleman of bounty hunter with mustache and fake Southern accent. Despite the concise 83-minute run, "The Lone Ranger and Lost City of Gold" lacks neither excitement nor surprises. Selander keeps the action going at a gallop. The dialogue is largely expository rather than memorable, as Schaefer and Freiwald push the plot more often than spring surprises, but there is a big surprise that binds to the good Indian theme. There is also a scene in which the Lone Ranger pushes his belief in justice available to all under the law at a time when the head of the Supreme Court Earl Warren had taken the fundamental decisions of the supreme court that recognized and mitigated the conditions of the racial segregation, civil rights, church and state separation and police arrest in the United States. One thing that differentiates "The Lone Ranger and Lost City of Gold" from its predecessor is its epic scale with flashbacks at the time of the Spanish conquistadors with a bit of science fiction involved in the form of a destructive meteor. Generally, the stories of Lone Ranger were limited to the nineteenth century without dragging them into European history. No, the Lone Ranger was not the first film to deal with the Spanish conquistadors. "The Seven Cities of Gold" by Robert D. Webb (1955) concerned the Spaniards who sought the southwest for the homonymous places, but Selander's western beat "Gold of the Seven Saints" (1961) by Gordon Douglas on the screen .
