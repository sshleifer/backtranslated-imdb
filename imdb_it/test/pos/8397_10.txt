Gone with the wind is one of the most popular books ever printed. It is by far the film of all films. The love story between Scarlett and Rhett has made people dream all over the world and turned the main actors into cinematographic icons. You may ask, is it really necessary to make a sequel? And ... there are some great shoes to fill. <br /> <br /> Well, first there was the book. Alexandra Ripley's 'Scarlett' is, we must admit, well written and in full respect of the world created by Margaret Mitchell. It picks up exactly where we left our heroine before and leads us kindly from Mitchell's legacy in his fantasy. In the book Scarlett, defeated after Melanie's death and Rhett's departure, she goes to Charleston to reside with her mother-in-law in the hope of regaining Rhett's love. His typical manipulative behavior once again evokes much criticism from Rhett and further distances them ... to a certain boat trip that will change everything. Scarlett now carries a secret. The series follows the book fairly carefully until Scarlett's arrival in Ireland. Since then, the book and the series have split slowly. The actual end is different, but obviously both have Scarlett and Rhett together again. <br /> <br /> Production of the series was announced with a worldwide search for the next Scarlett O'Hara. Many countries have made their television programs with young actresses who auditioned for the part. In the end, about twelve girls were chosen to take part in the final tests and interviews in Atlanta, Georgia. Unfortunately, the producer did not find Rossella among these actresses. Sad for the girls, great publicity for the show (it had already been sold to many TV stations around the world before filming also began). Robert Halmi, the producer who bought the rights to "Scarlett", said he discovered the right actress while watching TV, called her and two days later signed the agreement. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer (who starred in "Willow" and "Scandal", the last of which is the movie that Robert Halmi was watching that faithful evening) is not Vivien Leigh, but it is certainly Scarlett! His performance is not a copy of Leigh, but makes his character. The main difference between GWTW and 'Scarlett' is the fact that the protagonist evolves and grows as a person. This is the prerogative of the series, why copy something that has been done before? Considering that there is a difference of almost seventy years between the first and second plot, it is natural that both authors emphasize the different aspects of the characters. While Mitchell works with Scarlett to the consequences of the civil war and fights for Tara, Ripley leaves Rossella to face his demons. For me this is the most interesting aspect of the series, we learn to know Scarlett in a different way as she learns that not everything can always go the way she wants. I totally agree with Timothy Dalton's choice as Rhett Butler. He portrays it with charm and irony and is less of a cartoon figure than Clark Gable's performance. The rest of the cast was well chosen. Julie Harris is as captivating as Rhett's mother, John Gielgud makes a very funny performance like grandfather Robillard and Sean Bean is always at his best playing a dirty character, his Lord Fenton is no exception. However, poor choices with Stephen Collins as the adaptation of Ashley and Ann-Margret of Belle Watling was a waste of money. Costumes, sets and places are elaborate and convincing. The newly built Tara set looked exactly the same and is a moving sequence in the series when the house first appears. <br /> <br /> There's a point in making a sequel ... Well, six hours of romance are for me. One to watch!
