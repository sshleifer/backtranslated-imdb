Being a "Wallace and Gromit fan", I was looking forward to this feature film. Surprisingly I saw it at THE world-premiere in Vlissingen (NL), at the Film by the Sea festival. A wonderful feeling to be one of the first to see this movie very funny and cheerful. It's about Wallace and Gromit (which I think need no introduction) with their pest control company in the city that hosts a giant vegetable contest in a few days. Everyone, including an eccentric baroness, hopes that his giant carrot or melon will win the golden carrot. Unfortunately the city is plagued by a lot of hungry rabbits. This is where W & G comes into play. They have their fucking gadgets to control these funny creatures in a human way. <br /> <br /> It's a very funny and colorful story. Anyone who has enjoyed the three short films in the process of W & G (which are more than big!), Will adore this feature film. Nick Park has really produced a wonderful and original result with a great sense of humor. As in Chicken Run, it really amazes me how it is able to capture so many stories and emotions in just a few frames. "Job well done, boy" ;-) Oh yes: the music was fantastic! Really complete the race. To enjoy!
