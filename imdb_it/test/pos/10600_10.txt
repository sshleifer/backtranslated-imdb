One word for this. Funny. I haven't seen movies like this in a long time. At some points in the film, I completely forgot that it was a movie, I felt like I went back to watching Viva La Bam, or even to say, my friend went through something like that. It was realistic and I liked how Bam, Ryan, Raab, Rake and Brandon and the rest of the guys didn't try too hard to act. They, for me, were behaving like their famous idiots. There were some scenes that I loved more than others, like Raab in the shower, holy, I laughed so hard. Honestly he was probably my favorite character besides Bam. He, in my opinion, made the film a little more fun. Basically it is a must see for all CKY crew fans:]
