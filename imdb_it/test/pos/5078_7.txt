In this day and age where almost all other news is about discussions on waterboarding, images of Abu Ghraib or tales of forced detentions in Guantanamo Bay, Gavin Hood's "Rendition" is an updated and timely film edition as it is always likely that come out of the mills of traditional Hollywood cinema. It is not, for any reason, a perfect film, but it does not even deserve the opposition it has received at the hands of critics of the whole ideological and political spectrum. <br /> <br /> The term "rendition" refers to the CIA's ability to arrest any individual suspected of terrorist relations, thus secretly taking them away to a foreign country to interrogate and torture them for an indefinite period of time, the all without a fair legal process. Anwar El-Ibrahimi is an Egyptian man who has lived in the United States for twenty years. He has an American wife, a young son and a new baby on the way. He looks like a very unlikely candidate for a terrorist, yet one day, without warning or explanation, Anwar is captured and taken to a secret location where he is subjected to brutal torture until he admits his involvement with a terrorist organization that Anwar states to know nothing about. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, "Rendition" falters from time to time in its narrative skills, often biting a little more than it can chew in terms of both plot and character. The apparent focal point is Douglas Freeman, a CIA recruit agent who is led to observe "the interrogation" of Anwar by Egyptian officials. The problem is that, as conceived by the writer Kelley Sane and played by Jake Gyllenhaal, Freeman seems too naive "boy scout" to become a very plausible agent, and he is not given enough time for the screen to develop completely as a character. We know little about him at the beginning and even less, apparently, at the end. "Go through the movements", but we learn very little about the inner man. So, without a strong center of gravity to keep it all together, the film occasionally seems as if it would come off at the joints, with elements of history flying in all directions. A similar problem occurs with Anwar's distraught wife, played by Reese Witherspoon, a woman we never know much beyond what we can see on the surface. Gyllenhaal and Witherspoon have both shown themselves to be good actors in other circumstances, but here they are surrounded by a restrictive script that rarely lets them go beyond a single recurring note in their performances. <br /> <br /> What makes "Rendition" a powerful film in the end, however, is the extreme seriousness of the subject and the way in which two simultaneously running plot lines fit together elegantly into one another in the closing parts of the film. It could be a bit more artificial than perhaps we would have liked on this subject, but, hey, this is Hollywood after all, and the film has to pay SOME deference to the expectations of the mass audience if it wants to be green, not to mention of daylight as a completed project. <br /> <br /> Two of the support performances are particularly compelling in the film: Omar Metwally who makes the terror of a cultured man in a Kafkaesque nightmare real life he can't awaken, and Yigal Naor who creates a surprisingly complex character from the head interrogator / torturer. Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Peter Sarsgaard also make their marks in small roles. A special mention should also be made of Dion Beebe's warm and richly colored cinematography. <br /> <br /> Does the film oversimplify problems? Probably. Stack the deck in favor of the torture victim and against evil government forces? Definitely. (One wonders how he would have interpreted the film if Anwar was really a terrorist). Yet the film has the courage to beat on controversial ground. He is not afraid to raise thorny issues or risk disapproval of some for the political positions he takes. The problem of how a nation adheres to its conquered principle of "civil liberties for all" in the face of terrorism and fear is openly raised. And how much courage does it take for people of good will to finally get up and say "enough is enough", even at the risk of being brand-gratifying and unpatriotic terrorists by the powerful? (The film also in no way denies the reality of extreme Islamic terrorism). <br /> <br /> So refusing "Rendition" would have been to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. "Rendition" may not be perfect, but it is good, and it has something important to say about the world we live in now. And this alone is worth seeing.
