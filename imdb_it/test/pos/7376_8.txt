I originally published the first user comment on this film, and I stated that it was crap and made no sense. I DIDNT MAKE SENSE. The story of the bonfire is a film that enjoys great satisfaction (now that I have more than 2 years and I saw it last night). The actors were famous but not too famous. The acting itself was more than acceptable, it was pretty good. I will evaluate the film by movie segment. <br /> <br /> 1) The black and white scene (AKA- "The Hook") This was pretty useless, it looked good, but it didn't hold much grip, the only disappointing one, I don't think it was included as a segment. Here's the scare-o-meter. <br /> <br /> --- --- (Poor) <br /> <br /> 2) The RV Story (honeymoon stuck in the woods) Probably the most fun of all the stories, acting is it was good in this too, disappointing for the typical caravan sex scenes. Yet it was intriguing, think "Whoever knocked on the door". He had a suspense, and not too much cruosina. I liked it <br /> <br /> -------------- ------------ (Very good) <br /> <br /> 3 ) Internet Chat Tale (Little Girl Meets Psycho) This was an intelligent addition, a gore left to a minimum, a scare left to EXTREME. Although boring at times, the last few minutes were the most fun, don't get me wrong it was still fun to watch. Really creepy, and it could happen to anyone, so look who you are talking to. <br /> <br /> --------------------------- (Very good) <br /> <br /> 4) Ghost Such (Man kisses the ghost) ?? It wasn't the best, it wasn't too suggestive for a ghost story. This was strange, the aspects were pretty good, he played music and screamed, but everything was too real to be spooky, even if it was good, it was silent and bloody, and could have been better with this idea. <br /> <br /> ------------- (Acceptable) <br /> <br /> 5) The Ending (the 4 lost teenagers) These are the 2 attractive girls and boys that tell the stories through the film. The best thing about the film is definitely the ending, it gave a great impression, the ending was totally unexpected. Look at it, it was so well done, the realism was spectacular. <br /> <br /> ----------------------------------- (TOP NOTCH) <br / > <br /> 6) THE OVERALL FILM Bonfire stories was more than I took it, I really like it a lot now I'm buying it on video, because it's a really fun horror film to forget the Sin you see these days, like many, I was disappointed that this was really not going anywhere, it was directly to the video, for me it was better than all the hype "I rror" you see these days. Overall for Campfire Tales <br /> <br /> ----------------------------- (Very Good) <br /> < br /> 8 out of 10
