Bob Cummings is excellent at this, as this technically brilliant Hitchcock movie has no reputation for some of his other films, but is still very watchable today. Priscilla Lane demonstrates in this that she can stand comparison with other blondes who worked with Hitchcock later. He made only a handful of films after this that makes it almost forgotten today. <br /> <br /> There are sequences in this that will remind the viewer of the frames in the director's subsequent films. The acting is so well done and the story is so well made that this movie is still a lot of fun today. Every person in the cast behaves well. There are several great backgrounds in the movie in black and white. <br /> <br /> This was the first Universal for Hitchcock movie. In the long run among the feature films he did at Universal, in addition to the television series, Hitchcock would have made as much box office for the studios as anyone worked there. This fact is lost in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Norman Lloyd is considered the real villain in this film. The story moves very well, including Hitchcock's only western filmed sequence. This film is very good with a lot of great work from everyone who did it.
