The Thing is a milestone in filmmaking and remains one of my favorite movies of all time. Despite the film's roots in science fiction, it is ultimately a horror film that brilliantly balances the splatter with psychological trauma. Today, more than twenty-five years after its release, the special effects stand as an example of pure brilliance and effects: the Rob Bottin man has suffered a complete physical exhaustion for his art. It would be impossible to make the same film today, as the Studio will surely insist on casting a female character or a Paul-Walker type. <br /> <br /> An American men's science team in Antarctica is agitated when an alien life form that can perfectly absorb and imitate other life forms infiltrates their field. Their mutual trust is constantly crumbling as they become increasingly uncertain as to who is real and who is an imitation, and this scenario of "body tearing" sees their number steadily decline as one by one, falling victim to The Thing . When cornered, it manifests itself as a different nightmare creature, the always horrible and compelling metamorphosis. <br /> <br /> The impotence, isolation and claustrophobia of a team of desperate men with no way out of their situation and no way of helping them reach them is expertly supported. The long hours of darkness and the increasing snowfall provide a dark background to the terror that unfolds. Director John Carpenter has carefully selected a team of brilliant actors and each member of the team fits perfectly into the role they play, be it the wise young chef, the wise old doctor or the bitter and cynical pilot helicopter . The point is that nobody here comes close to being an all-American superhero with blonde locks and a six-pack and the real strength of the film is in no small part thanks to this crude realism. People who suffer on the screen are recognizable in our daily life. <br /> <br /> The Thing remains pleasantly engaging and engaging even after repeated visions. Now I've seen the film on more than twenty different occasions and my astonishment at the quality of the director, acting and special effects is unshakable. My girlfriend prefers the spin-off of the film high school - The Faculty - which is good and solid entertainment but much lighter and melancholy. She still loves and recognizes the splendor of The Thing, and thank God ... Because I couldn't stay in the company of someone who didn't love this movie. <br /> <br /> A classic and then some.
