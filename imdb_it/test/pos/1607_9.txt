I can't explain why I find this so fascinating and "Il Gattopardo" no; it could be because the attention here is on everything that was great with that film, those intimate moments that Visconti can render so beautifully. Like that movie, it has a masterly slow pace, but this time it's not too long. It is the kind of film in which nothing happens, but twenty minutes pass like this. I think this is due in part to the way the film treats the flashbacks that represent their mini-story. Like "Il Gattopardo", it has a nice character that brings out the same kind of worn pathos - even if Bogard's performance is more likely to open up to being unlikely, especially in the look: he has a really stupid smile that is easy to to love. It is often quite beautiful in quiet moments. It is the opulence of Visconti's films, the size of the ball scenes, which I find boring, while they exchange individual clarity with mass precision. But here, this is part of the point - Gustav surrounded by a visual noise. <br /> <br /> The way we are presented with the object of Gustav's affection is quite brilliant: the camera shows a girl, girl, girl, then this beautiful boy with feminine characteristics. It's like an allusion to Shakespeare's sonnets, and it doesn't seem heavy. (It's not until the camera sees Tadzio completely, it pulls back and we see its long, slender legs, that we realize it's not a boy, but a teenager - at first we're forced to question the attraction of Gustav in an uncomfortable way, Visconti must have known, and he is not far from it.) Visconti is extremely patient with Gustav; we have the perception of man, we know it. It is a largely silent performance, and when it opens its mouth it is to vomit poison; no wonder he wants the angelic boy, with the opening functions, to project himself on. There is a difference with Tadzio (we never know it, just as we never know a handful of Fellini's grotesques, but because his life is another, his film), but it's not as provocative as it was made to seem (there is one scene, however, where it flips over a pole that is too much). Tadzio is not necessarily leading him - he is looking at him; Visconti does nothing but zoom. <br /> <br /> The film does not describe Gustav as a homosexual - Tadzio is not even a male, he is a prolific version of a boy (delicate, pale, thin, with golden clasps) that everyone seems to love (including a magnificent young man, a little older with whom he fights). The closest to showing what could be understood as a reference to Gustav's homosexuality is the famous barber scene, which unlocks its repressed vanity. <br /> <br /> It is not completely successful - the whole section with Alfred is a waste and some useless scenes, the people carrying long-drawn bags could have been removed. Some parts are heavy, such as when Gustav's boat enters and the rowdy boys pass him - the looks on his face are too obvious. (But during the same scene Gustav launches an attack, wanting a new rower, something so inexplicable to compensate.) But there are some scenes - which touch for the first time - that create a remarkable, silent intensity. Tadzio repeatedly repeating a song for piano, the trembling notes in the air, may be the best example of the film's anguish. Is there a discussion that contains a debate that I'm particularly interested in: can art be spiritual if it satisfies the senses or has to go beyond them? (We can consider Tarkovsky, who esteems both Visconti and Mann, as the first example of someone who goes beyond mere sensory sensations.) I think this can do both. 9/10
