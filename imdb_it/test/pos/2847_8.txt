Well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This film went from dramatic crime to goofball romantic comedy and then came back so fast that they looked like two different movies that were played simultaneously and then merged together again at the end. But they did it without problems, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (like the scalping scene) even the fun ones. I just threw up, but I guess it's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor. It has the ability to perform those dramatic soap scenes with the right facial expressions and vocal intonations. His scenes with Betty seem to come out of "Sleepless in Seattle" or some other romantic comedy of the genre. You almost forget that Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are looking for Betty. The charm of Morgan Freeman for Betty was rather disturbing, considering that it could be practically her grandfather, but the scenes she is conversing with her photography are certainly worth a laugh! Chris Rock's performance looks rather wooden, but it has its moments. Renee Zellweger is as sweet as Betty, the adorable waitress with her unfaithful and unfaithful husband who treats her like dirt. It is very unlikely that he actually got a job in a hospital without real credentials, but hey, it's a movie, follow it! Even her roommate, Rosa, shines like a woman caring for Betty, but she doesn't know how to deal with Betty's illness. And finally, there is Crispin Glover. As his fan, of course I thought the movie could have been more fun if there had been more. No one else has the same acting style as Crispin, and the argument between Chris Rock, Crispin and the soap opera sheriff is hilarious. I imagine that I liked this movie quite a bit! If you can stand blood, violence and a lot of vulgar language, it is worth looking at and will give you lots of laughs!
