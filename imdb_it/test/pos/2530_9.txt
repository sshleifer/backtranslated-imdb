For me, this is another one of those movies that I got to watch from the "Z" channel in Los Angeles when he was on duty. And it was another one of those movies I saw when I was young ... and I learned that there was a world out there ... one I didn't want to accept. <br /> <br /> Moving to Los Angeles and seeing international cinema has become my pastime of guilty pleasure and to date, no preview channel programming has matched the "Z" channel in its international film screening. The three international films that remained in my young head were "Spetters", "Beau Pere" and, of course, this "Pixote". <br /> <br /> This was the most shocking and saddest film I've ever seen in my life. This was also one of the first films that made me realize that there is a difference in cinema: entertaining and informing. I would like to be honest ... raised in a small town on the east coast, I had no idea of ​​anything like this - to this extent - existed. Everything I knew from South America was a brochure of fabulous Brazilian vacations and Columbia had a lot of drug trafficking. <br /> <br /> Then comes a movie like Pixote. Sad. Disturbing. Resolute. Frightening. You're watching: children. Those who need shelter, love, understanding and all this are a way to survive day by day through drugs, sex, stealing, stealing, sleeping on the streets and in sadistic houses for groups etc. Their survival is difficult to watch with other street children, prostitutes, etc., and you begin to wonder how things like this can happen in this world. Pixote is not an entertainment film, it is an information film. It shows shocking and disturbing images - but it shows life for these everyday street children.
