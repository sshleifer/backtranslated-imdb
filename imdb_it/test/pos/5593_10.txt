The terrific acting of the 5 stars makes it a must see. <br /> <br /> Based on a theatrical performance, THE SILVER CORD speaks of "maternal love" at its worst. The film was highly controversial because of its implicit homosexuality of the younger son and the mother's unnatural "romantic" feelings for both children. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne is the new bride (and biologist) who travels with her husband (Joel McCrea) to visit the family before going to New York for their new jobs. But something seems wrong. <br /> <br /> The mother, Laura Hope Crews, seems rude to the girlfriend of the younger son (Eric Linden) (Frances Dee). But Dunne puts these thoughts aside and ignores some of the strange things his mother says. Then he discovers that "his" room is down the hall from McCrea's, and his room is adjacent to his mother's room. <br /> <br /> Later she enters while "the mother" slips into McCrea and kisses him (on the lips) good night. Mom also worked on Linden and convinced him to doubt her feelings for Dee. Everything explodes and with Dee running in the snowy night towards the frozen pond. While the boys run behind her, the mother screams from the window for the boys to come back and take their coats! Dee falls through the ice and is saved. <br /> <br /> While the girls leave the house the following morning, Dunne lets his mother know what he thinks of her and her attachment to the boys. But the mother has a firm grip, a false illness and always boasts her sacrifices. The girls leave, but the boys fall behind ....... <br /> <br /> Crews is magnificent as a voracious mother (repeating her scenic role); it's a part that few actresses would dare play. Sexual nuances are incredible for a 1933 film and Crews takes advantage of his best film role. Dunne is also excellent as he tries to maneuver the course without losing McCrea. Dee has some excellent scenes after being downloaded from the lost Linden. All 5 stars are fantastic in this drama that is strangely underrated and unknown. <br /> <br /> A neglected gem for those who love acting big ......
