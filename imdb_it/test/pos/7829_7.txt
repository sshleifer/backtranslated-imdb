Snakes on a Plane was such a well publicized film that it was inevitable and a bit crazy to try to release another film with almost the same title in the same year, not to mention the same week. Reading the other comments here I see the results. Many people are angry. Crazy because it doesn't have the best special effects. Crazy because he doesn't have a star cast. Crazy because they wanted to see Samuel Jackson say "I'm sick of these M ^ * & * &% - Er F * ^ (^% - Ing Snakes on this M ^ * & * &% - Er F * ^ (^% -Ing Train "! <br /> <br /> Well, this is certainly not Samuel Jackson's version. And maybe that's okay. <br /> <br /> Snakes on a Plane was lost in a cop movie and a horror movie, a action movies for the family and a bloody film of death Saturday Night Live artists laughed, while Jackson vowed enough to make a grandmother cover her ears, and as for the children they would be traumatized by violence . <br /> <br /> Snakes on a Train knew exactly what it was: it was a cheap horror movie on a train. Surely it had snakes and surely many of them were scientifically harmless snakes from garden with fake Rattler sound effects, but never once is a step missing in the plot or intentions in which the "on a Plane" version was stumbling went on itself from the first scene. <br /> <br /> I really liked the fun that Snakes on a Plane had to offer and I admit that "... on a train version it was a bit dry. But hey, in the trade, it was a interesting and unexpected story.This little horror movie could have gone much worse than it was. <br /> <br /> For this it gets 7 out of 10.
