Over the years it seemed to me to have lost this image of Ronald Reagan and, due to his recent move to the big screen in the sky, he was shown on TV recently. This is a low-budget B & W movie of the late 1930s, but it is very interesting to see how criminals used their talents to steal money from insurance companies with false claims during this particular period of time. I was surprised by the role played by Ronald Reagan (Eric Gregg), "The Killer's, '64, along with a great veteran movie star, Sheila Bromley, (Nona Gregg)," Nightmare Circus ", '73, which was a great supporting actor, it was a great film that showed that Ronald Reagan was a very young man who was reaching the stars of his Hollywood career at that time God Bless HIM!
