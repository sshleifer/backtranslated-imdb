I guess I don't have too much to add. I found the comedy still fun after more than ten years since it came out. <br /> <br /> The only thing I noticed was the music during the distracting dialogue and often made the movie more engaging than it should have been. The use of the songs is fine during the film, but the orchestral background is too busy, too invented and if the film were ever to be edited for DVD, I would seriously recommend that the background music be attenuated to an almost imperceptible level. It has weakened the general feeling of the whole film and I unconsciously see why so many people have passed it on. <br /> <br /> The film has had many levels of work for the script, the plot and the comedy level. Too bad the producer and director felt they needed the musical schlock to improve the mood. Now knowing this, I find it difficult to watch and curse quietly anyone involved in the musical editing in the film. It had all the subtlety of a jackhammer.
