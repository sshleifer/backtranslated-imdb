If you are also slightly interested in war between states, it is worth watching this film. It is a great historical tale. No flashing sabers, no cavalry charges, no carnage - just the story of a sad group of Union soldiers stumbling over a confederate woman's farm and her son, taking what their captain's conscience allows. This quantity moves up and down as events unfold that influence his sense of humanity in conflict with his sense of duty to his men and his cause. In the end, he reaches a compromise that none of us would be difficult to achieve. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the historic treatment of the Kentucky war, a slave state that tried to remain neutral but ultimately opted to remain in the Union under mysterious political circumstances involving the detention of some legislators. About half of Kentucky's soldiers fought on each side, but there has never been much treatment of what it was like to live there in those moments. This film makes a great contribution simply in the "look and feel" of time and place.
