Aaliyah blows all the female cast members out of the water, including the official love interest of Marguerite Moreau. I would have liked to see this film as Akasha's journey of power. Aaliyah is simply electrifying whenever it is on the screen. She is sensual, beautiful and threatening to the power of 10. Watching her take on a bar full of vampires is a sight to behold. <br /> <br /> Lena Olin is in the ungrateful role of "the oldest woman", which is extremely unjustified. It looks fantastic and at 46 (according to the IMDb) it still looks stunning. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the plot is very limited to plot, we have seen everything before, etc. <br /> <br /> The most exciting moment is the scene of Akasha's death, especially keeping in mind what happened to Aaliyah after the shoot. <br /> <br /> All in all, an extraordinary vampire movie.
