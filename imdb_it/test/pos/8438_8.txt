I rented "The China Syndrome" recently mainly because I read that it was this film that inspired ABC to make "The Day After". "Syndrome", however, is more of a thriller than a drama. The film is quite political, but I strongly agree with its message: nuclear energy, although extremely efficient, is too dangerous for common use. The risks are simply too high. It is hoped that those responsible for real nuclear power plants will be much more responsible and ethical than those represented in the film. However, given that the real disaster of real life at Three Mile Island happened a few months after the release of this film, he questions it. (In all honesty, that case was probably more about incompetence than corruption.) <br /> <br /> The "syndrome" is not only critical of nuclear power, but also of modern media, similar in vein to "Network", only much more serious. Being a press journalist myself, I am quite familiar with the way people perceive media; but it was a bit scary to see that even in the 70s the newscasts were already running out. When the character of Jane Fonda tries to convince her boss to let her do real news instead of fluff, she is advised not to try the change, as "research" finds that people prefer a cute girl to fluff, not news hard. > <br /> What makes the film truly memorable, however, is the incredible suspense generated in its third final. During this period, the viewer is constantly worried about the lives of the protagonists, whether the danger comes from hired hooligans or from the potential fusion of the nuclear power plant. And that last scene - I won't give it away, of course - but it will keep you guessing. <br /> <br /> On a final note, I had a distinct feeling watching the movie that seemed more like a TV movie than a real movie. This could, however, be due more to the fact that the rental tape I was looking at was quite old, and not formatted to fit TV screens like video and DVDs today.
