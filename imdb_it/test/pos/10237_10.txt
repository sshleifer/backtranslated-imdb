Nightbreed is not only exceptional, it is also unique, even taking into account Barker's films, which never lack originality. A surprising adaptation of a very interesting idea for a book. For the horror genre, it has a lot of subtle symbols and references. Surely a lot of fun to have, a little to think about, if we are interested. And, not to forget, a nice musical score. Well, the special effects, as usual, age faster than anything else, but this is probably the only drawback. I just saw him again after ten years and I still find him something to recommend.
