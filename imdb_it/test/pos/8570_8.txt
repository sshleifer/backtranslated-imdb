This must be my guilty pleasure. I'm a big fan of 80's movies that were designed to entertain and they didn't care if they offended someone. This move has no flesh, no substance, no scenes that cause deep thoughts. Only old college kids have fun and if any breasts need to be shown, then so be it! This film is for when you just want to relax and NOT think. Long live nudity!
