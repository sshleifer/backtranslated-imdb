This film tells the stories of different couples facing post-World War II life. Through many moving accounts the public discovers how the war has changed people, while their human spirit has continued to triumph. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where a young service man, who came home as a double amputee (after losing both arms to the elbow) is sure that he would not be good to his love, that still wants to marry him. His girlfriend simply said that he would help him with things he wouldn't be able to do, but that they would be good together. Moved by this true demonstration of love, the man embraces his girlfriend in tears. <br /> <br /> The scene where a service man asked for a bank loan is also a highlight. When initially rejected as "high risk", a high-ranking bank official takes over by saying "You fought for our country and you kept us safe - that's good enough for me." Your loan is approved! "" The best years of our life "has won 6 Academy Awards, including a special statuette for the disabled actor who has shown us his whole life and will continue to be worth living, even with a serious handicap. This film It's a joy to watch over and over again - a true classic! Highly recommended!
