The Cult filmmaker Corbucci, the rarest of his thirteen spaghetti westerns (of which I remained alone with what I do in the midst of the revolution [1972] to capture) is one of which I have only recently been aware of through "Stracult" by Marco Giusti. "guide; it is an atypical and squalid jewel in the style of the director's masterpiece, THE GREAT SILENCE (1968), complete with desolate snowy landscapes. <br /> <br /> Johnny Hallyday, the French Elvis Presley, whom I saw for the first time in Jean-Luc Godard's DETECTIVE (1985) is a curious but very effective choice to play the solitary anti-hero Hud (who, like Clint Eastwood's The Man With No Name from the famous "Trilogy of dollars" by Sergio Leone, it is equipped with steel sheet armor for protection); Incidentally, I met Hallyday's beautiful daughter, Laura Smet, at the 2004 Venice Film Festival, but I was distracted by the presence of her esteemed director, Claude Chabrol! Gastone Moschin is another curious addition to the fold (which practically carries out the same function as Frank Wolff did in THE GREAT SILENCE), but he recovers well and is awkwardly amused in the presence of a Francoise Fabian in costume; therefore, it interprets an avi from the nymphomaniac of the widow of a banker who seduces everything else in pursuit of his goals. Sylvie Fennec has another important female role in Hallyday, a farm girl who, at one point, is pleaded in Free Love by Apache Gabriella Tavernese (hippie) (with this mind, it's worth noting that the film is amazing but welcome nudity attacks from both Fabian and Tavernese)! Incidentally, is the anachronistic addition of a group of long-haired youngsters (who also devote themselves to drug smoking and revolutionary speeches) a somewhat infamous attempt of contemporary relevance? but in the end everything adds to the fun (also, even the black waitress sports an afro hairstyle!). Also Mario Adorf is having a great time with the small role of a Mexican greater than the bandit life nicknamed "El Diablo" ?? who constantly keeps a young biographer at his side (an element that may have influenced the UNFORGIVEN of Clint Eastwood [1992]) and, at some point, challenges the Moschin prisoner to a head-to-head duel! That said, does the film also contain an unusual "weapon of death" ?? how Hallyday has an opponent giving a kick to the cash register of the salon in the face! As always, fake friendly fist fights are accompanied by too emphatic sound effects; equally typically for the genre, however, the soundtrack by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino emerges as a very significant resource. In reality, is the ambiguous ending entirely consistent with the generally gloomy tone of the film? after Fabian's mockery at the hands of the locals, the hippies (who had previously idolized Hud) suddenly turn against him when they wound and terrorize the city (forcing everyone on the street and without clothes), but the imperturbable gunman he manages to rise up to meet their challenge (they, however, go away to face him!) and then ride out of town, leaving Fennec behind. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, have I acquired it through a good quality Widescreen print in Italian even if with French credits and the occasional interval ?? about a minute of screen in all ?? in the French language (where, apparently, the original soundtrack was not available).
