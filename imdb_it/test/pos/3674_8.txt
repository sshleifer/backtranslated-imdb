I wish it was released, as I'd like to see the finished product! We saw the unfinished version before it came out. I liked all the characters and actors. Does anyone know if it's already on video? I'd like to see it again. It is worth renting if it is not shown in the theater. I had trouble finding it because they renamed it.
