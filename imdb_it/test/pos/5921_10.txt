This is a great story. Although there are some parts of Jimmy Stewart's balls, for the most part it's a compelling story about an individual with a compelling boost, vision and sense of adventure - to say the least. The bottom line is that it's one of my favorites to watch and I've probably done it dozens of times - that is, until someone stole it from a bag I left on a plane for a flight to California! <br /> <br /> Some commented on too many flashbacks but I don't know a better way to keep a long flight interesting. For those of us who actually fly, the flight can be hours of boredom punctuated by moments of terror. I didn't want to see the flight shortened completely. The overwhelming need to sleep and the drone and the surrounding solitude are part of history. <br /> <br /> There are many parts that I particularly like, including taking off from Long Island and night landing in Paris (Wow, things have really changed with us and the French since then!). The airplane building scenes and the record-breaking flight from San Diego are as interesting as the ice crash on the Atlantic (which I believe is not entirely true but happened on the San Diego flight). <br /> <br /> One has the feeling that one of Lindbergh's greatest assets is his enlightened supporters and his persistence. <br /> <br /> Some of the lines that come to mind from time to time include "Throw the shit!" in the take-off scene and "I hope I don't have to use it that way" when I describe the periscope like a submarine to the lady who lent him a mirror so that she could see her instruments better. <br /> <br /> This film is not for everyone but it is certainly for me. I hope they do it soon on DVD, so I can replace my stolen version!
