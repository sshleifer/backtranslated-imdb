Abe Zwick has perfected the one-off, beautifully. He never made another film, but he created a brilliant portrait of self-homosexual hatred in this film that is both caustic and addictive. It controls the screen, presenting the crumbling debris of a man who collapses under the strain of an increasingly meaningless life. <br /> <br /> Paul (Zwick) is an old queen who somehow convinced Stanley (Wayne Crawford), a fawn-eyed idiot with no sense of the future to follow his star. He is a petty thief who has a thrill of hatred in recent times. He was forced to skip the city and move to a Miami suburb. As a disguise, she dresses like an old blue stocking dried up with so much seething sexual torment as the Lady of the Church. He tells Stanley to tell his friends that he lives with his "Aunt Martha". Paul himself has no friends, spends too much time alone at home and has to deal with Stanley's dissolute lifestyle. It would be enough to put any man in a transgender homicidal mania. <br /> <br /> Once again, Zwick plays Paul as a tragic figure who has completely lost all understanding of how to relate to other people. However, there is a certain poetry in its anguish, which burns slowly over the course of the film. It is tragic, but also elegant. This is ultimately a very sad film. Certainly it has many hilarious moments, but there is such an underground current of desperation and despair, that humor is bittersweet. It is worth watching this film for Abe Zwick's performance. He could really build his career on Martha. It's a little gas once you know it. Just make sure you cut your hair and stop riding. She really hates him!
