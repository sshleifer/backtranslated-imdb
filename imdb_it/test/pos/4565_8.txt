The 1970s saw an increase and decrease in what we have come to know as a "Blacksploitation" movie. The term is a reference to a kind of large catch-all, rather than a true genre of film. In short, any comedy, drama, adventure, western or urban cops and shooter thieves, which are so constructed and so expressed as to appeal to the large population of Urban Black of the mid-twentieth century. This could really embrace the broader type of film, as long as it has a tendency towards the black population of neighborhoods. <br /> <br /> It seems that the idea of ​​producing these films of particular interest to black Americans was its genesis with the Easter release of 100 RIFLES (Marvin Schwartz Prod./20th Century-Fox, 1969) . In it, the former American footballer from Syracuse University and the award-winning Full-All-Pro from Cleveland Browns, Jim Brown, had co-starred billing. Having already appeared in numerous films, such as RIO CONCHOS (1964), THE DIRTY DOZEN (1967), (ICE STTION ZEBRA (1968) * and others, he was starting to make more sense to the "Suits" of the Studios. "That Jim it was a hot property. <br /> <br /> Now this 100 Rifles brings the record number of black patrons to the central business districts of big cities on Easter Sunday to see Mr. Brown, why not start filming more of these adventure epics and other types of films with more Black Players and Stars? Why not, indeed ** So we saw a series of Cops & Robbers, Bad-ass Private Detective Films, Comedies, all departing. more captivating family-oriented, more captivating films: film-goers were treated to SOUNDER (1972), THE TAKE (1974), CONRACK (1974) and, finally, CLAUDINE (1974). <br /> <br /> In CLAUDINE, we find neither stigma nor easy classification as "Blackploitation", since the story is a universal, and could easily have been made as a story about the people of a ny descent, any where, and not just in the US of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> That the story was made of a SINGLE mother, Claudine (Dianne Carroll), who struggled to keep a family together after "... two marriages and two almost marriages.", is very different from a Harlem style shooter. The problems that afflict our nation's everyday citizens are addressed and examined under the sociological microscope. <br /> <br /> But we also consider the psychological and physical needs of Claudine as women. For "The woman needs the man and the man must have his companion", *** and we grant this point. (This is the sex we're talking about, Schultz!) Claudine meets a very masculine athletic type, with broad shoulders, in the private Scavanger Garbage Man, Ruppert B. Marshall (James Earl Jones) and they have an appointment. <Br /> <br /> The Great State of Wellness intervenes with the couple, while Miss Tayback (Elisa Loti), Claudine's welfare assistant, becomes nosy to see who this unattached male is, who is suddenly lending like this so much attention to Claudine's family. <br /> <br /> After a humbling experience with the "Welfare Bureau" auditing and the "deduction" of the revelry, which would be the norm for the family, the two decide to marry with or without the blessing of the Great Brother. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Claudine's eldest son got himself involved in a group of black activists who spoke big but just now. But, with the help of Ruppert, he and all of them go through A.O.K. <br /> <br /> It ends with a happy, optimistic and promising note. We know it might not be exactly "... Happily Ever After!", But rather I'll do everything together! If there is only one criticism that we must affirm is that sometimes in a film like this, a misunderstanding spreads to a large portion of Urban Blacks. And that is the apparent myth implied that all the Whites are rich, having no one of their kind who ever needs help, without a job or suffering from disability. <br /> <br /> Well, folks, it's just something is true! NOTE: * At one point, Jim Brown's career was a real success as a violent action. He had even been nicknamed "... The Black John Wayne." NOTE: ** The idea of ​​producing films with All-Black Casts, filmed for the consumption of All-Black was not a new idea. In the 1920s, 30s and 40s, we saw productions by people like Noble Johnson, Spencer Williams, Jr. and Rex Ingram. <br /> <br /> NOTE: *** This is "As time passes", you Sai, Schultz, is from CASABLANCA (Warner Brothers, 1942).
