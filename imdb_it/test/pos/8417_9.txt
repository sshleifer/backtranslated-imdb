After a very long time the Marathi cinema arrived with a good movie. This film is one of the best Marathi films ever made. Shows how an old grandfather tries to save his grandson's eye. Try everything possible in his hands to save the child's eye. The doctor and one of his relatives try to help him in his attempt. <br /> <br /> The acting of the grandfather, the boy and the doctor is simply superb. They showed the true image of a typical Marathi life. Every little action has some meaning in it. I would recommend watching this film because I initially thought this was a documentary type, but this was above my expectations. <br /> <br /> This movie is really touching your hearts. I would expect more Marathi films to come up with shows like this.
