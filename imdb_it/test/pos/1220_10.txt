Cute Movie is a good movie I had never heard of this movie, but I found it while looking for something to rent. I had high hopes for this film based exclusively on Flex in this film. I've never seen him in something for which it's not worth it. True to form this film delivered to me. I liked the story. The film is full of great actors and actresses. The exhilarating Tasha Smith, Essence Atkins and, of course, Tangi Miller. I really enjoyed this movie. I didn't give him five stars because he didn't discuss some problems that I thought the film should detail. The problem was apparently solved, but I would have appreciated a discussion to solve the problems. I liked the movie so much that I am now buying the movie after I already rented it and watched it.
