This film has just won the award for best film at the Cleveland International Film Festival. Apparently the American title is Autumn Spring. The acting is superb. History takes you into the life of an old man who takes what life inflicts on him and brings him up a little. Accustomed by his best friend (and partner of a not so serious crime) he puts people on every occasion, but often reveals his heart of gold. His long wife came to his intelligence and makes a life-changing decision that is heartbreaking to watch. The resolution of the story is beautiful.
