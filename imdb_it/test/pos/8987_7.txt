This film begins as a T'n'A college film, but gets pretty ugly after the protagonist's sister was raped by a band of motorcyclists driving a van. It has a pretty good pace, and James Van Patten does a good job in this Cannon tax writing film. This was the first film I ever saw on Parkway Drive-in, here in Toronto. The main feature was "Alphabet City", and "Young Warriors" was the added feature. Of the two films, "Young Warriors" was far more fun and memorable. If you are a fan of successful films, excessively violent films, this would make a great addition to any collection.
