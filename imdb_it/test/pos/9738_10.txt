Originally I saw the serial Gordon flash on PBS, and I thought it was fun and fantastic, I overlooked the special effects of rocket ships with streamers, and the great dragon monster with lobster claws, who cares that this is the 1936 and it was a serial, so every week they would show a new chapter, Busaro Crabbe played flash Gordon 3 times, in all 3 series. Then in 1939 he played buck rogers, in 1933 he played Tarzan without fear. He was a very busy actor. sexy dale Arden.frank Shannon as professor zarkov, and Charles Middleton played the evil ruthless ming the. Makes Darth Vader look like a boyscout. The serials were very close to Alex Raymond's comic strip. time.not talk about ray and television guns. this stands out as the best serial ever. The sequel flash Gordon's journey to Mars is of 2 longer chapters, the next flash Gordon conquers the universe is only 12 chapters. And then there are the natives of mongo .., hawk-man, lion-man, shark-m The version of the feature leaves out the scenes of shark men. for the complete effect you have to see the complete serial. I heard that George Lucas was inspired by the flash Gordon when he made the Star Wars. Flush Gordon came from universal studies. And the music on the soundtrack comes from many universal films like Frankenstein's bride, London werewolf, Dracula's daughter, etc., even today flash Gordon continues to delight young and old people out of 10.
