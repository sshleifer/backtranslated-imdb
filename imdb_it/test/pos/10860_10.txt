I have nothing but praise for this mini series. He's only about a year and a half, but I've seen him twice before; with greater joy the second time than the first. I am seriously considering seeing him again soon when I find him spiritually uplifting. <br /> <br /> It is a very tender romantic drama with such beautiful shows, sets, costumes, music and scenes that it has a resonance that places it almost in a separate league among the mini series. <br /> <br /> Some others have commented on the difficulties of living as lesbians in Britain in the 1990s. Nothing particularly difficult in this; it was only male homosexuality that was contrary to the law, since poor Oscar Wilde had lived his great cost and a great loss for the literary world. Anyway, I digress. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the essential television. It is perhaps one of the greatest tragic romantic dramas by Romeo and Juliet, though not in the conventional sense. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 from me. <br /> <br /> JMV
