The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow moon neon on the roof of a skating rink in 1956 in Lubbock, Texas. At the beginning of the credits, the camera moves from the moon to the parking lot, the skating rink, beyond the concessions and across the track to a small stage where a small group is doing sound control. It's a shot that Welles and Scorcese would appreciate both. It's up to the bespectacled face of Buddy Holly who peers into a rapt concentration as he grabs the headphones and talks to a man who puts this band on the radio. <br /> <br /> A young Gary Busey plays Buddy Holly and his interpretation is the key. It must somehow show the passion that Holly had for her music to make the film work. This is a rock and roll story with no coca cola lines with heroin shots and a fifth of whiskey. This is not a man with several women to choose from in a scandalized sex, abandoned to an abandoned and lustful tragedy. This is a film about a handsome Texan boy who respected his parents and went to church and had the same girl for 5 years and fell in love with rock and roll. Busey finds that spark and lights it, his passion is clear and contagious. He really plays the guitar in the film and sings, he's not overdubbed with Holly's recordings. Busey was a young Hollywood boy in the seventies, a struggling actor and much more a struggling rock musician. Thus, it gives a great performance, because even if it is not Buddy Holly, it is in a similar situation. <br /> <br /> His first song is the old Les Paul classic, "Mockingbird Hill" and he has the tweak country to nail it. Later a child called for a bit of bop, and against his two band mates (actually the Crickets were 3 boys, but the downsizing works well for the limited narrative of the film) leads them to cry in "Rocking with Ollie Vee ". Children love it and parents hate it. The DJ at the rolling track notes it and will then be released in New York without Buddy Holly, although he knows it has never been recorded. This leads to the funniest scene in a movie full of funny moments. A jockey from Buffalo's amplified record calls Buddy home. The DJ played "That'll be the Day" for 12 hours and stands for 24. The cops hit the barricade door of the station. Holly is confused, but when the dust settles, she is rather excited. He tells the boys and begins their meteoric rise. Dan Stroud as drummer and Charles Martin Smith as bassist complete the band in a pleasant way and have a good chemistry between them. There are problems but not exaggerated dramas found in most biopic rock (all?). The film doesn't even manipulate you. Your emotions go up, but they are not manipulated. When Crickets go up on the stage of the Apollo Harlem, the first white band that ever played there, then they will perform an electrified "Oh Boy" performance and conquer the audience, my rock and roll lover choked and she wept. Subsequently, Busey and the boys make "It's so Easy" more funky and more soulful than I would have thought possible. <br /> <br /> Anyone with a superficial knowledge of Buddy Holly's story will know where this movie will end. Holly died in a plane crash with Richie Valens and the Big Bopper too young. We, as the public knows, however the film is so well written, direct and lovingly performed that we forget it almost immediately. The film is not about his death, it's about his life and his place in the history of rock and roll. The film ends with his last performance and it's a good fifteen minutes of Busey swinging owned by the ghost of Buddy Holly. I was happy to hear him quit "Not Fade Away", my favorite of his songs. The film crashes in front of the credits with information about the plane crash, but I hardly noticed it. I was still thinking how beautiful that last song was.
