Anderson's animation easily rivals that of Pixar and goes far beyond most of anything Disney has ever seen. While some say that the story is a bit too abstract, I find a stimulating and refreshing change from the exaggerated characters and bizarre animals that are typically found in animated short films. It's an interplanetary version of CASTAWAY! Anyone who has left the safe harbor at home and gone to a lonely and frightening place alone will easily identify with this desperate microbe. Good work, Mr. Anderson! <br /> <br />
