Well, this movie came out in a business day at 230 in the morning. The pretty little actress who played Billy caught my attention initially and after the first 15 minutes I was held captive on my television until the end. It puts you at the edge of your seat, then throws in clever pieces of comedy during the most tense sequences. <br /> <br /> The only drawback is that the story was not substantial enough to fill an hour and a half of film, causing some sequences to drag just a little bit. Nevertheless, it was still a lot of fun, and I recommended it to all my staff the next day.
