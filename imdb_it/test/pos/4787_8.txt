A few years ago I happened to understand it on community TV and I was pleasantly surprised how nice a movie was. <br /> <br /> Although somewhat trivial in some ways, like its main function of being a mysterious thriller, it works superbly, thanks to a script that creates a brilliant plot; made me guess everything and the resolution is inspired. <br /> <br /> The cast is a star-studded star, containing a mixture of those at the end of their career (in fact Richard Long died the same year it was made), or those who were on the brink of celebrity in successful TV series (Kate Jackson, Tom Bosley). They all do a good job, with the exception of Cesare Danova who slumbers in his role. <br /> <br /> Strongly recommended.
