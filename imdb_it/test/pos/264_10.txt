Rented this from my club because it was the only new British film available this week. Never heard of the director before or his other films (thank you IMDB). At the time, someone made a good young British comedy that didn't play Hugh Grant or forty things. History is a moral tale but it is never preached, really pleasant by a young and fresh cast. Luke Goss's cameo was surprisingly very good, but then surprised me with his excellent performance in "Blade". I really liked the color gradation, especially in the sequences of the night club. Great music and a truly original voice at work here. Nine out of ten and worth renting.
