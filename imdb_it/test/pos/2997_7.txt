I captured this movie on the tape track I used to capture a movie that I really wanted to see again. When I saw the name of Raquel Welch in the opening credits, I decided to watch it. Actually, it was slightly funny, and brought me back "in the car of return" to the farcical films that Hollywood was throwing up during the sixties, much in the same genre as the current Austin Powers talent. Oh, the acting wasn't great, nor the plot, but it was worth looking at. There was a delightful scenery, even though Mrs Welch provided the most pleasant of these. Register it if you have the chance and watch it when you have absolutely nothing else to do. It's not a snoozer, but it won't make you roll in the corridors that want more, either.
