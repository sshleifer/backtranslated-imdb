Flowers! If it's something you will take away from this movie, it will be the flowers. They are so prominent and are used as plot devices, you will become an expert in identifying yourself with daisies and black tulips when the film ends. <br /> <br /> Set in Amsterdam, Daisy tells the frustrating story of the love triangle between a girl and two men in her life. One is a professional killer who earns a living, the other an Interpol agent. With a pan-Asian cast (Korean, Hong Kong) and crew (director Andrew Lau of Hong Kong, Korean writer and a Thai post-production team), I could imagine the headache in coordination. <br /> <br /> Park Yi (Jung Woo-sung) is a hit man who finds a weakness for the painter Hye-young (played by the handsome Jeon Ji-hyun). It is love at first sight in the lawns of the daisies, where its awkwardness attracts its attention. However, being shy and always attentive to the dangers of her professional career, she can only admire her from afar, do small (or maybe big) things for her anonymously, but the one who takes the cake is to send her daisies in pots every day without fail at 4.15pm. Become his guardian angel from afar, protecting her and protecting her from danger. <br /> <br /> Hye-young is in love with this mysterious stranger. She is constantly waiting for it to appear, but I really wonder how difficult it can be to give delivery almost on time. Nevertheless, it is terribly moved and touched by this single act. However, as the stars would like, Interpol detective Jeong Woo (Lee Sung-jae) has a chance on Hye-young in a town square during one of his undercover missions, and he too is fascinated by her. Similarly, because of his profession, he is in doubt whether he should make the first move. <br /> <br /> Which is where the public would find it frustrating. Obviously the lady would fall in love with the wrong guy (then again, he's the "good"), Park Yi is infuriated by the pursuit of Jeong Woo, but still refuses to go out and identify, and Jeong Woo is the opportunist in taking the free anonymous identity unintentionally. It's almost as if I wanted to give everyone a slap to wake them all up. <br /> <br /> Apart from this, it is precisely this tension that keeps you fascinated. And it is incredibly fun to watch the two male protagonists finding it difficult to fall in love without jeopardizing their career or their loved one. But it's not about action fans, there are enough revelations of cats and mice and a tacit camaraderie in the form of Infernal Affairs, as well as extensive shootings, although I felt that the ending could have been copied more closely. <br /> <br /> Which rocks is intelligent assembly. Telling the story in a non-linear timeline (don't worry, it's not so bad, you will still be able to follow the narration) from the point of view of all the leads, hold yourself suspended and culminate in a screen divided into three parts to show all their emotions in a single convergent event, which I considered extremely well done. <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful film in terms of lush meadows and crowded squares, with lots of classical music to soothe the soul. As for romantic films, all the protagonists are a pleasure for the eyes: the girls will have a field day with the two beautiful male protagonists, while the boys have to make do with a little plump (argh! OK lah, at some corners) Jeon ji-hyun. <br /> <br /> If you like love films with the same balance in the action / tension department, Daisy would be your choice. If you prefer more conventional crying, then the other Korean movie that makes its debut here at the same time, You are My Sunshine, would be your alternative. And yes, did I totally dig the final scene, which I thought only Koreans did it better? It reminded me of JSA.
