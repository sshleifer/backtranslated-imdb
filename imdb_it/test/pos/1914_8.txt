Dolelemite (1975) is a cult classic. Played by Rudy Ray Moore as the superhero of the proud, but challenging MAN along the way. He has two enemies, no good Willie Green and the squalid mayor. Watch Dolemite, kick, punch, slap and pimp across the screen. What's the name of the man? Dolemite! <br /> <br /> An interesting film that paved the way for a generation of rappers and artists. To sell more of his party albums, Rudy Ray Moore made several economic films in the seventies. Self-produced and marketed, it is aimed at a specific audience. Some call it blacksploitation, others call it garbage, I call it fun. Dolemite was followed by the semi-sequel The Human Tornado and a direct video of Return of Dolemite 25 years later. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended, a real cult! <br /> <br /> Footnotes, if the movie was played correctly on the video you would not see the boom microphones. Dolemite has been cut to receive an R-rating.
