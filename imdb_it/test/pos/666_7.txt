This special PAEDO-GEDDON by OTTO DI OTTO has been overwhelmed by complaints (we'll talk about it later) when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate around a possible "Sarah's law" following the seizure and murder of girl Sarah Payne. In fact, the planning was postponed as Phil Collins received legal advice after discovering that he had been deceived by show producer Chris Morris in a campaign called Nonce-sense <br /> <br /> If truth be told this show he is probably more remembered for the controversy than the bad taste content, but I confess that I laughed out loud. The edition focuses on pedophiles and how society treats both them and their victims. Chris Morris plays the presenter who tells the public that a notorious pedophile was thrown into space and confesses that an eight-year-old boy was accidentally placed in the capsule with the pedophile. The scared cries of the child appear. As I said very bad taste <br /> <br /> The other highlights of the show include Dr. Fox giving a scientific lecture stating that pedophiles share a nervous system identical to crabs ("Nobody knows, but it's a fact scientific ") Parliamentarian Barbara Follet gives a public warning on pedophiles of the equipment that attach to the genitals while surfing the net and Kate Thornton warns viewers that pedophiles can send gas through the Internet that makes young children vulnerable to sexual predators including a victim "Who was once a shy innocent child and who now has the sexuality of a sixty-year-old colonel". Morris also shows a police officer in the child protection team a series of photos that they want to know if they are classified obscene. The photos included Barbie surrounded by a marital allowance and a composite photo with the head of a young boy, a dog's body and an erect penis that could only belong to John Holmes. Hey, I never said this show was tasteful, did it? <br /> <br /> It is impossible to mention PAEDO-GEDDON without the hypocritical fall that surrounded it where politicians, children's organizations and policemen rushed to condemn the show to make fun of a very serious subject. The show was in bad taste, although I laughed out loud, but it is a biting satire. Perhaps the critics should take a long look at the mirror in which a liberal elite allows the stricken pedophile slime to travel the streets of Great Britain before criticizing a simple TV show to exacerbate tensions.
