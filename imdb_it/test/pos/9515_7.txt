Another film about the "end of the world" that supposes the comparison with the abysmal "Day After Tomorrow". Following the same type of DAT structure but with a clearly Japanese style. How are you? It depends on your taste for Japanese melodrama. <br /> <br /> I discovered that the little human touch is what makes this film compelling for most of its 2 hours. Even the frequent titles that explain part of science. The effects are probably the best I've seen in a Japanese movie and they compare very well with anything in Hollywood. Many of the disaster scenes are really scary even though the human carnage is usually off screen. And this is one of the drawbacks. Even if the terror of thousands of deaths on the screen as in the recent "War of the Worlds" could be too overwhelming, we don't even understand the chaos of an entire nation crumbling into the ocean. chaos, but for the most part this part of the story has barely touched. However, this film works on many levels and is much more realistic than DAT, which is until the end. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is based on a clich√© plot device and another plot device that would be at home in the 1960s Japanese Land in the "Gorath" movie. After reasonably good science and mostly realistic disaster, this creates a bit of disappointment. Even the sudden stop of the movie for a pop love song doesn't help (unless you like the song). This made the ending "exciting" a little compelling for me. <br /> <br /> the direction is good and the artistic design is excellent, even the acting is good.
