I was lucky enough to see the film Hari Om at The Bermuda International Film Festival. It was the opening night and it was such a delightful movie. It was shot beautifully in India and I want to go there now. The main actor ... Vijay was absolutely amazing. It was the highlight of the film. Apparently it was also in the movie..Mononon marriage. It was the total star of the show. Benoit's character upset me ... it was a lot of fun. And the girl (forget the name) was fantastic too. They were all fantastic! There were many terrible scenes like the one with the monkeys. And basically I loved the movie. Everyone who came out was thrilling him and it was certainly the highest point of the film festival. It was my favorite from the festival. It has really captured India's liveliness beautifully and cannot believe how beautiful India is. The feeling of leaving the cinema ... it was a real success. It's a delightful and happy film. I loved it !!
