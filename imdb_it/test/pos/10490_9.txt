This is a compelling story that borrows elements from the Kennedy assassination, and uses them successfully to create an excellent western tale. <br /> <br /> The film has a good soundtrack, although it is based on repeating the theme of the title a little too much. Giuliano Gemma and the rest of the cast are superb. This is a more cerebral spaghetti western than usual that is based more on history than action, and is successful because the story is excellent. This does not mean that there is no action in the film. There is a lot, and it is very well done. This movie immediately involves you and keeps you absorbed until the end. You will always be wondering what's in those documents that everyone is looking for. He also has some sharp comments on American politics. <br /> <br /> This film shows why Valerii, in my opinion, is in a threesome with Sollima and Corbucci for second place in the spaghetti western director ranking.
