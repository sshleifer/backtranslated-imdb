I was surprised and moved by this emotional film that moved me very strangely. I was confused, sad and happy at the same time. I imagine that too few people will pay attention to this film. But I hope at least some see it and get something out of it. The story of two friends, linked by their problems of physical disability, who (like a team) beat the health system and fight for their rights. This film shows a side that some of us would never understand, not too exaggerated but emotionally presented. We hope this film will help us better understand some of their desires and we realize how important it is to have a friend in the world, especially when you can't almost express this fact.
