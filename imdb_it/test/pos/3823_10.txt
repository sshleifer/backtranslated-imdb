When the new external limits started, the episodes were rather optimistic and challenging. When the series began to slow down, most of the episodes simply became ugly and lacked any entertainment value. The six episodes reflect the best and the worst of the series. <br /> <br /> Since The Outer Limits always preaches a moral. I would like to offer mine. Starting with the most fun on the flop. <br /> <br /> 1. The afterlife: as an institution, the US military-industrial complex is both evil and paranoid, not to mention the simple fool. However, people with great integrity serve our country and will obey their conscience even at incredible costs! In the end, the aliens don't need to say a word. Those without conscience are fools who must be held in total contempt! <br /> <br /> A truly subversive episode! One that should be shown in the early evening for everyone to see! This could be a revelation to some, but people without conscience should not be allowed to serve in our armed forces! Neither purpose justifies the means! <br /> <br /> 2. Theory of relativity: a good person can be forced to make a few seconds decision between good and evil, in order to save the life of defenseless and high cost intelligent beings themselves. What makes this decision all the more difficult is the hard choice: to be abandoned with alien strangers that you can't even communicate except through gestures or with a group of people you think will protect you from unknown dangers, even if they are ruthless and devoid of compassion! <br /> <br /> This episode is brilliant! What fuels this depravity is a good old-fashioned greed. This episode is one of the most ferocious accusations of capitalism, transnational corporations and environmental rape, which I have ever seen in my life! Unlike real life, justice is served here - and fast! <br /> <br /> One of the most memorable lines is when the ruthless corporate hooligan said something about it: "We did the same thing in the Amazon forest war". Alluding to the killing of Amazonian Indians who were trying to protect their rainforests from being ousted, as a justification to literally kill again in the name of "survival of the fittest". Something that Darwin never wanted to take literally! <br /> <br /> 3. Alien store: tremendous power can be used forever, even by an exotic alien. This power can be used to heal instead of destroying. Mere mortals can learn from their mistakes! Even a criminal can see the light if given the opportunity to do so. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it takes a strong medicine, but we can all wake up and change our self-destructive ways! <br /> <br /> 4. The Grell: an alien can be a Christ-like figure! In the distant future, slavery can be justified, once again, in the name of convenience! Basically good people can be corrupted. Sometimes a person needs to feel great shame to see the evil he is committing. Children are closer to the truth than adults. Those with political power have a tremendous responsibility! Another work of genius! As a species, "Do humans learn from history?" <br /> <br /> Flop Number 1: Quality of Mercy: Loose Lips, Ships of Sinks! When you're at war, keep your mouth shut on important military plans. Damn, do I really need to watch a one-hour soap opera to figure it out? !! I wonder, did the creators of The Outer Limits run out of ideas or did companies pull the plug? Dark and ugly, without purpose, but despair! <br /> Flop Number 2: Beyond The Veil: So bad there is no moral, but this: when locked up in a psychiatric hospital, use some common sense, please! This episode is so ugly that it disgusts. What an impact on X-Files! Don't waste time with this! You can thank me later! <br /> <br /> It is a sad comment that The Outer Limits went down the pipes towards the end of its run. Subversive episodes, like the first four, could not last forever! It was a miracle that they were made for everyone! We hope that one day other brave souls will follow the subversive tradition of the External Limits in a new territory! <br /> <br /> If you happen to be such a bold person, a good starting point is with a single book: "Anatomy Of Wonder: A Critical Guide to Science Fiction", edited by Neil Barron! For me, the most complete book ever written on the subject.
