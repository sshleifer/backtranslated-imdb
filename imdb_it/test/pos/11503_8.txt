This film is incredibly free from storytelling. It is a pure experience in which music obscures the visual impression. - Words cannot obviously express enough what should be expressed, but it is the need for chattering classes that chatter is put forward, inserted into the lines of production of mediocrity and therefore a necessity to express any reasonable thought or opinion on something should it not be necessary to be degraded by chatter. So these elaborate opinions are proposed to satisfy those empty minds that must be filled with a noise that you won't find as hard as you feel in this film.
