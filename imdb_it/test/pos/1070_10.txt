This Christmas gift came courtesy of TCM. We had never seen the movie, even though we saw most of Barbara Stanwyck's films. This comedy made us laugh so much that sometimes we had to hold back to listen to the dialogue. <br /> <br /> This is a film that should be seen by people suffering from stressful situations, especially around Christmas. It would certainly raise morale by letting go. The film would be a perfect gift in the form of DVDs or VHS tape. <br /> <br /> "Christmas in Connecticut" was briefly directed by Peter Godfrey, based on a story by Aileen Hamilton. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is the happy pairing of two of the most popular stars of the time: Barbara Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan. Barbara Stanwyck has always played strong women, of course, this has been a change of pace for her. In this film, besides "Lady Eve", Mrs. Stanwyck shows a talent for comedy. She and Mr. Morgan, who has starred in many musical comedies, are a winning combination. <br /> <br /> There are no weak performances in the film. Sydney Greenstreet, an actor famous for playing 'heavyies', is a pleasure to watch as the rich and fat Alexander Yardley, the man who owned a media empire and knew a good thing when he saw it. Reginald Gardiner, an established British actor, adds luster to the stellar cast behind the two main ones. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakall, is another source of continuous joy; plays the Hungarian chef Felix, who has difficulty with his version of the English language. Furthermore, Una O'Connor is a perfect Norah, the housekeeper on Sloan's perfect Connecticut farm. <br /> <br /> Reading other comments in this forum, it is sad to learn that the glorious black and white cinematography is not appreciated by some people. After all, color was not widely used in the 1940s and most films classics must be seen in its original format because, what would you do in "coloring them"? <br /> <br /> This film should be a requirement for anyone who wants to spend almost two hours of uninterrupted fun at Christmas time because total happiness is assured. Look at it with an open mind and heart and maybe you'd like to see "Christmas in Connecticut" every year.
