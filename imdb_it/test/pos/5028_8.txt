This basically sums it up ... trivial. MacDowell's inability to act is sometimes painful and Hurt needs money to take on such muffled roles, but I've always liked him. <br /> <br /> Why? In one word, Travolta. It's GREAT in this movie. However, I can't give the film a high score, but it certainly deserves better than it appears to be.
