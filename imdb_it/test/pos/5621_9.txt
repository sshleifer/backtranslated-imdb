David Lynch shot his first film, "Erasurehead", for several years, adding new scenes whenever he managed to raise a little more money. Kevin Smith had 'Clerks' work while working as a clerk, and Robert Rodriguez boasted that "From Dusk Till Dawn" cost exactly $ 30,000. But $ 30,000 is still a lot of money to collect if you work as a cleaner in a cemetery. And if an aspiring director had not only had such a job, but also had all the ambition of such luminaries and all of Smith's stolidity, but absolutely none of the talents. One such figure is Mark Borchardt, the subject of this hilarious documentary that tells of his attempt to make a couple of films for many years. Borchardt combines his moody dreams with flights of depression and a fatal inability to call him a day; one senses that he almost prefers the endless efforts of seeking an impossible perfection in an accommodation with the reality that he is simply (on the evidence presented in "American Movie") not very good. And like a modern day, Ed Wood surrounds himself with an epic crowd of other losers, his sincere affection for whoever is his greatest saving characteristic. The collection includes his parents in war, his best friends (one a criminal, the other a reformed drug addict), his unfortunate children and, above all, his old Uncle Bill. Bill could live in a trailer, and he almost gave up on life, but he owns a small fortune ($ 280,000 to be precise) and the moving but potentially exploitative relationship between the two men is at the heart of the film. Borchardt manages to enlist some actors to perform (beside himself, of course), but overall he is totally dependent on friends and relatives to complete his work (even Bill has a role in the camera). On British TV, the BBC brilliantly scheduled a screening of "American Movie" with "Lost in La Mancha", the story of Terry Gilliam's unfortunate film attempt of "Don Quixote". In that film, one was impressed by the enormous amount of professionalism exposed (inadequate as it was for the task in hand), and how damaging it is even for experts with millions to spend on making a film; while Borschat is not only a soldier, but also such a clown who cannot even correctly pronounce the name of his work ("Coven"). After all, Borschadt is human enough to want him to succeed, but horrible enough to allow the viewer to still be able to laugh at his failures. If this film were fiction, you would consider it as unbelievable; but as it is, it's one of the funniest documentaries you'll probably see.
