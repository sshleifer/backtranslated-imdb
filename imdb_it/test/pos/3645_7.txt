As I said, I'm NOT a Tweety fan. It's so infuriating that I wish Sylvester ate it and ended up with. <br /> <br /> In this cartoon, Sly is again homeless and has returned to feed the garbage cans. Locate a cruise ship that leaves the port nearby and decide to get on board when it spits Tweety is one of the passengers. <br /> <br /> The ship offers an adequate stage for the following hijinks and Sly desperately tries to catch the annoying bird and avoid seasickness. If only for once he can chew and swallow, ending up with the canary irritant forever. But, since the cartoons with Tweety go, that's pretty good, but it's EVERYTHING thanks to that brilliant cat.
