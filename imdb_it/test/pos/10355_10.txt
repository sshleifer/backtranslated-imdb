This film revolves around an Arab leader (Amir) who dies and wants to continue living. So a Dr. Lloyd Trenton is paid to transplant Amirs' brain into an "available" participant. But in the doctors' basement his dwarf assistant Dorro (Angelo Rossitto) drains the blood of girls for medical purposes. Meanwhile, Dr. Llyod pays a man to kill the people who helped Amir in the country (which is Reed Hadley, Grant Williams and various unknown bodyguards). Grant is the only survivor when his car crashes from the road. While this has happened, the doctors, the other Gor assistant, is sent out to get a body for love and it hurts him so much that Dr. Llyod cannot operate. Meanwhile, Grant finds Amir's "girlfriend", Regina Carrol, and tells her story. Grant sees the man who pushed him away from the road and Dorro kills him. Then since Gor failed to get a body, D. Llyod puts Amirs 'brain into Gors' disfigured body. Then Grant and Regina go to the doctor's lab and <br /> <br /> ------------------------ SPOILERS ------- ------------------ Discover its secret. Soon Amir (Gor) wanders around killing people and in the confusion of what I think is the plot Dr. Llyod has a brain ray gun that injures Amir in command. It turns out that Dr. Lloyd wants a country where all scientists can work without law. Then Regina dies. and in the end Amir's new body (I think) says it will be a new country blah blah. <br /> <br /> I haven't gotten the final yet, but overall this was a very nice piece of smelly cheese. This film features Grant Williams in his penultimate film. I recommend it to all Al Adamson fans or if you like Brains.
