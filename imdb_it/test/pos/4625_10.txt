I had the pleasure of attending this exceptional film in a preview screening in Sydney. Although it was a pleasure to see him. Pleasure is not the emotion that remains when the credits come out. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is a film that addresses not only a stigma heard by young people but all of them. The main of which is isolation. It is not just to position the final galvanization scene of the film on a pedestal above the others, but rather it is important to see it as the climax. And from this, it is important to realize what it represents for you both as a spectator and for the people directly affected by it. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is not a soft image but the way Mr. Thalluri handles the subject with a profound dignity and the no-holds-barred approach acts as credit to his message. <br /> <br /> I don't think films like 2:37 need to be resized with favorable votes. Rather it should be recommended to those who are looking for a purpose in their vision. <br /> <br /> A portrait of brilliantly realized, lost innocence. And a masterstroke for an inexperienced talent. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it.
