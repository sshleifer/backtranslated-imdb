Although Never Say Never Again (NSNA) has a weak soundtrack, it is far superior to its current competition, "Octopussy". Never Say Never Again is an updated and improved version of Thunderball (the less popular Connery movie). NSNA is full of intelligent dialogues, wit, intelligence, sex appeal and one of the best and most convincing villains in the entire Bond series. Furthermore, NSNA presents a beautiful young Kim Basinger of great talent. Fans of the British comedy will also recognize the actor (Attwood), known as "Mr. Bean". I wouldn't trade any of Moore's images for this. However, Connery / Bond's previous efforts (with the exception of "Thunderball") are superior. <br /> <br />
