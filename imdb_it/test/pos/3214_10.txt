this is a really fantastic series. i love the show and i'm so glad it hasn't been canceled yet. she has a really good mood and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. or yes for Gilmore's girls! it is very beautiful I am such a humorous and sarcastic group. they do everything together, just like me and my mother. yes for Gilmore's girls. um, I'm running out of lines. but I love how the relationship between Luke and Lorelei is finally taking shape. so they needed to be together. and I absolutely love Sookie St. James! she is so fantastic. and the show wouldn't be anywhere without Michel. the whole show is dry humor, sarcasm and life in a very small city where everyone knows each other ... especially Gilmore's girls.
