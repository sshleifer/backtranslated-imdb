with this, they carry the same obscure weaknesses that we all unfortunately possess: lies, deceit, laziness, the list goes on. <br /> <br /> However, as an American, I was shocked to see that corruption and racism exist in today's police force, as evidenced by the horrific police and investigator of the Duval County Sheriff's Department, with the murder of a white female tourist and a young black woman accused of 15 years. I shook my head in shame that the detectives were protected from their violent work while a young man's life hung on the balance of justice. <br /> <br /> However, there is also a story of hope with our judicial system and as poorly paid public defenders blocked by their guns (the irony understood) and forced the truth by the detectives. I wanted to fly down to Florida and tell anyone with influence what great public defense team they have in Duval County; those lawyers worry about the "small" man and, above all, about justice. <br /> <br /> The other story is about faith and the family. Praise the defendant's family and its strong Christian beliefs (submit any dedicated religion) and wonderful family values. I hope they win their case against the Duval County Sheriff's Department. <br /> <br /> Bravo for justice !!! Bravo for the little guy !!!
