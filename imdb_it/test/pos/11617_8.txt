"Subconscious Cruelty" must be one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen. "Salo" and "Cannibal Holocaust" didn't bother me that much, but there is a strange psychological element in "Subconscious Cruelty". This film invades your subconscious with shocking taboos, surrealist images and one of the most disturbing film scores and sound design. Repulsive sometimes; yes, but his visual style can be compared to directors of Avant Gard such as Alejandro Jodorowsky, Dario Argento, Dusan Makavejev and David Lynch. Get the most extreme elements of those 4 directors and immerse yourself in the graphic violence of a film by Luico Fulci, and you might be able to guess what you like. <br /> <br /> The film is divided into 4 parts. The first part "The ovarian eye" is very short. A narrator tells us about the parts of the brain and its functions. Then a naked woman opens her stomach and an eyeball is extracted. The second part "Human Larvae" is a bit like the movie "Eraserhead" but with incest. This is a man's sexual obsession with his pregnant sister. Where is Frued when you need him? The third part is my absolute favorite. It reminds me of "Begotten" and the short film by Jame's Broughton from 1972 "Dreamwood". In this segment people have sex with the earth. Men beat bloody holes in the ground, girls masturbate with tree branches. The branches bleed when they break. Watch with horror as a man gives fellatio to a knife sticking out of a woman's vagina. These people really know how to get in touch with nature. <br /> <br /> The last part of the film is the most disturbing and sometimes borders on hardcore pornography. This part of the film made me think of "The Holy Mountain", "Sweet Movie" and "Cannibal Holocaust" by Jodorowsky. I have never been more disturbed in my life than what I witnessed. A businessman gets his private parts separated by fishing hooks. Yuck and Ahi! Two women urinate on a figure of Christ and cannibally proceed to eat it like the communion bread and sodomize it with a tree branch. Poor boy. The last part was so extreme that if I ever watched the movie again, I would have closed my eyes or slightly forward. Karim Hussien and Mitch Davis are obviously very talented, because they think they have done this project in the early 1920s. Hussein continued to direct the influence of Tarkovsky "Ascension" (2002), which is a much better film and co-wrote the script for Nacho Cerda's masterpiece after the dark horror "The Abandoned". "Subconscious Cruelty" is a fascinating and disturbing journey; with images that come from the unthinkable realm of everyday human minds. Well, a little.
