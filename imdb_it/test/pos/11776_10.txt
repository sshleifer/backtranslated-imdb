<br /> <br /> Fourteen minutes more fun on celluloid. This brief parody is at least as much a part of the Star Wars saga as Phantom Menace, and much more fun if you ask me. Hardware Wars was the first in a long series of SW spoofs that form their own subgenre these days. I hate to describe it too much - it's so short that the premise only concerns everything. Suffice it to say that many of the most famous and familiar aspects of Star Wars have enjoyed beating them. Appliances such as toasters and vacuum cleaners portray spaceships and robots, Princess Anne-Droid's character wears real sandwiches in her head instead of the famous spiers of braided hair, and Fluke Starbucker is even more of an idiot than her original, if that's possible. Ernie Fosselius is a crazy child of a child - he is also the source of Porklips Now, the parody of Apocalypse Now.
