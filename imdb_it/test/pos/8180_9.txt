Another vintage piece for Chen Kiage ... (I don't remember making a modern movie!) ... <br /> <br /> Good characterization with a simple story of trust and broken promises. None of HK's fight scenes, or the kind of Hollywood heroes, but that's okay for that. The characters are strong, I felt really good for them. <br /> <br /> Understanding mandarin definitely gives English subtitles. The film is 3 hours, but it didn't look like it.
