The portrait of the Marines in this film is perfect. Action scenes are among the best ever produced in terms of content accuracy. The uniforms and weapons of both US and German troops were perfect. The costumes and weapons of the Berbers were also perfectly accurate. This film could easily be used to teach the militaria of the period and was used by the USMC Academy for this purpose. The scenes depicting the filming of Roosevelt and the rifles he was using were beautiful. Providing so many vintage weapons in such good shape testifies to the attention to detail and the presentation of this film. Millius is a genius.
