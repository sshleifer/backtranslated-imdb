For a feature film, the plot closely follows the story - or at least the historical gossip. But then the Chinese, who know the story very well seeing it portrayed again and again, would never tolerate it otherwise. Attention to detail is wonderful, especially for those who have read Sima Qian's story in Records of the Historian. Jing Ke, according to Sima Qian, actually made an attempt on the life of Qin Shi Huang at the request of the Crown Prince of Yan before the unification. Sima Qian explicitly mentions both General Fan's head and the dagger rolled into the map, as well as the dagger that is thrown into the brass column. Although Jing Ke is described as a stranger to sword fencing, he is hardly the invincible warrior played by Chen Kaige. Jing Ke is indeed the weakest link in this film. In fact (again, according to Sima Qian), he was a heavy drinker and postponed his visit to Qin for as long as possible, spending a good deal of time with the ladies of Yan before the crown prince ordered him for his Street . He was, in short, a human being and he couldn't wait to die even though he was willing to accept it. Jing Ke of Chen Kaige is afraid of death, but not his own. He is the classic ruthless murderer turned into a disillusioned pacifist. His love (or perhaps only affection) for a woman and pity for several hundred children that Zheng had buried alive (not even two thousand years of hostile Confucian historians claimed that Qin Shi Huang did so, even if there is a legend about of him who buries 460 Confucians at their neck and then behead them) is enough to have this former assassin killed again. The melodrama is not convincing and the character ends up being simply boring. Acting here is not evil, although not very interesting given the character. As for Lady Zhou, in all the many stories I heard about Qin Shi Huang, it never came out. However, Gong Li is quite famous for Americans who have heard of her (thanks to Zhang Yimou) and there had to be a love interest, so here it is. It is unfortunate that his performance is almost wooden like the character of Jing Ke. He did much better (in Qiu Ju for example) to be thin; here he can barely manage his presence. But all this is trivial compared to Li Xuejian's extraordinary acting as Zheng himself. Qin Shi Huang is to the Chinese rather what the Satan of Milton is to us: accepted as bad, but noble. The successes of Qin Shi Huang radiate a reverential fear for all the two thousand years in the present and Li captures his terrifying will without compromising his humanity. Li's performance is sufficient, but the purpose of the film is great, even if the photograph is intentionally drab. It looks ancient. The score is adequate, scarcely moving even if very appropriate for the action. Although I only saw him once, I think Chen Kaige should be given more credit for his work with the camera than the other reviewers have allowed him. The opening credits are hilarious. If five stars are absolutely average, I've given three more for the acting of Li Xuejian and Chen Kaige as an actor, writer and director.
