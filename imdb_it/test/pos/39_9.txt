Since I first met Divine Ms. Merkerson as a sexual therapist in Spike Lee's "She's Gotta Have It," I was sold to this extraordinarily talented but terribly underrated actress. He received an Emmy for his performance here and to say that he is deserved is a masterpiece of understatement. <br /> <br /> Here it simply shines as the driving force and the hand in its community. This was particularly touching for me because I grew up around this time. The detail of the production was phenomenal and evoked wooooooooooooooooonderful memories of life and times during the 50s and 60s and of women like Mrs. Merkerson portrayed. She was accompanied by a warm and warm cast with shows that would have fun again and again. I saw the name of Macy Gray for the first time in the credits and I played a bad joke. His performance was so good, I didn't even recognize it until about a third of the way. I am particularly proud of the obvious care and attention to detail to create an appearance and an air of another beautiful era in Afro-American culture that was very tastefully crafted. <br /> <br /> Another very interesting aspect is that the project was less concerned with the racial fabric of the times but infinitely more in tune with the richness of the characters and the emotional diversity they provide to exemplify that ultimately it is of the choices we make and to what extent we accept responsibility for those choices. <br /> <br /> This is a worthy and elegant presentation of African-American life and is certainly destined to become a classic. You owe it to yourself to have it as part of your collection. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend.
