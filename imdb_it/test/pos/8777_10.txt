Hitchcock gave an interview in which he said he liked to direct scripts that made one think of an ordinary person who took care of his own business, who is accidentally involved in a terrible chain of events from which they cannot go out until the vile plot behind their problems are solved. In this way, the public can feel more sympathy for the hero. We certainly do it in this beautiful film. Barry Kane is just trying to help his fellow men perform acts of kindness and consideration, like helping Fry collect the letters he left at the factory. Barry also returns a $ 100 note lost to Fry later ... which was a BIG money in 1943 !! It is Barry's acts of Christian kindness that get him into trouble and, soon, he is wrongly accused of sabotage and murder and will probably get stuck if he fails to clear up. Similar to The 39 Steps in the plot, the hero crosses the country where he discovers plans for further acts of terrorism by fascist cells, an archaic villain that no one could believe to be a Nazi wardrobe, and a beautiful blonde, Patricia Martin , Who first suspects and then hates eventually falls in love with Barry Kane. Hitch's touches of humor are here too. Patricia is a billboard model that offers various street announcements to help and comfort Barry as he takes a ride with the bad guys, from Las Vegas to New York. We meet a truck driver who is a comic act by a man "Someone convinced my wife that it was elegant to eat three meals a day." Employees on the field of the fascism spy sound the rumble for having been forgotten or ignored by the "seeds" just as if they were working for some legitimate business. During a chase scene in a movie theater, members of the audience laugh at the action of a schocky comedy / film of the gangster while the saboteur's cell really shoots him with the good guys and accidentally kills a patron from movie cackles. Terrible for the dead, but fun! Hitch liked to use the famous monuments in his films and this is the best example, with the Statue of Liberty as a background and ironic icon! It works even better than the Mt Rushmore scene in NBNW.
