Freely, from one scene to another, from one story to another, just like when you are walking, from a shady path to an open place, like the wind in the leaves, from tree to tree, how many different sounds? Just like when they travel, people meet and tell their stories and then they separate forever, who knows? And just like when you walk through these places full of expectations lost from another time, the human "thickness" of the world takes your breath away. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with my friends, not everyone liked them, maybe they were too used to stories based on scenarios and ready, I don't know. So this film is for fools who like to watch the sun sparkle on the sea, walk unhurriedly on the hills or through small villages, listening to the growing grass, which tells the stories of those below, under six feet, in the wind summer heat.
