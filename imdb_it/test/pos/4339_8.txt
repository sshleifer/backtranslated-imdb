I had never seen the original Death Wish in the book Death Wish I (film). However, Death Wish 3 was the very interested film. The notorious vigilante, Paul Kersey, tried to visit his friend, Charlie, but he only visited him for a couple of minutes before he died, because Charlie did not pay protection for the giant and infamous underground gang led by Manny Franker. After some altercation during his time in prison, Kersey learned that Franker, with whom he fought in prison, had his own program to make New York City into the fire of hell (and even its influence) by sending his henchmen to set up crime every time, anywhere and every day. Because of the possibility given by Insp. Richard Shriker who knows his profile well and likes him very much. Kersey has decided to set the war with Franker and his gang. <br /> <br /> I accepted that Death Wish III was one of the extremely violent and extreme action films I had seen in the past. This film used the very direct way to tell the story. No thoughtful tale scenes and less useless scenes that was the only merit of the film. On the next issue, Violence was used pervasively in the film. I believed that many viewers would like the action scene of Death Wish III because it showed the raw, the extreme and the blast of action for every minute of the film, especially the culminating scene of the film and the death of Manny Franker I thought which was the maximum action scene. <br /> <br /> As for the cast, I think everyone was good at getting past their role. Charles Bronson has made everyone believe he is still as big as Paul Kersey. He didn't look like the "big old cat", but the great vigilante. Gavan O'Herlihy also did his job very well. His main role as a villain in the film made him look bad and he looks like the big bad guy. However, the role of Kathryn Davis in this film was pathetic. It didn't look like the main character. I thought that only two or three scenes had appeared before she was killed by Franker and his followers to set Paul Kersey on fire. He could have more role to appear. <br /> <br /> For my comment, the straightedge style and extreme violence have made this movie fantastic for fans of the extreme action movie. The frantic pace with the back and the Forth style made this film very interesting to watch. However, this film had a stupid scene and a hole in the plot. First, the scene in which Insp.Shriker faced Paul Kersey for the first time. It was very trivial because you attacked your favorite boy before you wanted to help him, it's like punching someone before you try to lend them money. Haha! it's like a joke! Although I liked the plot when Insp.Shriker was shown later that he helped Kersey because in the beginning, Shriker looked like the big bad guy because of his role in Kersey, but when the film went to a climax, everything was clarified that he did not have a hidden program with Kersey. <br /> <br /> In another case, the final scene of the film slowed me down. He stumbles over everyone's feelings because it's too easy. Members of Franker's band seemed incredible after discovering that Franker had died, before his girlfriend and other followers decided to flee. Eventually, Insp. Shriker allowed Paul Kersey to fly out of his town before the police captured him. I thought this final scene style could be found in many Cannon Film films, but I don't like it. <br /> <br /> For the summary, I'm fine with Death Wish 3 because of my explanation that I typed first. The cast, and the action was very good and so extreme, even though it had some scenes that I don't like. Straightedge and Extreme of Violence could be the best short description of this film.
