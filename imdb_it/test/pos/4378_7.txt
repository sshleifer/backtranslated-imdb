I can't say that I liked it as much as "The Big Lebowski" or "Raising Arizona", and I felt a little underrated, but "O Brother" is a funny movie worthy of some good laughs and a taste of the lively enthusiasm of the Coen, twisted sense of creativity. The DVD edition contains the featurette, and I was interested in discovering that the Coens are quite simple in their directing techniques. This surprised me! Of course, this film is not the best example (and I only say this in comparison) and was not worthy of any Oscar (many think it was robbed), but perhaps it depends on the appeal. Although I liked Coens's previous work, I've never been a fan of old westerns or "The Dukes of Hazzard" or anything else they show on TNN daily. I guess that's why I didn't feel so excited to see this movie, as it revolves around southern folk. For all those in the South who are reading this, I do not intend to offend any of your people! I'm sure you feel the same way when you watch films on urban areas like "A Bronx Tale". When you live in the city for life, it is difficult to get used to films of this nature. But apart from all the excuses, I found the characters funny and extravagant. I think John Turturro has perfectly nailed the accent, and seeing the way he speaks in real life I find it fantastic. Tim Blake Nelson was also good. Of course, George Clooney - who I assume is not the best at faking accents, judging by his decision to give up the idea of ​​working with a dialogue coach and developing a New England accent for "The Perfect Storm" - it seems naturally a bit mixed and continually struggles with the accent. His performance was good, however. You can also find Coen's regular customers like Holly Hunter (in a short but sweet role) and John Goodman (even on screen for a short time, but steals them every minute). <br /> <br /> Even if I don't do it I usually play country music, I liked the song of the title "A Man of Constant Sorrow". The DVD also contains the music video for that song. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found the movie to be fun and original, but it doesn't have the "in-your-face" quality that the Coens have shown us in the past. It is a lighter but good effort. I still suggest you take a look. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
