I saw it once probably like most of my age (55 years) in the 60s. I understand the dissatisfaction with the final product from both families. But this is a great film, it was a great work; but as a film it is wonderful. This film should be released at least for the video, other generations can appreciate the music and the story. The cast was composed of some of the greatest black actors of all time, most of them have now disappeared; only Sidney P. is still with us. Please don't wait for it to go away and the movie, like all old movies, becomes unusable due to the ravages of time. Again this is a great movie that is something that is not seen very often today, if at all.
