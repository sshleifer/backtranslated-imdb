If you are looking for an original horror movie, this might be the one for you. It's strange and sometimes focuses on stupidity, but it's just a beautiful, beautiful and original film, and it never fails, except perhaps during the climax that has lasted too long. "Nightbreed" is a must for horror fans, or for fans of monster makeup. <br /> <br /> Boone (Craig Sheffer) dreams of a city called Midian full of mutant creatures. In therapy, his psychiatrist Dr. Decker (director of horror David Cronenberg) has come to the conclusion that Boone is a murderer and gives him hallucinogenic pills and tells him to deliver himself. After being nearly killed, Boone ends up in the hospital, where he runs into a mental patient who also knows Midian and tells Boone where to go. Midian, located in a cemetery, is inhabited by vile mutant creatures that don't let Boone in. After escaping with only one bite, Boone was shot dead by the police, who were taken to his position by Dr. Decker. But Boone is not dead. The bite makes him live, and he goes to Midian. Meanwhile, Boone's girlfriend, Lori (Anne Bobby), tries to find Boone and go all the way. When Dr. Decker also finds out about this place, chaos ensues. <br /> <br /> The plot seems long and complicated, but it's not hard to understand. The plot, among other things, makes this film really interesting. The effects of makeup are stunning. The creatures seem unique and incredible, and make this a very attractive film. To add more appeal to the senses, we have a Danny Elfman soundtrack, which is both lush and swollen, and fits the film like a glove. Even the shots in the film are set beautifully. Cinematography is adorable and the film creates an atmosphere that never breaks. Even the acting is good, with the biggest surprise being the director David Cronenberg who offers a grandiose and threatening performance to the man, who for one reason or another wants to see Boone dead. It is strange that a horror film is so well done. <br /> <br /> The problems with the film ... well there are some, but the positives outweigh the negative ones. The script presents occasional limping jokes to try to add some humor, but almost all fall horizontally. The mutant creatures look great and for the most part they are well acted, but sometimes they seem to be just doing their fantastic camera trick. The worst part of the film should be the climax. It takes so long and it's just constant chaos. It is the part of the film that moves from single characters and beautiful shots of tight knit, to explosions burning from every direction and violence that happens to characters that we don't know or that interest us. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is amazing to watch. It is a horror film well done, but even with that said, it has the occasional failure in the character's jokes and a disordered climax. However, this is one to check. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** on ****. 101 minutes R for strong violence and language.
