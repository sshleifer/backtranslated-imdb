Just thinking about the movie, I laugh to myself. Anne Ramsey plays an unforgettable part as 'Momma', probably the most evil, but hilarious matriarch ever captured in the film. Danny Devito and Billy Crystal form a fabulous duo, bringing a real warmth to the film. Although not overly complex, the cute story catches your attention and makes you laugh all the time. It's a fun comedy to lighten things up and even entertain kids. I give him my full recommendation.
