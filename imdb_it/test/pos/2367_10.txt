Much of the "alternative" comedy in Britain in the 1980s was insular, misguided, overly politicized, and not much fun, and the worst of the Comic Strip Presents ... stuff back in this category. <br /> <br /> But this is the opposite extreme - a remarkable film that works on different intellectual levels. <br /> <br /> Is Dennis a criminal mind or is he lying? <br /> <br /> Are you telling the truth, bluffing, double bluffing, double-doubly-bubbly-bluffingwhatever? <br /> <br /> I've probably seen Supergrass 20 or 30 times, and I still can't decide 100%. This is the wonderful thing. <br /> <br /> In addition to Ade Edmonson, there are great roles for other early pillars of the Comic Strip - French & Saunders, Pete Richardson, Alexei Sayle, Keith Allen, Nigel Planer and Robbie Coltrane, although Strangely not Rik Mayall . <br /> <br /> The entire cast of the Comic Strip - although I didn't like the hidden agenda of some of their members - are convincing actors and turn into superb performances in this great film, while the team's work Richardson-Richens scriptwriters are often pure genius, with small details. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it is a study on crime, criminology and human nature, in all its wonderful complexity. And very funny with it. You will not be disappointed.
