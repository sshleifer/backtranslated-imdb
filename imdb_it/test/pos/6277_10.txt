To be honest, this is probably the best version of my book as a sound version of the Jazz Singer. The 1927 version is really a silent movie despite its first talkie. <br /> <br /> Danny Thomas is a great comedian, and he sings very well. He does Jewish things with feeling. Peggy Lee is fantastic and every movie that hosts her is always fun. Allan Joslyn is not too funny and we could have done without him. A question: since when did the singers live in such luxurious homes ???
