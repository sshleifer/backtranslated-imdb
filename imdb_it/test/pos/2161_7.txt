Check out the first 20 minutes, even if the suspense has not yet come into play. Let's take a look at the super-secret Los Alamos only a few years after the great bombing that helped end World War II. Except for the strict security, it seems quite threatening. Notice how he is a TV repairman, a normal and obvious guy, who guides us through security. Once crossed, it's like in every US city, beautiful homes, quiet streets, children going to school and a family TV in the blink of an eye. Later we see little Tommy and little Peggy having fun walking along the streets flanked by imposing structures separated by locked gates. The film seems to say "Ok, we're tough, just because we have to be, but we're still just people after all." <br /> <br /> Now, I expect it to be comforting message to the Cold War audience that is not yet used to the government's "dooms-day" search. It is a clear effort of popular reassurance. The only darker note is when Tommy's mother (Clarke) worries about her son's mental state. He does not say "when I grow up"; instead, it is "If I grow up". This note of doubt reflects not only a reality of Los Alamos, but also a national reality that in 1952 had just seen the video of the apocalyptic atom bomb. Also note, as the FBI agents are professionally interpreted, a standard feature of the McCarthy era tariff. When brute force is needed, it is not they, but private citizen Gene Barry who discloses the information in an earlier version, I suppose, of the "representation" of the modern era. <br /> <br /> Once the abduction occurs, the suspense does not stop. The intrigue is well managed with the colorful locations of Los Angeles that make us guess. The climatic scenes around the houses on the cliff may not be plausible as a hiding place, but the view of northern New Mexico is exceptional. Furthermore, the ancient stone apartments represent one of the most exotic backdrops of the decade. Note also the widespread use of the police helicopter that is coming into use as a law enforcement tool. Among an otherwise subdued cast, Nancy Gates remains a sparkling presence as a teacher Ellen Haskell. Never Hollywood glamor, she was still a beautiful not celebrated actress and a winning personality. I also expect this to have been one of director Hopper's most successful film efforts, and although people have since become accustomed to the nuclear threat, the film remains a revealing and compelling document of its time.
