This film was well made but it also made me feel very down at times. For anyone considering the show, this is a must see as it shows the raw deal in what happens to these struggling workers. The soundtrack was definitely beautiful and the acting and the dance complimented nicely. Some of the student's attitudes may have been a bit far-fetched like those of Leroy, especially since I'm sure someone like that would have been thrown out immediately for refusing to read and if this was the real High School for Performing Arts. The Coco screen test is hard to watch for all the people out there with a weak stomach, please pay attention to my warning. While it is very gritty, I know that it is the truth about what happens in this sense, the film is right. Overall it's fun and even if some parts drag on most of which go very quickly. <br /> <br /> Final Grouping: <br /> <br /> Movie: I probably would have missed it. <br /> <br /> Purchase DVDs: not something I need to see again and again. <br /> <br /> Rental: worth renting at least once in your life!
