I remember seeing this movie in 1981, when I was 7 years old. It was absolutely brilliant! I found the DVD only a couple of months ago. I was almost jumping up and down with joy !! I bought it and showed it to my children. They loved it too. They asked what words the seahorse was singing (I didn't tell him, because I don't think that pronouncing the words "gay" and "ecstasy" to 6-year-olds is an excellent parenting). The songs are brilliant. I still remember them all. I'll remember them again when I'm 60! There, or near around. Tommy Pender is (was) a brilliant actor. Too bad I gave up. <br /> <br /> If you find the movie, BUY IT! You will like it!
