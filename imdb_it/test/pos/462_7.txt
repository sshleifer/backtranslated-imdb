A good show, a really good acting, and the director makes us go through his plot in an interesting and unpredictable way, above all because, essentially, they are two people in a room. It doesn't run through as many modern movies, but it doesn't drag either. Bohl is brazen enough to believe her in the hour of her character, who is still involved and will not return to her "career" choices - so it's credible without her needing to show us a deep, self-examination of her soul ... has the delicate balance of weight, innocence, gentleness and class to bring out 'Buddy' very well. A little grainy on the quality of the film, but adapts to the tone of the story. He could use some polishing on his hair and make-up, but it's definitely worth watching.
