Even if he doesn't give one more than the previous posts here (like Ruby Liang's) I wanted to share my point of view. I hope my English is understandable. <br /> <br /> Bon voyage is a rhythmic, light but profound presentation of unorganized French, but also courage and charm. In a France of 1940 brilliantly reconstituted and with many details (from the luxurious Bordeaux hotel occupied by the government headquarters and attacked by useless high-class French, to the Parisian cafes near Le Pantheon / rue Mouffetard and the cars of the thirties) Gérard Depardieu and Yvan Attal give their second role a brilliant taste;) Isabelle Adjani and Virgnie Ledoyen are very credible in their drastically different roles, and Grégori Derangère makes a bewitching performance :) <br /> <br /> Much lighter than average (eg American) war movies and civilian-focused, Bon voyage shows many things about French problems (even to a French guy like me), some of them quite profound.
