Lou Gossett, Jr. is as great as "Chappy Sinclair", a super US Air Force pilot who comes to the rescue of a sympathetic but unruly "Doug Masters" (Jason Gedrick), the son of a captured pilot who is determined to take in loan an F-16 fighter pair to use in an attempt to save his father from a dictator (David Suchet) of an enemy foreign country. <br /> <br /> Better than "Top Gun", this aeronautical film advances in excitement and a lot of explosions - you know, all those interesting things you would like from a contemporary military adventure film. <br /> <br /> Cool music including Twisted Sister's Dee Snider who chirps 'We're Not Gonna Take It' and 'Never Say Die' by King Cobra is excellent. <br /> <br /> Aim high! Air Force!
