Graphically, it's the same game as the first at different levels and some new features added for fun. <br /> <br /> The PS1 version still has a problem in giving skaters enough space for some ground tricks. The Dreamcast version, which is rarely seen, was the best version of the 4 versions (Xbox eventually came out with a 5th with 2x), had the clearest resolution and the skaters seemed better and more detailed than the PS1 and N64 could handle . <br /> <br /> The levels are really incredible, from the beginning to the end, like the first, the school was my favorite, I liked it so much, not only for the golf cart that sometimes dragged you but for the length. This is what I liked about the first two games, they don't graphically improve these games, they focus only on the length of the levels, which is nice. <br /> <br /> Overall, as good as the first, and worth playing.
