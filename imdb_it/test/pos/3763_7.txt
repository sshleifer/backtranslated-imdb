I really love this movie. I have to have it on DVD I have 2 VHS copies, but the quality is so poor that you can't read a joke written on the ward door. I am perpetually amazed that Blankfield has done almost nothing since. It made both Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Hyde credible. <br /> <br /> The film is plagued by its low budget. (An atrocious modification jumps into the central word and has been described in "Siskel & Ebert".) But there are a thousand jokes, gags of sight with subtle references, which more than compensate. I often cite lines (or, singing, "I have nothing to hide") and, from time to time, completely describe a scene that corresponds to some conversations. There are, at least, six scenes that are among my favorite comedies of all time. <br /> <br /> Viewers without history of cocaine use can lose a lot of gags. <br /> <br /> "Here, take it." * The view of driving while waving out the window. * "I said, 'Is this place occupied?'" "Beautiful burns!" Vision of chaps, headgear, jockstrap and fins. * "Yes. I'm right-handed." * "Me! Me!" says the woman trying to sell 'nads. * "Bernie will love these." * "These are my feet, Jack." says the black feet. * "Why should we tell you?" ... "IT'S AT THE SUPERMARKET!" * "Ivy!" on PA supermarket. * Loading entire shopping cart in ambulance. * etc.
