This film has some pretty shocking scenes and topics they consider as it was made in 1971. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood, Geraldine Page and Elizabeth Hartman do an excellent job in the film, as well as all the cast members. <Br /> <br /> Set during the Civil War, the film begins when a wounded Yankee soldier, Johnny, played by Clint Eastwood, receives refuge and help in a women's academy located in the south. <br /> <br /> The school director, Mrs. Farnsworth (Geraldine Page), the only teacher, Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman), and a small group of half-grown girls have been without a man in the middle for maybe a little too long. > <br /> While their loyalty lies in the Confederacy, their physical emotions and needs lead them decidedly in the opposite direction. Johnny immediately uses his masculine charm to try to win over women on his side - and prevent him from delivering it to patrolmen. <br /> <br /> However, feelings previously fueled by incestuous behavior, an adulterous father, brutal rape and adolescent inexperience combined with jealousy - turn things upside down with some unexpected consequences for both Johnny and residents of school. <br /> 10 stars
