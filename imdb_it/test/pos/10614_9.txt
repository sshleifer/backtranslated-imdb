I saw this movie over 20 years ago and I still remember how much I liked it. it really touched me, and I really enjoyed the work of noel coward. highly recommended: atmospheric and touching. <br /> <br /> I think of this film from time to time, and I am disappointed that it has not enjoyed so much of a revival of many classic films. I didn't realize until I looked for him today that he won an academic award for the best original story for Ben Hecht and Charles Macarthur. <br /> <br /> basically it concerns a bad character who destroys another's career and is cursed because of it. he dies, but he is granted redemption if he manages to convince someone to shed a tear on him. most of the films show him in search of this goal. well written and adorable. I had met him for his plays, so I was surprised to see him in this role on TV late one night in New York. a must see if you ever have the chance.
