This is probably one of those films that are too commented but not yet discovered ... This is probably a masterpiece of Spanish cinema like a piece by Bu√±uel's masters. "15 days with you" could be the best "now and their" revisitation of other films from a long time ago: it could be "Midnight Cowboy", but it could also be "Les amants du Pont-Neuf" or a realistic film and not -spot-look (but more realistic) "trainpotting". This hard story has the place of humor, love and of course the dramatic sense. In the new Spanish social cinema this little diamond could be the resurrection of the neo Italian realism mixed with the best films of Ken Loach. Probably the best film I've discovered in the last 10 years.
