How I Spend My Vacation closes the television series broadcast from 1990 to 1992. I have always liked the series for what it is. I've never compared the series to the Looney Tunes of old times. The video's release was divided into four or five episodes (I can't remember as I'm writing this) for television and is included in the list of episodes in the series. The positive thing about this series is that all the main characters of the show have an important role in the story. Let's see what everyone is doing during their summer vacation in different parts of the world. Elmyra is with her parents in a Safari, Plucky and Hampton crossing the country with Hampton's parents, Fifi is on some beach, etc. The climax is very good and in the end all the characters of Tiny Toon get together for the beginning of a new year in the "Looniversity", so practically closing the good run of this TV show.
