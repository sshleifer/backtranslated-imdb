The Great Dictator is an excellent film. Charlie Chaplin manages to be both extremely funny and witty and at the same time provides a strong statement in his satire against fascism. Chaplin's anti-Nazi speech at the end, with its values, is one of the director's great moments. Throughout this film, I felt that there was a form of superior intelligence, beyond truly intelligent cinema, at work.
