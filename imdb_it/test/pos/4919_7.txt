To be honest fellow IMDb, I really enjoyed this show. The reason? Well, he didn't try to be more than he is; I mean, a sitcom with regular expectations, a well-known and repeated storyline, fun and talented actors, and smart jokes geared for a post-college audience. <br /> <br /> This is what Grown Ups is all about: try being mature but in a fun way. <br /> <br /> Jaleel White is fun as always and offers witty and witty jokes. Humor is very '90s without taking into account the trends of the new millennium and this is the main reason, in my opinion, of why the show was not successful. He was stuck in the 90s. <br /> <br /> Oh and Mrs. Ribisi was really fun and lively. <br /> <br /> My favorite show must be the one that takes care of Karma biting her ass! It's not a cult classic, but I'm sure it's part of the normal nostalgia of the early 2000s.
