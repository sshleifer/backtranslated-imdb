This was one of the most exciting movies I've ever seen. Passion, Pleasure, Pain, Despair, Pain, Healing, Cleanliness and Love. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was fascinating. Everything has been done so well; adaptation from the book, from the actors, from the sets, from the camera shots. <br /> <br /> This film has touched me deeply in so many ways. It reminded me of the despair that can lose your love and the time it takes to heal that wound. You could love again, but you will always risk the pain of separation. <br /> <br /> Is this not one of the most important secular questions? <br /> <br /> "Is it better to have love and lose? <br /> <br /> What have you loved before?" <br /> <br /> - Ascension
