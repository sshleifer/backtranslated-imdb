It only serves to show how wrong you can be. I didn't expect me to like this movie. I was disappointed both by the Kill Bill films (although I preferred the latter) and by Death Proof (although it was better in the shorter cut of the double-bill version). I love Reservoir Dogs, I admire Pulp Fiction and I think Jackie Brown is the most mature piece of Tarantino's film - technically his highest - including Robert De Niro's last great performance. Since then it seems to me that while his films were good (I didn't hate them) he trampled the water in referential, reverential, self-indulgent juvenilia. <br /> <br /> Then I read the script last year for Inglourious Basterds - and I hated it! Of course, it had some typical aspects of QT and the opening scene was undeniably powerful. There were a couple of fantastic characters. But on page it was more juvenile garbage, largely ruined by the generosity of the uninteresting Bastards of the title. It made me seriously think about not seeing the movie. The trailers did nothing to convince me. I just changed my mind when I had the opportunity to watch the film with a Tarantino Q & A later in London. I thought it was worth listening to him in Q&A because I know from interviews how fun it can be in person. <br /> <br /> So little was I prepared for the exuberant fun and brilliance of Glorious Bastards. <br /> <br /> Easily the best work of Mr Tarantino since Jackie Brown is a triumph. <br /> <br /> Yes, the references are there but they do not interfere with the story, they are not the driving force. Yes, Eli Roth is a stunt but it works well, with little to do but seems aggressive, and does nothing to hurt the film as I feared. While admiring Mr. Tarantino for using stuntman Zoe Bell as if she were in Death Proof to amplify the euphoria of the main acrobatic scene, his lack of acting skills in a key role was a problem for the film. The same could be said of Tarantino's appearances in several films, in particular From Rod Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn, which Tarantino wrote. <br /> <br /> What really makes this work is how BIG it is. The western style of spaghetti in most of the style, dialogue and performances is wonderfully exaggerated without going too far into the quality of the Kill Bill comics. Violence is so great. Such great boldness. Brad Pitt is so great! In the trailers Hitler's moment and Pitt's performance bothered me, but in the context of the film they are hilarious. Pitt is really brilliant here, exactly what he must be. It's the spooky samurai of Mifune in Yojimbo, he's Robards Cheyenne of Once Upon a Time in the West, there's a very James Coburn atmosphere for him, and of course a margin of Lee Marvin. <br /> <br /> Christoph Waltz (who I didn't know before) and Melanie Laurent (who I first noticed in a brilliant British short by Sean Ellis in French) are sensational and I expect to see them both used a lot more in the future. Tarantino clearly did not lose his sight for the casting, which seems to have abandoned him in Death Proof. Waltz is equally great in his performance. Chilling, still theatrical. It's Fonda by OUATITW, Van Cleef by Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent is suitably innocent Cardinal but tough, a fighter. They both dazzle here. <br /> <br /> That every member of the cast gets the fun of what they are doing, while they don't allow themselves just having fun and trying to get laughter helps tremendously. The laughter - and there are many - come organically. Only Mike Myers is approaching to give the wink and pushing it too far, but his scene has reigned at the right time - with the help of a fantastic Michael Fassbender who seems drawn straight from the mold of the Great Escape leader of Attenborough. <br /> <br /> All the actors shine and Tarantino throws in wonderful flourishes, but those that work with the story. The introduction of Schweiger Hugo Stiglitz is a revolt. After a resounding slow opening and a glorious introduction to these glorious Bastards the rhythm never stops and more than two and a half hours flies away. <br /> <br /> It also looks beautiful, marking this as a return to the real movie -making rather than self-indulgent nonsense. The musical choices, as always, are inspired by Morricone. <br /> <br /> The film is bold and hilarious. After a summer in which almost all the films disappointed me, it was a great surprise that the film was fun and funny, but also engaging and impressive, in this case, where I would never have believed the script. Welcome back QT.
