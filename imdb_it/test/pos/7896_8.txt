Rich businessman Bill Compton (played by Dennis Patrick) accidentally kills his daughter's hippie boyfriend after an argument. In a panic, he retires to a bar and meets Joe Curran (played by Peter Boyle): a strong, angry, bigoted mouth that is bitter about how he became his beloved country. Unintentionally, Bill allows Joe to find out that he just killed a hippie. And this is only the beginning. "Joe" is a classic film of an unlikely friendship. A bond between two men, one of a white-collar background, the other of a blue background. Bill and Joe have one thing in common, they are in disgrace for how crazy the world has become. Dennis Patrick and Peter Boyle both gave very realistic portraits of their characters. With this "pre-Rocky" effort, director John G. Avidsen directs this low-budget gem with the same refinement as a film with a budget of $ 100 million. The script has excellent character development and a very realistic and realistic dialogue. Despite its strengths, this film has its weaknesses. The script falls asleep about 3/4 of the way, but wakes up just in time for the jarring climax. This film also features a very early and uninspiring performance by 22-year-old Susan Sarandon as Bill Melissa's daughter, along with her hippie boyfriend Frank, played very loosely by Patrick Mc Dermott. One could only be grateful to have been killed at the beginning of the film. Despite its few flaws, this is one of those forgotten 70s movies that shouldn't be. Although "Joe" is very dated to today's standards, the chemistry between Dennis Patrick and Peter Boyle is completely up to date today, and it is the glue that holds the whole movie together.
