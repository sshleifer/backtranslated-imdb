I saw this movie alone when I was a teenager in my hometown, in India, at a time when the only thing that fascinated me apart from the girls was the Tigers. I returned home after seeing him, with a lucid look in my eyes, that wanted to be that guy in the movie that made friends with the Tigers. What a movie and what a moment! The theater in which I saw it does not exist and has given way to a shopping center. I don't know how I'd feel after so many years and I don't want to ruin a childhood memory by finding this movie available on DVD or something similar and not finding it more interesting. I learned from the previous experience that a childhood memory is often overshadowed when one walks the weary streets of life every so often trying to rediscover their unadulterated past through films, only to discover that his innocent gushing is completely faded and no longer grata. And I don't want to throw away the memories of a movie in the wind. I don't have kids, so I'm probably selfish about leaving this movie in a sepia-colored area of ​​my brain, not wanting it on DVD. But if you are at an early age and want to remember the memories of a captivating childhood in the late years, try watching this movie (if you can ever). It will be really worth it.
