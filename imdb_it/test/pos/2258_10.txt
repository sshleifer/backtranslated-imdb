This film was one, if not the best film I saw last year, I highly recommend it as a very funny film, but the progress of the film turns into much more. do yourself a favor and watch this movie I saw a screener of this movie, but I will buy it not only for myself, but for many real movie fans I have the unfortunate feeling that this great film will be largely unacknowledged as in the case of many other films non-commercial. moving but heartbreaking movie will make you laugh, make you cry, make you think and yes you will think about it when it is finished and it is not what a good movie is!
