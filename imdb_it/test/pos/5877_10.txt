This superb post-war classic of the 1940s, tends to neglect these <br /> days. When it was published in 1945, it cleaned up at the 1946 Oscars, mostly at the expense of "It's A Wonderful Life". Both films were the best film, the best director <br /> and the best actor, all won by "Best Years". Frederic March, <br /> <br /> and Dana Andrews together with an amateur actor Harold Russell (a real life soldier <br /> <br />, who lost both hands in an explosion), plays the <br /> <br /> return of the soldiers, finding life is very different, from what they remember <br /> <br />. Myrna Loy is as superb as March's wife, who must keep the family together <br /> <br/> while she is away. The scene of tearing tears <br /> <br /> where March gather and Loy is magnificent. All three <br /> men find that they have trouble resetting post-war life, not just Russell coming to terms with artificial hands, and his finance <br /> <br /> (Cathy O'Donnell) tries to be too useful. Sam Goldywn said he doesn't care if the movie doesn't make money at all, as long as everyone in America sees the movie, so they'll appreciate what these men have gone through. If a film is worth 10 out of 10, this is it.
