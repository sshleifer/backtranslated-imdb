OK ... The end of this could be a kind of disappointment after what happened before ... And Klaus Kinski should have had his 10 second appearance cut off ... But there's no way to get away from the fact that this is a really wonderful and atmospheric euro thriller ... I can't believe I've never seen it before ... It's nice to know that there are films out there that are still worth tracking down ... And this is really ... Amazing graphics ... Spectral ... And creates an extraordinary atmosphere ... Florinda Balkan is perfect as our heroine ... And the scene on the beach with Nicoletta Elmi is the most relaxed and perfect acting you can see .. Lila Kedrova is a real visitor to the city that may or may not be what it seems ... If you miss the days of hay from the Euro Cinema, then go hunting for it ... There is a widescreen print decent that goes around ... And please, say it on a DVD restoration to someone ... They did it with the "Fifth Cord" directors ... And this is a much better film
