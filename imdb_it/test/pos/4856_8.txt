Others' main criticism of this film - namely that Macy suddenly looks Jewish after wearing glasses - is misplaced. The glasses are just the small change needed to CONVINCE the others that he is Jewish. The scene in which he tells his boss, (paraphrase) "but you know what my background is", along with another discussion with his mother, suggests that he had to fight this same hypothesis in the past. The glasses now make him seem Jewish enough to "confirm" the existing suspicions of his neighbors and colleagues. Then there's the big nose of his new wife and the taste for noisy clothes, which PERCORSO means she is Jewish. The whole point of the film is how those stereotypical little notors become the whole basis for judging others. <br /> <br /> If he has a lye, he must be gay. If he has long hair, he smokes drugs. If he is Hispanic, he has a knife ... and if he has round black glasses and has a minimum build, he must be Jewish. These statements seem to me equally (im) plausible. If the conclusion that people were jumping on Focus was reasonable, the whole point of the story would be lost.
