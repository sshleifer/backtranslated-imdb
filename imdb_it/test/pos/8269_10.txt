Just read the reviews of this wonderful BBC mini series that reminded me how much I enjoyed it when it was first shown many years ago. At the moment I remember waiting anxiously for the next episode and I fell in love with John Bowe and Janet McTeer, two talented actors who haven't seen much on TV or in the cinema these days. <br /> <br /> I have tried unsuccessfully to get some of the fantastic BBC dramas of the past, including the 1973 version of Jane Eyre and the 1972 version of Anne of Green Gables, all wonderful timeless classic stories, which unfortunately it seems that the BBC has no intention of publishing videos or DVDs. If someone learns otherwise I would like to hear them. <br /> <br /> In the meantime we will have to settle for our memories of how wonderful they were.
