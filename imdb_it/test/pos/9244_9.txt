I found this a funny account of the challenges that an independent director might encounter (something I never thought of). The film managed to keep my interest all the time and I actually laughed stronger than it used to be! I'm not a director, so I don't know anything about technology, but I thought it was well cared for and flowed smoothly by telling the story. As a disclaimer, I contributed to this effort after providing the music for the soundtrack, but I was not involved in the creation of this film and could not tell you anything about Repo Man, except that I remembered seeing it before (I am not really a science fiction fanatic). I liked the comparisons of the punk rock file with punk rock music. My wife went with me to watch the movie and she knew nothing about it and we had a lot of fun.
