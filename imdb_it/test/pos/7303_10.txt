Having seen this film years ago, it never faded from my memory. I always thought it was the best performance of Michelle Pfeiffer I saw. But I am stunned by the number of negative reviews this film has received. After seeing it again today, I still think it's powerful, moving and can't care less if it's "vaguely based on King Lear". <br /> <br /> Now I realize that this is the biggest performance of Jessica Lange I've ever seen - and that she has received awards for her less profound efforts. <br /> <br /> A thousand acres is complex, humane, vibrant and immensely moving, but it certainly does not present either of them the female door with any touch of glamor or "sensuality". I don't think this is well received these days. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the reasons why this film's response is overwhelming is that the writer (Jane Smiley (screenplay (Laura Jones) and director (Jocelhyn Moorehouse) is a woman, I know, in my younger days, I wouldn't have read a book written by a woman, I didn't focus on this until a few years later. <br /> <br /> you haven't seen this movie or given a chance in the past, try looking at it again, maybe you're ready for it.
