A highly literate and intelligent drama about a group of international travelers detained in 1956 in Hungary, invading the Russian communist regime. Kerr and Robards play lovers, she is a British baroness, he is a Hungarian freedom fighter who tries to do his part for his country. Other New York theater stars of the period Anne Jackson and E G Marshall play an American couple traveling with their two young sons, including Ronny Howard on his big screen debut. The character of Jackson is enormously pregnant and not anxious to give birth in a future communist country; gives a passionate plea in the third act of this film that foreshadows the naturalistic acting styles we learned today from Redgrave, Fonda and Streep. Leading the pack of Soviet wolves is Yul Brynner, magnificent as commander and at his highest level since he starred alongside Kerr in "The King and I". He is bad, bad and terribly in conflict with his attraction to the adorable, patrician and heroic Kerr. This is one of the great transitional films of the last part of the golden age of American cinema. Do not miss it.
