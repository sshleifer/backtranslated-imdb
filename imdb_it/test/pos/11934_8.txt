I saw this movie for the first time a year and a half ago and I loved it, I decided to get the DVD last year for my birthday .. It has the right amount of suspense, action and drama .. This movie is about of the preparation school called The Regis school and its school full of rebellious children, in which a William Tepper child (Sean Astin) has difficulty regulating due to previous refusals by other schools because they could not control his rebel act and now at The Regis School engaging in more acts of a rebellion, the school is taken over by terrorists on a random day and the real reason is because the father of leader Luis Cali (Andrew Divoff) has been sent to prison, and the boss will do any what to kill the students, place bombs and so on to bring back his father. <br /> <br /> Along with William Tepper, they are his rebel friends at the Regis School, one in particular is Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton) in which this boy has a troubled past of living in a mafia family and being sent to The Regis School to hate his father for what he is and now has to deal with these terrorists who take over the school, so William, Joey and other friends must come together to stop these terrorists from violent acts and dangerous tactics. /> <br /> This movie was really cool and I think people should notice it more because when people think of a good hostage movie they would say "Die Hard" and even if I should agree with them, they need to recognize that Toy Soldiers was a good thriller, he surely beat my heart because the students are my age and I would be scared to face terrorists like these if they took our school ... But overall this movie is really good 112 minutes of your time and if I had the decision to rent it or buy it ... I'd buy it! I recommend it with a lot of hype! 8/10
