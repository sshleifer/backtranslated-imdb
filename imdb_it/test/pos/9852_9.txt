I heard about this documentary for so long that I realized that I needed to take the time to watch it. As a documentary it is very well done, as it requires a neutral looking view of their experience. There are no comments or interviews. It's honest It's true. It is also humiliating. Two comments really remained with me after the film was made. One was the way kids are told not to be like American boys wearing baggy pants, and like Africa there is time but no money, but in America there is money but no time. The biggest impact was the way kids are hungry for education, and how one of the boys totally moved in order to go to school. I saw this film with a second year of high school that said it bothered him to see how boys were brought into their new lives without a real orientation to America. He also said he knows so many American kids who simply can't appreciate their lives in America. I would agree with him on both accounts. A strong film that will leave a person thinking about many things.
