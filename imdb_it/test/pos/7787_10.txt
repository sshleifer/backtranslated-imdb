Andaz Apna Apna is my favorite comedy movie of all time. Both Aamir and Salman khan played brilliantly while Aamir's acting was much better than Salman. Aamir Khan is known as "MR. PERFECTIONIST in Bollywood and shows it in every film he makes. <br /> <br /> The story moves around two young boys Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan) both come from poor families and I'm a great dreamer. They want to get rich without enduring any pain. So when they hear about Raveena Bajaj (Raveena Tandon) daughter of Mr. Bajaj (Paresh Rawal) coming to India to find her husband, they both deceive their fathers to marry Raveena Bajaj and the journey begins.There is also a turning point in the film that makes the film even more enjoyable.Paresh Rawal has a dual role (Teja and Mr. Bajaj) and has acted brilliantly as usual. (the criminal Gogo) also adds a great comedy. <br /> <br /> This film is a comedy to tease from the first to the last minute and is one of the classic Bollywood comic films.
