Sorry to repeat myself endlessly, but here is another great episode of Columbo. I guess that's why I'm a fan: most of the episodes are really cool! The best episodes always have an extraordinary characteristic, and in this case the murderer and his accomplice are perhaps the youngest villains of Columbo ever. <br /> <br /> After seeing a lot of episodes in which Columbo and his adversary behave like close friends, it's nice to see an episode in which the spirits mix and the bad feelings rise to the surface. It only gives a slightly more dramatic and biting episode. Columbo is quick on the fact that the two students who claim to help him are not laughing at him secretly and giving him false clues. Play happily, deliberately raising the rumble in front of them to make them underestimate! But obviously he knows instantly when they talk about bales. <br /> <br /> The murder itself is another complicated one, along the lines of the episode The Bye Bye Sky High IQ, with a sophisticated chain reaction of events that manages to kill the intended target while providing the killers with a apparently waterproof alibi. In the years between 1978 and 1990, the technology has shifted from turntables and firecrackers to remote control systems and hidden cameras. <br /> <br /> Stephen Caffrey performs in a great performance like Justin Rowe, the hateful, spoiled student. Gary Hershberger is discreet but as good as his "yes-man" friend Cooper Redman. And it's nice to see Robert Culp as Mr. Rowe, Justin's father. <br /> <br /> A very satisfying episode in all ways.
