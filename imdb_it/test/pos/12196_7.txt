Despite some acceptable adaptations of the main themes of the books, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED / THE VAMPIRE LESTAT has not remained faithful to the complicated story by Anne Rices. The deep layers that build all the characters have been torn to pieces only for their surface, if not for a completely different identity. The chronological order of the main events of the film seemed deformed and irregular. <br /> <br /> However, there were some things the film did to deserve my rating of 7. One was that the film strongly captured the effect that Lestat (among other vampires) had on public, especially young girls. The film also did a good job focusing on the importance of heritage and history of which vampires were proud. The sensuality scenes were also environmentally satisfying. <br /> <br /> The acting in QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was moderate, if disappointing. Stuart Townsend and Aaliyah have a surprising chemistry, even if it shows only when the acting is at its best (not very often). The characters are nothing compared to those set in INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE. The emotional intelligence of THE FEAST OF ALL SAINTS is also missing, which is a shame because Rice's Queen of the Damned had this and more. <br /> <br /> This film does not give all that it appears to be. The effects are boring and very disappointing. The extravagance required in many scenes is not given and the dialogue is tiring. The settings for many scenes are not as I imagined them in the book, and I think many of them haven't been taken from history. There are only a few areas of inconsistency near the beginning and the middle of the film, but it wraps up quite well, giving the viewer a complete story (if they hadn't read the book). <br /> <br /> Somethings that I think the necessary film includes a good original score (Howard Shore or Elmer Bernstein), instead of the mix of rock music; although I had no problems with some songs. Another thing that would have made the film better is the set direction. The scenery was boring and unclear, which is important in a story that moves quite often. <br /> <br /> Overall, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED was a non-disappointing but somewhat satisfying adaptation of the important novel. With some simple modifications, it could have been a very successful film. I would recommend this film to people who have seen INTERVIEW or who have read the books, so that they can express their opinion on the adaptation.
