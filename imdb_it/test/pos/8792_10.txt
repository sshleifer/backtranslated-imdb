I love this movie! I love all the characters and I can watch it again <br /> <br /> and again ... and I like to hear the soundtrack again and again. <br /> <br /> Although I saw it about two years later it was done and I was never as young as Jip and company that I can <br /> <br /> understand them and I love their stories. And if someone thinks this movie sucks, I disagree and say that it is full of positive energy, friendship and love ... and full of young people! <br /> <br /> The weekend has landed ... have fun!
