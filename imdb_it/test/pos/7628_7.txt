Stupidly beautiful. This film embodies the genre of film "so bad is good". <br /> <br /> The only two talents are Richard Boone and Joan van Ark, and only Boone is good. It's a little sad that the man who became famous as Paladin should end up in this ugly celluloid pile. While turning in a fantastic performance, I couldn't help but feel that he outclassed all his fellow actors in this piece that shouldn't even have been there. <br /> <br /> The effects in this film are ridiculous, but fun. The idea of ​​a dinosaur that is buried in the wall of a cave and that suddenly comes to life is the gold of film B. When the "triceratops" is killed, it looks like it falls. It is clear that the stuntman in the costume FRONT knows the best times. It falls to the ground, long before the rear half of the dinosaur follows the example. <br /> <br /> Speaking of "seeds", there is nothing good to say about the purple tyrannosaurus in this film. He seems to have some sort of stealth technology, since Bunta (known to be the best tracker in the world) twice fails to notice it until he is within his bite radius. I don't know what all the prints are like, but in the version I own, the roar of the Tyranno contains the bellow of Godzilla's trademark. <br /> <br /> This is a lot of fun to watch, if you like bad movies. I love them, and especially the films of evil monsters, so I consider this the jewel of my collection. If bad movies are your passion, take this definitely.
