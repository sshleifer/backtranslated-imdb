"Icky Flix" is a great starting point for anyone who has even a vague interest in Residents. Most of their classic videos are present (although "Earth vs. Flying Saucers" and "Do not Be Cruel" are curiously missing), and the "concentrates" of their various CD-ROM projects offer tantalizing glimpses of how the orbeds they have spent their time since they realized that MTV was no longer running them heavily (or, in effect, showing the video period). <br /> <br /> All the videos of this compilation present impressive images and idiosyncratic music (with the choice of the original tracks and those just recorded). And two of them - "The Third Reich 'n' Roll" and "One Minute Movies" - are in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art. Check out this DVD and find out why.
