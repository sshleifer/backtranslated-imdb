TV-14 rated for content and sexual language. <br /> <br /> I remembered hearing about this show in 1998 when it played on the Teletoon channel. I didn't look at it then but now, the channel is playing, Razer. I've seen about four episodes of this show and I have to say that it's quite intelligent and fun. <br /> <br /> The show sees the fame of Jason Alexander of Seinfeld and also Tim Curry of Rocky Horror Picture Show and It fame. The show is about a duck who is a cop. He basically does his job as a cop, facing personal problems. This show is pretty funny at times and fans of animated comedies will appreciate this.
