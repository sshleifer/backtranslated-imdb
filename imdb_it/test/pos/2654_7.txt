"2001: A Space Odyssey" is set in 2001 and the main character is HAL. A computer. Exactly, a computer that talks and thinks for itself. This was done in 1968 and to think that by 2001 it would be conceivable that computers spoke like a joke. If this were in 3064, a talking computer that had emotions and had made its decisions would have been considered just as moralistic as that. There is nothing in this film that causes any kind of emotion. It causes two reactions and one is called: sleep. Start with nothing but a pitch of black pitch for well over two minutes. So the first shot we see that has some kind of lighting is the sequence "The Dawn of Man". So, if it is in chronological order, the darkness before it, is the birth of the world? <br /> <br /> During the sequence "The Dawn of Man" from where, a huge monolith comes from? from earth, from heaven, we will never know where it comes from, but for one reason or another it is there. The monkeys go on Apesh! T once found this monolith that only the man could have made, but that's the trick ?? man has not yet evolved. So who created it and where did it come from? What is its purpose? Monkeys find an instrument. Monkeys use bones to fight an opposite group of monkeys. The monkeys with weapons are now the dominant group because they used their mind to gain an advantage. The most advanced monkeys and, above all, the most intelligent and innovative monkeys, are the dominant group in that they have conquered the trough. <br /> <br /> We quickly ascend into space, millions of years later, where we see a group of spaceships floating around classical music. We can see the earth, the moon, the sun, the universe and for a film made in 1968 the visual effects are stunning but outdated. The score is legendary. Cinematography is spectacular. The editing is atrocious. There are an infinite number of shots of squared-looking spaceships floating in outer space to, for a feeling of infinite time. Once on board there is not much to talk about. For the next hour Kubrick shows various life shots in space. Kubrick shows us the life of an astronaut, which is very boring, and we receive the message completely. The internal and external spaceships are bulky and obsolete. Do you remember how the first cell phone was? Neither do I, but it is what resembles the future in 2001. All the characters have dresses and hairstyles that look like 1968. The chairs are decorated in bright red colors and strangely modeled because we know that, in the future, we will be sitting in chairs with an appearance strange. Computer screens are horrible and this is obviously older than HDTV because the clarity is atrocious. All the televisions seem to be from 1968, so it's not all that futuristic. Like all films set over 20 years in advance, they look terrible and unconvincing. Just because this is Kubrick, we shouldn't say, "Well, that's how you might think it looks." No, I wouldn't. Just as if I didn't think a computer would talk to me in the year 2047. It won't happen and if someone made a movie right now, set 30 years in time and had a talking and thinking computer, I'd laugh at the stupidity of it. Just like I did with "2001". <br /> <br /> HAL is the liveliest person, shoot ?? I just called someone. HAL is a computer, but it has more life than all the muted characters in the film and actually thinks it's alive. HAL is the only thing that is lively and sees humans like his maintenance workers who take care of him while he does all the work. HAL "reads" the lips of one of the very few conversations between Dave and Frank, and "sees" that they are planning to shut it down. This is where the only dramatic part of the film enters. A battle that takes place between a red light and a boy in a spaceship trying to get into the largest ship. Oh, the drama. Once HAL thinks he has the upper hand, Dave returns to the spaceship, demonstrating the ingenuity of man. Dave proceeds to close HAL. HAL, begs his life as he slowly fades away, which, like everything else, seems to last forever. <br /> <br /> The final act is as boring as the first two. Once again, the monolith found by the monkeys appears at the end. It comes out of nowhere again. Thus, a child is born into a placenta shield that faces the earth from space. What is Kubrick saying? Is it about transformation? Dave to a child? Is man evolving again? Kubrick is saying that this is the end of man and the beginning of ?? whatever is that alien-looking thing? Maybe I'm going crazy trying to figure out what this crazy director is trying to say, but the more I think about how much more the beginning and the end make sense. There are so many questions left unanswered, especially for the purpose of the monolith. If you can make it through the film, it should make you think. <br /> <br /> Eventually the film struggles to get where it wants to go. The first act and the third act are strong, but the second act revolves around, suspended in a point for what seems eternity. There are some interesting things in the film that will cause some reflection if you give it a chance. Once the beginning of the film makes sense, the ending works much better, even if you don't do what Kubrick is trying to say, which is not true.
