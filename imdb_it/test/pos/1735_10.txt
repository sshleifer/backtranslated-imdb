2005 will go down in the history of "Dr. Who" as his most incredible year. Everything seemed to click; a new doctor and first-rate companion, a large audience (10 million for the first episode and a Christmas special), important awards, critics 'acclamation and those idiots who have spent years giggling in Daleks' apparent inability to negotiate stairs have been silenced. But then Christopher Eccleston dropped a bomb, leaving only one series. It seemed that the honeymoon was over. Fortunately, the public seems to have embraced his successor, the excellent David Tennant. In addition to this, the show boasts a good S.F.X., like the spaceship crashing into "Big Ben" in "Aliens Of London" and superb narrative lines like "Tooth & Claw", "Army Of Ghosts / Doomsday". The new 'Dr. Who' is basically the same as the old one, updated only for the 21st century. Some fans have accused Russell T. Davies of "ruining" the show. They must remember that there was no show for sixteen years until it arrived.
