After 10 years, it's finally safe to say that our Belgian Action Star is back again. Personally I found this to be even better than Wake Of Death, which makes it his best film in ... 10 years !! Ok, it's not like his highlight years like Timecop, Universal Soldier, Sudden Death or even his best effort to date: Hard Target (one of the best action movies ever made by one of the best action directors John Woo. ) The Action is good, the story is exciting, the dialogue is quite funny, this is better than expected. The bad guys are fantastic like in Hard Target, and the fight scenes are "old school". Real fans know what to expect. I have to say that I gave up on him, but Van Damme is finally back. More please....
