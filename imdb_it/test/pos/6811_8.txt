The first in a new style of film for Lamas: no tattoos, motorcycles or karate. I miss them, for example. But this is a serious film. He plays an FBI profiler who has lived so long with the bad guys in his head that he no longer trusts anyone, including himself. Gary Busey is a great actor or someone I wouldn't want to meet in a crowded street in broad daylight. Kristen Cloke chases Lamas firmly as he pursues the serial killer. There is one surprise after another as the plot develops not the least of which is the ending. It seems to never arrive: there is always one more level in history. Cloke and Lamas start like good guys, turn into bad guys and somehow end up with heroes. But the rental price is certainly worth it. For maximum enjoyment throw in a candy bar, a bag of popcorn and a soft drink. You're going to the FILM!
