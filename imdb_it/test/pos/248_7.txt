This is definitely an exceptional 1944 musical with great young stars and famous veteran actors directed by Charles Vidor. Rita Hayworth, (Rusty Parker), "Charlie Chan in Egypt", sang and danced with Gene Kelly (Danny McGuire), "Anchors Away", Danny McGuire owned a night club in Brooklyn, NY and was in love with Rusty Parker who was a dancer in his club along with Phil Silvers, (Genius), "Coney Island", who was the comedian in this photo and also worked and danced with Danny, Rusty. Otto Kruger, (John Coudair), "Duel in the Sun" played the role of promoter of a magazine for girls and decided that Rusty Parker would become his top model. Jerome Kern's music is heard throughout the image and the song, "Long Ago & Far Away" is the theme music for this musical. This film was nominated for many awards and was a big box office success during World War II that kept people's minds out of the war that was happening at the time. Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly were instant successes and their career exploded on the big screen for many years. Great musical and a movie not to be missed, this is really a great classic movie. To enjoy
