I can hardly call it a great movie, but it's fun. In my case, at the time this film was released, I was the same age as some of the junior campers in the film. For me, watching this movie brings back memories of my camp years. While some of the jokes that take place in this film, such as bringing the camp director to his bed and leaving him on the side of the road, perched in the trees or on the lake, are a bit exaggerated, the other jokes are not. When I went to the camp, the campers and consultants came up with similar stunts, like running underwear on the flag pole, canoe battles and boys breaking into the girls' cabin. Growing up, I realized that these nightly incursions into the cabin of the girls I was attending had been carefully orchestrated by the councilors, so as not to find the girls in embarrassing situations, but at the time I thought it was real and it was fun. This is what MEATBALLS (MB) is. <br /> <br /> MB captures not only the scenic beauty of the campground surroundings, but the beauty of being young and carefree. MB is a great example of pre-teens, teenagers and young adults who live their summer without worries if not boys who connect with girls and girls who connect with boys and cabins having as much fun as possible before they get back to junior high and boys high school and university. The opening title song that reads "Are you ready for summer? ... no more homework, no more books, dirty looks from teachers ..." describes exactly how summer is seen by school kids. <br /> <br /> I personally liked the two campers Spaz and Fink. What guy, nerd or jock, didn't spend the whole field trying to please some nice camper girl? Which guy didn't want to be accepted by other campers and consultants? While these two characters are a bit exaggerated, I bet all those who watch the film can't help but appreciate these two guys. These two characters are a mix of Charlie Brown from PEANUTS and Jack Tripper and Larry Dallas from THREE'S COMPANY. I bet most viewers even rooted for Spaz in the competition that brings the egg and for Fink as he tries to "beat his stomach" in the hot dog contest. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film had normal-looking children and consultants. No super models for consultants or campers who wore fashionable clothes. It's fun to just relax and watch this movie and remember when life was as fun as this movie.
