I must say that this is a great film. <br /> <br /> Mike Judge keeps an eye on things that no one would ever notice then Office Space. It issues a statement about the absurdity of society and that the survival of the fittest is just an impossible dream in 500 years. That pop culture and mass marketing of affluent companies tend to dominate the day. Yes, there is a lot of humor in it and it is to move the story and its point of view. But the real frustration on Joe Bowers' private front is priceless and in some cases we can all refer to it at some point in our lives. <br /> <br /> If you don't like humor, look at it from another point of view and watch it again. Did it take me to look twice to really appreciate this movie for what it is? And with that said after seeing it twice, I'm going to read a book now.
