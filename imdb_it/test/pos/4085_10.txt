I don't usually like this kind of movie, but I used to work at home and I wanted something halfway while I was doing it. I so immersed myself that I gave up working to sit down and finish looking at the last half hour without interruption. And usually I don't cry for this kind of show, but in the end I cried. A lot of emotional nuances. Great acting and good southern feel. John Corbett is one of the most talented actors out there, and even the guy who played Luke was really good. Highly recommended.
