Ok ... it's 2005 and when you finally see this movie, I probably exclude that it's dated. But here's the thing, the script was bold, the music industry's exposure at that time was just as bold ... and it took some time to get the music created by African Americans promoted to the same level as white acts . In some cases it still is, but in the 70s this film dealt with some of the "backgrounds" that many have never known. Now we have "American Idol" - "Pop Idol" and other similar things that allow us to enter the mind of "record performers" and how they think they need to market something that sells and does not sell talents. <br /> <When I was a child, I loved the release of Earth, Wind and Fire from "That's the Way of the World" which contained some of their greatest hits: "Shining Star", "Reasons", "Yeanin ", Learnin '" and the title. I didn't know this was a SOUNDTRACK of a FILM ... until I moved to Los Angeles and got the wonderful "Z" channel. <br /> <br /> The channel "Z" showed this film as part of a "" Retrospective by Harvey Keitel ". Damn, I had no idea that Harvey Keitel had made so many films - and when I saw him, I was surprised. This film is not a cinematographic masterpiece, but it deserves more merit than the one obtained. It's a nice little movie. More than a "vanity piece" for Earth, Wind and Fire, Harvey Keitel does a great job as a record manager trying to "fight the system". There are lots of lessons to be learned from this, and a lot of "internal" exchanges that have been exposed. <br /> <br /> If you can find this uncut ... it's worth a look.
