It should be noted that this film was not "improvised" (as you are probably thinking), despite what the title suggests in the end. The film was heavily scripted and proven - Cassavetes didn't have enough money to sustain the inevitably high production costs of an "improvisational" film, even if it wanted to produce something like that. The "improvisation" of the film is contained in the actors' shows and the emotions they draw from the lines. <br /> <br /> Having said that, let me say that this is an extraordinary job that I am sure I will come back to again and again. The depths of the emotion that Cassavetes manages to draw from the smallest gestures and interactions are incredible. I have no idea how he was able to direct such extraordinary performances by the actors, especially in the conditions in which he worked. This is indeed a magnificent landmark of the film that I would recommend to anyone interested in exploring beyond the Hollywood mold.
