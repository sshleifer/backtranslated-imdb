Years ago I read the book 'A Máquina' (The machine). While I reread this little book again and again, I could never stop being increasingly fascinated by the writer's imagination and the richness of Brazilian culture. <br /> <br /> When I heard about the movie, I was really scared that someone could ruin one of my favorite books! Well, happily, my fears were unjustified and the film is such a wonderful and delicate work of art. <br /> <br /> I can't remember any other film that could bring tears to my eyes because of the beauty of the text itself. I also can't remember a performance as powerful as Gustavo Falcão's. <br /> <br /> You can see and feel how colossal his love for Karina is. You can understand that it will move mountains and will do anything for this love. <br /> <br /> See this movie, watch it through the eyes of the child that lives inside you, spellbound!
