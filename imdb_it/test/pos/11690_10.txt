First I have to admit that I had some doubts about the director. He made some films (with Jarkovsky) on the recent history "Czech = East" or more precisely on families (individuals) how they survived in some historical moments. But it was always like sweet and sour chines food. This film was completely different. It was pure, shows the bones of life, shows the variations of human natures. This film is an excellent work of art (history, acting, photography, music) but it shows you the life around you in a much more intense light that we don't want to see. By the way, I saw it on a DVD (with English subtitles) but I fear that I won't be able to understand it in the United States.
