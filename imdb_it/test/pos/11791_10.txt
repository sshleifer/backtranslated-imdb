I really enjoyed this movie. If other people want to give them an average of around 5.0 / 10 this is their choice. I would give it 10/10. Sutherland's performance as a private eye is absolutely fantastic. The story is incredible, human, exciting, intelligent. The dialogue is good The story may not be perfect but still - the mood of the film is good enough to compensate. Furthermore, the ending is incredibly beautiful and their jig-saw puzzle really comes together. So anyway I liked it. I also thought that the female lead actress performed very well. I'm not a big fan of detective films, but this was really good, also because they don't care about the conventions of the supernatural.
