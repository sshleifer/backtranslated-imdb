This film is excellent. Not because it does something special or new, but because it is always excellent in all its parts. No part stands out as "revolutionary" or "stellar", but all parts are far superior to the mediocre, and this makes me an excellent film. <br /> <br /> I own several copies of this film and could buy it on a collectible DVD or Blu-Ray someday (holding it down due to high blu-ray prices, and of course the face I don't have a Blu-ray player ... but this is next to the point of this review). <br /> <br /> It is a bit ordinary, but quickly turns into a drama full of tension, action, characters played with force, and a well-defined plot that keeps you interested until the very end. <br /> <br /> Wait, no, it does NOT start normal. <br /> <br /> Start in a similar way to what a Qun is. Tar. GREETINGS of the film could be. With a wonderful scene where an attempt to buy coffee and donuts goes ... very, very bad. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, nothing was as it seemed, and some people died, and some people are very rich. I won't tell you who ... look and have fun! Overall rating: 10/10, A **, Excellent!
