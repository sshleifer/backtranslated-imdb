I learned one thing: you have to take this movie as a fun vintage comedy, if you don't want to be disappointed. The film is fun because it's a delightful comedy. I think the over-hype has damaged him: the too glorious Monica Bellucci appears in a few scenes and is not as good as they wanted you to believe. It seems unnatural, false: the best actress in this film is Sabrina Impacciatore, who speaks with a perfect Tuscan accent and shines with Massimo Ceccherini. Elio Germano is very, very good: the most promising young Italian actor, in my opinion. Daniel Auteuil resembles Napoleon, but I preferred other actors. Thus, the most exaggerated performances were also the worst. <br /> <br /> The costumes and the design of the production are fine: of course, the American films are more accurate on these things because they have bigger budgets, but the Italian skill rewards the lack of money. A beautiful period comedy, in short, with a first-rate casting (except Bellucci and Auteuil).
