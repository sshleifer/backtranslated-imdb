I loved this movie! OMG! This movie was so hard! I found it among some old tapes and I didn't know what it was and after reading the back of the cover to see what the summer had to say about it (which among other things, mentioned the fact that Elton John covered the column soundtrack of the film more times than mentioned what the film was about.), I thought it sounded interesting, and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older film. <br /> <br /> "What controversy?" I thought to myself how I put the tape in the reader, I was curious to get. And my expectations were certainly met. I loved it! I guess it's a really girly movie, but it was so sweet and adorable! It was a beautiful love story, although sometimes the direction reminded me of the camera work in "The Graduate", which I thought when seeing it the director must have been acid with some of the close-ups they made . /> <br /> OK, so it was not entirely conceivable that these two children ran away and lived alone ... but it could happen ... in a fantasy ... <br /> <br /> But the ending has sincerely canceled! I was so upset with how they ended up ... it's like you let yourself get bogged down, and I suppose they might face what actually happens to them in the sequel ... but at the same time, I'm almost reluctant to see it, since the sequels I almost never live up to the first. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone sixteen and over! It's a fantastic movie ... Fantastic!
