I was lucky to have found this movie. I took advantage of the $ 5.50 Walmart DVDs because I watch a lot of movies (and very rarely do I watch television). I graduated from high school in 1968, so I have family and many friends who have served in Vietnam. This film really illustrates the pain I saw in my friends in dealing with what happened to them over there. I would like more people to see this film - I think maybe more people could understand what happened to our Vietnam veterinarians by looking at these excellent actors in the portrait of a family damaged by that war. The story seemed realistic - it's not lackluster, but it made me feel what they were going through. I think it helped that Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez played father and son, making their relationship more credible,
