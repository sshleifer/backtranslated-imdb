In one of the best films of the year, Tom Hanks plays Congressman Charlie Wilson in this sardonically funny and extremely relevant historical drama-comedy (given reasonably current events) surrounding the Afghan-Soviet fiasco of the 1980s. The Soviets were attacking Afghanistan killing hundreds of people. Why should anyone import? People are dying, right? No, the reason the United States was involved with Charlie Wilson was because the Afghans, fearing that they would be killed, illegally started entering Pakistan, which in turn arrested Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq. Charlie Wilson in an attempt to resolve this situation joined the sixth richest and fanatical religious woman in Texas, Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts) and a fun and robust American CIA spy, Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to help provide Afghans with high-tech weapons to destroy Soviet fighter planes that would attempt to attack their land. <br /> <br /> Although certainly not a serious Oscar nominee for best film, "Charlie Wilson's War" is probably one of the best of the many political films of the year. Academy Award winner Mike Nichols provides a solid direction as expected, while the Emmy Award Winner Aaron Sorkin (The Night of Sports, The West Wing) offers an extraordinary script that almost perfectly balances comedy and drama. Even acting is excellent for the most part. Tom Hanks offers his best and most entertaining performance after his Oscar nomination in 2000 as a FedEx operator stranded on a tropical island in 'Cast Away'. Hanks takes a slimy character like Wilson and with his distinctive charm turns him into a nice guy. Amy Adams and Ned Beatty are as reliable as ever, but the true performance of the film is by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Probably the best actor working in today's film industry, Hoffman takes a small supporting role and stages all those around him. From his first scene in which he is screaming at his boss before he violently bursts in his window, Hoffman sucks you inside. The only member of the disappointing cast is not overrated by the Hollywood star Julia Roberts. Making their way through yet another film, Roberts' portraiture and over-representation of a rich Texas woman hits all the wrong notes and at the most is annoying. At 97 minutes, the film is short and sweet, and this does not mean that you don't drag yourself in some places, but when you drag it for a very short time. <br /> <br /> In conclusion "Charlie Wilson's War" is definitely not a perfect movie, but it's definitely worth a look. Degree: B +
