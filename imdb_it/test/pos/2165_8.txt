Even though this is a good fun carton, later they have made much better ones, like Carrotblanca. This is almost the first feature of Star Trek, which would have been welcomed with open arms and with joy, no matter what, just to exist. This is really a mosaic of old bits with a few touches, but nothing special. It reminds me a little of the hunting trilogy in the spots and the finish is priceless. Available and certainly worth looking only for the novelty and the good things. Recommended.
