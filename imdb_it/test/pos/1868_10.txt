This sitcom was a big crowd attraction in the year 1984-1985. It was a time when people could see deserted streets in most of the busy Indian cities every time a sitcom was played on Indian TV screens. All this was the result of the creation of television broadcasting stations throughout the Indian nation. This was one of the essential elements of the modernization of the Indian television network strategy adopted by the late Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. It was also continued by his son Rajiv Gandhi. This series provided clean entertainment that most Indian TV audiences watched on their black and white TVs. A funny thing about this series is that it was sponsored by an indigenous company that deals with Ayurvedic products. A couple of days ago I spotted some episodes of this series but lacked the general equation of laughter. This goes on to show that it could be with the ever-changing passage of time that entertainment material loses its appeal and holds people's minds.
