This is the classic 80s humor. If you were a teenager in the 80s this was a summer hit to see. It was a first look at those now super stars. This and Better off Dead are just funny and stupid movies to sit and have fun. Everyone can admit that they had a crazy summer when they were teenagers. Even family members and crazy friends love these characters. Being introduced to some of these characters was a lot of fun. The uncle who is crazy sitting every moment of wake up at a radio waiting to win a million dollars, the grandmother who only likes the granddaughter and handed over a bill to the children after dinner, the twin brothers who do not resemble at all, and it was so much fun to meet hoopz. This may not be a reward, but it's just a fun movie to get lost in an afternoon.
