I saw this movie at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> This is the first Indian film I saw in Tamil, and while sharing some similarities with other Indian films (wonderful music and choreography, radical plot) , the director does not just try to entertain. The film tells the story of Amudha, a precocious nine-year-old girl whose parents tell her that she was adopted, thus beginning an odyssey that takes them from war-torn India to Sri Lanka. Extraordinary images mingle with gruesome scenes of violence to express a point explicitly, albeit simplistic. Amudha is interpreted by P.S. Keerthana, and she's one of the few child actors I've seen that can be precocious and not annoying. Its charm and beauty have combined the film.
