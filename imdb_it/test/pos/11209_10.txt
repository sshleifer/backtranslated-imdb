It's probably a year since I saw Uzak, but he left strong memories of the two main characters, the exhausted photographer Mahmut and his naive cousin of the Yusuf village. <br /> <br /> It is a long film with very few dialogues and a fairly limited plot. This has obviously irritated a fair number of spectators. But the film builds such a painfully credible portrait of Mahmut and Yusuf that there is so much emotional tension as in the most peaceful thriller. <br /> <br /> Just to be clear, there is no padding in this film - in the long pauses in which nobody speaks there as it happens in the emotions of the characters (and yours, observing them) as one could bear. Go see him awake and attentive, and you will be grasped rather than anesthetized. <br /> <br /> Uzak sounds real in so many ways, and that sincerity is probably his greatest success. People are not struggling with events and problems, as much as with each other. Indeed, throughout the film, there is probably no point where the main characters (Mahmut, Yusuf and Mahmut, the ex-wife Nazan) are not against it. <br /> <br /> Much of it is true throughout the world: country perhaps cousin Yusuf's deliberately naive attitude that a work on a ship will fall on his knees; Mahmut's urbanized cynicism and reluctance to sympathize with Yusuf. Other truths are more specific to Turkey: Yusuf's incomprehension that Mahmut could tolerate his tight-lipped stay; Yusuf wavering between the macho ambition and the wide-eyed embarrassment when he tries to meet a woman. <br /> <br /> Uzak is undoubtedly a rather distressing film, and Ceylan's strong point is not to beat the lead with the themes it explores. At least for me, I firmly believed in the behavior of his characters. All the small failed attempts to connect and the petty cruelties sound so true. Yet I didn't leave with a message that "The world is like this", but instead I had "This is the way we sometimes treat each other".
