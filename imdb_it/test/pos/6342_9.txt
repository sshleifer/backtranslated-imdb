At first glance of this mini ... I was a little disappointed that Tommy Lee Jones and Anjelica Huston did not return to the cast. Both John Voight and Barbara Hershey did a commendable job replacing very important characters for the continuing saga of this legendary Epic Western. <br /> <br /> Cherokee Jack Jackson (Haysbert) played an excellent bad guy, and Louis Gossett Jr. was, as always, true to his form with his excellent acting skills. <br /> <br /> The drama that seemed true to life in many scenes, including one of the best, in which the brave shooters who ended up shooting Ranger Walker made me feel that I was actually in the movie. The return to Lonesome Where it was for me, almost to the height of the quality of the first series. The next 2 followers with James Garner as Call did not make it for me. And that Lorena marries Pea Eye? How the hell did he get into them? That was a total imbalance of characters. The first 2 of the series made the history of Epic, the next 2 in no way were of the same quality. <br /> <br /> Now, if the first 2 could be remastered in Dolby Digital and an Anamorphic presentation, the movies could be where they should have been like today's movies.
