I liked this western Starring Randolph Scoot and Glenn Ford.it has pretty much everything a western should have. There are shootings, actions, horse pursuits. There is a bit of romance that is hinted at. There is a nice comical twist in the form of Edgar Buchanan, who plays uncle Willie McLeod, a character who pretends to be an old fool, but is actually aware of everything that happens. Randolph Scott plays the sheriff of the city, and Glenn Ford plays Cheyenne Rogers / Bill Smith, a hunted outlaw who eventually tries to change his way. I liked the different mix of characters in the film. I didn't find the pace always fast, but I never found it boring. Although the film is in 1943, it is in color. 8/10
