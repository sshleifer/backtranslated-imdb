Lackawanna Blues is an excellent film. The casting was perfect. Each actor and actress was perfectly suited to the role they played. Their chemistry together was amazing. The acting was superb. I felt like I knew the characters. I could almost "hear them". They reminded me of the people I knew as a child who grew up in the 50s and 60s. Oh, the memories !! My personal belief is that this film should have been on the big screen for everyone to see. I've seen this movie so many times that I can almost play the lines while the characters tell them. I can't even list my favorite part, because I have MANY favorite parts. Thank you for bringing back a part of my youth that I never see in this day and age ... and this is that the Blacks love each other, look at each other, respect each other, take care of each other and do everything they can to help themselves one another. Now I have to go. I have to go watch it again.
