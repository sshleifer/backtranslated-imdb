Another great performance by Tom Wilkinson punctuates "Separate Lies", a 2005 film starring Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, it is the story of a married couple, James and Ann Manning, in which her husband (Wilkinson) believes that he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident near their home the night they have a party brings the police around. It's a success and a race that killed their maid Maggie's Bassett's husband. James becomes suspicious of a neighbor, Bill Bule (Everett) when he sees damage to his car. He confronts Bule, who admits he did and promises to go to the police the next day. When James arrives home, Ann is angry because she gets a big deal and says she was driving the car. Of course, James is not so eager to rush to the police. She suggests calling Bule and telling him their decision. "Oh, f___ Bule," says James. "Well, that's right," says Ann. "I'm f___ing Bule." James's devastation is only the beginning of this well-made drama. Without giving away the plot, this is a good example of how gender change changes a story. Example of what I mean: Susan Smith drives her car in a lake and her children drown. She takes life in prison. What if the father did it? The chair. You would be surprised how often the result would be different. The same is true here - if James had the relationship and had done subsequent activities, viewers might feel differently from the story. If Ann were in James's place, it would be shocking. As it is, it is terribly sad. <br /> <br /> Tom Wilkinson is heartbreaking as a man blinded by the woman he loves, and Emily Watson does a good job as Ann, who, once freed from her lies - her involvement in the accident and the happy marriage - knows what to do. Rupert Everett as Bule is very effective: indolent, arrogant and ultimately in need. Everyone here is very civilized in their mutual relationships, and nobody is completely good or bad. <br /> <br /> There are separate lies - James that his marriage is happy, Ann as listed above - and there is a unitary lie - the incident, on which all parties are silent. It's enough for Ann that Maggie knows. In the end, everyone has to face the separate lies discovered by the single lie. <br /> <br /> Brilliant film.
