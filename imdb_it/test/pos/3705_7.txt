When her elderly mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) is attacked by her tenant Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) and turns into a cannibal monster, TV journalist Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas Miller) struggles to keep the dear old mother from satisfying her hunger. /> <br /> Although the plot summary above evokes images of slain and extravagant 80s horror titles like Flesheating Mothers and Rabid Grannies, Mom actually turns out to be an original and refreshing version of the werewolf / vampire / zombie mythos (exactly what Emily becomes is never really clear, but it is not beautiful!), as well as a moving study of the close bond between mother and son: Clay's devotion to his mother leads him to abandon all his other responsibilities, including her work and her relationship with her pregnant girlfriend Alice (Mary Beth McDonough), while Emily's love for Clay eventually drives her to self-destruction. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film could be sharper, with a more elegant direction and better effects (the creature's shots are kept very short, so as not to disappoint), and some more experienced members of the cast frustrate with terribly mischievous performances (Yes, Brion James and Stella Stevens, I AM referring to you); fortunately, however, the strong emotional current in well-constructed history alone is sufficient to guarantee that the mother is an effective, compelling and occasionally shocking story, which I do not hesitate to recommend to anyone looking for something different.
