I'm a Talent Manager. I have been for 15 years now. I discovered a wonderful talent. They have been in films, commericals, braodway and television. In my opinion, Eddie Monroe was wonderfully chosen. I like to see the ability of real people. Not just a name. The actors in this film have been very natural and credible. I was very amused by this movie. I love a movie with a few twists. I also like it when the puzzle is solved at the end of the film. I would still like to know what happened to the large sum of money. (When you see the movie you will understand what I'm saying). The Mobsters all look real ???? I'd like to see this movie on the big screen. The movie was shot really well. The scenario of New York was the New York I know. Have a Happy 2006 and this movie can be rewarded.
