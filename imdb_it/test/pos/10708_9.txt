I'm surprised by the questions and problems this documentary has raised in the reviews here, especially because they are really interesting questions. Surely, those who could best face it would be the creators of the film themselves. However, I think I can shed light on something that I think has been overlooked, which is, in my opinion, the purpose of the film, what it is about and what it is trying to convey. What is your message after all? At the risk of underlining the obvious, I will begin to say that the directors have an intention. They are trying to tell a story, extract the meaning and get a point of view. With this in mind, we can break down many of the criticized points, especially those that relate to what people expected in contrast to what the filmmakers were really trying to show. Causes and consequences of violence? The film is not about this. Is it not an "illuminating non-Brazilian public" on the question of Brazilian favelas? Well, who wanted to do it? AfroReggae is this or that and supported by whom? It doesn't matter in this context. Aren't there enough women in the movie for your taste? It is not about equality or the feminist cause. Any small details about life, mother, son, Anderson's family and all aspects and functioning of the AfroReggae movement? Well, don't be so picky because it doesn't matter. There is so much time that a story can have before it can no longer become a movie. If the authors were to show all that everyone expects, they should instead make a 6-month TV series. If you expect all this, you approach the film in the wrong way. <br /> <br /> The film is about two people who started a movement. Two people full of ideals. Two people who are thirsty for change. Two people try to do something about all the evil that is around them. Individuals who hit the bottom and wanted to get up. It is about finding a purpose in life, drawing inspiration from misery, changing destiny and becoming something other than what they were meant to be - criminals and drug dealers for that matter. It concerns the realization and hope and not the cruel reality of violence in Rio de Janeiro, even if it is an integral part of the film since it is what the characters are constantly surrounded by. Unexpectedly and not without a reason, the film ends up focusing much more on Anderson's journey through the difficulties of life. This is because they faced the Anderson incident while they were shooting the film. I'm not sure, but they could also seriously consider putting an end to filming right there, leaving all the effort spent behind. But Anderson wanted to move on. And so they did, risking losing to have a movie with a little identity crisis, considering the sudden change of course, but gaining in showing someone to overcome such a devastating event. It is very evident to those who watch the film start on AfroReggae and end up on Anderson. It is really unique in this sense (the displacement of the plot). Perhaps their only sin is not to make it clear in advance, which may initially raise expectations that will not be met. <br /> <br /> Regarding the importance or ordinariness of Anderson, I would say that not everyone wants to change the whole world, end all violence, feed all the hungry, be like Mahatma Gandhi, be known as Mother Teresa or anyone else is known. It is much easier to relate to and be inspired by someone who is, like everyone else, trying to transform their hard life, raising problematic children, facing permanent injuries or illnesses and even managing to pay bills by the end of the month. To understand the film you have to see that it is a question of leaving behind a past of involvement with drugs and crime, of remedying and trying to persuade others not to follow the same problematic path. Although you can criticize if the way they choose to do it is effective and doubts the ideology of the method, you cannot deny their intentions. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the perception that Anderson is special or chosen may have something to do with the fact that the directors were very involved in the lives of the characters they were depicting. Much like becoming friends with them. There is no way that it will not dye the whole film with a more favorable light on Anderson. If a dear friend is paralyzed in an accident, it's not just a fact, you make a big problem of it. And this is not necessarily bad. It is not so much that they treat it as "a chosen one" as much as they do everything to try to show it as a seed for transformation and a source of inspiration. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, don't watch this documentary for the scenes of the reality of poverty and the crime it contains, watch it for what is much more, a story of inspiration. <br /> <br /> Ad-like Nike? It looks damn good and professionally done for me and doesn't affect or diminish the intentions of the movie. Romanticized? Speculate on his credentials as a documentary if you want, but why not when it should provoke reaction and inspiration? Aren't you trying to improve people's lives through music and dance - the essence of what the subjects are trying to do - to romanticize their reality? Forgive me, but just showing the facts is what journalists do and you can watch them on TV every night. <br /> <br /> If I wanted to become a director, I would like my first film to be fantastic too.
