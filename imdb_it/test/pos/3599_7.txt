Once you manage to convince Nic Cage to play an Italian soldier who loves opera and believes in making love, not war, you can enjoy this wonderful looking movie. This could be used as advertising for tourism in the Mediterranean. John Hurt is great and Penelope Cruz is not bad, as you might imagine. Christian Bale's character is a bit one-dimensional, which is a shame. <br /> <br /> The main drawback of this film is the adaptation of the book - I was later told about the differences between the film and the film story lines, I feel betrayed by a much better and more convincing plot.
