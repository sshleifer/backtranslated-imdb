I had never heard of Silverwing before, then I saw it on Toon Disney and I immediately appreciated it! I also think it's not just for kids, and that people of all ages can have fun. It has a fantastic plot, great effects and fantastic characters. I will always love the show, and I heard that it will soon be coming to DVD all over the world, and I'm going to take it! I haven't read any of the books, but I'm going to do it. The show deserves a 10 out of 10, and I hope the books are just as good. Well, that's all I have to say. But I still have 2 lines to fill, so ... who do you think is the coolest character? Mine is Shade, and my second favorite is Marina.
