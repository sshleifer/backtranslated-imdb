It makes no sense to compare it to the original series. Although different in appearance and content, both are faithful to the original idea. I mean, a SF / horror anthology series. Due to indifferent planning in Australia, I managed to capture only a small number of episodes during the first few seasons. The very first episode made me really shiver (nightmares at my age ...!), But a number of others fell into disarray; generally when the stories have moved into the realms of horror and away from SF. I just hope the DVDs reach us at the end.
