It's just that. Chucky 1 was good. Chucky 2 was better. Chucky 3 sucked. Now, the 4th in the series which is, in my opinion, the best in the series. Jennifer Tilly was simply fantastic in this film. For dolls, they were better than some actors that come to mind (Freddie Prince Jr, for example) and more fun than many comedies I've seen in the past. <br /> <br /> The plot wasn't great, but I really didn't care. Just to watch Chucky and Tiffany fight and fight each other. And the ending leaves it open for a fifth sequel (which I hear is in progress). Next week, Idle Hands will debut and be another horror / comedy, but I doubt this will be at the top.
