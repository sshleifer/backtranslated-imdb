Short summary of the book: Boy, Billy Tepper, about 12 years old, is the school's main trouble maker, and if he is kicked out of another school he will be sent to college. His high school in Switzerland (or somewhere else) is taken over by Arab terrorists because I'm not really sure. Billy has no friends and loves using his laptop to hack his school's database. He, with the help of two teachers, obstructs the plans of the terrorists and saves the whole school. The book was not bad, but it was a terrible clich√©. <br /> <br /> Now on the film; they mistaken Arab terrorists for Cuban terrorists and made Billy around 5 pm and the leader of his group of friends. They like to get into trouble, but normal teenage things. This film was credible. Perhaps not realistic, but the characters are real. You can watch Billy, Joey and the rest of the guys and see real kids acting like they did (or at least want to). Great action scenes. <br /> <br /> Not everything goes as planned for both sides. The overthrow of the terrorists was messy and the good guys got hurt. I won't say who, but it's heartbreaking (I know, I use that word a lot). Sean Astin is excellent. As a teenager he usually played the best friend of all time. This film showed once again that he could play the main character, boy, whatever. The only performance that could have staged him was that of Wil Wheaton, who played the only son of a New Jersey mobster. He hated his father and everything he represented. (A distant cry from Wesley Crusher) Usually this kind of film is one that I look at for the purpose of the soul to tease; but not Toy Soldiers. The plot flows, the dialogue is usually credible. I can't think of a single moment when I found myself shouting on TV "Oh, it wouldn't happen that way." A great film that should be in everyone's collection.
