If you like Cagney you will like this movie. It claims American integrity at all costs, personal or social. Cagney plays the head of weights and measures in New York. Cagney goes against crooked politicians, illegal criminals, a prominent philanthropist and simple grocers who add a couple of ounces for the price of a chicken. The chicken scene is hilarious in which Cagney finds a weight placed in the hollow of birds by an unsuspecting butcher. The chicken is thrown around the store in a hilarious scene about who controls the "evidence". If you like old phones there are interesting scenes of dials, phones and even bizarre telephone cables. Compared to a lot of films made today, this is pure entertainment and includes the mystery with comedy and a message that honesty should above all be the guiding principle of humanity. Done in simpler times it reflects a world we cannot find today. Outwear and fashion cars (especially hats) all play an important visual role in defining this little film.
