The only thing I really can't forget about this film is its beginning: a brilliantly realized classic comedy. I love it. Watch it yourself (no spoilers here! :-). Even the sparring between DeVito and Crystal lights up in this film, with DeVito as the perfect oppressed son. One of my favorites. Highly recommended for Crystal fans.
