I saw this movie tonight in a preview showing and it was fantastic. It is good to portray the problems faced by the average high school student. <br /> <br /> I left the film excited and saddened, yet grateful that this film has the opportunity to raise awareness about these issues (bullying, rape, suicide and depression). <br /> <br /> It is a fantastic Australian film. <br /> <br /> Go see it. <br /> <br /> Support it. <br /> <br /> Learn from it.
