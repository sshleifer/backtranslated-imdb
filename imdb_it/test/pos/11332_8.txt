The Chinese film title of "In the Mood for Love" is "fa yeung nien wah". It can be interpreted as "those years in bloom (which once were)". <br /> <br /> The whole film is a well composed piece. A complex love story told in a simple visual approach. The director and screenwriter Wong Kar-Wai has choreographed a dance of hearts: it's her, it's him, it's love. I can hear the theme of Galasso: dum dum, dum dum and arcs, almost like the beating of the heart. A song with prelude, rooms and epilogue. <br /> <br /> The director has optimized the use of music (the soundtrack by Michael Galasso, the singing of Nat King Cole in Spanish and the Chinese songs / melodies). Rhythm and words suggest to viewers what she and he feel / think rather than verbal dialogues. I can hear Nat King Cole giving us the clues: "Aquello ?? ojos verde" (that thing, run away, green eyes) sounds when the two meet, and "Quizas, quizas, quizas" (maybe ??) when it's undecided . <br /> <br /> Nostalgia pervades the whole film. Abundant design details: bags and ties; New in Japanese rice cooking; cups, saucers and saucers of green glass in the shape of crests (remember that Dad kept them at home); mahjong session; kitchenette; bedroom decor; the thermos for the takeaway noodles that she swings when she walks. Maggie Cheung, slim and shapely, looks exquisite in those fashionable models and colors of traditional Chinese women's clothing - 'cheung sam'. Every change in her dress denotes another day, another time in history. Wong Kar-Wai is enterprising in this way. <br /> <br /> The scenes can be of the same place, but it is in a different mood, advanced to the next room. Up and down the stairs to the won noodle stand. Standing near the wall around the corner of the apartments while the rain pours. Along the corridor, back and forth, at his writing angle. <br /> <br /> Curiosity: So you help him with his writing of his martial arts novel. Maggie would be able to help as she was in the kung fu / martial arts movies. "Eastern Three Heroes" 1992 is a fun action movie featuring Maggie Cheung (Thief Catcher Chat), Michelle Yeoh and Anita Mui as three superheroes fighting evil. <br /> <br /> If you like Tony Leung's performance, don't do it. Miss "Chungking Express" 1994 (in the second segment - romantic rhythm with a difference), and "Happy Together" 1997 (an intense, emotionally colored painting by friendships, faith and destiny), both written and directed by Wong Kar-Wai. <br /> <br /> Being able to understand the Cantonese and Shanghai dialects and having visited the official website, I realized that the epilogue was not completely translated. Here is my version of Chinese subtitles: <br /> <br /> It was kind of an unbearable encounter. He always lowered his head giving him the chance to get closer. He didn't have the courage to be closer. She turned around, went away. <br /> <br /> That time and place had come to the past. Everything that belonged no longer exists. _______ <br /> <br /> Those missing years, apparently separated by a glass that collects dust, can see, but fail to catch it. <br /> <br /> He has always longed for everything that has gone by. If he can break through that glass of dust that will come back in time, it has long since faded. ________ <br /> <br /> "In the Mood for Love" by Wong Kar-Wai brings to mind the simple poetry and wisdom of Rumi, the Sufi philosopher - the "inside and outside", the "spirit and the body" of life, love and live. <br /> <br /> [Postpone.
