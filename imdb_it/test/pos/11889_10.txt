El Padrino has just been released in Europe and is really a real ace. This film with its great cast - Damian Chapa (Blood in Blood Out), Robert Wager, Jennifer Tilly, Robert Wagner and many others - is the best gangster film since SCARFACE. A film that everyone MUST SEE. 2 hours full of action with amazing fantastic stunts !!!! <br /> <br /> GRACIAS JENNIFER !!!! We look forward to part 2 !!!! Does anyone know if there will be one? Keep up the good job !!! I loved it !!
