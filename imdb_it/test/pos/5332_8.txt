Simply delightful claymation character from Nick Park and spoofing company of films like "King Kong" and "The Wolf Man" has Wallace and Gromit as a rabbit security that finds it difficult to solve a big problem in their village ... a giant rabbit is feasting abundantly on the citizens' vegetable crops! What makes it even worse is that the great vegetable festival is about to begin and all the citizens have diligently prepared to win the first prize. What makes the situation even worse is that Wallace is the reason behind the whole fury of vegetable consumption ... he was experimenting with a new invention concerning his brainwaves in trying to wash brain-caught rabbits in unpleasant crops horticultural. What happens is catastrophic as a sort of hybrid: the rabbit is created in the process ... and has more to do with Wallace than he can ever imagine. It will be up to his faithful (and surprisingly intelligent) and to the dog Gromit, who thinks quickly, to save the day. <br /> <br /> This is an ingenious and imaginative effort on the part of the crew behind other winning features of Claymation winning the Oscar starring Wallace and Gromit. Seeing a good clay composition is refreshing considering the boom in CGI that has been characterized by rather lackluster dishes here recently, given that the industry is spreading more and more mediocre products. Here, we get complete functionality with witty humor and some wild stunts with wonderful animations, not to mention miraculous gags.
