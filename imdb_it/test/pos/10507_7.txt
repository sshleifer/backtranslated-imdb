I inserted the DVD waiting for the perversion of the fields from the creators of Society and Re-Animator, and I was rather surprised to be involved in a story of authentic suspense. The acting was first rate (nice to see Vosloo in a leading role after a long series of bad guys), the plot involved, and a few quite surprising twists. I imagined going on most of it to get to the kidnapping scenes, but instead I looked through it, but I was disappointed to the end. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too lenient, but as I stated before, I didn't expect much more than alien sex. Of course, if you are looking for a hot alien sex, you will be disappointed. It was mostly a quick table absurdity, with a flash and a glare of an interesting 'impregnating' alien.
