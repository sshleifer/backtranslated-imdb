When I was growing up, Voyage into Space was my favorite movie. I remember when KTLA (Channel 5) filmed the film all week and my sisters and I watched it every day! I still remember every part of that movie. The ending was so sad when Giant Robot was blown up along with Ghigliottina and then to watch Johnny Sokko with all the tears running down his face to call Giant Robot. There had to be a sequel to the film, in which Giant Robot somehow survived the explosion. :) I can't believe there are so many other Voyage in Space fans out there yet. I really want to buy the movie when it comes out on DVD, but my sister said that those out there now are counterfeit and probably bad quality copies of the movie. I don't know why they haven't published it yet, since more than 40 years have passed. I think Voyage into Space was created in 1968. Only now, my second favorite Japanese monster of all time (The War of the Gargantuas) finally arrives on DVD and was released on September 9th and I can't wait! :) Now if only they would do the same with Voyage in space. Giant Robot, Johnny Sokko and Voyage into Space will never be forgotten! In my eyes and probably many others, for me it will always be a classic for children! :)
