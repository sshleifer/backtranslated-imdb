I was very moved by the young life experiences of a man who has grown so high in the academic world. A hard life, surrounded by love for a narrow family and an extended family of workmates, has created a person who can succeed in the world. For the most part, Hispanic culture is shown as I have always observed and admired: hardworking, optimistic and truly family oriented. The points of religious superstition were authentic for the Catholic church. Without a doubt, the actress who played the mother deserves an Oscar. His prayers for his missing son moved me to tears. I will recommend this incredibly thoughtful film to my friends and my family.
