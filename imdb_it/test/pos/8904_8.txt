... but I laughed. Very. <br /> <br /> I saw "Astérix et les Vikings" in a public screening during the World Cup. The sound was bad, it was too bright to see the screen correctly - but I enjoyed it immensely. The names of some characters made me roll on the floor: Smsix, Abba, Vikea ... All not very witty, but in the good tradition of Astérix. Some very good jokes, but also some that not everyone seemed to get. <br /> <br /> The only thing I didn't like were the voices of Astérix and Obélix, at least in the German version. The voice actors are very well known around here, which was the only reason they were cast, really. They don't fit the characters at all. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good way to spend some time (and if it's free, as in my case, so much the better) and have a couple of laughs. 8 out of 10.
