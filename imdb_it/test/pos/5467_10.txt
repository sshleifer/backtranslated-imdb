I saw this film when it aired on Lifetime in 2004. I've never seen it since, but I've often thought about it. It left such an impression on me that I was looking for it lately. I finally found it and realized that it was only for television. The film is fabulous, full of great writing and acting. William Petersen is perfect, as always. This film left me speechless and in tears. It is a wonderful story of faith, love and compassion. Does anyone know how I can get a copy of this movie for my home? Is it possible with television movies ?? I would really like to see it again. This is a must-have among my collection !!
