I knew little about this film when I entered the theater for an early screening. I discovered from advertisements that it was a thriller. <br /> <br /> What we have is how "Compulsion" meets "Matlock". Two boys decide to commit a perfect murder. A victim is randomly selected and then carefully executed so that no traces of actual killers are found. Then a pile of false tracks are planted that point towards an innocent bystander. (Innocent of the murder anyway) <br /> <br /> Enter Sondra Bullock as a detective. (IMDB says she's from the FBI, but I don't remember, I thought she was a regular cop) She's frustrated by the inconsistency of the assassins' profile ("The profile doesn't fit the profile!") And from power and the influence of the father of one of the boys. <br /> <br /> He also has his demons that he figures prominently in his deciphering to become a cop. But this is the only character that is really more than one-dimensional. All the others are rather flat. <br /> <br /> For a thriller, there are not really big chills. It is mainly a cat and mouse game like an episode of "Matlock" (which is looking at one point in the film). The twist is that there are two involved in the killing. Just who is the real murderer, Justin or Richard? It will cost you eight dollars to find out.
