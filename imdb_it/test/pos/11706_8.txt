Crackerjack is a simple but good movie where good guys are very good and bad guys are very bad and the central character is tempted by both sides. <br /> <br /> The combination of the central character played by Mick Malloy and the central setting being the local lawn bowls attracted an unusually large crowd ranging from large numbers of teenagers to large numbers of elders - and everyone laughed at the comedy. <br /> <br /> As you would expect from a movie with Mick Malloy and Judith Lucy there were bad words, but it was not exaggerated and the audience I sat with definitely pleased me! <br /> <br /> Mick Malloy did a good job as the lazy boy who joined the club bowls group (three times) simply to get parking spaces (one for himself and two for leasing to others at a prize) but who has everything to fall on him when he is required to play or lose his membership. <br /> <br /> Judith Lucy does a great job as a local journalist / love interest and there are fabulous performances for Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson, Monica Maughan, Lois Ramsey and many others. <br /> <br /> The role of John Clarke as a villain is not one of the most fun but gives a solid performance. <br /> <br /> The not so subtle pokies swipes provide some serious note to this otherwise light comedy. <br /> <br /> I'm sure even those who liked The Castle and The Dish would enjoy this movie.
