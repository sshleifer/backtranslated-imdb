Residents are a band known for their strange appearances and strange musical styles, so obviously their music videos won't be exactly normal. In reality, these little videos are abnormal and bizarre, but they have enormous artistic value for them. The atmosphere is built with lighting and thoughtful images. It's a fantastic viewing experience. <br /> <br /> Basically, Icky Flix consists only of many music videos of Residents made for their songs. The music itself ranges from rock to synthesized music that seems to come from a 1980s horror film. What doesn't change is the quality of these videos. They are fantastic! <br /> <br /> Every fan of art films will love these. They are so original with their images and the angles in which they are shot, and the lighting makes them particularly interesting. The music is creepy and catchy and very original and these short films are mini-classics that deserve more sightings. This is an almost perfect collection of short videos. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** on ****. 56 minutes
