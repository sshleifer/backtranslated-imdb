Ray Charles Robinson (Jamie Foxx) is also a very talented pianist and singer. Ray is also an intelligent man. Ray started his career in the late 1940s before finding his distinctive style. Ray is definitely popular in night clubs with his music. Things change when he meets an ambitious music producer (Curtis Armstrong). Who knows that Ray has what it takes to be a strong performer and that he also meets a woman (Kerry Washington), he loves him too and gets married along the way. Ray's album becomes a hit, when he mixes soul and gospel music together. Which makes Ray a controversial man during the 50s and 60s. Ray loves every kind of music, including the country. But Ray isn't always the perfect man as he seems. Since he has had many failed relationships with other women while he is married. But he also had to fight with racism, people who crossed him, his musical ideals and, of course, his drug addiction. Which made Ray's life extremely difficult for him and also to fight the tragedy of his childhood. Of which Ray has always blamed himself. <br /> <br /> Directed by Oscar-Winner: Taylor Hackford (Against all odds, Devil's Advocate, Dolores Claiborne) has created a fascinating real life story of the ever interesting of the late "Ray Charles". Foxx won an Oscar for his moving interpretation of the late entertainer. Foxx brings heart and soul into the film and also into humor. But this film has many rich performances by a prominent cast including: Queen King, Clifton Powell, Bokeem Woodbine, Aunjaune Ellis, Warwick Davis, Terrence Howard and Sharon Warren as Ray's mother. This is probably the best film of Hackford's career to date. The film also has a lot of songs from Charles' best music. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a strong Pan & Scan transfer (1.33: 1) and excellent 5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound. Disc 1 has an informative commentary by the director and the DVD also has the original theatrical cut and the extended version. But you're better looking at the theatrical version, because sometimes the bonus movie is in bad shape and you have to click on a logo if you want to see these deleted scenes. Disc 2 has deleted the scenes with optional comments by the director (which is visible in the extended version), featurettes and more. But the featurettes are disappointingly short for this DVD. Since the film is extraordinarily good. This film received four Oscar nominations including Best Costume, Best Director, Best Editing and Best Film. This is a true life story well told but, of course, Charles's life was even more controversial and outrageous than the final film. Still, it's damn close. Screenplay by James L. White. From a story by White and a director: Hackford. Academy Award for best sound. Not to be missed. (**** Â½ / *****).
