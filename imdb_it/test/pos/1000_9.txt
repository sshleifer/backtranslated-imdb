I was lucky enough to attend the London premiere of this film. Although I'm not at all a fan of British drama, I found myself deeply moved by the characters and the BAD CHOICES they made. I was in tears at the end of the film. Every scene was fascinating. The attention to detail and excellent acting were truly impressive. <br /> <br /> I should agree with some of the other comments here that question the reason why all these women have launched themselves against such a despicable character. > <br /> ******* SPOLIER ALERT ******** I was also hoping that Dylan would be killed by William when he had the chance! **** END SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley did a great job and emanated beauty and innocence from the screen, but it was Sienna Miller's performance that was truly worthy of the Oscars. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this production will be nominated for other awards.
