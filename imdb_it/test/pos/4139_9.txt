What a great movie! I never knew much about Buddy Holly, but I knew his lively and funny music. This is a wonderful biography of someone who helped change music in the 1950s. Although I never cared about Gary Bussey, he was as fabulous as Buddy Holly! I don't know how accurate the film is, but I suppose most of it is accurate, which makes the film even more interesting. Music throughout the film only adds pizazz to this biography. I don't think I would change anything in this movie, everything went well! What a difference between the stars of the 50s and the stars of today's music. How can you compare someone like Buddy Holly to Justin Timberlake? or one of the other popular singers of this generation?
