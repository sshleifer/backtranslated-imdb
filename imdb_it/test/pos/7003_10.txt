As a zombie fan, I really love these types of plots where people end up in strange places surrounded by evil monsters! PB is also an excellent link with Chronicles of Riddick (COR). The band must run as fast as possible out of the darkness. There are so many metaphors in history! Riddick is a bad boy, but he is also the hero who tries to save people from the slow pace. The Muslim boy, Imam, relies on the positions of the sun for prayers five times a day, but is stuck in a land where darkness reigns. Overall, I recommend this movie to all science fiction fans. You will not be disappointed.
