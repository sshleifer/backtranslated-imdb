Due to a very misleading advertising campaign, I saw this film in theaters at the relatively young age of 10 years. TV trailers played the film like a comedy, and I annoyed my parents until they caught me. After watching the film, I was left speechless. I had no idea what to think. Totally different from anything I had seen before, leaving so many questions to a young mind. Needless to say, I loved it. This morning was the first time I looked in maybe 2-3 years, and I still think it's one of the greatest films made in the last decade. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are both in excellent shape, like a mysterious man who may or may not be from another planet, and the psychiatrist who develops a bond with him while trying to decipher his mystery. Even the supporting cast is almost perfect, every resident of the institute is incredibly convincing in his own way. The open ending has been very well managed, providing a lot of evidence to support whatever you believe has happened in the end. The way this film failed to receive at least one Oscar nomination that year goes beyond me. If you haven't seen this movie, run to Wal-Mart NOW. The DVD is usually in the business basket, take it! <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
