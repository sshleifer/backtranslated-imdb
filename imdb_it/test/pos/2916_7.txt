I'll start from the beginning by saying "I like this movie". It's amazing, it's great, it's addictive and it's fun. Sinhue, the doctor, sits in front of his little stone hut writing his memoirs. And what a story it is! Taken from a river and raised by an elderly couple who worshiped him, he became a doctor for the poor. He befriends Horemheb who sees glory while Sinhue sees healing. And both run into the future pharaoh Anknaten (forgive me my spellings), who suffers an epileptic fit. <br /> <br /> And this pharaoh has another "defect": he believes in a god instead of a pantheon of gods. So this was totally revolutionary. Sinhue and Horemheb grow up. One night, Sinhue sees a woman who makes him unconscious. He gives up his practice, sells his parents' home and even their graves just to spend a night with her. It does? I will not say Meanwhile, Merit, a tavern maid played with sweet simplicity, gets tired of Jean Simmons, falls in love with Sinhue. She falls under her spell and under the spell of faith in a god. <br /> <br /> Victor Mature wins perfectly as Horemheb. Edmond Purdom is as sincere as Sinhue, the lost doctor (does he find redemption? Stay tuned). Even Bela Darvi, the woman who steals Sinhue's heart is not as bad as everyone has said. The fact that he was Daryl F. Zanuck's lover had nothing to do with casting - right? Yes, right ... however, it wasn't so bad _ I've seen worse. I think he did better in "The Egyptian" than how many other young actresses of today have ever done. I said it before and I repeat, I like this movie. I advise. It makes you think despite some acting still. Have fun with this movie; it's worth it.
