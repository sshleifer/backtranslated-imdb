THE HAND OF DEATH calculates a dozen on a scale of one to two, in no small part, to the masterly direction of John Woo, combined with Kat's superb cinematography: some of the simple monitoring shots alone are worth the price of a rent ; there are times when this is no longer an arthouse film. Both James Tien and Sammo Hung make the kind of bad guys you can't help but love to hate. Tien is particularly good as the worst of the villain. It's a reversal of roles that I don't think I've ever seen before (Tien used to play normally with a hero and, in fact, with his mustache, I didn't even recognize him at first). Sammo's stupid "lion teeth" only make an already unpleasant character even more imperfect; that he too is a skilled martial artist makes him even less sympathetic - in a villain you love to hate in a certain way. His fight scene choreography is fantastic. Jackie Chan appears briefly (early and late) as a blacksmith, and I think I saw Yuen Biao somewhere along the way. Tan like lead is nothing less than magnificent.
