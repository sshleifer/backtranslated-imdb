If Hollywood cared about the welfare of the public, we would see 20 films a year with the kind of healthy strength behind this film. There are different experiences of personal growth in this film and while the characters ARE still very human the lessons learned are not that greed will benefit you, or you do-to-others-whatever-want-how-long-how-you - I'm-okay-with-it, no, this is what our sad and desensitized lives need, the more sense ... more love ... more do-goddess-others-as-you-would-have-done-gotten you ... more HOPE. (thanks Ursula!) This film has an intelligent intelligence, not of the "yo 'mama" cracks that spread in the so-called comedies. People need to feel good. This film will make you feel good and will probably inspire you to improve your life and the lives of others. sidenote Every person counts in the sale of tickets. This is a truly independent film. If you want more quality films you have to support them.
