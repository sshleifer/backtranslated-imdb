It's always a good feeling when a movie delivers the goods when you weren't expecting it. The Dead End Kids / Bowery Boys found themselves in a lot of irregular films, and usually went better in a supporting role, as in "Angels With Dirty Faces". Here, their presence as a backdrop to the story of a framed murderer gives them plenty of time on screen without distracting from the main action. <br /> <br /> John Garfield is light heavyweight champion Johnny Bradfield, a left handed batsman who is very different from the image he portrays in the sports world and the press. When a journalist inadvertently learns that Johnny is a party-loving womanizer, his plans to spread that information in a column are interrupted by a bottle of whiskey in the head by Johnny's manager, Doc Ward (Robert Gleckler). In turn, Doc talks to Johnny Goldie's (Ann Sheridan) girlfriend about running away with him to avoid the legal hassle of facing the reporter's death. While they both escape, a police chase ends in a burning car accident, and Doc's body is mistakenly identified as Johnny by the gold watch he was wearing. <br /> <br /> Claude Rains adopts a grin of Edward G. Robinson that does not. It works like a detective who has been reassigned to the details of the morgue after a bad arrest years ago. His character is Monty Phelan, and he has a good impression that the corpse was not Johnny. His boss is worried about giving him the case closed, and he is given the task of taking him out of town and leaving. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Johnny seeks advice from his lawyer and twenty be screwed even more when he is scammed for most of his ten thousand dollar savings. Making his way across the country, Johnny stops at Rancho Rafferty Date Farm in Arizona, run by a cruel Granny Rafferty (May Robson). The farm is the legacy of the grandmother's brother, a deceased Brooklyn priest, and is now the home of a band of rags (The Dead End Kids) who work on the farm. Billy Halop is the nominal leader of the boys in this, and his sister Peggy (Gloria Dickson) becomes the romantic interest for Johnny, who now takes the name of Jack Dorney. <br /> <br /> It takes me a kick off of the historical perspective offered in these pre-war films. When Johnny and the kids take a joyful ride in the farm truck, they fill up with gas at $ 1.28! Tommy (Halop) has the idea that a service station on the farm would be a good way to earn some extra money, and with this thought, Jack Dorney decides to face a boxer who offers $ 500 a round to anyone who can stay in the Suona with him. The premise of a clich√© is turned on a little when the ear is knocked out in the fifth round, but at that point it has gained enough to give the fruit farm a chance to fight for itself. Maybe grandma Rafferty should have been in the ring, practically got everyone out in the front row. While Johnny / Jack arrives in the locker room, Detective Phelan is available to take him into custody. Knowing that he can redeem his reputation with this collar, it's obvious if Phelan will follow his arrest - you'll have to see the movie to find out. <br /> <br /> I like the dead-end movie where Leo Gorcey is in charge, but he doesn't have much to do with that. However he makes a great flam movie on the conductor at the gate of the boxing match. Another thought - wouldn't it have been great if the ever-present image on the priest's wall had been Pat O'Brien's? <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a nice entry in both the filmography of John Garfield and Dead End Kids, and a fun way to spend an hour and a half. If there is a disadvantage, it is not enough time for the screen for the beautiful Ann Sheridan. The film could have been even more satisfying if the roles of Sheridan and Gloria Dickson had been reversed, as the chemistry on the screen between Peggy and Jack of Dickson seemed more forced than natural.
