The big fat liar is a pretty funny movie. But while I was watching him, I thought of something. Some of the events that occur in this film are incredible. So really, the film is kind of a big lie. There is no way he could have gotten away with all this. Here are all the incredible things. <br /> <br /> 1. When he pretends, his father choked on a meatball and behaved as if he were the father. Jason (Frankie Munez) could not have made it. Well, luckily for us, he didn't. So the outrageous did not remain so. <br /> <br /> 2. Even if the grandmother was blind, she could understand that she was not her niece. <br /> <br /> 3. They could not get on the plane, fly to Los Angeles, behave as if they were coats vendors, sneak into the studio, and then, and then ... Well, part of the movie is bit incredible. But it doesn't hurt to say a little white lie. Trust me, I always do it. <br /> <br /> The big fat liar, even if sometimes unbelievable, is fun. It's also a lot of fun. But let me tell you something before continuing this review. If Paul Giamatti were not in this film, he would really suck. It would be horrible. The big fat liar is also quite amusing, even if sometimes it's trivial. I give a thumb up. <br /> <br /> Big liar: *** / ****
