Oz, was the first original television program that HBO has included in its channel (in the 1 hour format) and remains the best so far ... The story is simple ... Oz is a surreal look in high-level life i Oswald maximum security prisoners, focusing mainly on "Em City". Now there are many things to compliment this show from the script (which in my opinion was the best on television when it aired this show), directing (the maximum), acting (the best of the best), and the characters ... This show literally blew my socks off ... This show was a critically acclaimed gem until The Sopranos bowed, after critics got excited about that epic story of trust and family to notice this compelling drama ... Oz for me is a better show than Sopranos as a whole and it's a shame that I've never won any of the most important Emmys ... = / <br /> <br /> to everyone involved in this magnificent show, heartbreaking, ... <br /> KUDOS
