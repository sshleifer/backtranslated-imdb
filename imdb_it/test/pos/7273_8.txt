** HERE BE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Summary: Macleane (Miller) is witness to a robbery by Plunkett (Carlyle) that goes wrong. Plunkett's partner is shot (and killed) but not before having swallowed a large ruby. Plunkett and Macleane then meet at the cemetery when they both try to take over the ruby. Unfortunately they are captured as thieves and sent to prison, but not before Plunkett has swallowed the ruby. Ruby is their key to freedom and, once released, they form a partnership in robbery. Macleane proposes himself as a gentleman and discovers who is worth stealing and therefore simply steals it (and steals it in style). But Macleane falls in love with her niece / daughter (?) Of their first victim, Mrs. Rebecca Gibson (Tyler). And a Mr Chance (Stott) wants to capture them, and his methods are not very beautiful ... <br /> <br /> Comments: A good action seasoned with comedy and adventure. Carlyle and Miller form a good team, with a lot of friction and friendship. And then there's the relationship between Macleane and Rebecca Gibson. The ball scene is very good, especially the (anachronistic) use of music. In addition to these interesting characters, Cumming plays the best of all, Lord Rochester. Both the character and the acting are stellar and among the best in the film. In total, the film works very well, a good balance between history and special effects, action and comedy. Very funny. <br /> <br /> 8/10
