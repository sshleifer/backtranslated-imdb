There is a sign on The Lost Highway that says: <br /> <br /> * MAIN SPOILERS AHEAD * <br /> <br /> (but did you know that already, right?) <br /> <br /> Given that there are a large number of people who apparently did not understand the meaning of this film, I would like to contribute with my interpretation of why the plot makes perfect sense. As others have pointed out, a single view of this film is not enough. If you have the MD DVD, you can "cheat" by observing "Top 10 tips to unlock MD" by David Lynch (but only after a second or third viewing, please.);) <br /> <br /> First of all , Mulholland Drive is decidedly brilliant. A masterpiece. This is the kind of film that refuses to let go. Often the comments on DVDs are not very accurate, but Vogue "The fact that it gets inside your head and stays there" has really hit the mark. <br /> <br /> David Lynch deserves praise for having created a film that not only has a magnificent fashionable look - cinematography-wise, it has a great acting (especially Naomi Watts), a disturbing soundtrack of Badalamenti, and a very dreamlike quality - but besides all this it also manages to involve the viewer in such a way that few films have before. (After all, when was the last time you saw a movie that didn't want to leave your mind and that everyone felt obliged to speak and write, regardless of whether they liked it or hated it?) <br /> <br /> Well, everything is enough, it is time to justify these statements. <br /> <br /> Most people who have made some efforts to try to put together the plot will have come to the conclusion that the first half of the image is an illusion / dream sequence. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is a pity for all those who try to make sense of the film by expecting "traditional" methods in which the story is presented in a timely manner, a logical and linear way for the viewer. But for those who expect this, I urge you to check the director's name and come back again. ;) <br /> <br /> MD is the story of the sad disappearance of Diane Selwyn, an aspiring actor who is hopelessly in love with another actor, Camilla Rowles. Due to Diane's lack of talent, she is constantly struggling to advance her career, and feels that she has not managed to keep up with her parents' expectations. After realizing that Camilla will never be his (C. becomes engaged to Adam Kesher, the director), he hires a hit man to get rid of her, and then he has to face the guilt he produces. <br /> <br /> The film starts for the first time with what might seem a strange opening for this kind of thriller; which is a dance / jitterbug competition from the 1950s, in which we can see the main character Betty offering a great performance. We also see an elderly couple (whom we will see two more times in the film) with her and applaud her. <br /> <br /> No, wait. This is what most people see the first time they see it. There is actually another very significant fact that is given before the credits: the camera moves in an object (even if blurred) and the scene dissolves quickly. If you look closely, the object is actually a pillow, revealing that what follows is a dream. <br /> <br /> The main characters seen in the first half of the film: <br /> <br /> Betty: The imaginary self of Diane Selwyn, used in the first half of the film which constitutes the "sequence of dreams" - a positive representation of a young aspiring successful actor (the exact opposite of Diane). 'Betty' was chosen as a name as it is the real name of Winkies' maid. Note that in the dream version the name of the maids is 'Diane'. <br /> <br /> Rita: The fantasy version of Camilla Rhodes that, through Diane's dream, and with the help of an imaginary car accident, is transformed into an amnesiac. This makes her vulnerable and dependent on Diane's love. It is therefore conveniently located in Betty / Diane's luxurious home, to which Betty has been authorized to remain. <br /> <br /> Coco: In real life, Adam's mother. In the part of dreams, the woman responsible for the apartment complex in which Betty remains. He is primarily an authoritative figure, as can be seen in both parts of the film. Adam: The director. We know from the second part that he will become engaged to Camilla. His only purpose for being in the first half of the film is just to serve as a punchball for Betty / Diane, since he develops such hatred for her. <br /> <br /> Aunt Ruth: Diane's real aunt, but instead of being out of town, she's actually dead. Diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used it to pay for Camilla's murder. <br /> <br /> Roach: a typical Lynchian character. Not real; appears only in Diane's dream sequence. He is a mysterious and influential person who controls the chain of events in his dream from his wheelchair. It performs the same function as the backward speaking dwarf (who also plays) in Twin Peaks. <br /> <br /> The killer: the person who kills Camilla. This character is basically the same in both parts of the film, although rendered in a somewhat more stupid way in the dream sequence (more on the one below). <br /> <br /> Now, having established the various versions of the characters in the movie, we can start digging into the plot. Of course I won't go into every little detail (nor will I order it chronologically), but I'll try to explain some of the important scenes, in relation to Lynch's "suggestion sheet". <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, Camilla was re-produced as amnesia through her unlikely survival of a car accident in the first 10 minutes of the film, which made her completely vulnerable. What I found very intriguing with MD, is that Lynch constantly provides suggestions on what is real and what is not. I have already mentioned the camera moving in the pillow, but note that there are two cars running in each lane approaching the limousine. <br /> <br /> Only one of the cars actually hits the limousine; And the other? Even if they stayed away from the accident, wouldn't they try to help others, or at least ask for help? My theory is that, since this is a dream, the presence of the other machine is put aside and forgotten. Because, as Rogert Ebert says eloquently "Like true dreams, it does not explain, it does not complete sequences, it lingers on what it finds fascinating, it rejects unpromising plots." <br /> <br /> Shortly afterwards Rita crawls down from the crash site to the Dr. Mulholland, and makes her way up the hill and sneaks into Aunt Ruth's apartment, Betty arrives and we see this creepy old couple moving away, staring the mischievous looks at each other and smiling at themselves and at the camera. This is the first indication that what we are seeing is a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Although the old couple does not seem to be familiar to Betty, I think they are actually her parents (since they were applauding her at the jitterbug contest). Maybe he didn't know them very well, and he didn't have as good a relationship with them as he wanted, so the couple is very pleasant and useful for her in the dream. They also represent his feelings of guilt for the murder and Diane's sense of dissatisfaction with his unreached goals in his life. <br /> <br /> A rather long and fun scene is one that involves the killer. Apparently Diane sees him as the main force behind the campaign that tries to push the director to accept the role of Camilla in the film (since Adam's party in the second half of the film), and therefore occupies an important part of his dream. Because of her guilt and remorse for Camilla's murder, part of her wants me to miss her, so she turns him into a stupid criminal. <br /> <br /> This scene, I think, is also Lynch's attempt to totally mess up his audience, given that he is given a false pretense in which to view the film. <br /> <br /> I have to love the phrase "Something really hurts me", though. :) <br /> <br /> The next interesting scene is with the two people from Twinkies, who are having a conversation about how one of them continues to have this recurring nightmare involving a man who is seen by him through a wall outside the restaurant where they are sitting. After a chat, they head outside and continue to walk towards the corner of a fence, accompanied of course by an excellent music that corresponds to the mood of the scene. <br /> <br /> When he reaches the corner, a poodle character with a disfigured face appears around the corner, frightening the living crap of the man who has the nightmare. This nightmare exists only in Diane's mind; saw that guy in the restaurant when he paid for the murder. So, in short, his objections translate into the nightmares of that poor boy. The tramp also means the evil side of Diane, as can be seen later in the film. <br /> <br /> The Cowboy constitutes (along with the dwarf) one of the strange characters who are always present in the Lynchian landscape - Diane I only saw him for a short time at Adam's party, but just like our dreams can reward insignificant people who hardly know an important part in our dreams, so they can receive an important part in their dream. Furthermore we are given further clues during his scenes that what we are seeing is not real (his sudden disappearance, etc.). <br /> <br /> The Cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the Director, when he meets with him in the strange position (the lights here clearly indicate that this is part of a dream). Notice also how he says he will appear again if he (Adam) does good, or twice if he hurts. Throughout the film he appears two more times, indicating to Diane that he did wrong. He is also the one who wakes her to reality (that scene is probably an illusion made to satisfy his needs of him appearing twice), and shortly after he commits suicide. <br /> <br /> The scene of the espresso with the Castigliane brothers (where we can see Badalamenti, the composer, like Luigi) is probably the result of the fact that Diane was making an espresso just before Camilla and Adam did their announcement at Adam's party in the second half. At the same time it could also be a Lynch statement. <br /> <br /> During the scene in which they enter Diane's apartment, the body lying in bed is Camilla, but notice how she assumed Diane's sleeping position; Diane sees herself in her dream, but the face is not hers, even if she has the same wounds on Diane's face after shooting. This scene is also full of a certain Lynchian unease. Since Diane didn't know where (or when) the killer would come to Camilla and finish her, she simply put her in her house. <br /> <br /> In real life, the audition of Diane for the part of the film was bad. In his dream, he offers a perfect audition - leaving the entire crew ecstatic for his performance. <br /> <br /> Equally interesting is the fact that the money that in real life was used to pay for Camilla's murder now appears in Rita / Camilla's purse. This is part of Diane's downfall of his terrible deed since the money was returned to him, since the murder did not take place. <br /> <br /> When his neighbor arrives to take his piano-shaped ashtray, another suggestion is given; he takes the ashtray from his table and leaves, but later, when Camilla and Betty meet the sofa, we see the ashtray appear again when the camera opens on the table, suggesting that Betty's encounter with her neighbor was a fantasy . /> <br /> The catch phrase for Adam's film is the audition of actresses for "She is the girl"; which are exactly the same words that Diane uses when delivering the photographic resume of the henchman Camilla. <br /> <br /> The blue box and the key represent the main turning point in the film, and it is where the true identities of the characters are revealed. There is a lot of symbolism going on here; the box could represent Diane's future (it's empty), or it could be a sort of Pandora box (the killer laughs when he asks him what the key will open). However, it is linked to the murder by the blue key (which is placed next to her after the murder took place). The box is also seen at the end of the film in the hands of the disfigured tramp. <br /> <br /> Club Silencio is a very useful addition to further remind the viewer that what he / she is viewing is not real. It also means that Diane is about to wake up to her reality (her reality is a nightmare from which she is unable to escape, even in her dreams). <br /> <br /> During the chilling scene at the end, where the gruesome old couple reappears, Diane is tormented in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out to escape the screams and to avoid being persecuted from his fears. <br /> <br /> However, this is my $ 0.02. I hope this can help people hit this movie and call it "the worst movie ever" or something like that, without realizing the plot. <br /> <br /> As usual, Lynch focuses on creating irrational fears, and he certainly does it with this image. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
