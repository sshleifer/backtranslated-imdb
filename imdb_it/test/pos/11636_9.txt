All right. To enjoy this silent comedy you MUST suspend disbelief regarding the main starting point of the film. If you do not succeed, you are probably more likely to score this movie much lower. Charlie Chase has a huge overbite and his wife has a nose big enough to have her own area code. Unknown to one another, they both spared to have surgery to correct these defects. Apparently, plastic and dental surgery was better in the 1920s because neither of them seemed to need to recover from these major surgeries and they seemed immediately very dandy !! Okay, remember I said to ignore it, right?! Ok, well you also have to ignore the hard to believe idea that both could then meet and have no idea of ​​the other is their spouse. Ok, ... now that you have allowed yourself to accept these two stupid premises, the film becomes really beautiful. <br /> <br /> Charlie gives her a ride and she gives him a ride. Both are shocked and excited because nobody has ever considered them really attractive. So, because of this new vanity, they agree to go out with an appointment. But both sneak in at home - not wanting to know their spouses! However, they meet later and are quite attracted to each other. But what about the poor spouses who are supposed to be at home? Well, they both learn that the other is married and both predict that their marriages will result in a divorce because they really want to be with them! Towards the end of the film, Charlie realizes that the woman is really his wife and goes through a very funny sequence in which he plays both the boyfriend and the old husband - changing clothes and putting false teeth when he plays the husband! It's really a riot of laughter to see him bounce in and out of the room while he seems to be fighting with another person! You really have to see it to believe it. However, the wife sees an announcement with Charlie's photos before and after and knows what's going on. In the end, they both feel pretty silly!
