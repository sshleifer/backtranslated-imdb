the most "spiritual" film I've seen in a long time. perhaps never even a scene around the dining room table a piece of comic perfection. I understand that a release date is coming in the fall. if it arrives in your city and you want to see a movie that makes you think it's like that. Aviva is fantastic and certainly a star of the future - (Superbad is out now where it is) - all the actors seem perfectly calibrated too. There is a tone set by this film that is used to surprise. I don't know what to call it - it's a comedy, but the subtitle message is so fierce and direct that the "comedy" isn't a word big enough for that. I love this movie. It's a comedy for a thinking man. but even that sentence is not good enough. FTF has a message and that message must be heard at the moment
