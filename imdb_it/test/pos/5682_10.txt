I've read many unflattering comments about this film, and the only things I've seen that they all have in common are: "boring" and "unrealistic". <br /> <br /> First of all, they used the real frickin 'crocs! How much more realistic can you get? No CGI, no animatronics, no thumbnails. Just a croc and a piece of meat. Have fun, guys! <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that this film starts slowly. Character development, the little they have, however, takes some time, and I think this is mainly where this film is missing. <br /> <br /> However, when the film starts, I found the action taken dramatically. I do not mean that there is much action. If anything, there are more times when the croc cannot be seen at all, and people are just waiting. However, we know that there will be no relief, and that the croc is just waiting for his time. This has had a disturbing aspect similar to other films that reach their horror through non-action, like Open Water (another film that has been criticized by some viewers as "boring"). Personally, I think that viewers who find themselves unable to feel the suspense have had their attention surgically extended at birth, but it's just me. <br /> <br /> Finally, the characters feel real, and the situation is such that it could really happen to anyone in the right circumstances. Moreover, the deaths are completely real and sometimes it is a bit difficult to look at. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a winner.
