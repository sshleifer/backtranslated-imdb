This is perhaps the most perfect film I've ever seen: acting, adapting and directing. It is autonomous and of a kind, so it makes no sense to say that it is better or worse than other great films, only that it can be considered a perfect work of art. <br /> <br /> And it was fun to watch confused horror fans get up and go out!
