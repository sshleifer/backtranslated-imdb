Often considered the last "big" movie by Argento, this entry into the yellow fee is unquestionably better than any Argento movie that has followed (although I have yet to see "Mother of Tears"), but call it his last "big" movie could be a bit exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The line of direction and stylism - the distinctive trait of all Argento films - is truly present, with some of its suspenseful sequences that line up perfectly (the "peephole" sequence) is particularly memorable), and Ronnie Taylor's cinematography is exceptional (fluorescent lighting is beautiful). <br /> <br /> However, the narrative - which is inconstant in all Silver films - is missing here. There is indeed a powerful sense of mystery and intrigue, but the plot uses what is essentially a sequence of sequences of murders, one after the other, without leaving real time to completely construct a right and focused mystery from to solve. All this translates into a climax that is ... well ... anti-climate, as the film does not invest enough interest to make us really interested. <br /> <br /> Regardless, this is recommended simply because of the masterful direction and beautiful images that Argento evokes. I would not recommend this as a starting point for Argento's films, however (for this, I would recommend either "Deep Red" or "Suspiria"), but if you liked them, or even any yellow, then this is very good addition to your repertoire display.
