A lot of people say that the end made no sense, but it did. With the dead female vampire, the connection to the land was broken and the ship took off, having collected a lot of Lifeforce from hundreds of thousands of souls. Enough to re-energize those hexagonal cells and create new bat creatures. It seems they don't have carnal sex, like the vampires of legend. <br /> <br /> Vampire bats from space can be ridiculous, but killing them with one stroke to force the center under the heart is consistent. All you can ask for is consistency. The spectator must suspend disbelief, even for the scifi. <br /> <br /> The only problem is having to be a sword or a pole, not a bullet. This introduces a supernatural twist that does not fit into science fiction. So this is a problem. <br /> <br /> The only major inconsistency I found is killing male vampires with the sword, but the girl's soul and Carlsen get on the ship. I assume that even the souls of males have climbed the ship, but not shown. <br /> <br /> What about all the humans killed? Their strengths here ("souls") climb onto the ship as discrete entities, does all the life force merge into one, for the use the ship deems appropriate? In other words, all the human souls that went on the ship could be reincarnated as bat-like creatures. <br /> <br /> The basic concept is no more ridiculous than Star Wars "Force" or even reincarnation. <br /> <br /> This film was exaggerated, the kitchen sink (Dawn of the Dead meets Alien meets Dracula), but in many ways profound. It was also a beautiful love story. The beginning and the end were etheric. He both started ("what's happening to me") and ended up as a love story. <br /> <br /> Most of the criticism of the film concerns its being bizarre. So what? Bizarre is an art form. However ridiculous, everything fits. The plague concept is much more interesting and subtle than the aliens that kill people. Maybe they didn't need Patrick Steward's blood to form an image of the girl, but it was a very surreal, surreal scene. <br /> <br /> Another reason why the movie is hated is because of the end. But the end fits perfectly with the beginning. People are so wrapped up in the naked girl that they lack the core of the film. It's a love story, from beginning to end. Start with Carlsen and the girl on the alien spaceship and end the same way. So it fits perfectly. Most people are fixated on the hero who kills the monster, and this film didn't end up that way, and that's why I love it. <br /> <br /> Instead, it has a happy ending, with the 2 returning to service, to be reborn. Much nicer than the hero kills the monster, but that's exactly why he bombed. It was not a direct horror or even a scifi / horror, but a love story, with a nice start and an end. All those souls that shine on the ship. And the crystal room pulsates with new life. <br /> <br /> Most people cannot face a love story that is also Alien meets Dawn of the Dead meets Dracula.
