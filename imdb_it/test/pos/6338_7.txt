In addition to being a clever and well-publicized variation on the horror genre that is very popular today and a wonderful formula to attract potential new fans in general, I have always considered Supernatural a massively gigantic tribute to the genre through the decades. Although it is not always visible to younger viewers and / or people who are only interested in the latest horror films, every single episode contains some obvious and more subtle references to classic and influential titles. From this point of view, it was only a matter of time before the writers paid tribute to the "disturbing vehicle without a type of driver" film, and even more specifically to the '70s "Duel" (Steven Spielberg's acclaimed debut ) and "The car". Being an avid fan of these two films, I really enjoyed "Route 666" despite its flaws and flaws. The episode opens up in a tense and atmospheric way on a remote road in Missouri, where a black man is hunted and finally killed by a threatening monster with a seemingly driverless driver. The victim's daughter, Cassie, is Dean's ex-girlfriend and calls the Winchester Brothers for help. The brothers cannot avoid two more similar "incidents" before discovering the sudden presence of a ghost truck that takes them back to a racial dispute of the 1960s, involving both Cassie's parents and several other important inhabitants of the small town. Some of my fellow reviewers around here tend to label "Route 666" as one of the weakest voices in season one, mainly because the script is too verbose with regards to racial problems and shows a different and more emotional side of Dean's character. He is usually the strong and silent type, while here he is confronted with unfinished romantic events of the past. On some level I agree with the debate on racism, but it didn't bother me much, really. Eventually the writers had to explain the presence of the ghost truck, and the racial conflict is acceptable for me. As for Dean's emotional vulnerability, I can only say that it is admirable to see how writers continually try to provide depth and detail to the main characters. Dean's behavior towards Cassie throws him an entirely new light, in fact. Also, what really matters in this episode is the wonderfully sinister truck and its virulent attacks. It is an impressive and powerful vehicle that produces blinding lights and noisy engine noises. In case you adored the brilliant "Duel" above, you will surely find some fun in the exciting chases described in "Route 666".
