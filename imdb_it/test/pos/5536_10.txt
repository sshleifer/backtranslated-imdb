Married To The Mob was one of the first VHS tapes I had with Coming To America and Grease. I still have fond memories of this movie after all these years. Hell, I still have the VHS of this movie in good condition. <br /> <br /> The story: The undercover cop Mike Downey (Matthew Modine) is sent to spy on Angela De Marco (Michelle Pfeiffer) the wife of the killed Mafia member Frank "Cucumber" De Marco (Alec Baldwin). Later he falls in love with her after he realizes he is innocent in all this. Angela not only deals with the unwanted advances of the mafia boss Tony "The Tiger" Russo (Dean Stockwell), but also with his jealous wife Connie Russo (Mercedes Ruehl). <br /> <br /> Married to The Mob is fun and keeps your interest when not trying to be fun. I like the small blows it takes to the life of the mafia (the jealous wife of the mafia, the mafia boss who doesn't realize it's not a magnet, etc.) And you like the characters of Angela De Marco and Mike Downey. It was the last of Johnathan Demme's funny phase before he became serious and gave you gems like Philadelphia and Silence Of The Lambs (the best thriller of all time). If you're in the mood for comedy, Married To The Mob is a keeper. It's better than the garbage that goes through comedy nowadays (Epic Movie, Date Movie, Meet The Spartans, Disaster Movie, etc.).
