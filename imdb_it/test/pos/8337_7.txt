... Grandfather's time. <br /> <br /> More than the gangsters, it is a detailed representation of an American family around 1930: the father, proud of his work that worries about his son who left the high school, the mother that everyone wants , the daughter who forgets about dinner time in the arms of her grasp, and the twins who are absolutely adorable ("Don't go to sleep first, please!"). <br /> <br /> And there is the grandfather, who plays the flute of the Yankee on his flute. Did you notice that this melody has the same role as "Que Sera Sera" by Doris Day in "The Man Who Knowed Too Much" by Hitchcock (1956)? And there is this grandfather who is finally the bravest person in the family. So old he doesn't even tell you about his age, but he is proud of his country and resists the hateful blackmail of the gangster. <br /> <br /> A nice film by Wellman.
