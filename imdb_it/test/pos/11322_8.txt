Well, surely this film has been in line with current times. No happy endings, super-heroes or miracles here. Only earthly fiction to stimulate our minds along the lines of terrorism, and what happened. Congratulations to Percival and Mickery for an excellent script and superb director of Percival. Movies like this are needed to make us aware of what's out there. If all men and women who love peace on earth report activities that are obviously suspicious, I believe that terrorism cannot flourish. This film showed how difficult it is to subvert these terrorists, even with good intelligence. Although the film is a bit propagandist against Islam (the use of a Muslim police officer as the main character) I think it was completely realistic. There had to be a shock to the bombing incident. As a very intelligent tool to convey the humility and humility of the people involved in an attack like this, they showed the total nakedness of the decontaminated women after the attack. It didn't take me long to realize that this was meant to infuse that thought even more into the observer, that is, we don't have control of everything in a situation like this. Although this happened in London, with the usual high-level British acting, it makes a statement for any part of the world. Great films must not be epic productions of great success, and this film is very worthy of being seen.
