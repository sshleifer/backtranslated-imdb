You have to see it to believe it. Filmed in Hollywood on the strip in the middle of the dingy, whatever goes in the 70s, this low-cost movie really has to fill the city's theaters within the day. Then again, I bet he had a week's run. Actually, it's pretty funny. The acting is terrible, the direction non-existent, but the hair, the clothes, the pre-disco music and the general exaggeration of the plot are shocking. Sleazy, it's very shabby. Highly recommended (if you find it)
