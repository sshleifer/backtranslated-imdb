I particularly liked the ending of this film - I really felt what the characters must have heard, and I think it's a mark of good direction. I was tickled by how the new rental came to the record store - a great development of the character, even though his "role" would probably be considered minor. <br /> <br /> I was also struck by the fact that the entire film, while the darkness in its subject matter, was free from free nudity, obscenity and violence. Sadness, sexuality and darkness can all be communicated (often better) by what has not been said, but it seems that this is often unique for really "classy" films and actors. Congratulations to the director for this.
