First of all I would like to say that this film is the greatest thing that ever happened to humanity. It's the best of all the excellent Muppet movies and every other movie out there! then BOO-YA for jim Henson! <br /> <br /> This film is the first of all the Muppet films and the best. (boo ya) This is a Frog (kermit) trying to reach Hollywood. along with the fantastic friends he meets on the road comes a couple of the greatest songs ever made that are destined to become classics, including "the rainbow connection" <br /> <br /> in conclusion I'd like to say that watching this the film is it was the greatest thing ever! If you haven't already seen it, then get off your computer and make sure you settle in your nearest video store !!! (if they don't have the film muppet, I'd denounce them BIG TIME)
