This is a truly wonderful love story. I liked the songs, but even if you don't, you have to love the story. Peter O'Toole is at his best and Petula Clark is also doing well. I saw it for the first time when I was about 13 and loved it. Now, in my forties, I still like it, probably even more. It still makes me cry, laugh and feel good. It's a movie to watch only with a new age guy or alone, since it's a hit movie. But what's wrong with that. You need a little romance and maybe a little cry, try this movie. <br /> <br />
