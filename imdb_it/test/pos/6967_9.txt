Ghoulies 4 is a rather macabre sequel. The ghoulies look very different from the first three ghoulies, but they are still fantastic. There are some nice flashbacks, from Ghoulies to the first movie. Jonathan is back in this one more time. However it was not in parts 2 or 3. The film is low budget, sometimes, but fun to watch. You have Tony Cox as Dark Ghoulie and Arturo Gil as Light Ghoulie. The ghoulies in this film are actually good guys, instead of evil as in the first three films. Both Ghoulies are pretty funny characters in the movie. Then you have the hot Alexandra! It's a great dark and funny comedy! Any fan of ghoulies movies will enjoy watching Ghoulies 4. The DVD will finally be released in July 2007! Hopefully one day Ghoulies III will be on DVD in the United States. I would really like to see a sequel to this film one day. I doubt it will happen though. It's 2007 now and no sign of a sequel yet. If there is a sequel, I hope Jim Wynorski will make it. <br /> <br /> Give Ghoulies IV a 9/10
