I honestly have to say that A CAT IN THE BRAIN is one of the most fun and unintentionally funny movies I've ever seen. This film is full of stupid dialogues, ridiculous scenes and an engaging storyline, with the legendary horror director Lucio Fulci himself. <br /> <br /> The plot full of stories is about an elderly director (Fulci, who is also called Lucio Fulci in the film ...) who is starting to get crazy and hallucinated because of all the bad things he has put into the cinema in recent years. He goes to a shrink who hypnotizes Fulci, and tells him that he will think he is a murderer, but that the shrink will kill him. The rest of the film consists of shots of the "movie" that Fulci is directing throughout this action, scenes of shrinks that kill while he giggles like an idiot idiot and some of Fulci's hallucination sequences. Oh, and also some boobs thrown for good measure ... <br /> <br /> A CAT IN THE BRAIN is completely exaggerated and ridiculous in all senses. The gore is the classic Fulci - ugly and strong with some really decent scenes. The chainsaw section of a female corpse is quite beautiful, as is the beheading of a small child's chainsaw. A lot of stabs, gougings and other beautiful scenes of killings make this bathroom a nice bloodbath without a break. The ridiculous dialogue (LICK IT !!!! LICK IT !!!), as well as some of the crazy scenes (the Nazi orgy, the work that sings the party of slap and the discharge of an innocent hippy come easily to mind. ..) make this fun to die for. Not as dark as some of Fulci's other films - CAT is more of a self-indulgent horror / comedy than if it weren't meant to be fun, it's actually a bit sad. I say we get a cheap bourbon fifth and settle for it. I looked at CAT with some friends and we laughed all the time. THIS is the summer wellness film ... Recommended 8/10
