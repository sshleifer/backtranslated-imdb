Cooley High is considered one of my best films of all time. It certainly reminds me of the days of my youth growing up in the cities of Cleveland and Chicago during the first half and the end of the 1960s. What happened to Brenda and Pooter? Someone needs to track those two down. Brenda for her beauty and Pooter for her innocent wits. Both deserve to be recognized even 31 years after this film was presented. I think many fans of this movie would like to find out what happened to them as well as others who have starred in this fun movie. I certainly think that this film should be included in some kind of MOVIE HALL OF FAME. The whole cast of this movie was great. My opinion is "Cooley High" is turning back the hands of time, those were the fun years.
