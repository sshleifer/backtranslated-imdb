After reading that "At the time of its release in 2002, its budget of $ 47 million, or FRF 327,000,000, was said to make it the most expensive French film ever. However, Astérix et Obélix contre César (1999) he had a budget of $ 48 million, or FRF 274,620,000, which presumably made him the most expensive French film ever "I discovered why I found this film as one of the most beautiful and colorful of all I've ever had seen. I loved the scenery, the clothes (especially Cleopatra's) and the atmosphere of the movie! He is so happy and cheerful! I found the jokes smart and hilarious and I must consider this film as in my favorite comedies of all time! <br /> <br /> The cast is also excellent, with Monica Bellucci (who is as beautiful as Cleopatra) Gérard Depardieu, (great Obelix !! Christian Clavier, Jamel Debbouze (which I saw for the first time in "Amélie Poulain ") among others! :) <br /> <br /> I also recommend this film to those who don't. I know the comics of Asterix and Obelix. You will have a great time! :) <br /> <br /> aka "Asterix and Obelix: Missão cleópatra" - Brazil
