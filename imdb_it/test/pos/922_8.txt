In my analysis of "Trois couleurs: Blanc" I wrote that his tone is much lighter than the tone of "Trois couleurs: Bleu". I think it's the same with this movie. This time it is not for a tragic comic element, but much more for the main character Valentine. Even if her boyfriend lives abroad and is ridiculously jealous, she manages her life with lightness and optimism, it seems to me that it could be the image of Kieslowski for carefree youth. The opposite seems to be the judge, who is very pessimistic, a grumpy old man, who feels great loneliness. In my opinion, Valentine and the judge are quite similar to each other, the judge is only much older and has experienced many other disappointments. They share a different kind of ingenuity and discover both that they can learn a lot from each other. Finally, I would like to highlight the performance of Ir√®ne Jacob, which completes the series of extraordinary female contributions to the "Tre colori" trilogy.
