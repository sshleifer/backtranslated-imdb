A great performance by Clint Eastwood and in particular by John Malkovich, in my opinion the best so far. Malkovich had this nailed to the floor is incredible. Eastwood is agent Mike Horrigan, an elderly and cynical secret service agent who is finishing his career by smashing counterfeiters and pursuing routine tasks. But an assignment that seems to be run by the mill at first becomes complicated and deadly serious. Horrigan and his new partner Al are sent to investigate a threat to the President by a "wacko". How fate would have it that Horrigan came across not a crazy madman but a professional lone wolf who has a big bone to choose from with the White House. As Horrigan plunges more and more into the world of "Booth", he attracts the unwanted attention of the villain and unbridled admiration for him. Horrigan was JFK's principal agent and present in Dallas, Texas, when he was murdered and accused of what happened. Now he feels that it is up to him to stop the current head of state from joining the list of dead presidents. But this killer has transformed Horrigan's tables and is now the prey in a game of cat and death rat. Who will win? Who will die? It's a race against time to save the Pres from a chameleon-like enemy that can reach anyone. My favorite secret service film and like a good nail like nobody.
