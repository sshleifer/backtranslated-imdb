Evil Ed is a Swedish film about a man named Ed (obviously) and his collapse into total insanity after mounting a series of B horror films known as "The Loose Limbs". And he is so angry that he thinks he sees demons and monsters but in reality they are people he knows and people who are close to him, like his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I first saw this 1998 movie and was baffled by what I had seen. To this day, I consider this film one of the darkest comedies out there. Since the film is almost picky with its Goreene scenes, there are still some creepy moments. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic film, but don't expect anything wonderful. It's simply a funny movie that it's nice to show some of your friends for some laughs. 8/10 stars
