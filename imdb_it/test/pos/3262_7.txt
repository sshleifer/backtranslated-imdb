This Australian film shot in 1999 does a good job of portraying a group of little scammers in Kings Cross, Sydney. The plot focuses on the plight of a young aspiring criminal that life is in danger after setting up a job for his future boss. Very well played by Heath Ledger and Bryan Brown. The plot is quite credible with some very funny moments in a scene that revolves around a bank shot. The preparation of various central themes for the story is quite well done. For example. When a crim is looking for bullets for his gun. Personally I dislike free violence in films, and in this sense, the film has not offended. He tried and managed to show us the human side of villains like Bryan Brown. The rest of the cast has done a good job, without real ideas that I remember. The management was very good in being able to make a credible film that offered good entertainment. The main main feature that makes this film a good film is the acting and directed by Heath Ledger and his successful portrayal of a naive young man who makes stupid mistakes for short-term gratification, thinking that it is indestructible and not realizing that there are sinister people waiting to flash any mistake The director, Gregor Jordan, deserves a special mention. Evaluation in my book - 7 (of 10).
