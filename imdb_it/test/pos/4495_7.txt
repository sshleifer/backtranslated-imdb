Two young friends grow up together in Afghanistan. The events of their lives push them away and one of them has lived in the United States for a good number of years. While receiving a call, it is clear that he must return, because there are problems in the air. <br /> <br /> This is a film about life that lasts friendships, mistakes and remakes. But also a film about darkness, pain and resistance. From the pleasant young days of growing up and playing until the fall, returning to the game of games. This is a slow movie, but not too slow. <br /> <br /> Play with emotions and this is right for a drama, but it does a little too much for my taste. This makes it too tear-jerky, losing some of the quality it brings. It's still good, but not fantastic. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 kites have run aground
