I saw it last week and the Korea city sketch was fun. Very ironic and suited to the political climate. Points for writers and Spike for that. The part where he gets a rickshaw translator and throws Korean words may have been pulled out only by Spike. This is a brave attempt by Fox. This is a brilliant show and I hope it comes off. My wife and I are practicing it regularly and even if the clash with a couple of other programs we look at now on MySpace. I hope that Fox dedicates all the resources to the show and does it every day. I can't wait to see Bobby Lee in his show. With people like Bernard Abedalla behind the show, this is on the right track. Even Mary Mae as his wife looks beautiful.
