1983 was "the battle of bonds". That year both Roger Moore and Sean Connery starred in two separate James Bond films, the first (Octopussy) was produced by the "official" producers of the James Bond films while the next (Never Say Never Again) was produced " unofficially "by a group led by Kevin McClory who covered film rights on Thunderball. Surprisingly, it is the "unofficial" movie that is better despite the obvious flaw and the fact that Never Say Never Again is a Thunderball remake. <br /> <br /> Never Say Never Again has the distinction of one of the best casts ever assembled for a James Bond film. It all starts with Sean Connery, returning to the Bond game for the first time since 1971, Diamonds Are Forever. Connery may be older then, but he looks better here, then he did in Diamonds Are Forever. The bond of never saying it again is the elegant and dangerous shark of Dr. No or of Russia with love, a few years older. Connery's delivery of a lining and dialogue is as dead as ever. The only downside to Connery's age is his credibility, especially when it comes to the women in the film. Let's face it, even Connery, despite being in excellent physical shape, seems as strange as Moore when nursing women in the middle of her age. Despite this credibility problem, Never Say Never Again shows Connery in one of his best Bond performances and a marked improvement on his two previous Bond performances. <br /> <br /> Kim Bassinger plays Domino in one of his first film roles. Bassinger plays the role with considerable confidence for a relative newcomer and makes the character credible. Bassinger holds her against her co-stars and is also very familiar with them. In fact, it could even surpass its Thunderball counterpart played by Claudine Auger. <br /> <br /> Then there is the villain, Maximilian Largo played by Klaus Maria Brandauer. Brandauer's Largo is all that a James Bond villain should be: sweet, charming, wicked, and above all believable. Brandauer makes the role realistic and chooses not to fall into the trap that many other Bond villains have fallen into. Brandauer plays Largo with a silent threat and an invisible charisma in many 007 opponents. <br /> <br /> The excellent cast also extends to the supporting cast. Barbara Carrera is a good Fatima Blush woman and the screen lights up when she appears. Max Von Sydow looks good like Blofeld, although his appearance is more like a cameo. Rowan Atkinson makes an appearance like Bond's buttery touch that creates some of the best scenes in the film. With all this the highlight of the supporting cast comes from the MI6 staff of M by Edward Fox which creates a great contrast with Bernard Lee, Pamela Salem who supports Moneypenny and the icing on the cake with the wonderful Q by Alec McCowen. he has a couple of twists but in the form of Bernie Casey in the role of Felix Leiter and Gavin O'Herlihy in the role of Jack Petachi, who both seem not very credible in their respective roles. Otherwise, this film shows one of the best casts ever made for a James Bond film. Above an excellent cast, the film has many other essential ingredients. From the Central American inaugural sequence to the fight at Shrublands to the underwater and motorcycle chase sequences, this is a movie in which the action sequences are not only grandiose, but they also serve the plot for the most part. The film also has good special effects in terms of cruise missile models, explosions and all the things we expect from a James Bond movie. Irvin Kershner, who just did The Empire Strikes Back, brings a narrow sense of the film especially in sequences like the nuclear warhead substation and the subsequent theft of cruise missiles. <br /> <br /> Yet this film is far from perfect. Never Say Never Again is easily one of Bond's oldest films with its massive use of computer games with 80's technology. Although the technology is the basis of a film after a while, the strong dependence on this film, especially in the hijacking of cruise missiles and the Domination sequence, makes the film incredibly dated about a quarter of a century after its release. The script also tends to suffer from predictability due to the fact that it is a Thunderball remake. <br /> <br /> However, due to its predictability, the Never Say Never Again script is quite good. The script is characterized by scenes of good dialogue, not a single grumbler worthy of a lining (how many of the screenplays from the time of Roger Moore can you tell?), Some humorous situations, yet it is mostly watchable and tense. Once you look beyond the fact that it's a remake, there are a lot of good things in the movie script. <br /> <br /> Music is actually the biggest weakness of the film. Due to the "unofficial" status of the film, the James Bond theme could not be used. Having said that, he could have proved with the right composer that a Bond score without it could work. Unfortunately, Michael Legrand's score is far from adequate. The Legrand soundtrack is totally out of place in a James Bond movie and there are only two or two places that really work. To make matters worse, the film is also marked by one of the worst sequences of titles that has ever graced a James Bond film. <br /> <br /> Despite being very dated, somewhat predictable and with a negative score, Never Say Never Again is still a good James Bond movie. With one of the best casts of any James Bond movie, good action sequences, good special effects, good direction and fantastic dialogues, this film shows that "unofficial" is not a bad thing. In fact it is better than Octopussy and the winner of the "battle of bonds".
