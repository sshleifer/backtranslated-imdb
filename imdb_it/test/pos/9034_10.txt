Hello; I would just like to say how much I appreciated your review and the comments on that excellent "intruder in the dust" movie. I believe the points you made were insightful, intelligent and totally valid. it's also a shame that this movie is hardly ever shown on TV these days and is not available on DVD region 2 - I live in England. once again, many thanks for your review. the actor Juano Hernandez was in another brilliant film, "Young with a Horn", which he also starred in Kirk Douglas and Lauren Bacall. that was a very evocative and elegant film with superb music. I wish someone with influence could publish the entire catalog of films like "johnny belinda", "I remember mum" and "bored" on DVD region 2, we love these films in Britain. I'm not a retirement age, I'm still quite young and my family and I love classic movies !! movies like these have been made in a wonderful way and bring back wonderful memories. Anyway...! Many thanks for your comments!
