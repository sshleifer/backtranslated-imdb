This is the best time of comedy. It is so undervalued! Witty and intelligent mood, great casting! Jerry Stiller is the jewel of the show, he is so incredibly funny and bizarre, just a comic genius! Doug and Carrie have great chemistry! So I don't understand what it is when it comes to Everybody loves Raymond is so overrated by limping jokes mostly forced humor and not just the witty show, I don't remember laughing in more than one episode. King of Queens is a rare comedy that has all the right ingredients to give you serious belly laughs that are normally caused by Arthur Spooner, I think it's time this comedy has the hype it deserves and not the lame Raymond & CO.
