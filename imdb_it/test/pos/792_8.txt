For my eternal shame, I have never seen a silent film - not even the mother of all vampire movies, "Nosferatu". However, if they show half of the creativity and pure joy of this effort on the part of Buster Keaton, I will probably try to look at others. This is really fun as well as being an extraordinary introduction to the world of silent comedies. The premise, as it stands, focuses on an unfortunate case of incorrect identity, as Keaton is mistaken for the renowned villain Dead Shot Dan (co-director Malcolm St Clair). This leads to a series of chases and escapes as the authorities get closer and closer to the increasingly desperate Keaton. <br /> <br /> Stay amazed and amused in equal measure. Keaton is a natural comedian but also a clever stunt-man, judging by the way he jumps and jumps around like Jackie Chan in speed. And the comedy also has an exceptionally high standard - my better half had to interrupt a call to his parents because he was laughing too much! If you've never seen a silent film like this, then it's a revelation not to be missed - it certainly wiped out all the ideas I could have had on silent films. Of course, it's not as polished as in today's movies: acting is pretty horrible, to be honest, but it doesn't matter why you're enjoying the movie regardless. Anyone with a passing interest in films in general should strive to see it because they will not be disappointed. Brilliant!
