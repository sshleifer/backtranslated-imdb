Frank Langella steals my heart in everything he has ever seen! I love watching it !! I was 10 (1979) when I saw it for the first time. I look forward to each and every one of them. We hope that one day you can see it for yourself. he is very hypnotic and mysterious and that voice is imposing and strong! he is very attractive, even now at 65 he is absolutely gorgeous !!!! I think he's the greatest actor I've ever seen! I loved it in "Dracula" (along with many other girls out there) and in "God create woman", "house of D", "Jason and the argonauts" and many others. I thought he was a genius !!!!!! I can't wait to see him in "good night and good luck"
