I have been fond of "GG" since mid-2001-2002 (2nd season), when I tuned in to see "Smallville" 10 minutes earlier. Thanks to "Beginnings", I now have only 2 episodes on tape, until last night (Ep. 4.9). I am a middle-aged heterosexual male, and this is the ONLY weekly TV show I watch. <br /> <br /> I love this series because: a) Lauren Graham is a damn pretty woman, and fun and smart to start; b) the dialogue is extremely well written; c) it is exhilarating, exaggerating, putting the overrated garbage as "Everybody Loves Raymond" in shame. Many television comedies have been heavily influenced by the very successful and very despised slime known as "Sposato con bambini", where the viewer is encouraged to mock and feel superior to the characters. In "GG", the characters have flaws, but we can see our own weaknesses in them, and laugh with them, not with them. This is stimulating the TV, in which the writers challenge us to keep up with rapid fire exchanges and with references of pop-culture / literature / current culture outside the left field. I find great pleasure in watching these episodes again and again, capturing all the jokes and references to previous episodes. Stars Hollow is his little world, which I will continue to visit happily until the series takes place.
