A city in Japan is taken from a brutally horrible abstract form: the spiral. It's becoming a theme in everything from animals to clouds to people and twists them, mentally and literally. This film shows that it is happening to different groups of people. A bit of demonic possession is implicit, but nothing is entirely safe, except that the best thing to do is get away from dodging. The film progresses very well from normal life to abnormal phenomena (giant snails and crazy people) up to the supernatural (walking dead). <br /> <br /> As an avid fan of American horror, this was just what I needed. Maybe it was just the novelty of the film of a different culture, but it seemed to have a very original progression, a series of characters and the premise was definitely new. The Japanese might think "horror forms" (uzumaki means "spiral", they told me) are old now, but it was nice for me because I'm used to movies of monsters / aliens / viruses / disasters / undead. In an American movie, you know who will die (annoying / nasty / lascivious / racist characters) and who will live (children / heroine / dogs / cats / good boy). This is not true in the Japanese horror. It was not predictable how they would fight evil or how it would end. Furthermore, it had a very new (but probably typically Japanese) color of leaching in the Pacific Northwest style, which was a new visual effect for me. The horrible moments were truly gruesome, based on a little blood, but above all on incredibly exaggerated facial expressions (thinks The Ring) and body manipulations. This should be one of the great, up there with original ideas like the first Nightmare on Elm Street or Night of the Living Dead.
