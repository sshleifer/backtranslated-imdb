The diary of Anne Frank is the second best-selling non-fiction book in the world, and for good reason. Nevertheless, sitting in this documentary about his life, which fills some of the details in which the diary was interrupted, I thought, "Just another documentary about Anne Frank". I found him competent but not extraordinary. This was my complacent attitude because I was already well aware of the story of Anne Frank; most of what the documentary had to tell me was nothing new to me. <br /> <br /> Everything changed, however, when I arrived at the end of the documentary --- when I saw the video of Anne Franco. The emotional impact of seeing this movie, just a second or so long, made everything that came before a thousand times more real - but not just everything that was in the documentary; everything I had previously known about Anne Frank suddenly became more real to me, more personal. I've always been touched by his story, but when I saw that movie, what I felt was stronger, deeper and deeper than any other cinematic experience of my life. (I knew in advance that this documentary contained live images of Anne Frank, and I had even seen the film in a film review on television, but seeing it in the context of the documentary was a completely different experience. It is not likely that my mention this here it will ruin it for anyone.) <br /> <br /> I realize now that many people still don't know the story of Anne Frank; sometimes it is discouraging to witness this kind of ignorance. I think of myself, "How could anyone not know the story of Anne Frank?" Anyway, ANNE FRANK: REMEMBERED, along with reading his diary, is the best starting point. It is a story that everyone should know.
