If you want to see the real evidence of what a misguided and uncontrolled government can do to "unpopular" people, this film provides it. Read what some people are saying about the "Patriot Act" past 9/11 and then watch this movie. Is it worth it? Do we really want to give these people our freedoms? Regardless of what you've seen on TV, you're not fully informed until you watch this movie. I apologize for mentioning another reviewer, but he needs repetition: Roger Ebert of Siskel & Ebert said: "What is interesting is that if you are looking for people who are unbalanced zealots ... don't find them among the Branch Davidians you find them between the FBI and alcohol, tobacco and firearms, those are the people in this film who deserve to be feared, I think. "I think every person responsible for 9/11 should be brought to justice , but I think the government has not shown a history of honoring its duty to protect people's rights, and this film shows it dramatically.
