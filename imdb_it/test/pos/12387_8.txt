I suppose this film is not the typical Spanish thriller as it is based on a true story set abroad. The film is based on the true story of the French Jean-Claude Romand, and the real case is much more bloody and scary than the film. In the true story of Mr. Romand the family did not flee, after years of lies he decided to end everything by killing his wife, two children, parents and dog, and even if he tried to kill himself, it seems that he does not I did it very hard while surviving. I saw the film with people next to me talking about how it could never have happened in reality that all these lies had not been detected, I was laughing as I read the book on Mr. Romand and knew it had happened. I like Jos√© Coronado in this film, he offered us a good performance, like the rest of the crew.
