It was a fascinating story waiting to be told. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY takes us inside the trials and tribulations of a group of great American scientists who carried out a very high task during the Second World War: bombing everyone else with the atomic bomb. Seized in a heavily guarded New Mexico complex, the brains slowly transform the idea from an ambitious concept into an immense reality. <br /> <br /> FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY is one of those movies that requires your attention. It is a film of a person who really thinks, not only from the scientific aspect of developing an apparently impossible weapon, but also the moral implications of contributing to killing on a large scale. The characters are constantly divided between that reality and their war duty as Americans. The film is never preached, however, leaving us free to admire the enormity of the inner turmoil of these men. The performances also deserve a special mention. Paul Newman offers one of his great and underestimated performances like General Pattonesque in charge of delivering the last big stick for allied forces. <br /> <br /> Where FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY loses most of its traction is useless romantic component. Dwight Schultz as a leader of the scientific team struggles with his affections for his family and his relentless obsession with his great project. Director Roland Joffe apparently felt the need to explore the most human corners of this story, but romantic tones serve mainly as a distraction. Furthermore, it is the interaction between scientists and their military hierarchy that gives us the greatest vision of the thoughts and feelings of these brilliant men. <br /> <br /> Still, it's hard not to recommend FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY. It is a largely forgotten gem that puts a human face on one of the most intriguing stories in human history.
