Having seen "only" about 200 Hong Kong films in my time, I must say that this film is one of my favorites. Not only is the plot engaging (and somehow surprising, which in these days is rare for any film), but the chemistry between the two main actors is superb. First-rate casting! And while often HK's most serious films tend to include a bit of humor between drama and action, they often ruin the atmosphere a bit, here the lines are subtly kept and intertwined in the plot, also improving relationships character. The music is also very well done and the two main themes are very beautiful. With the release of the special edition of HK, they even cleaned the image (the first version was grainy) and the subtitles, although the quality of the translation is still lacking (nothing new there). All in all, if you have to watch an HK movie that is not directed by John Woo or have Chow Yun Fat in it, this should be at least on your short list! A truly fascinating and fun watch!
