Sometimes I wonder if perhaps Meryl Streep has become so accepted as the most versatile and versatile actress since, perhaps, right at the beginning of the sound age, perhaps her talent is now taken for granted. There are probably about three tics that he constantly relies on during his performances (most obviously a pinched lip), but other than that, his performances are incredibly variable and original and fresh expressions of internal mechanisms. Although "Sophie's Choice" and "A Cry in the Dark" and "Silkwood" can be more conspicuous, his work here and in "Bridges in Madison County" is also remarkable - only more subtle. In "One True Thing", she is mostly sweet and in love with her home life, and Streep makes what could be routine, even boring, look attractive and charming. I think you have to work out these mini-theses for each character and find what makes this person real and interesting. It works from the inside out with each character, and perhaps it is this essential quality that has evoked the main criticism of indifference or self-consciousness. I don't think he's cold, but instead he thought about the unique qualities of his character. I think his critics confuse self-awareness with intelligence. Not many other actors would be so thoughtful and creative as to make Kate Muldrun light and carefree in her beloved domestic environment, only to subsequently reveal an unprecedented depth due to her genuine attachment to that domestic environment. His performances are of unsurpassed consistency, rarely does something wrong. I wonder if it is conceivable that none of the images of Streep appear undiminished because of his presence ... However, Kate loves her home, and her affection for her "family life" is as captivating as her new conflict at interior of the house is staggering. When all this comes together, and Kate begins to recognize that she can no longer function in the same capacity, and breaks the plate of the cake and screams that she is not handicapped, she is painfully sad to look at because she was not someone inclined to emotion. Streep is smart and generous enough to recognize how much better everything works because he felt the dramatic validity of Kate and is really the only scene where he allows his character to go. But how nice it is to see a character that can really surprise you by showing something you wouldn't have thought possible. Once again, the character of Streep has at least three dimensions ... God, this sounds like a thesis, but as an actress, Streep has only a special kind of intelligence, incredible empathy and great expressive abilities. The film itself is probably a bit mediocre. I suppose William Hurt is an unlikely imitator, and he is very pompous. I think Hurt's a bit creepy though. Script is fairly standard - another tribute to Streep that was as touching and believable as she is.
