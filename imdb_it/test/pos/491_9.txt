hi <br /> <br /> Blade is a sensational action film. the hero (Wesley Snipes) and the villain did their roles justice. <br /> <br /> The movie's action sequences are better than the Matrix! <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes is one of the best action heroes ever. <br /> <br /> If you like action movies / vampires, this is ONE. <br /> <br /> the theme is quite good considering the fact that so many vampire films have been made before. But these are the best. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the Ride.
