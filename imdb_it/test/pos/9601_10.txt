I cannot add much to what has already been said, except that I will have to do it because of the minimum policy of 10 lines. <br /> <br /> Actually I got this on a VHS-to-DVD copy, but the quality is rather poor and I desperately need it to be officially released. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine what extras I'd like to see (the character of Tim Healy making his way through one of these) Football Bloopers programs would be fantastic!). Can you imagine it now, no? But obviously, it seems that most people should continue to dream of a DVD version. <br /> <br /> Surely God there must be someone in the ITV DVD release department who also knows something about British culture, is web savvy and has enough about them to watch IMDb from time to time? Oh good.
