Cinematography is the brilliant feature of the film. Park really knows its stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes from behind a camera. Every shot is full of vibrant colors that pops off the screen. Each plot of the film seems to tell a story all on its own. I hope there is a Blu-ray version of this movie because it will be fantastic. It is rather interesting to see what elements of Park vampire mythology they used for his vision. Sang-hyeon has to drink blood to survive and remain impeccable, has incredible strength and is vulnerable to sunlight. However, it has no fangs and also has a reflection in the mirror. <br /> <br /> Although I never saw the movie, I couldn't help but think that this was the version of Chan-wook Park by Twilight. The entire central part of the film is dedicated to the love between Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo for each other. It looked like the adult version of Twilight, really. There is a lot of blood, nudity, sex and even some obscenities launched in good measure. Maybe he's the Chan-Wook Park fanboy in me, but honestly I feel I can guarantee that this is the best movie of the two. The psychological aspect that I love about Park's previous films is also in Thirst. This is an important factor for me as every movie that makes me think or is somehow unusual ends up becoming a favorite fan. The soundtracks of Park's films always seem to fit into their respective film like a glove. Thirst is no exception. While the soundtrack is a bit thinner this time, it fits rather into the overall atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> The central part of the film seems to drag on longer than anything else in the film. It's strange though because the scenes of that period are crucial to the film's plot and it's hard to imagine that Thirst is the same film if one of those scenes had been cut. Nevertheless, it's my only nitpick in the film. <br /> <br /> The Chan-wook Park bites in vampiric mythology with Thirst and puts its dark, psychological blow on it. Park's films always seem to have a specific formula or include most of the following: excellent script, good cinematography, a solid cast, a kind of psychological touch that will confuse your head and a memorable ending. Thirst offers on all fronts and it is hoped that he will get more than the attention he deserved during his theatrical DVD projection (and hopefully Blu-ray in the end).
