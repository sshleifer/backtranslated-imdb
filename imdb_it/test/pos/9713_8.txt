This movie shocked me - I only saw two episodes of the show, I never saw the first movie, but I went to a pre-screening where Johnny Knoxville himself introduced the film, telling us to 'turn off our sense of moral judgment for a film an hour and a half. ' He was right. As a film, this would probably give a 2, since it has zero plot, no structure besides randomness, and very little production value. However, this is not the point. Everyone in our theater was laughing and panting all the way - not only were some of the stunts creative (see the trailer if you need to know but they have hidden some of the best (or worse depending on how you want to watch them)) but some of the things that they did took us by surprise. These guys do things that won't be published in your magazines (and probably can't even be published here), involving a lot of things below the belt. However, almost 3/4 of the stunts are fantastically hysterical (though morally reprehensible, but remember the Knoxville declaration), and if you're in the right mindset this movie is hysterical to watch. Only about 20 minutes of this movie could actually have been shown on TV, so consider yourself warned of what you are feeling - some things are disgusting, but instead of being rejected by it you end up laughing at the sheer stupidity of it all. As a person who thought that Jackass the TV show was an excessive fashion with only a few funny sketches and a lot of useless pain, the amount of fun I had in this film made me realize that having no boundaries is the best environment for these guys to work with. It's a lot of fun and should be a great comic correction until Borat's movie comes out. With this film, you might think you know what you're getting, but these are some steps ahead of you - I guarantee you will be surprised by the third sketch. So have fun and don't worry: you won't want to do almost any of their stuff at home.
