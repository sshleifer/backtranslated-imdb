Now more than ever we need Peace & Love in this world! <br /> <br /> This film really shows the wonderful music of the Broadway show and the fabulous choreography of the legendary Twila Tharp! I saw it again after many years, and it continues to hold up well. <br /> <br /> Thanks, MGM / UA for putting it on DVD! I love the ability to see in Widescreen. MGM warms up for having done so in many of its DVD releases. <br /> <br /> You must love Treat Williams as Berger and John Savage as Claude. They could not have chosen better actors and actresses for this film! Beverly D'Angelo is a "hot mom" in this movie - I had forgotten how hot it was! WOW! <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is absolutely great, <br /> <br /> with the late great Nell Carter making a cameo singing in a couple of scenes, as well as the kooky Charlotte Ray (Mrs Garrett on "Facts Of Life") <br /> <br /> The story becomes a bit weak towards the end, but the anti-war sentiment of the late 1960s continues to resist and is relevant today. <br /> <br /> It is beautifully filmed (quite on the spot) and is so colorful and adorable and brings back the spirit of 1968 to the big screen. <br /> <br /> I saw this film when it was released in 1979 when I was 15, and was then moved by it, and it still moves me to 40 years. Some other reviews here say they should have been done before - I don't think Hollywood was ready to make a film like that in the late 60s and early 70s. <br /> <br /> The Vietnam War ended in 1975, and the whole affair struck a little too close to home, I think this story was first filmed (as in 1969, 70, 71) <br / > <br /> Good for director Milos Foreman! I love this movie !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> It's nice to see it again, this time on DVD. It has never been better!
