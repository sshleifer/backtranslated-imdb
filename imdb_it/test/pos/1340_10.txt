This was one of my favorite programs when I was a child. It had everything - music, stories, a talking squirrel and giggling daisies. I wanted to be one of those hippy chicks that sang and swung on a swing. I'm 35 and I grew up in South Jersey, but we got three New York channels with our cable connection, and I think it was on Channel 11. They don't do shows like this anymore (I know it makes me sound really old), and it occurs to me that I grew up with only 9 channels on our TV, but I always found something interesting to watch. I only talked to another person who really heard about this show. She is three years younger than me, and grew up in North Jersey. I'd like to see this series on DVD, so I could show it to my 5 year old daughter, and she could see what stupid (but great) things her mother used to watch! I just found a VHS tape of some episodes and a music CD of the show on ebay, and bought them right away, even though they were a bit expensive. I can't wait to make them relive the great memories!
