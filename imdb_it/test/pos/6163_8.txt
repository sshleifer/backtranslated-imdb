A romantic and pleasant war story that should have had more visibility. The Czech pilot who played the piano gives a soft touch to the story. The flying footage may not have been enough for aviation enthusiasts like me, but then again, this isn't really an action movie. Although it has nothing in common with James Salter's novel "The Hunters" which became the film about Korean war pilots F86 Saber, Dark Blue World had a similar feeling but with a more romantic element. Better in some ways than Battle of Britain as it is not based on big name actors. Suggest that you watch this movie with a Czech beer and some Czech dumplings called kneldniky (sp).
