full of action, with my favorite type of creature. I won't give away any if you haven't seen it, because it's worth taking the time to sit down and unravel the mystery of the things presented in this film. sometimes it went slow and those were the moments in which my mind wondered, something that however easily but moist left me quietly thrilled, where you keep it in your head instead of letting it go out, probably the state of mind in which I was at that moment . Special effects and action sequences that you could try for occasional breaks. Of course there is a load of films, just like this, the film still has its style and its taste, which I still respect from underground underground horror films.
