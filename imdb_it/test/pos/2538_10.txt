"Pixote: A Lei do Mais Fraco" is about what is perhaps the greatest of all Brazilian themes: poverty. And along with poverty, the other unnatural sensations and actions it brings; prostitution, violence, crime, rape and murder. <br /> <br /> Brazil is the country of paradoxes and its social problems are present everywhere. The difference between rich and poor; the beautiful and the ugly; happiness and the deepest human decay. <br /> <br /> "Pixote" is one of the films that dares to touch and open these painful wounds, and does so without the slightest glimmer of hope, in an honest portrait of a country that, like Pixote himself, is already lost.
