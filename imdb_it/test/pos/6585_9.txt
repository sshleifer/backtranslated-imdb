This is another one of those rare films where you feel gratitude for being introduced to the usual Hollywood tripe. It's really a roller coaster ride, as we follow the effects of a counterfeit 500 Euro note on a multitude of people. One asks "what if" all the time but it is certainly a butterfly effect captured in the film. It will make you laugh, cry and bite your lips. I loved every minute! And thanks to SBS Australia for showing really fun movies, it's also worth reading the subtitles. The only downside of my mind is that I won't book a holiday at Frozen Land - they all seem too depressed - it must be all that cold weather. Anyway, look at it - it's worth every second.
