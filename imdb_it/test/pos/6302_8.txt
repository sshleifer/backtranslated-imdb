The screenplay for Consequences of Love perfectly creates this intriguing and engaging film. A travellatore slowly brings a figure out of focus towards the camera, dragging behind it an enormous suitcase. As the central character of the film, we know nothing about him and our initial interpretation of him, his profession, the contents of the suitcase could be very far away. <br /> <br /> Consequences of love is that kind of film. From the title we could expect a Bergmanesq dissection of a relationship. What we have instead is a main character, Titta, who lives life in emotional exile, apparently choosing to cut himself off from those around him. If the film can be classified in some way, I would call it a mystery, since we are committed to understanding who Titta is and what it is. What we know from the beginning is 50 years old, fresh, composed and expensive. He has lived in a luxurious Swiss hotel for the past eight years, always paying the room rate on time, but he rarely showed any interest in the staff or other guests. <br /> <br /> His only real companions are a couple who occasionally play card games. The couple, shining through, was the owner of the hotel, but now she bet everything and has only the room where they live on the left. Their love for money, antiques and the other was their downfall and Titta seems to identify with their situation. He once had everything, but now he now lives as a virtual prisoner in the hotel. His brother, a surf instructor with long hair, comes down to see him from time to time, but he sees his visits as an intrusion rather than a pleasure. They talk about the person that Titta considers his best friend, even if he hasn't seen him for 25 years. This missing friend is now a telephone engineer, who is repairing the communication network that brings so many together. Meanwhile, Tittas's phone calls to his wife and children end early when they refuse to talk to him. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the film, Titta makes an unusual move and begins to open up to a young waitress at the hotel bar. With his judgment clouded by emotion he poses himself on a series of actions that will finally seal his destiny. <br /> <br /> The slow unfolding of Tittas falling from grace is well scripted, shot and scored. The sonorous techno soundtrack does a lot to increase the tension as more and more secrets are revealed, the last half hour turns into a thriller taught while Titta lets the mask slip and must once again face the consequences of his actions. The finale, with a visual nod to Felini, is dramatic but ambiguous and leaves the public to wonder once more about its motivations. <br /> <br /> Patrick Bliss, 01/06/06
