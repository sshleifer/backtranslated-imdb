Isabelle Huppert must be one of her greatest actresses or any other generation. "The Pianist" really confirms it. What's more, Annie Girardot plays her mother and Annie Girardot is one of her greatest actresses or any other generation. So, as you can well imagine, those casting pieces are worth the horror we suffer. Isabelle and Annie play characters we've never seen on screen before. A mother and a daughter yes, but with such a virulence without fear that sometimes I wasn't even able to blink or breathe. Personally, I don't believe in the intentions of the director, I don't think (intentions) go beyond the shocking anecdote and the ending made me scream in frustration, but I was fascinated by the story written in front of the sensational Huppert and the ferocity of Girardot's strength . I highly recommend it to movie lovers everywhere and to collectors of great shows like me, you can't afford to miss "La Pianiste"
