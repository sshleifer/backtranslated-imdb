This covers almost every area of ​​the creative process, and goes through the three phases in chronological order, with the main objective placed directly on production. There are documentaries that go into more detail and better deal with the other two groups. These are works of art, behind-the-scenes videos, clips from the film and many interviews. With a running time of just over two hours, the public has a lot of information, as this is almost the same length as the film itself. It could be argued that much of the time is spent on people, with craftsmanship and the result of their collaborative efforts coming into the background. This is well done, with tight editing. Enter technology and reveal how certain effects have been achieved. This spends a lot of time on physical preparation, in preparation for combat and so on. Nice shots of people, crew and actors alike are obtained. The Ultimate Matrix 10-Disc Set of this also contains almost three hours of music, in a simple system, with individual track selection and a Play All function, about 38 minutes of BTS material in addition to the title itself, in various featurettes. The original version, however, has many very short extras, including the making of the sequel clips, a preview of The Animatrix and Blocking Tapes by Yuen Wo Ping (a complete run-through of a pair of the largest art sequences martial arts, with acrobatic interpreters and almost the exact cinematography, with the same strokes and the same angles as those in the effort of finished silver screen). The language is strong enough, but rather rare, almost non-existent. I recommend both versions to anyone who loves the concept, and / or wants to know how they put together the first one. 7/10
