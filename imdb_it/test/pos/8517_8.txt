If you can watch a 1983 James Bond movie that isn't as good as Octopussy and still enjoy it. <br /> <br /> If you can accept production values ​​that are not much higher than the level of a TV movie. <br /> <br /> If you can watch Sean Connery with wrinkles on his forehead under an obvious toupee and see James Bond again. <br /> <br /> If you can get past an inexperienced Basinger, a weaker Largo and a cheerful Q. <br /> <br /> If you can learn to love an idiosyncratic score, not up there with Barry in his worst day. <br /> <br /> If you do not believe in the hyperbolic reviews that was accepted with the release. <br /> <br /> If you can meet a poker battle and a video game face to face and have fun the same way. <br /> <br /> Your never say never again and all that is in it. <br /> <br /> And what's more, you'll probably like it, my son!
