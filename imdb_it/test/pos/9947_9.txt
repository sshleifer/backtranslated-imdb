OK, I admit, I'm 40 and I still shed tears every time I watch Johnny call his robot to the end. <br /> <br /> "Robot, stop now! Don't do it, stop attack ... Robot, what are you doing, Robot ... Robot, where are you going? Robot, go back! Robot ... Robot please "Don't do it, you will die ... Robots ... Robot, please come here! I need you here? Giant Robot ... Robot! Giant Robot ??" - Johnny Sokko /> <br /> Of all the Tokusatsu that is out there, the giant robot has a special place in my heart and will always be there. I deserve to be involved in all sci-fi and anime when I was a kid. <br /> <br /> LIVE ON GR!
