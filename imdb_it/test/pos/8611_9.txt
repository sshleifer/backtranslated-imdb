Fabulous film on film production. Show the intense and strange relationships that can develop between directors and their actors; manipulation and mental games; the exaggerated selfishness of the artists. As in any workplace, sexuality complicates things, but here to the nth degree while filming a sex scene. <br /> <br /> Absolutely fantastic performances by Gregoire Colin as the fragile, aspiring macho lead man, and - supremely - Anne Parillaud as the director's self-portrait. The image of her laughing and eating a banana at the end, having finally got what she wants from her puppets, is pure delight.
