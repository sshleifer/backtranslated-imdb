"Big Fat Liar" is welcome - superficial, but welcome - a breath of fresh air after a swarm of films with baths, body fluids, pets on acidic jokes, gasses and horse gags. After all, "See Spot Run", "Max Keeble's Big Move" and "Snow Dogs" had reported The Degenerative Spiral of Kiddie Movie-making. Worse still is the awareness that the young public would later be satisfied with the insufferable offers of "Not Another Teen Movie" and "Slackers". Written by producers Nickelodeon Dan Schneider and Brian Robbins (who coincidentally starred in the 1980s sitcom "Head of the Class"), the film stars Frankie Muniz as Jason, who is always ready with a good lie for get out of scratches. (Where is the English newspaper? Dad choked on a Swedish meatball.) His teacher (Sandra Oh) publishes an ultimatum: deliver the paper by the end of the day or take the summer school. Jason brings out a story called "Big Fat Liar" and gets hit as he goes to school by a limousine with Hollywood's callous producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti). Wolf walks around him, but Jason leaves his paper behind him. No one will hear the truth this time, and Dad tells him that he has lost his trust. <br /> <br /> Months later, Jason and best friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) see a preview of the film for "Big Fat Liar", and Go to Los Angeles to devastate Wolf's life - all to get a confession that stole Jason's work to make the film. They even get the sympathy of some of Wolf's abused employees, including his assistant (Amanda Detmer), former driver (Donald Faison), movie star (Jaleel "Urkel" White, who plays himself) and coordinator of the stunts (very old Lee Majors). <br /> <br /> Because "Big Fat Liar" doesn't have the advantage that its "Malcolm in the Middle" sitcom is famous, but Muniz is easy to use but doesn't have much to work with. Likewise for Bynes, who headlines his personal set design by Tracey Ullman on Nickelodeon. All humility is given to Giamatti, whose eyes swell and his cheeks wriggle with every mocking insult. <br /> <br /> The film gets shots only by trying the high road, and should be enjoyed by its target audience (especially since most of the high jinks occur in the Universal Studios lot). But here is a masterpiece: the message is that it pays to tell the truth. But haven't we just seen Jason get his money back by telling white lies throughout the movie? Well, at least there's no poop.
