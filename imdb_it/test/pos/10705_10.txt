The producer, Matt Mochary, came across the subject of the film, Anderson Sa (leader of the AfroReggae music movement), during a trip by the Hewlett Foundation to Rio de Janeiro. Mochary was so moved by Sa's story that he called his friend, New York filmmaker Jim Zimbalist, who quit his job and joined Mochary in Brazil to work on a documentary on the favelas of Sa, Rio and culture of violence. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film shows the culture of violence in the favelas of Rio (the slums where the poor live) through videos of police incursions and attacks on the inhabitants. The video is graphic and shocking. <br /> <br /> The awakening from the negativity of the favelas is the charismatic Anderson Sa, who has passed a possible career in drug trafficking to start the AfroReggae movement, which combines elements of Afro-Brazilian culture, Reggae, ska and other elements in a percussion musical style with a fast-paced rhythm that has since spread to other parts of the world. You can't help but get carried away by the music, especially when you see the local children involved in Sa's school, which he founded to keep children out of drug gangs. The rest of the film follows Sa's rapid rise and his positivity changes many of the lives of children to look for a life beyond the drug race. SPOILER: Just when the filmmakers thought they had finished shooting, there is an incredible life-changing event whose resolution must be seen to be believed. The film then continues and you are grabbed in your place until the end. <br /> <br /> This film is a response to "City of God", and worthy of this. The squalid situation depicted in that film is contrasted by a real example of how the inhabitants of the favela can overcome the terrible situation in which they find themselves and use their resources for constructive purposes. You can't help but dislike and cheer on Anderson Sa's success. <br /> <br /> This film is terrifyingly shot, at a rapid pace, and is quite engaging. Judging by the overwhelming response of the public to last night's screening of SilverDocs, the film is expected to be released in the United States and the soundtrack should also be published. Watch this superlative documentary: it's excellent!
