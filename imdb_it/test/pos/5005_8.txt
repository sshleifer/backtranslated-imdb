Talkshow with Spike Feresten is one of those shows that will surely polarize the public. You either like it or you don't. Personally, I find most of the hilarious bits, but it has a little "eh?" moments. <br /> <br /> Staples like "Idiot Paparazzi" are always good for a laugh, but my favorite piece of all time must be the only "Hollywood Douchebag". "Comedy for Stoners" is the only normal bit that generally leaves me confused (which is part of the point!) Spike and his team of writers manage to churn out a lot of comedies every time so the show never feels stale . Feresten's brand of humor may not be suitable for everyone, but it's definitely worth a try. <br /> <br /> The masses have spoken! We like this show and we want more. Please note that I am not a friend or affiliate in any way with Spike Feresten, the "Talkshow with Spike Feresten" staff or the Fox network and affiliates. It's simply fun!
