In my endless quest to see as many quality films as possible in my life, I came across this cable movie. I have tried Hitchcock three times before this, and I have never heard that the work of man was equal to the praise he had received. I always thought it was good, not great (from what I saw) This was the best of his films I've seen like this. Robert Walker is absolutely chilling, his performance takes the film where Hitchcock wanted it to go. Even an average performance here damages the product in general. My favorite scene was his obsession with getting the lighter from the sewer (how does he get his arm down there?). Bruno is a rather compelling character, but I also loved Patricia Hitchcock's performance as Barbara. The rest of the Morton and Guy family were a bit dry and boring, but added a bit of flare to the film, as well as having some of the best lines in the script. <br /> <br /> Finally, in any suspense movie, you will live and die with your end. This contains water, unlike a couple of other Hitchcock movies I've seen. I wasn't sure how it would end, which kept me on the sidelines while I watched and waited.
