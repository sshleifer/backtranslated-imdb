"The Last American Virgin", along with "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" is one of the last great children's films ever made. It is a tender story of envy and unrequited love set in the early eighties. Very criticized by the critics that it was a trivial and banal attempt to recreate the magic of "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", these same critics do not recognize that the two films were actually filmed simultaneously during the end of 1981 and published at minimum intervals l 'one from the other. In any case, the studios would never allow such a bold and intransigent portrayal of the problems that many male adolescents face when they reach their sexual maturity. Especially considering the protagonist's heartbreaking discovery, Gary faces the end. American Pie is not. The story revolves around a trio of male adolescents, and their mostly unsuccessful sexual activities. Gary is the least successful of the group, hence the tagline LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN. Secretly, Gary wants his wife after Karen, who is involved with Rick, his best friend. Rick and Karen start having sex, and Karen gets pregnant, only to be dumped by Rick, who isn't interested in the obvious responsibility in front of him. Gary slips to help Karen, who leads to the aforementioned unexpected conclusion. Overall, as a film, I find that it has been very successful as a comedy, as a commentary on the sexual dilemmas of young people, and an extraordinary story about growth that addresses issues such as envy, unrequited love and abortion, which are just as relevant today as they were over twenty years ago. Plus, it has one of the most rockingest soundtracks ever made !!!
