Crossing the Bridge: the Sound of Istanbul has received one of the most grueling applause of the public at the end and very deservedly. I didn't expect too much from a musical documentary, but the film turned out to be much more than that. It was also a visual documentary of Istanbul with strong contrasts between old and new, western and eastern, poor and rich, modern and traditional. The black and white photographs of the old Istanbul by the famous Armenian photographer Ara Guler have been exceptional. But of course the main theme was music, and for God, what a variety! It was somewhat similar to the Bueno Vistas Social Club; love and respect of the interviewer - Alexander Hacke here to replace Ray Cooder - for the musicians who emerged from the screen and swallowed us all. The music was for the most part very interesting. The jazz session of a group of Roman gypsies in a small town in western Turkey was amazing. I will not be surprised if travel agents begin to receive group booking requests for Kesan after the film is released. But above all I loved Muzeyyen Senar who appeared extraordinarily elegant in a sort of burlesque way and while he let himself go "Raki" declared bravely: "My voice and I are 86! Well done Faith Akin. I bet there are many other Turkish musicians who feel excluded: go for Volume II please.
