This was essentially a remake of "Diagnosis Murder" minus Victoria Rowell, Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter. Dick plays a university professor who teaches Criminology 101 and can't even find his class. Barry is now a private eye, not connected to Dick. This allows Barry to shoot boys who turn away from him, which a policeman can't do. In the end Barry still has the girl. Tracey Needham portrays the girl. He's the main suspect and Dick and Barry believe she's innocent and try it. This is all the spoiler you get. The ending is sufficiently unexpected that you don't know it already in the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> Don't take it seriously. Don't criticize it. Sit down and enjoy Dick and Barry Van Dyke.
