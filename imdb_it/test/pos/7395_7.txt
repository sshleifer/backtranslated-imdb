Jack Frost 2, is probably the most exasperating film I've ever seen in my life. The full title of the film is Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman. Horror film fans who have a taste for campy story stories will be happy to see it. This film was for video and for good reason. Here's why: the acting was so atrocious and so terrible that it could make someone cry. The main character had no personality and the actor's bad acting made it all worse. The script was, it was also atrocious. Each character always says a joke in the background, and adds the poor lines to the bad choreography, so you have something bad. Secondly, the plot is not that impressive, but since this film was directed to video, it is forgiven. The director and the writer could have turned the idea of ​​a killer snowman into something beautiful, but they didn't. Their story has many holes in the plot. At first, a cup of coffee is thrown into the fish tank, with the melted Jack Frost. Scientists try to restore his life, but they could not. Once the cup of coffee fell into the tank, Jack Frost was completely restored. He is now immune to antifreeze. In part 1 of Jack Frost, the main character's DNA was mixed with the Anti-freeze used to kill Jack Frost. Since the main character is allergic to bananas, even Jack Frost is. So here's my point. They say that Sam's DNA combined with Jack Frost's. But one of the scientists had saliva on the cup, so when it fell into the tank, the scientists' DNA would be combined with Jack Frost. Another thing, even the special effects weren't very good. Here are the positive points: Jack Frost 2 has a lot of blood, it looks pretty realistic. Although this film is spoiled in hell, it's still fun. Overall, Jack Frost 2 is a funny horror movie. The first one was better though. 7 out of 10.
