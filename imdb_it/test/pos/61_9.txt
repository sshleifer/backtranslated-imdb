The core of Lackawanna Blues is the character of Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, who runs a board and provides untiring support to a young boy, Ruben, the narrator of the film. Based on the experiences of writer-actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson, the film lovingly recreates the northern area of ​​New York and evokes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is virtually non-stop music. The second half deals with the various characters of the board more completely. The babysitter's ability to "take fragments and make them whole" affects everyone in her sphere. A particularly vivid scene is when confronted with a violent husband, telling him firmly: "If you ever touch that child again, we'll dance!" As interpreted by the actress S. Epatha Merkerson, this line is so harmonious and full of such a resolution that the husband with the temperament to shake his hair is frozen in his tracks. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end, Merkerson offers an imposing presence His character binds together disparate lives of boundaries in his home. This was a moving and sincere film with a wonderful cast. As interpreted by Merkerson, the character of Nanny simply exudes love. This is a cinematic experience that I will remember for a long time to come.
