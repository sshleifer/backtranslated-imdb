It takes a lot for a film to reach the already numb particles of my brain that have not yet been exploited due to the overload and the redoredoredocopycopycopy cinema. But this movie has entered my 'Magic Movies' list. To become a "magic movie", it must let every string of my being quiver in what I can only define "happiness" and "complete satisfaction". This film exploited the fibers of how my mind thinks and if it weren't for the deeply personal connection of my head and the head of those who made these shares, it would seem like another "rave scene" film when the 90s exploded with his Mania of ecstasy. This is not the way the film came out for me. He joined me and pulled up something I thought had been dead for a long time and pushed me to criticize mine. I forgot how much time has passed since I saw something that made me feel so good inside. I highly recommend seeing this movie.
