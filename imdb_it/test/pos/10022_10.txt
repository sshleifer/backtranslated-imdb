In fact, this comic uses (and may have started) some of the gags and devices that have become standard in animation in later years, such as celebrity caricatures (including the aforementioned Chaplin. While the characters are silent, they "talk" using comics, just like in comics, as Felix started in the newspapers like a comic book, this device is natural, the atmosphere and style of the short are completely in harmony with that of comics, adding another dimension (literally and figuratively ) and makes this brief a pleasure to watch. It is worth taking the time and effort to get.
