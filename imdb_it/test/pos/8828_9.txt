I highly recommend it to anyone who loves good plots, good actors (though not very well known) (often, it's just better that way), science and / or science fiction cleverly presented on screen (small), good effects though they didn't have billions of dollars to produce it ... <br /> <br /> Much better than any war in the stars ... <br /> <br /> there was only one comment that was not necessary: ​​speaking of comet, the commentator says that LIFE was perhaps brought to earth through a comet ... it's funny, there must always be a chance for a magical way, eh ?! This is the beauty of LIFE, it can reach anywhere, without external force
