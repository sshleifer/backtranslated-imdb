Superb editing, exceptional acting, especially of Epatha Merkerson, and a very entertaining soundtrack. This film dates back to the 1940s to comment on racial lifestyle differences and some effects of desegregation while weaving the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic woman. <br /> <br /> The actor who portrays the character of Terence Howard is a wonderful work that reflects the life and times of his education in New York's small city of New York. The audience laughed, cried and burst into applause for the film and its director. <br /> <br /> Soon it will be shown on HBO (February 7th, I think) - turn on the TIVO and enjoy a good story!
