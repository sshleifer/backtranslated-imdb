This documentary focuses on the Gothenburg events of 2001. In the Swedish media the protesters were represented as criminals representing anarchy and violence. This film shows that it is not there, in fact they are intelligent, articulate people who have something to say - And he says it with the strength of bricks. They believe in a better world, a world where people can think and say what they want without being targeted. But do their beliefs have the chance to change society in a realistic way? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> This documentary gives us the illumination in the themes of greed, capitalism and the future that could lead. It is a great documentary that is not propaganda, because it is not shown how what they say is right. All that shows is what some individuals think and it is up to the viewer to decide whether what they do and what they represent is right or wrong. <br /> <br /> I have heard many people labeling this propaganda and for this reason they choose not to see it, I think they are making a wrong decision because even if you feel sympathy for the police or for the conviction of the demonstrators, all you will get it is more facts to rely on, for example the child who shot says he thinks he is good at throwing a brick through a McDonalds window because it is the step between thinking and acting as you think. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film scared me because you can't really ignore the facts that the few policemen, who fought violence with violence, were not convicted or detained in custody, despite evidence of having cast bricks during the event (and in some cases beating people with the truncheon, even if they are lying on the street without resistance) where it becomes. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10 - Very good, but not the best!
