For me, North and South (Books I & II) is the last TV series of the 80s. Finding all those cameo appearances was a lot of fun. Gene Kelly, James Stewart, Elisabeth Taylor, Olivia De Havilland, Robert Mitchum, even Johny CashÂ¡ No series approached this milestone. Have you ever seen anyone that looks like Lincoln? Dick Smith's prosthesis made Hal Holbrock's powerful performance even stronger. Handmade costumes, breathtaking locations, everything. It is clear that nowadays there are excellent and brilliant TV series (Desperate Housewives, Lost, 24), but North & South was, and still is, unique. Not to be missed. Only David Carradine's interpretation of the definitive villain (you could only call him a violent husband) deserves vision. Perhaps some characters and situations are too stereotyped, I admit but the positives clearly cast a shadow over them. I'm so glad it's finally available on DVD in Spain.
