It's not really about wine. No, the real targets of Nossiter are those that rationalize and assimilate the peculiarities of local production (wine) for commercial purposes. To this end he made an excellent and objective film. Independent producers of alcoholic, irritable, emotional and imperfect wines are combined with those mediated, Anodians and Americans who love Europe: the art of winemaking against the manufacture of laboratory products and market-driven products. It is an open show that does not lead to the conclusion. <br /> <br /> Nossiter's film is occasionally irritating to watch - the cameras are neither hidden nor steadicam, by any means. There are also many captions and subtitles to browse, often too short on screen. <br /> <br /> However, he exceeds Moore in the game that Moore cannot play anyway. The characters speak - and therefore condemn - themselves. Worth a visit 7/10
