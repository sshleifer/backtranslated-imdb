I think "Key West" could do well as a DVD. There are probably many failed Star Treks who have never had a chance to succeed. We will never know if this could have been a great series. I'd like to know if there's a way to see older shows like this or are they just another Hollywood note? Is it possible to find copies of these shows so that we loyal freaks can enjoy them again? The show had a great talent in writing and some if not all the episodes left you with a touch for the characters that are often missing in today's hits. I often had the feeling of learning something with narrative lines and very amused by the truly unique characters. Thank you.
