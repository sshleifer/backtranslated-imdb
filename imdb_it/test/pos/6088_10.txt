Count Laszlo (Ralph Fiennes) has just been transferred to a hospital in Italy during World War II. It is horribly burned by an ambush. His nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche) takes care of him, his body and mind, because he rightly fears that she may be a very upset soul. In the course of his care, the Count begins to tell Hana of his recent past. He seems to have worked in a government in Africa, where he met a beautiful married woman named Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Although they tried to avoid each other, they fell in love. After a brief relationship, Katherine interrupted her, leaving the count desolate. Even so, the two would meet again, in harrowing circumstances. Meanwhile, Hana herself falls for a Sihk in the British bomb squad. Yet the war rages implacably. Can love exist when the world is in turmoil? This is a terrible film, based on an equally beautiful but complex novel. The plot has many narrative lines that are intertwined together beautifully, each of them moving beyond description. The script is elegant and contains many memorable lines. Fiennes is magnificent, both as a burn victim and as the man who thought love was a myth. Scott Thomas is also quite as good as the woman who fights against his passions. As for Binoche, she largely deserved the Oscar she had been presented with, as her nurse is a shining example of hope in a desperate situation. The scenery is absolutely beautiful, as are the customs, direction and production. If you have lost the vision of this film, correct it soon, very soon. The English patient will remain one of the greatest successes in cinema for centuries to come.
