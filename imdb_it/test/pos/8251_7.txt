Simply brilliant to be plausible and still a lot of fun, this is a pure slice of the 70s (even the cops need haircuts!). Filmed in and around London, the plot of the former American inmate who tries to go straight but finds himself sent as an electrician to a bank in Mayfair, and then he has the screws made by Lord David Niven, and finds himself plotting the crime of the century is well managed. <br /> <br /> I liked its simplicity and even its innocence, it refers to a period in which caper films, where only that, a caper and violence were not part of the agreement. <br /> <br /> All in all, you can do a lot worse than watching this: it has enough twists to give it some grit and a cast that obviously enjoyed doing it. <br /> <br /> Well done and watchable.
