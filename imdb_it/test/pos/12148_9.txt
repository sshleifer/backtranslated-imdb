The film Classe tous risques directed by Claude Sautet was not a film, to be honest, I had never heard of it until the Film Forum in New York declared that they would have a two-week screening of the film, with new subtitles in English. When I also read that he was in the vein of the classic French crime film wing Jean Pierre Melville, I jumped at the chance to take a look (at best he would have classified himself with his great works, and in the worst case I would have had something good popcorn in a big theater). It was worth it to admit, given that Classe tous risques is one of those French films just waiting to be rediscovered (or discovered for the first time). With a diligent and tense diligence, Sautet maintains the suspense at a close pace for the first forty minutes of the film, maintaining a good (if not exceptional) central section, and then finishing with what is always expected with these films, but with motivations fascinating through the characters. With a film in the wake of this genre, you know how it will end, but it is the cold and careful journey that counts. <br /> <br /> The film presents a performance with a certain truth and honesty, among the "criminal code of the old school, by Lino Ventura in the role of Aldo, that at the beginning of the film (one of the best beginnings of a film in this genre and country) steals a large sum of money from its crime partner.) When there is a nasty surprise of fate on a beach late at night, Aldo is again on the run with two small children. help from Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo, a role in tune with Le Doulos only with a smidgen more humanity and charisma), who is also a thief and guides him in Paris, but there are some problems with some of the old business partners of "Aldo and an old score could be the right ticket. A couple of times the plot may seem nice, but it's not. Like Melville, Sautet doesn't give anything fat to his story, and it's a very well structured film, with some good doses of humor here and there (sometimes I was smiling for the audacity d and the criminals in the initial chase sequence, and also with a particular woman who had a picky thing with her cat and a fish). <br /> <br /> Along with a soundtrack by the great George Delerue, an exceptional cinematography and a mood that rarely meets, let alone matched now Adays, Classe tous risques is a reminder of that bridge between the real film old school noir and the latest crime films. The gangsters in this new kind of "thug-life" movie have a thousandth of the class and the honor of the thieves in this film, and it's a second banana for the works of Melville and Jules Dassin (a compliment that I assure you). Which also has a good moral and realistic advantage.
