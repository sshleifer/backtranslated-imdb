I tuned into this film because there was nothing else to watch. I was immediately sucked into the characters. <br /> <br /> Robin Tunney is nothing less than spectacular in this film. His portrait of a mentally ill woman is both moving and 100% credible. Really, this kind of thing is not easy to do. He rips it off in a fantastic way. <br /> <br /> We know that soon this film will end tragically, but you can't take your eyes off it. The characters do stupid things, but unlike most Hollywood movies where people do stupid things because the story requires it, these people do stupid things because they aren't right in the head - and the things they do are completely consistent with their characters. /> <br /> This is just a great example of making IMHO movies. Great writing, great acting, great direction. A film for people who think that cinema can be something more than mindless entertainment.
