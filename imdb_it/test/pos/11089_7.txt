The tense and frenetic film of director John Schlesinger tells the true story of Christopher Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee, two young men who sold secrets of the US government to the Soviet Union in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton plays Christopher Boyce very competent He is a very disillusioned young man from the devious CIA activities in allied Australia. Sean Penn, as an addict and drug addict, Andrew Daulton Lee, is exceptional. <br /> <br /> The competent and professional management of Schlesinger, along with a very good acting, make "The Falcon and the Snowman" a spy thriller not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Tuesday 4 February 1992 - Video
