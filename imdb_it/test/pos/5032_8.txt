Michael is probably too sad for most action movie fans and even Hollywood for the intellectual public, but I found it extremely funny and very touching, despite being both formidable and formidable. <br /> <br /> When three skeptics are sent to investigate a man who claims to be an angel, they end up escorting him on a great tour of the central-western countryside only to discover that each of them needs investigations. <br /> <br /> When you take this Aside from the movie, like in most movies today, there is not a lot of new material, but taken as a whole it has an original approach and is quite offensive to entertain him to the end. <br /> <br /> Although not a "Family" film, it is suitable for all ages and a good movie to share with the whole family or that special person. <br /> <br /> "Michael" is not a great film but it is certainly a good movie, a touching film, and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> KWC
