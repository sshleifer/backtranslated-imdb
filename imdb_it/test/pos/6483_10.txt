I think it's the kind of movie you love or hate and I'm not the art film type. My mother rented "Mullhuland DR" last night and almost ran away from the room, ah. But I love this movie. <br /> <br /> We recorded "The Beat" one night when we had just run the tape and got a fantastic movie by accident. He saved that tape and watched it a lot. In the end I got the VHS to add to my collection. I've looked at it many times and at one point I copied the poems. I even tried preforming a scene for my school acting class. He said we could do any scene we wanted and just cut the bad words. She refused to let me do it. If it could upset my theater teacher, so much must be good :) Honestly he never treated me the same after. <br /> <br /> I liked the acting that came out very sincere and honest. It wasn't clean and shiny but it was better than that. It was true for life, as someone would really behave and show emotions not like Hollywood. It was a great acting especially that of Rex. <br /> <br /> The story was original. Not only are the characters drawn to his world but you too. Not your typical person meets the children of the city center and saves them through the film of knowledge. Simply care and friendship make things a little better. <br /> <br /> The only thing is that even in the 80s there was more violence with the gun and less simple things like rock throwing, but that little bit of innocence didn't damage this movie. <br /> <br /> I think it's a must see. you will love it or hate it, but in any case it has an impact and this is a good movie that you will remember and talk about later.
