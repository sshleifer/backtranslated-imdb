A grumpy old baronet, happily unmarried, decides to send his three illegitimate adult children and give them a home in his manor. To his surprise, he finds himself tied to his uninhibited American daughter. Will he find satisfaction in his new role as THE BACHELOR FATHER? <br /> <br /> This 1931 film, which gives a solid performance, marked the arrival at MGM of Elder Sir C. Aubrey Smith, very soon to be one of Hollywood's most important actors. With his big hooked nose and beetling eyebrows, Sir Aubrey looked at every moment at the part of the duke or general or statesman that he would play so often. The well-known leader of the Hollywood Hollywood community, Sir Aubrey would also have supported the criquet game in southern California. He would remain in great demand in the studios of the whole city, until his death in 1948. <br /> <br /> The most famous star of the film is Marion Davies. Better remembered today as the lover of media magnate William Randolph Hearst and the lord of Hearst Castle, the most fabulous residence on the west coast, was actually a very talented and pretty girl. For a few years, Hearst tried to make her the queen of MGM (with her production company and a huge dressing room) but the studio already had several other queens - Dressler, Garbo, Shearer, Crawford - and eventually moved it to Warner Bros. Here Miss Davies has the chance to joke and make the clown and her scenes with Sir Aubrey are fun. <br /> <br /> His love interest is played by Ralph Forbes, a charming young British actor who was just starting to find good movies (THE TRAIL OF 98) as the silent days ended. He had all the qualities for the celebrity, but unfortunately he wouldn't have been. The celebrity would come to Ray Milland, doing one of his first screen appearances here. Halliwell Hobbes and Doris Lloyd also seem to benefit.
