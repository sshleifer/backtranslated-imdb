Spin-offs, for those who don't know, usually don't succeed because most of the original characters are absent. <br /> <br /> Here they are and you couldn't ask for a better ensemble in what is essentially a silly little cartoon, not meant to do anything but entertain. <br /> <br /> JP Manoux, replacing David Spade, does an admirable job of preserving Kuzco's ego and yet does not seem as annoying as the Spade character (a character Spade has been doing for decades and gets angry nervously after a while). It has a softer voice but fits somehow. <br /> <br /> Eartha Kitt, resuming her part as Yzma, is brilliant. She has not been given much praise since Batwoman centuries ago, except perhaps for her cowardly part in Boomerang. It is strange how much the character resembles them, however. <br /> <br /> and Patrick Warburton. There is no way it can't be funny, except when it was completely wasted on Men in Black 2. I was a fan of his from Seinfeld but unlike that character, he plays a real nice guy who gets sucked into doing such beautiful things . <br /> <br /> The animation is really beautiful like all Disney is, but sometimes the character design is a little too sweet. Oh good. Two out of three are not bad.
