I know little or nothing about astronomy, but nevertheless; At first I was a bit skeptical about the plot of this movie. It follows three children who were all born during a solar eclipse and therefore have no emotions, and therefore (naturally) they become ruthless serial killers. At the beginning the plot seems ridiculous, but once you realize that a solar eclipse blocks Saturn and, as you know, Saturn is the planet of emotions, everything is okay; makes perfect sense and that's when you know you're not just looking at another silly 80s slasher with a pea plot. Thank God for that! Seriously though, Bloody Birthday is based on a ridiculous premise, but it's more than compensating for its originality. Having a group of kids going around people might not be the most brilliant of the masterpieces ever seen in the cinema, but when they chose between this and another boring Friday 13th clone - I know what I'd choose. <br /> <br /> Even helping the movie out of the hole that some people might think the silly storyline sinks into is the fact that it's extremely fun. Many loggers become too fast and the public simply ends up seeing some blood. This film, however, continues to go with some fantastic child-like performances (reminiscent of creepy kid-like classics like Village of the Damned), a steady stream of sick humor and a small, but impressive one for the kind of film, suspense voltage. One thing I really liked about this film was the wide range of weapons. There is nothing worse than a slasher in which the killer uses the same weapon over and over again (cough for Halloween cough), but this is not the case when Bloody Birthday finds space for everything from jumping to bow and arrow strings. There was no room for a chainsaw, which is a real shame, but I suppose that not all films can contain a chainsaw.
