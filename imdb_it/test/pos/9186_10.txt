I was expecting a good movie. What I got was an even better movie. The chemistry between James and Smith is simply incredible. I'm glad to see him in an important movie for once! <br /> <br /> The film works, because the actors play their parts perfectly. Will Smith is fantastic with his incessant charm; Kevin James is hilarious, and Eva Mendes ... well, let's say she plays that bitch / sweet / annoying role to the best of her ability. <br /> <br /> What I loved about the movie was the fact that Will Smith didn't even have to try to be lovable. He was alone !! The "doctor of the date" had all the right moves, he said everything in the most perfect way, and he never exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The fun parts are hilarious ... and the cute and romantic parts are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> I absolutely recommend this movie. And no, it's not a chicken shot.
