Honestly, I really don't understand why there have been so many controversies about this show. Embrace the elements of the original, expanding on them. Storytelling has been updated and, while some episodes seem a bit "fast", it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is perfect in the role. Easily as good as Tom Baker. <br /> <br /> Rose is one of the best companions, on par with Sarah Jane Smith or Leela. <br /> <br /> I like the concept that the timelords have been destroyed - No more controversy with the Doctor acting as president emeritus. And it adds something to the character of being the only one left. <br /> <br /> SFXs are exceptional - especially compared to the original. <br /> <br /> Take me to me (And I was a huge Dr Who geek - In fact I took notes while watching the show from Dr number 1 to Dr number 8. I threw away the horrible cannon movie, personally ) this is the best science fiction show on TV right now, maybe never. Watch it and buy the DVD.
