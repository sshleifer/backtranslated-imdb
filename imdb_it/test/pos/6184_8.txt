This film reappeared on channel 13 in the 1990s when they made a series of Hollywood comedies in the 1930s and 1940s. In fact, for the notes of "The Jolly Fat Policeman", they did a montage of scenes from the movies to present the series of laughing people, including one by Gary Cooper who giggles while watching a movie in a cinema - a sequence from this movie. <br /> <br /> It all starts innocently when Cooper, a millionaire, enters a department store in France to buy pajamas. But he just likes sleeping at the top. The clerk (Tyler Brooke) insists he can't sell half his pajamas as Cooper wants. Claudette Colbert listens to the discussion and offers to help her - she just likes sleeping in her pajamas. What happens if Brooke sells them every half? Brooke has never had a similar offer before, so he goes to the walker (Rolfe Sedan) and asks if this can be done. He too is disturbed - the request is quite unconventional. Eventually they contact the shop owner (Charles Halton). Halton is in bed and leaves - his lean build that only supports a pair of pajamas at the top (if the length is appropriate for censorship reasons). Can they sell a set of pajamas to the two customers (half for each)? Rightly horrified, Halton replies: "No, of course not! This is Communism !!" So the sale is not allowed. Apparently no one thinks that Cooper can buy the total pair and sell half to Colbert. <br /> <br /> THE EIGHTH WIFE OF BLUEBEARD has had a reputation of falling flat, most viewers don't like it due to a misreading of Colbert's character. It is considered quite mercenary towards Cooper - selling itself to him on his terms. <br /> <br /> Actually the character of Cooper is the worst, because he is rich and understands that everything has a price. It is correct most of the time. Look at how the fatherly aristocrat of a father, Edward Everett Horton, sees his new son-in-law as a golden goose he can use. Cooper's willingness to marry Colbert somehow includes an agreement that, if he is reluctant or chooses not to marry her, he must pay damages. Horton, when he realizes it, pulls out a watch and (in a very reassuring voice) tells Cooper: "Take your time, my boy!", To make a decision. Later we see that Horton's wardrobe has become more modern and more elaborate. <br /> <br /> The film, screenplay by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, compares well with the screenplay of Mitchell Leisin's MIDNIGHT (also with Colbert, but with Don Ameche and John Barrymore). There Colbert is willing to sell himself for a cash marriage (to Francis Lederer), but it is complicated by a fictitious marriage with Ameche. She really loves Ameche (a taxi driver) but she explains to him in an unexpectedly realistic moment that her parents got married "out of love" but poverty made them grow up to hate each other. This is not found in the eighth wife of the nineteenth century, where Colbert does not have such a background (after all, she is the daughter of a marquis). His mercenary plot is to teach Cooper a lesson about his standards. <br /> <br /> The film has a good job by the support staff, including Herman Bing as a private eye who discovers he is hiding the things Colbert learns, and a young David Niven, who has a series of moments chosen as support in the punching bag and as a willing ear to Cooper. Coop tells Niven about his problems with Colbert and how he is so irritating. Niven listens respectfully. In the end, Cooper is touched by his willingness to listen to what he has to say. "Albert, how much do I pay you?" Asks Cooper. Niven thinks and says: "Thirty-five francs a week, sir." Cooper looks deeply into his soul, and says (shaking his head), "That's right!"
