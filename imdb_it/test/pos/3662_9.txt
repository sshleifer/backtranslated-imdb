"Hari om" is an Indian greeting and the gripping character of the film's title with the same name (played by the wedding planner of Monsoon Wedding) greets you and takes you on a journey to the heart of southern India. There are no "Piegalo come Beckham" backdrops and stereotypes, and only light greetings to Bollywood music and dances (however it is worth getting the soundtrack), but rather, the feeling that you are seeing the real India permeates the film through 'use of dozens of local residents in each scene to increase the performance of the five professional actors. Fortunately for us, Hari Om's partner is a beautiful young French woman looking for a trip. With the opening of a journey "Y Tu Mama Tambien" towards self-discovery (without sex and deadly disease), this beautiful film calms and brings the philosophical mind. Against the initial juxtaposition of the protagonists, everyone identifies with the traits of both and the cultural gap disappears as humanity intervenes. More succinctly, the central theme of the film, "Everyone has a love story, don't let yours go by" teaches us a great deal of love on a number of levels. Don't let this movie pass you by!
