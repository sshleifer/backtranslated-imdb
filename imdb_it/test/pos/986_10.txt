Having never read or seen the original work of the Bard, I cannot begin to compare this work with his story. So I won't do it. Instead I will simply say that this was a very funny story with some very nice special effects (and some that seemed a little lower in budget, but still decent enough to enjoy). I thought all the main actors did a great job. The style of magic seemed more black than white and it is almost certain to offend anyone easily upset about that sort of thing, but I thought it was well done.
