After watching this movie, I have no choice but to write a review in the hope that there are others like me out there who have been swept away by the ninja action fueled by the rocket and hot white titillation that is Ninja III: The Domination . /> <br /> We all know that Sho Kosugi swings. This is a fact, but what about Jordan Bennett's ultra-macho interpretation of his official police character "Billy Secord"? Good Mr. Bennett, bravo. You will soon prove to be trying to seduce the formidable Christie (played to perfection by a Miss Lucinda Dickey of Breakin 'hunger) who is not afraid to risk your trade. I particularly liked how you don't feel the need to intervene and try to help her as 4 thugs try to rape her outside her gym. Oh, you could have been sure of yourself, but watching you let her know who the boss was. Secord will wear pants in this relationship. I also liked how Mr. Bennett was not afraid of repeatedly taking off his shirt or wearing his wife-beater's tank top despite his gorilla like shoulders and back. The back and shoulders are warm and Secord knows it. What about Lucinda Dickey? All I can say is "KABOOM" - I see a sex bomb preparing to explode. She has all the right moves both as an actress and as a martial arts magician. The chemistry behind Dickey and Bennett is what makes this movie perfect. You'd think he'd hate him because he's kind of an idiotic idiot, but not my friends. Animal magnetism is too strong to resist and bind like mad glue. Sho Kasugi is not as important as one might think, even though he is still a main character, which is fine for me because all I wanted was more Bennett and Dickey. It looks like it has a lot of eye make-up, which was nice to see. The special effects? Wow. This is all I can say. I won't give away the ending but let's just say it won't disappoint. I love Ninja III: The domain, and I can only hope that there is a Ninja 4. I give it a 5 on 5 star rating. disappoint.
