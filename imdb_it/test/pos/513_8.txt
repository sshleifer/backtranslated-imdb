If you like horror or action watch this movie soon. If the opening scene does not pump up the adrenaline, then someone should check the pulse. Great action, excellent casting and top one-liner. This is the only movie I saw in a cinema where the crowd applauded every chop, kick and punch thrown. Not perfection, but who cares when movies can be so fun. It's a sheer wave of dark comic actions. 9/10
