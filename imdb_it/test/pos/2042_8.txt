Almost no cinematic experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor. Geena Davis is a native speaker who suffers from amnesia. You are also on the PTA! But then a car accident awakens the woman she was, and she is HOT! Samuel L. Jackson is as exhilarating as the rented private eye that tries to help Davis find his past, only to find that he has gone over his head. Davis also has hilarious jokes, and the interaction between her and Jackson works surprisingly well. <br /> <br /> Look for Brian Cox, the original Hannibal Lechter, and David Moorse finally getting rid of his St. Elsewhere TV picture. The film is directed by Davis's husband, who seems to have built the entire movie around her, but it works. <br /> <br /> Extract this DVD and watch it often. I still love the makeup scene. Geena is hot or what?
