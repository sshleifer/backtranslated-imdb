Although this film does not stand out particularly from the cinema crowd, it is still a very nice film to sit on and watch with your feet up high! There are perhaps one or two errors that are understood and the cinema is a bit neglected, the film itself is a lot of fun and has a wonderful atmosphere. Music contributes a lot to the mood of the film. <br /> <br /> Acting is no less impressive (especially the dog than he is!) with John Travolta taking on the fun and boring direction of Michael. Other characters feel very genuine and behave very well in the film. <br /> <br /> So, after a long day at work, stick "Michael" in the evening with an ice cream and enjoy a quality movie in his own right :)
