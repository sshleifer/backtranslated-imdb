Both Jackie and Candice are fantastic in this film. They are well adapted to their roles and have different possibilities to shine. In particular, the way in which Candice pronounces the words "Puerto Rican" is a lot of fun, since she is as kind as she can be, but at the same time condescending. I saw the original of this film, called "Old Knowledge", with Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. Presumably they didn't get along, so because the film is about female friendship, that may have been a problem. Here, the actresses clearly admire and respect each other. Hart Bochner and Meg Ryan have supporting parts and they are both excellent, especially Bochner, who has never gotten many decent parts in the movies, as far as I'm concerned. George Cukor didn't make another film after this, so it was a good way to get out.
