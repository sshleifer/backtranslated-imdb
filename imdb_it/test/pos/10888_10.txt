Wear only the best Italian Armani suits, hand-sewn and adapted to your exact measurements. Your car is the best that German engineering has to offer and is equipped with all the horse gadgets under the hood. You are a member of the best polo clubs, you often dine in restaurants like Spago and you are always accompanied by at least two of the most beautiful women in the world. Your pocket watch also acts as a nuclear explosive, while your trusty pen can also be used as an automatic caliber 22 caliber pistol. Ski on the snow in the Alps, go scuba diving in the Caribbean, dive into the sky over the Andes, and your hair will never, ever be out of place. You are Bond, James Bond, the most famous spy in the world, favorite son of the good queen, bad boy of the British SS, and perhaps the most desired man in the world. The character of James Bond was created by Ian Fleming and is the longest running icon in the film industry, being the subject of over fifteen films in over four decades. The last character to play the role is Pierce Brosnan, who took on the role of James Bond from Timothy Dalton in 1996, and made his debut in 007 at Goldeneye. <br /> <br /> This is the set of the first great title developed by a third party on the Nintendo 64. Goldeneye, developed by Rare for Nintendo, has been on the market for some time. Its continued dominance in the sales charts is only a testament to how good this game is, and no revision library would be complete without it. <br /> <br /> Let's face it - most of the time cinematic licensed games are flops. Although the two look like a good mix, the results, for the most part, have been horrendous. Games like Cliffhanger, True Lies, Lethal Weapon, and not to mention all the Star Trek flops, are enough ammunition against this mix. And for the record, I'm not a fan of movie-licensed games, especially if I've seen the movie. At least that's how I thought. In the case of Goldeneye, I had more reservations than normal. While not a bad film, Goldeneye the film didn't have much appeal, and I don't rank it in the top ten of Bond movies. As a game, let's just say it's a completely different story. <br /> <br /> The game is a first-person shooter, and to be successful, you will need at least as much brain as muscle. For those who have seen the film, which I imagine most of you read, the plot is very coherent and follows the path of the film with little variation. A plot to control the most dangerous satellite in the world, Goldeneye, began in the USSR, and in the process a beautiful woman was captured. Your missions will be many, the extreme danger. You will have to rely on your wits and your experience to overcome the most grueling missions the world has ever known. M will inform you as soon as you are ready. Good day, James.
