Vanaja (2006), written and directed by Rajnesh Domalpalli, is an extraordinary film from southern India. Mamatha Bhukya plays Vanaja, a 15-year-old who lives in a rural area with a loving but alcoholic father. If he is successful in life, he will have to overcome the responsibilities of low caste and poverty. <br /> <br /> I went to the film waiting for the representation of a wretched girl who is crushed by society. This is not what "Vanaja" shows us. The young woman is attractive, intelligent and ambitious. He will not accept his fate with tears or simple resignations. He wants to succeed, and it is never clear that he will not succeed, despite the odds. <br /> <br /> The acting that Mr. Domalpalli draws from his amateur cast is miraculous. Mamatha Bhukya is exceptional in the title role, and Urmila Dammannagari does an exceptional job as Ms. Rama Devi, the rich landowner who is a famous classical dancer. <br /> <br /> In the film, Vanaja learns classical South Indian dance, as he did in real life. I couldn't tell how beautiful the Vanaja dance was by Indian standards, but the many dance scenes were fascinating. (Don't think of Bollywood - this is classical dance, it is also very different from ballet, because in ballet the dancer lifts her heels off the floor. In the Indian sound dance, the heel is the main point of contact.)> <br /> This is a movie not to be missed. It will work on DVD, but it will be better on a theater screen because the dance will be shown for the best advantage. However, if the DVD is the only option, then see it that way. Make sure you see it.
