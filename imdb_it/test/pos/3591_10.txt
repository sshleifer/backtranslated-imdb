As a SCUBA diver, I can appreciate the incredible physical effort that cameramen must have undergone to get the shots under water. This series is MUCH more, though. The narration is perfect, the scenes at the limit are not plausible and the subject is engaging. The daily struggle for life that takes place from the point of view of us terrestrial inhabitants is shocking. This DVD set has opened our eyes to another planet right here on Earth. I invite everyone to watch this series.
