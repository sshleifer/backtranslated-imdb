I put this film on I didn't expect much, if not a film festival of B. Fortunately, I was presented with a very well done film, which accumulated suspense and managed to keep it for its entire duration. This was an impressive result. The acting was solid, creating characters that you worried about and worried about; and although some may find the film slow, they forced you to think about what you would have done in the same situation. Add to this a beautiful photographic work and the directors manage to put it all together admirably. An excellent effort, therefore, is worth spending your time if you prefer blood development and suspense.
