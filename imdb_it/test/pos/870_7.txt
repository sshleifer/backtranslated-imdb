This nice French film is about a millionaire who owns a tobacco factory on an African island almost in Madagascar named Louis (Jean Paul Belmondo). He is a single man looking for a wife, then he advertises a bride and gets a wonderful woman named Julia (Catherine Deneuve). When it appears spontaneously it turns out to be much more attractive than expected. He marries Julia but suddenly disappears. A French private eye (Michael Bouquet) is hired by Julia's sister and is soon on the trail of his previous wife. Later Louis meets her in a ballroom with another name. Despite the romantic illusion and everything else, Louis continues to fall in love with his enigmatic wife. <br /> <br /> This film is a splendid drama full of betrayal, deception, killing, theft and Hitchcock suspense. Good interpretations of Jean Paul Belmondo as a young cigarette company owner who seems determined to fall under the spell of a femme fatale and a wonderful Catherine Deneuve as a suspected heroine. The film gets numerous references to American cinema, but Truffaut (400 shots) was a fervent spectator, such as: Johnny Guitar, Colorado Jim, Bogart and Hitchcock. The US version has been cut several minutes and deserves urgent restoration and remastering. Freely inspired by the novel entitled "Waltz in the darkness" by Cornell Woolrich (Stained glass and screenwriter by Alfred Hitchcock), also adapted in "The bride dressed in black by Truffaut". Colorful photography by Denys Clerval (Stolen Kisses) and atmospheric music by Antoine Duhamel, the usual Truffaut musician. This is one of the best of his suspense films along with "Davenheit 451 and Shoot the piano player". Remade from an inferior version by Michael Christofer (2001) with Antonio Banderas, Angelina Jolie and Jack Thompson, full of erotic scenes and lust.
