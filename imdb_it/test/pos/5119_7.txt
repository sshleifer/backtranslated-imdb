This time, the amiable dimwit is summoned by juror, where a corrupt lawyer realizes that he looks like a jailbird who wants to burst, so the two exchange. Of course, most of the film is a series of gags; in "Ernest Goes to Jail", most gags refer to electricity. I really liked the whole sequence of vacuum cleaners at the beginning. Overall, the point of the movie is just for fun, and I'm sure you will. This is probably the last movie you watch with a gem. It's pretty safe to say that Jim Varney will be really missed. Knowwhaddamean? Best regards: the only other member of the cast I recognized was Randall "Tex" Cobb, who played Lyle. You certainly saw it somewhere.
