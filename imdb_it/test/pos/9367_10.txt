The real best film of 1947 also deals with anti-Semitism and is superior to Elia Kazan's GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT (the final winner of that year's Academy Awards) in practically all departments. The almost perfect direction of Edmard Dmytryk, the concise script by John Paxton and the expert expressionist lighting of J. Roy Hunt are wonderfully welcomed by an exceptional cast. Although Robert Young (who plays a casual, methodical and very nice cop) and Robert Mitchum (who actually has the occasional witty comment) are the nominal stars of the film, they are Oscar nominees Robert Ryan and Gloria Grahame - so like Paul Kelly, in the small but fundamental role of the pathetic husband of Grahame - which confers the most memorable characterizations of the film; Ryan proved so convincing as a murderous racist who was eventually replaced for a while, excelling in equally evil roles in such films as ACT OF VIOLENCE (1948), CAUGHT (1948), THE RACKET (1951), CLASH BY NIGHT (1952 ), THE NAKED SPUR (1953) and BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK (1955). The film is also noteworthy for its atypical structure as Ryan's "flashback" sequence, a complete fabrication, is shot in a direct manner while the actual truth emerges from the confused and distorted memories of the true protagonist of the film which, moreover , it is not even played by one of the movie's stars! Furthermore, CROSSFIRE originally dealt with homosexuality (as in the original novel by Richard Brooks, "The Brick Foxhole"), but this taboo topic was unacceptable to the Office of Hays at the time - one far from the situation we have today when (at least) 3 gay-themed films are in the running for the important Oscars this year! <br /> <br /> The print used for the Warners DVD transfer shows some deplorable signs of wear at times, but the audio The comment of noir experts, James Ursini and Alain Silver, is good, even if I don't understand the their opinion that Dmytryk's career has steadily declined after his HUAC problems, such as excellent images such as THE SNIPER (1952), THE CAINE MUTINY (1954), BROKEN LANCE (1954), THE YOUNG LIONS (1958), WARLOCK (1959) and MIRAGE (1965) demonstrate this widely; having said that his collaborations with RKO with producer Adrian Scott and screenwriter John Paxton - MURDER, MY SWEET (1944), CORNERED (1945, hopefully he will be part of the upcoming Filmners' Noir Box Set) and CROSSFIRE - constitute its best work. In any case, in my opinion, the latter is not only one of the key films of the 40s, but also one of the best ever made, period.
