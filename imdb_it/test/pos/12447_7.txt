This DVD usually sells for around $ 20. I wouldn't have paid that much for the DVD if I knew what I was getting, but despite this it's a pretty good record. Show the Node in all their glory, with the filming of their concerts ... playing Surfacing, Wait and Bleed and Scissors among other tracks, including the music video "Spit it Out", apparently banned by MTV. <br /> <br /> Slipknot, for the uninitiated, is essentially a symphony of the damned: nine masked men who show total chaos on stage, with machine-gun drums, guitar squeak and voice that will rip your face off and they'll let you want more For those who have never seen Slipknot before, I can't recommend enough that you have this DVD ... probably on eBay or Amazon, so you can get a better deal. <br /> <br /> A brief but well done show of the knot. <br /> <br /> Seven out of ten.
