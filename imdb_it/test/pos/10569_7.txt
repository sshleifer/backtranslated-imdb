The historical drama is one of the areas where the British cannot be beaten. So, even if I'm not a big fan of the genre, I can usually be persuaded to look something like this if it's British and with decent actors. <br /> <br /> I've never read anything about Sarah Waters, which is obviously something I should do. So I really didn't know what to expect from this. I had heard that there would be a lesbian love affair, but not much more. While watching it, I found it much more interesting than I expected. Without saying too much, the plot twists are unexpected and well done. Although there have been many changes somewhere, it took me a minute to fix everything. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are good, the actors are very solid and the pace is decent, although I found it to be a little slow in the last half hour. This could just be me, I usually have a problem with movies that drag after the plot is more or less finished. All in all, this is a fairly pleasant three hours. I recommend it to anyone interested in historical dramas.
