This is without doubt one of the funniest and funniest movies I've ever seen. I really liked the characters in the movie. They are all wonderful in themselves. It's something I've never seen before in any movie. <br /> <br /> The story is almost unbroken from beginning to end. There are no boring moments. I was totally captured by the film. And I thought acting was great. <br /> <br /> So if you want to see a funny movie. You should look for The Green Butchers. A great movie. <br /> <br /> I give it 10/10
