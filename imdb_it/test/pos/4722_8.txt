While the film has its flaws, it highlights some of the problems that arise from living in a country that has no democracy. It empathizes with people under such a government and makes you want to learn more about their lives, their struggles and a potential leader Aung San Suu Kyi. We wonder why our government will interfere with places that are not wanted, ignoring those who ask for our help.
