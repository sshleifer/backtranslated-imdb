I'm not a film producer, but I know it's hard to tell a story in seven minutes and draw the audience into the character. Horses on Mars does this and more. When you watch a good movie, you don't want it to end. Here's how I felt about watching this movie. It is visually expansive and the microbe assumes such human qualities that make you feel traveling with him. <br /> <br /> We really can't wait to see what exciting adventures Mr. Anderson will take us in the future. Very well.
