A year later "Love Thy Neighbor" made its I.T.V. debut, followed the path of "On The Buses" and "Steptoe & Son" graduating on the big screen, in a photo by Hammer Films. It opens with an exciting patriotic speech that praises the virtues of the green and pleasant land of England, then cuts to a shot of Eddie and Bill as he walks down a street, fighting furiously. This turns into a strange sequence of black and white neighbors who vandalize their respective homes. At least the melody of the original theme is maintained (even if it is sung by someone other than Stuart Gillies). <br /> <br /> The local newspaper - "The Gazette" - holds a competition to find the best neighbors, the winners land on a Mediterranean cruise. Barbie suggests that Joan should come in. Is the fact that Bill and Eddie can remain friends long enough to win it? This is the main part of the plot. The film is largely episodic. A piece is removed directly from Season 1, ie Bill and Eddie going to the Club pretending to be in "union affairs". In reality they will see a stripper (not meeting two girls). Another part of the film has Bill, along with other workers from the black factory (he was the only one in the series), breaking a strike that Eddie helped to make with various tricks (including being smuggled through the gates in barrels of beer). While another (apparently inspired by Powell and Driver "For The Love Of Ada") sees Eddie's talkative mother (the magnificent Patricia Hayes) making friends with Bill's father (Charles Hyatt). <br /> <br /> The culmination of episode 1 Season 1 reappears in an expanded form. Bill once again puts on paint and a towel to terrorize Eddie, but his friends join him, and they dance around a drum containing a naked Booth, so they can pretend to cook and eat it. Eddie must then go home naked (surprisingly, there is less nudity here than there was in episode 2, Season 2). <br /> <br /> The film ends with the Reynolds and the cabins that win the love The Thy Neighbor race and the cruise together, but there is an unexpected twist involving Joan's crazy brother, Cyril (James Beck - "Private Walker" of "Dad's Army"), who works as an administrator. <br /> <br /> This is the typical sit-in movie of the 70s, with all the defects usually prevalent in these films. The laughter is scattered, and interest falls after about half an hour. The cast is enriched by familiar faces like Melvyn Hayes (cast as "Terry", a character from the first season Episode 2, played on that occasion by Leslie Meadows), Bill Fraser (as factory director), Anna Dawson, Andria Lawrence ( which seems to have been in every English comedy film of the 70s, mostly cast as nymphomaniacs), and Arthur English. The director, John Robins, was also responsible for the film "Man About The House". <br /> <br /> The funniest moment - while Eddie sleeps in a quiet part of the factory, Bill paints his face in black. The first who knows is when the manager's secretary screams in terror. The tables have been turned!
