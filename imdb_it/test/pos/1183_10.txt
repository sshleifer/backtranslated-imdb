For people like me who were born long after the late 1960s, we can only know the era through cultural artifacts, of which "Capelli" is one. This is certainly a well done tour de force. You can get an idea of ​​how things were going for the hippie culture. Probably the most impressive scene - at least for me - is when the group collapses the feast of rich people. As for the final scene of the film, it could be interpreted as the symbolic end of all that the 1960s represented. <br /> <br /> But no matter how you interpret this film, it is important to understand that even if the 1960s may have ended, the movements that characterize them still exist in small enclaves. It is a time that people will not soon forget. <br /> <br /> However, this film is one that I highly recommend. Milos Forman scored another great one here, right between his two masterpieces "Someone Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Ragtime" (so why did he do a piece of shit like "Man on the Moon"? With John Savage, Treat Williams and Beverly D'Angelo.
