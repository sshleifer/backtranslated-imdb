A few years ago, while I was renting some movies, I came across Subspecies 4, I ended up watching it and actually liked it, we need a good vampire movie that doesn't hold back. But when I returned to the video store, they told me they didn't have any other videos on Subspecies, unfortunately, the same happened to any other video store I checked. I gave up, until someone on youtube actually published all the films of Sottospecie and I got to watch them all last night and I'm passionate about it. Now I'm a fan of the Full Moon Subspecies series. I think that since this was the kind of horror film I was looking for, I have long been looking for a cheese scare and Subspecies has filled that place. Radu is one of the most fantastic vampires on screen and almost gives Nosferatu a run for his fangs! <br /> <br /> Radu is an evil vampire who searches for his bloodstone, his birth ritual, the stone contains absolutely incredible blood and gives it strength. Three American girls who are studying Romanian history and culture meet a man, Stephan, who offers to help. They stay at the Radu castle where we discover that Stephan is Radu's brother; Radu seduces and transforms two of the girls, but Stephan falls for one of the girls, Michelle, and will do anything to protect her. <br /> <br /> The subspecies is a fun series, despite the effects of cheese, it makes it in some ways more sympathetic. Also Radu was a perfect villain as Stephan was the perfect angel as a romantic vampire. The story is chilling and I think this was a fun vampire movie. This was also the first of the series, the best part is that the sequels are just as fun. I would recommend it for a scary movie night, watch it in the dark, Radu is sure to send shivers down your spine, or even your neck ... OK, cheesy joke, I couldn't resist. <br /> <br /> 7/10
