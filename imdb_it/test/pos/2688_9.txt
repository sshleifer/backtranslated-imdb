I think the problem with this show doesn't have the respect it really deserves is that it comes after Seinfeld, after ELR and after Friends. Those three sitcoms were the stars of their time. <br /> <br /> KOQs have come to the end of this special moment on TV. <br /> <br /> But don't be deterred. <br /> <br /> King of Queens is good if not better than two of the three mentioned. <br /> <br /> Seinfeld started it all and it was and is a timeless classic. I never laughed so much at Seinfeld. But the KOQs are really close. <br /> <br /> When it comes to laughing, I have to evaluate KOQ second only to Seinfeld. The ELR must be the second even if the creation and interaction of the characters are more appealing. <br /> <br /> In any case, the KOQs are the top ten of the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> The only other sitcom worth mentioning now are two and a half men who do not really hold a candle to the other four, but it is all that remains.
