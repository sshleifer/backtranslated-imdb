"Caribe" is not a masterpiece in any of its narrative aspects. However, it offers a perfectly pleasant story, along with a magnificent photograph. The narrative structure is based on two narrative axes, one of which incorporates the other, each with elements that refer and coexist in excellent harmony. History never loses the right rhythm, and shows an excellent mix between the human figure and its natural environment (which is a character in itself). The acting is exceptional, and for this we are indebted to the emerging director, Esteban Ram√≠rez. Furthermore, the characters are very well written and masterfully complex; so, once you are familiar with them, you can feel their feelings without them even saying anything. I can't say that I liked this photo because of all the hype it generated (in Costa Rica), but rather how it manages to show an interesting portrait of what happens when you interfere with people's life balance . We hope that Caribe establishes a reference for future projects in Costa Rica, as it is an excellent example of making a good film.
