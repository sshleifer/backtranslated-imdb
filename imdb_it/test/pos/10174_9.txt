Many funny scenes about people who normally don't pay attention in a movie and what they have to do to get a job and what happens once done. Lou Myers was a lot of fun as Half-Step Wilson. Every guy with a close group of friends can relate to many of the scenes unrelated to the film scattered throughout the film.
