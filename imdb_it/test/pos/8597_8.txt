Why is there so much angst among IMDb critics who hate this movie? It is not a masterpiece, but having seen it twice it has become a compelling drama set in the world of network TV. Robin Stone is the epitome of every Dan Rather, Phillip Stone and Brian What's-his-name on NBC. A mannequin of a man unable to love who succeeds professionally, but fails miserably in his personal life. I worked for eight (8) years in Robin Stone's network news and DO EXIST! <br /> <br /> The supporting cast works for me from Cannon (which can be annoying, but it's not in this movie) to Greene (who plays the right pathos) to Wexler (who marks how the young model in love with the image of Prince Charming and fails to reconcile that image with the real ugliness inside). Of note is also the ending that some critics of IMDb claim to be a cop-out. It is not! Listen to the song "He's Moving On" for the clues on the arc in which the character of Robin Stone travels that finally leads him to face his problems. He realizes that the answers are not based on the life he lived and the symbolic moves away from those to which he has associated himself, in the end he is perfect.
