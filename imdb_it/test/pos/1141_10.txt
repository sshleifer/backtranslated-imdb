I went to this movie having no idea what to expect. Actually I made an appointment in the theaters when it came out. We both enjoyed it a lot and helped someone discuss it after seeing it. <br /> <br /> I recommend seeing this movie only if you like non-mainstream films. It is not separated as a Liquid Sky or as imaginative as the forbidden zone. The original plot is very easy to follow. There is a lot of humor. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief summary of the plot if you are completely lost: an older brother type government keeps an eye on everyone in society. Suddenly a new person appears and there is no data on him (he seems crazy). It may or may not be the second coming of Christ. The overly cautious government is delirious to find it and discover its true motives. The sovereign is also obsessed with immortality. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are hectic while others are completely subdued. We follow the protagonist while meeting all the different types of people in society. <br /> <br /> I didn't need my conscience to be altered to enjoy the movie, but I know some of my friends helped him. <br /> <br /> Split was also filmed in Santa Cruz and San Francisco.
