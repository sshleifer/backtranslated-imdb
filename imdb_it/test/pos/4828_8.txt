This work is rather suggestive, with a couple of surprises some really gruesome elements. I found this work more rewarding than I initially expected, given the rotten reviews it receives here on IMDb. The dialogue appears natural and honest (given the circumstances), even if the general run of the film goes from predictable to cliché with the heroines falling when they should run, and investigating strange noises when they should close their doors. Typical horror dishes. <br /> <br /> Local characters are some of the worst clichés, depicting the Appalachian natives as monsters afflicted by development. The characters of children and principals are FANTASTIC! The development given is adequate, and Scout Taylor-Compton seems to be developing her talents quite well. <br /> <br /> Now, I will not say that this is completely original or the best thing after sliced ​​bread (which is not that great), but this is interesting and it was not long before I recovered my 107 minutes. I wouldn't say this is a fantastic movie anyway, but there are some really good horror elements here. But there are also some really slow points in which the plot / character development seems superfluous to the whim of the director (or director). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's good for a rainy night, but not so good for a Friday / Saturday viewing. <br /> <br /> Evaluate a 7.6 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
