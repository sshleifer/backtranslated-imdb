Although I feel strongly that SITR is the best film by Gene Kelly, but it's pretty good. I liked the music, the dance and the ending on how Gene took the girl. My favorite part is undoubtedly Gene's dance with her alter ego. I love watching two Gene Kells for the price of one. It shows how talented Mr. Kelly really was. It's a film that I think everyone should watch at least once in their life. So you didn't see him go out and try to see him today! I'm sure everyone out there has a friend of Gene Kelly who has this movie in his collection. So go to their home and pop popcorn and have fun!
