It was a sweet, introduction to the smartest sailor, Sailor Mercury. It consisted of a new "in croud", Merciurios. At first he wrote a love letter to Ami, who starwtling (obviously) and, now, Ami thiks is a chibi-Einstien, and is attractive (he ended up looking like Umino (Melvin)). This was a halarios (the scene of Minako "It's without skin from the neck" (HOT!)) Well, I really like the Bishojo Senshi Sailor Moon Series, personally I think it's the best anime ever!, But this movie was good , funny, but not as adventurous as Sailor Moon R- It was more like the movie "S". I saw this @ Sailor Moon Univewrse, with Real Player, and it was pretty good. (Overall)
