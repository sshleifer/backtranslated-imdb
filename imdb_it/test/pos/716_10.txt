I watch a lot of movies - DVDs, features and classics, you call it. The night I looked at JERICHO MILE, my wife (who had ordered it on the internet) said he remembered it since he was in high school, that he had stayed with her all these years. With a little reluctance I sat down (with our daughter and my son), and I was riveted from the opening sequence to the final titles. We all were. <br /> <br /> She, who remembered the original, and our boys (18 and 16) who had no idea what the movie was, couldn't believe it. Our favorite scene? Nothing to do, when Peter Strauss hits his fist so passionately and says, "I'd do it AGAIN!" He did not support violence because it was a defense crime, but it evoked so much intensity that we could not believe it ... when his cell mates gave him food to support his efforts, there was no dry eye in our house. <br /> <br /> Someone, please, make more movies like this. INCREDIBLE !!
