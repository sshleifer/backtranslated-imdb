When I went to see this movie I thought this would be another chic movie that I would have to endure with my sister. Also, Amanda Baynes' latest film wasn't so hot, which makes me doubt the movie because it's the lead actress. However within 5 minutes I was laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes, the jokes weren't "out there" that it took more then a second to figure it out but very funny. The script was not too complex and I could not understand the love triangle, but it was true to the original interpretation of Shakepeare. I loved every minute of it so much that I kicked a guy from two places away from me in a laugh lol !!! very embarrassing! I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie especially girls, since the guys in this movie are hot hot hot !! (lol), so much so that I could only have it on DVD.
