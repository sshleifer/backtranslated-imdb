30 years after the original film, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" was turned into a musical. Peter O'Toole and Petula Clarke starred in this wonderful remake of the beloved teacher, Chippington, who is called Chips by his beloved wife. <br /> <br /> O'Toole was excellent here and received another Oscar nomination. You have to ask yourself what Peter O'Toole must do to win an Oscar. He lost the coveted prize 8 times. You should also be amazed that you lost to John Wayne for "True Grit" in 1969, which was really a testament to Mr. Wayne's long career and popularity. This year was also marked by Richard Burton's great performances, "Anne of the Thousand Days", Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight for "Midnight Cowboy". <br /> <br /> Surprised to see Petula Clarke as Mrs Chippington. However, since this was a musical, a beautiful voice came along well and also made a nice acting piece. <br /> <br /> Who can forget the scene when Chips continues in the class despite the news that his loved one was killed in a bombing. He never could tell her the wonderful news of his pending promotion. <br /> <br /> Beautiful photography and music have only enriched a truly memorable experience.
