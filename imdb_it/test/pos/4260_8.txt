This film shows that the free enterprise system and the search for the almighty buck transcend all racial and ethnic barriers. Ultimately the market determines the message that is sent to the public. This film dramatizes that point. A conservative white-collar advertising company is taken over by a group of African Americans on the street, chaired by a no-frills black who wants to make a penny and believes he can sell products by telling the truth. But the film shows that, although it tries to do something different, the market and the political system demand that it conform, making it different from its predecessors. Interesting, off-beat film.
