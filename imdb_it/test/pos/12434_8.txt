"Gaming? Nicotine? Fisticuffs? We are moving in a downward spiral of iniquity!" Thus says the head of St. Swithen after inspecting the master's town in Nutbourne. St. Swithen's faculty and students were ordered to share facilities in Nutbourne to avoid German bombs during World War II. Then there is the masters' library. "The diary of Samuel Pepys? Abridged ... well, this is something to be grateful for. What is it here? Casanova's Memories? Wasn't the book we captured Jessica James reading in the closet? Decameron Nights! Well , really! What ever this place may or may not be, is not a place to bring carefully bred girls! "<br /> <br /> Yes, a terrible mistake was made by the Ministry of Education. Nutbourne is a school for kids. St. Swithen's is a school for girls. And what makes this one of the best British post-war comedies, the Nutbourne leader is Wetherby Pond ... played by Alastair Sim, while St. Swithen is Muriel Whitchurch ... played by Margaret Rutherford. <br /> <br /> "St. Swithen's?" says Pond. "Don't you mean that yours is a school for boys and girls?" asks one of the first girls. "Only girls," he says cheerfully. "It means, sir," asks one of the Nutbourne teachers, "what can we expect 100 girls?" "It means that not only the ministry made a mistake in sending a school here, but that it is guilty of a horrible sexual aberration!" <br /> <br /> Miss Whitchurch of Margaret Rutherford, positive and immovable as a warship, intends to make the most of it, if possible by encouraging Nutbourne briskly. Alastair Sim's Pond is exasperated to his big bald head and is determined to save his school. Meanwhile, there are 100 girls and 170 boys to feed and places found for them to sleep (along with all their teachers). The chefs and those who take care of you, totally dressed, come out. Miss Whitchurch and her girls, however, live up to their cooking duties. "Come on now, Angela," he says to a girl who is trying to mix something on a big plate, "didn't you make porridge before?" "Yes, but nobody has ever had to eat it." "It's a defeatist attitude, my dear. Mix well and don't shake." <br /> <br /> Things are going wrong when Pond discovers that four school governors hoping to drive are coming at any moment to see for themselves how well-led Nutbourne is. And Miss Whitchurch learns that four wealthy and influential parents have just arrived to see how their daughters are in the new free boy, he was told - facilities. The only solution? Miss Whitchurch and Pond, their teachers and their students, devise a class shift to give the allusion that Nutbourne has no girls and that St. Swithen has no boys. After the parents have inspected a dorm and left for a lesson, the girls in the beds slide under and the hidden boys jump into the beds, just as the governors enter. The boys are observed at rugby and, as soon as the governors turn their backs, the goal posts are pulled down, the lacrosse nets are set up, and just then the parents come over to watch the girls. A parent sees his daughter in a science class, then moments later he sees her in a choir practice, then moments later ... "Angela is back," she tells Miss Whitchurch. "Because it's like that," she replies, pushing her parents out to avoid the governors approaching around the corner. "The child is quite omnipresent." <br /> <br /> When we leave Nutbourne, everything has been discovered. The students are poking around. The teachers are stunned (except for two who are kissing). The ministry of education has just sent more busloads of students. The parents are speechless but the governors are not. "We are waiting for an explanation," he says abruptly. Pond holds his head and shudders. "Don't you see I'm trying to think of one." <br /> <br /> The film moves from one complicated and ridiculous situation to another, backed up by a very entertaining script and two incredibly comic performances by Rutherford and Sim. The exasperated exasperation of Sim and the relentless determination of Rutherford are so well matched that it is a pity that this is the only film they have ever made together. Joyce Grenfell, like Gossage, the tall, clumsy sports teacher of St. Swithen, gives them some competition. If you keep your eyes open, you'll also find funny references in the role of director Frank Launder, including a gong in Nutbourne that looks like a midget version of J. Arthur Rank, a faint echo of The Third Man's Cetra theme and a shot stolen from Oliver Twist by David Lean, except this time the boy approaches with the bowl of porridge and says: "Please, sir, I don't want any more". <br /> <br /> Frank Launder and his partner Sidney Gilliat were responsible for some of the best films produced in Britain in the thirties, forties and fifties. They wrote, produced and directed, sometimes doing one, sometimes the other. In one way or another they were responsible for top-quality films like Green for Danger (with a masterly performance of Sim), I See a Dark Stranger, The Lady Vanishes, Night Train in Munich, Wee Geordie, The Belles of St. Trinian's, The Rake's Progress and many others. With the happiest days of your life, Launder wrote and directed while both were produced. It is one of their best.
