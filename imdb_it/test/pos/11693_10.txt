This was an excellent movie! I saw him at the IFF in Karlovy Vary, in the Czech Republic, and he won a prize there. This is the first film I've ever seen from Jan (the director), and I was impressed. It's a great story of love and family. The film has a great balance of comedy, romance, drama and suspense all in one. I will not give away anything of the plot, but this is a well-made film, and I would watch it again if I had the chance! Cinematography / editing is great, the film runs smoothly, the characters are warm and are the type with which one can relate. I hope you can enjoy this movie like I did. If anyone knows where I can find him in the United States, or if he plans to release it on DVD any time soon, please let me know !!
