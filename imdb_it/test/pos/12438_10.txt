After a long run in the West End, this fascinating film has re-released Margaret Rutherford as the director "Miss Whitchurch" in this adaptation from the financial success achieved in 1950. <br /> <br /> All internal shots took place in the studios Riverside of Hammersmith, London. The exterior scenes were shot in a women's public school near Liss, Hampshire. During the 12-week shoot both Margaret Rutherford and Joyce Grenfell were staying at a nearby hotel and often visited the school during the evenings when they would happily have fun with the company of the real school owners. <br /> <br /> the script of the film contains only two original lines of the original, the protagonists and the secondary actors are in excellent shape and you can only feel sympathy for their situation, especially in the final scenes.
