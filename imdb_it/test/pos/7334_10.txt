I just watched this movie in Austin, Texas, at the Austin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, and it was my favorite festival. The gymnast is a film not to be missed. It's an honest story of "coming to terms" on relationships, self-discovery, growing old and having the courage to change and move forward. Not only is it a good story, but the glorious aerialist performances of Dreya Weber and Addie Yungmee will take your breath away! Watch this movie! He will soon be coming to a festival near you. This film deserved to be picked up immediately by a large network or studio. I will definitely buy it when it is available on DVD.
