A cleverly directed film by Martin Ritt in which a tramp and an antihero, John Cassevetes, lands in New York to escape a tragic accident in his life, where he killed his brother in a car accident, as well as being absent from the army . > <br /> Cassavetes, always an intense actor, shows the determination in his interpretation of a film. I'm surprised that Montgomery Clift didn't get this part. <br /> <br /> Ruth White is her mother and does exceptionally well in two scenes over the phone. <br /> <br /> Once in New York, he makes friends with Sidney Poitier while the two work on the docks. Immediately, Jack Warden, a bully and villain in this film, doesn't like it and the tragedy occurs when Poitier tries to defend his friend. <br /> <br /> Ruby Dee, plays Poitier's wife in this film, and is brilliant in a scene in which he pushes Cassavetes to reveal her husband's murderer. <br /> <br /> This is definitely an interesting film of moral values ​​and the solitary in society. With the background of the buildings, the film shows the right mood.
