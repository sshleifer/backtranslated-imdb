There's only one movie I can think of that could be better or better than this when it comes to Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck - ALI BABA BUNNY. However, determining which is the best is irrelevant - just look at them both and enjoy them. <br /> <br /> I compared this with ALI BABA BUNNY because they both play Daffy in its worst ever - greedy, naughty and very funny in the process. Anyway, I think I prefer RABBIT SEASONING simply because Bugs is also pretty awful in this - doing horrible things back to Daffy whenever Daffy plays a bad joke. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Daffy leaving the rabbit track to Bugs hole in the hope that a hunter (of course, Elmer) will shoot the rabbit and leave Daffy alone! Not to be outdone, Bugs always uses all of Daffy's tricks and makes them turn - and in most cases involves Daffy being shot in the face! It's all very, very smart and fun and I don't care how old you are, this cartoon will make you laugh unless you're a grumbler. In particular, I love the grand and unexpected ending, but I won't say anything else, because I don't want to spoil the surprise.
