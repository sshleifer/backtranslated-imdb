This is a real gem of a TV movie. Based on a completely false story, it follows the course of the football club around the world through their course in the FA English cup, where chaos ensues and the players have all the styles of the seventies. The ending is unexpected, the performances are great and Nick Hancock proves that PU CAN do something different from sports shows. My only regret is that I didn't register it.
