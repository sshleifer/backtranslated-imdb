Alexander Lou, star of classics like "The Super Ninja" and "Mafia vs Ninja", the titles here in this fun martial arts festival. <br /> <br /> The plot involves the evil Abbott White (who boasts some humongous and frankly frightening, white-looking eyebrows) enlisting the help of a ninja clan to overthrow the Shaolin Temple. <br /> <br /> It achieves this goal and also cancels most of its members, although needless to say, one or two can survive and rather foresee, predictably, the final revenge on the unbeliever Abbott. <br /> <br /> .... Ok, so the plot is not exactly pushing the envelope in terms of creativity, but someone is watching a movie with a title like "Wu Tang vs Ninja" or "The Ninja Hunter" is really important for a factor as irrelevant as a plot? Obviously not! - They are the fights that count in these films and with chewing gum - you claim your money here! There are some superbly choreographed martial arts on display from all those involved in this and rarely a minute seems to pass without fighting for some reason. <br /> <br /> If you are completely in martial arts movies then this is a must see!
