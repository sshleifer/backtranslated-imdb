I understand that "Checking Out" will probably be released in US cinemas in June 2006 and on DVD in November 2006. My recommendation is not to miss "Checking Out" !! This film comedy will entertain everyone, which will cover all the characters, family relationships and the many social problems that are represented. "Checking Out" will make you laugh all the time with a quick and intelligent humor built into almost all the lines, and could make you weep touchingly even in a touching way. <br /> <br /> The subject of suicide is treated comically, which at the same time can help people consider understanding the impacts this act can have on those who have touched their lives and those who love them. We hope that "Checking Out" can have a positive impact and help prevent those who think about acting suicide, especially in the group between the ages of 16 and 25 who has the highest suicide rate in the United States. <br /> <br /> The script is wonderfully written, perfectly cast and loaded with synchronicity and significant flashbacks over time, whose meaning becomes more evident throughout the film and especially at the end. I think the script is worthy of an Oscar nomination for "Best Screenplay, Play to a Movie" (The Phoenix Film Festival honored "Checking Out" with a "Best Screenplay Award"). <br /> <br /> The cast is loaded with great actors who act alone, and have a long experience of great shows, acting nominations and winnings. I feel that Peter Falk's performance in "Checking Out" is worthy of an Oscar nomination, and is the most challenging and extensive of his career. Laura San Giacomo's performance and chemistry with Peter Falk as her father is masterful, and was recognized at the Palm Beach International Film Festival with a "Best Actress Award". <br /> <br /> Even the film's teenage characters shine and are played by young acting actors Dan Byrd (Film: A Cinderalla Story with Hilary Duff, 3 young artist nominations, won 1) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (TV : Monster Island, Wolf Lake, Passions, Touched by an angel; 2 Young Star Nomination). <br /> <br /> Director Jeff Hare and producer Mark Lane wonderfully develop the characters, their interrelations and the plot of this fun, entertaining but complex script. <br /> <br /> The editing of the film keeps up the pace of the fast-moving film, slowing down only appropriately in the moving scenes, so that the audience never loses interest from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie that you can take the whole family to see and everyone will love it.
