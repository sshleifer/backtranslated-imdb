Paul Naschy, as a spooky security guard, is scarier than most of his werewolf robes with fur and shoes. The story is not unknown, a group of children who go to party in an abandoned school. The fact is that one of these fathers did the same thing years ago, but has now passed away, and the last group of boys seems to be reviving an event 23 years ago. This is quite well done for films of this type, and there is an air of mystery to what is happening because apparently what happened to children before is a bit of a mystery and perhaps the truth has not been revealed. So no, not just your standard slices and nuts. This moves in a pretty good clip and doesn't let you lose interest like many movies do, and the weird story is compelling enough to get you interested too, and there's some suspense missing in many movies these days. The finish is rather abrupt and I suppose it is mainly left to your imagination, but even in this case it is not even welcome. 7 out of 10, take a look.
