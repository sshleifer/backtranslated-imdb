it would be a shame if one had not yet seen speed racing, dubbed or subtitled (I prefer the dubbed version (which is rare) because it was fun ... in a good way). what is nice about speed racer is that you are never too old to watch it. go red and yellow !! I saw it for the first time when I was about seven and enjoyed listening to the catchy opening. he disappeared for a while, then I saw him again a couple of months ago (I'm 19). imagine the feeling of nostalgia that rises, singing "here comes, here comes speed racer! is a demon on wheels ~~~" again and again. however, the concept of mach 5 has generated so many "ultra-multi-function special cars", but no one has been able to overcome his genius in construction. the other cars seemed too much. and it wasn't just the different bosses' contests or fights that made him interesting to me. was the mysterious character of racer-x and how the world of speed racer has practically "happened" to revolve around it. they did some tweaking for some manga story lines, but everything turned out pretty well. although I can't remember if the show actually revealed how the racer-x looked, in the manga, they did.
