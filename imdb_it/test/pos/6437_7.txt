I saw this film for the first time when I was about 6 years old - my grandmother thought it would be a good movie for children to entertain me and keep me busy ... anyway, every time I saw it I had nightmares the same night. Yes, it masquerades as a children's film, but even now I find it really obscure in places, especially the disturbing music that is played every time the guardian angel woman is on the screen, and her voice and rather hypnotic eyes. The real "villains" of the film, or sharks, Mr. Grimes, etc. They didn't scare me at all, I always found the whole movie rather disturbing and obscure. This is obviously something I can appreciate now that I'm 21, but speaking from experience there's no way to show it to my kids!
