There have been many excellent comments on this film and I want to add my voice to the praise. Yul Brynner has never been more attractive. His major Surov was compelling. Your eyes can't leave the screen when it's on. This is his film. This is by no means the rest of the cast which was also exemplary, especially Deborah Kerr and Anne Jackson. Being mostly stage actors, they brought many nuances to their performances. For example, I've seen this movie at least 4 times, but this is the first time I've noticed the reaction of the German girl when she came face to face with a Russian soldier. Although he was not threatening, his utterly hysterical reaction made me realize that he must have been in Germany after World War II and that he had probably been raped by a group from the Red Army. The possibility of discovering deeper layers of history that may be just below the surface makes me want to see this fascinating film again and again. Please put it on DVD.
