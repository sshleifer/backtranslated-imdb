This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Jason Shepherd, a 14-year-old boy, wrote an essay in English called "Big Fat Liar". When his skateboard was taken, he had to use his sister's bike to get to college on time and hit a limousine. When he entered the limousine, he met a famous Hollywood producer, Marty Wolf. When he left the limousine, he forgot one thing: his card! So he was taken by Marty Wolf and turned Jason's English card into a movie! When Jason admitted leaving his sheet in the limousine and that Marty took it, his parents and his English teacher didn't believe him! So Jason and his friend Kaylee had to fly to Los Angeles to go to Hollywood to admit that Marty had stolen his story from Jason's parents. When Jason told Marty to call his father that Marty stole that sheet, Marty tricked him and burned his paper! Jason got so angry that Marty burned that sheet so Marty called security to get Jason out of his site! Jason and Kaylee realized that Marty would not admit the truth. To bring Marty down in Phase 2: The Takedown, Jason and Kaylee put a permanent blue dye in the pool and when Marty jumps in, his body gets all blue and doesn't come off! Then they put the permanent orange dye in Marty's shampoo and when he uses it, his hair all turns orange and doesn't come off either! In the end, they put a lot of glue on Marty's headset to get him to call Jason's father and when Marty uses it, he sticks to his ear! It was fun when Marty's hair and body turn blue and orange and the headphones are glued to her ear! After that, they tricked Marty by telling Monty, who is Marty's assistant, that Duncan moved into a house where there's a party going on. When Marty went to see Duncan, he was in the wrong house and all the kids at the party beat him! When Marty was at home, Jason and Kaylee changed the controls of his car. When Marty drove his car, he knew that all the controls had been switched and he didn't know which button to press. He's stupid enough to believe it. When Marty hit the back of the spiker, the Mason destroyed his car! It was so funny. So Marty starts calling Jason's father and tricked him again! He was on the phone, but he wasn't his father, he called security! After security brought Jason and Kaylee out of Marty's site, they suggested they go home. Monty would have been on Jason's and Kaylee's side because he knew that Marty was a liar and an asshole so he told Rocco, who is one of the security guards who will take care of the children. Jason told his father the truth about what he did in the last 2 days and brought his parents to L.A. When Monty came to the children, he will help the children move into Phase 4: The Payback. Jason divides the crew into 3 teams for Phase 4. A team will distract and deceive Marty until Jason's parents arrive on set. Marty drove with Frank Jackson for the first time, but his car broke down, so he drove with Jaleel, but took him to the desert and left him there. When Marty was in the desert, a helicopter came to rescue him. After that, one of the blades is blocked, so Marty and the pilot got out of the helicopter. After that, he was on his way to the set and when Jason saw it, Marty stopped and saw what Jason has: his monkey! So Marty went after Jason and Kaylee and when they saw Lester, he let go of the water and when the water came, he pushed Marty away. Marty was still behind the boys and when Kaylee went the other way, Jason led Marty to the top of the apartment building. At the top, Jason was challenging Marty by making him admit the truth and Marty would never tell the truth. When the crew surprised Marty, all the people including Jason's parents on the set knew what Marty was doing. Marty was about to kill Jason, but the only way to escape from Jason is to jump off the top! After that, his parents believed that Marty had taken his story. When the people who were on the set left, this is the end of Marty. In the end, Jason's story, Big Fat Liar was a movie. I just can not get enough.
