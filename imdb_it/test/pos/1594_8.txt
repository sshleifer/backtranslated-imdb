ATTENTION: SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Even if at times the film has moved a bit slow, the brilliant scenery, the richness of the characters and the powerful themes make `Death in Venice 'a rewarding experience. I have not read the book by Thomas Mann, but I am sure that the visual splendor, the musical score and the powerful evocation of Visconti's conflicts and desires must make it justice. <br /> <br /> Gustav von Aschenbach's study alludes to the human tendency to rationalize and quantify our emotions, behaviors and passion. This tendency is shown in the scene in Germany between Alfred and Gustav when Alfred describes music as mathematics - that is. quantifiable - and emotional. This conflict arises again in the scene where the young Tadzio is alone playing "Fuer Elise" in the lobby of the Hotel and Gustav remembers his visit to a brothel where he is attracted by a prostitute who plays the same song. In his flashback, after paying the prostitute, Gustav is clearly taken by the consequences of his actions. This reaction serves as a reminder of the moral reaction to the temptations that Tadzio represents. <br /> <br /> In the end, Gustav is forced to make his biggest decision: stay in Venice and resign himself to his lusts and temptations? Or run away from Venice to save one's life? His first attempt to flee Venice to the train station led to futility and foreshadowed the result of prolonging his stay. <br /> <br /> Complimenting the captivating interaction between the characters, Visconti's powerful scenery (especially of Venice at Dawn and the final scene of Tadzio walking in the water and pointing to the horizon) makes this film a real masterpiece.
