Mighty Like A Moose is one of many short films that director Leo McCarey played with Charley Chase. What a dandy it is! Charlie and his wife both undergo plastic surgery to improve their horrible appearances without each other's knowledge. They then meet at a party and hit each other. Now they can't afford each other to find out they're cheating. This is the absurd premise of this frenetic farce. Vivien Oakland, one of the few short film comedians who have a thriving career long after the silent ones, is perfect as Charley's long nose wife. Charley has a horrible case of buck teeth, which are quickly shipped to the dentist. After a team was searched by the police for no other reason, to practice raid, Charley and his wife frantically try to avoid themselves at home for fear that changes in appearance are known. Both were photographed with their new features at the party. The hilarity at home culminates with Charley trying to teach non-good-cheating with his wife a lesson. The no-good-nick of course is the new Charley, who his wife realizes long before Charley teaches a loyalty lesson. This is one of the best efforts of Charley Chase. *** of 4 stars.
