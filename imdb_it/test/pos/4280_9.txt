Those who do not like this film seem to think that a loved one somehow "belongs" to them and should be discarded if they leave with someone else. Fortunately, human nature is much deeper than that; loving someone deeply inevitably leads to suffering, even if we are lucky only to die. <br /> <br /> This film is true for setting, atmosphere and dialogue with Nigel Balchin's original novel ('A Way Through The Wood'), and identifying an apparently irreconcilable dilemma captures the peaceful desperation behind many apparently idyllic lives (and the depiction of country life in the upper English classes is very accurate). <br /> <br /> I loved the movie and I hope it looks like a UK compatible DVD soon
