For those of you looking for the crazy acrobatics that characterized a silent comedy by Harold Lloyd, this is not the film for you. What The Cat's-Paw offers us is an interesting and atypical character for Lloyd who was trying to impose himself on sound. <br /> <br /> For me the comparison of the film closest to Lloyd's character is that of Peter Sellers in Being There. For all the education that Lloyd received in dealing with the world, he may have been raised in isolation as was Sellers. <br /> <br /> But where he grew up he was the son of a missionary in China and I don't know how much Christianity he and his family were able to teach the Chinese, but the young Harold learned the wisdom of the Chinese philosopher Lin Po citing constantly as a fortune cookie aphorism. Apparently, Lin Po turns out to be a sage. <br /> <br /> In any case, Lloyd's father, Samuel S. Hinds, decided that his son needs education in the modern world of 20th century America and refers him to being the guest of the pastor of the home church that sponsors the mission. The pastor is the perennial candidate of the "reform" movement of that city of Stockport. But as soon as Lloyd arrives and the pastor dies. <br /> <br /> Now the reform movement is a fiction and the pastor is a patsy of political leaders who need a straw man opponent in every election. They decide that Lloyd could only be a better patsy than the boy who just died. <br /> <br /> Of course, as in this type of film, Patsy proves not to be such an easy proposal. In fact, Lloyd was constantly quoting from Lin Po, the way Charlie Chan used to dispense wisdom proves the opponent enough for the criminals who run Stockport. In addition, Lloyd gets the admiration of Una Merkel, cynical like the lady of Jean Arthur in Mr. Deeds and Mr. Smith. <br /> <br /> The Cat's-Paw is still a nice political satire even though it has not established Harold Lloyd as a great comic name like in silent films. A beautiful cast of players was selected by director Sam Taylor topped by George Barbier, who plays a political leader who discovers Lloyd and actually proves to have a vein of honesty in him.
