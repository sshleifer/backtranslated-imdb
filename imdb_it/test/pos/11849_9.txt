I ran into the lair this morning during the scene where Ed was engaged to 3-Way and I thought my wife was catching some morning porn! To my surprise it caught my attention and I rewound it and started watching it at 4:30 am! That plot and script is very funny, rich, fun and well developed. We really had so much fun, my wife who shared the experience with her girlfriends at work! Going ahead to recommend it and to say that "a kick" got from it. I am in my last 40s and she in her early 50s. I think this film is suitable for young and old. An unexpected surprise, very pleasant. Good job! Thank you! Two thumbs up!
