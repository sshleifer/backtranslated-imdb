This three-hour Chinese epic, set in 220 BC, could ultimately be a familiar theme of the idealist dream of the emperor of peace through the unification that turns into corrupt isolation, and there is nothing intrinsically problematic in the film , but it is a compelling narrative, full of intrigue and passion and betrayal and epic events told with vivid strokes. Even for those who are not attracted to such historical shows for their own interest, it is a surprising feast for the eyes: the scene that represents the Marquis's attempted shot is one of the most impressive evocations of physical space and memory grandeur and the battle scenes are memorable both in their scope and their immediacy. The title sums up the film's use of compelling contrasts: huge plain panoramas centered on intimate horrors; the most noble of the reasons against the most degraded; I hope to turn into dust. If you've never seen a three-hour Chinese epic, this wouldn't be a bad place to start.
