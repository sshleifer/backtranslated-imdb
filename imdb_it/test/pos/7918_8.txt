It is important to realize that Eisenstein was a committed Marxist filmmaker who possessed some very specific and particular theories about what the film could achieve, and how. <br /> <br /> It is simply idle to compare Alexander Nevsky negatively with anything a similar period in the United States; this film comes from the oldest film school in the world, from another continent, from a completely different approach to cinema. <br /> <br /> To appreciate this film a little more, try to find out the editing theories of Pudovkin and Kuleshov for example, or read the Wikipedia entry on Marxist Film Theory. If you feel really audacious, you might even investigate the triadic forms of the Hegelian dialectic. <br /> <br /> It follows that if you watch this movie without understanding Eisenstein's ideas and ideals, you probably won't get it. In Alexander Nevsky the main characters are not interpreted alone, they are thought to be distilled of the character of their nation. Nevsky and his generals are deliberately shown to be larger than life, because they represent the stylized and heroic aspects of the entire Russian people. <br /> <br /> The acting is not wooden, it is made to be slightly mannered. It represents a completely different school from the more naturalistic narrative style that Hollywood was rapidly adopting. Eisenstein's films are designed in particular * not * to be realistic. If something seems a bit "obvious", be it an actor's lighting, language or pose, it is bound to be like this. Eisenstein was one of the first proponents of cinema as an art form, not just as entertainment. <br /> <br /> If the montage sometimes seems to consist of a clash of images, well, that's the idea. The shots are intended to oppose, Eisenstein's films contain and embody elements of a political / philosophical argument, namely the Marxist dialectic. <br /> <br /> So sit down, yell for Russia and its defenders of the folk hero, boo to the noble cowards and invaders of Teuton, and enjoy the difference.
