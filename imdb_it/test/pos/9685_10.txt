This film was at the limit in a rough humor ... I absolutely can't believe these people can get away with it. Johnny Knoxville didn't cross the finish line ... he was trampling everything! This was better than the first ... ALL THE WAY! The thing I found on the first film was that shenanigans were a bit like being on t.v. to exhibit. NOT THIS TIME !!! they jumped 180 degrees ... the whole cast is so great at what they do and they weren't crazy acrobatics ... but the music basically fit every situation ... GOOD JOB !!!! When you go to see this make sure you use the bathroom before going to the theater, keep your stomach strong and remember not to let your drink spray your nose ...
