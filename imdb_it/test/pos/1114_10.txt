Speaking of the characteristics of the competition at the Split film festival, we have titles from all over the world. China, Korea, Canada, the United States and Australia, and many of these stories indicate that the world is indeed a valley of tears. Modern love ... that's for sure. <br /> <br /> In that film by Alex Frayne, two young married men and their boyfriend are traveling from the city to the coast to visit the tomb and the home of the uncle of the man who raised him long ago and who is died in mysterious circumstances. The coastal village looks like something out of an American horror film where the village is bizarre and people are uncommon mutants. But the episodes of Alex Frayne's shepherdess cannot be described as horror in the normal way. In reality, this is an extremely interesting drama in which we see relationships and horror through flashbacks and much more. In this story and through the obviously psychological facets of the actors we are shown a peep show of the film, a fascinating and eccentric Australian film. This is the case with Frayne. Always something new and fresh. The visual intelligence and unique sensitivity of some Australian directors are surprising. Frayne's film is super. There is something in the Australian landscape that shows their films as special as we saw in FRAYNE's Modern Love and in RAY's films Lawrence Lantana and Jindabyne. <br /> <br /> It looks like it will be the same in future Alex Frayne titles.
