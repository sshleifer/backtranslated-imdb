One of the best war movies I've ever seen, if not the best. It is very difficult to talk about films of this type, since it is very difficult to point to any cinematic error. The "problem" is how it seems too real and from this it takes you to the ruins of Stalingrad and make you suffer for both sides. This is for the reason that this film unlike most Hollywood movies does not glorify the war or heroism of the main characters. Instead, the film makes them heroes only because they are human and that's why it's anti-war as much as reason can offer. Extremely convincing war scenes and such impressive acting, most of the scenes resemble isolated theatrical pieces. Furthermore, the German army is interpreted by Germans who are so convincing. The film is produced and made by the Germans where you can see their love for detail to perfection. This is why "Stalingrad" is one of the films that I can see millions of times and that I never feel boring. I saw the film with my father who fought in World War II and the first thing he said was, "This is true, that's how the war against the Germans seemed." This is where you can see what a soldier looks like in the worst nightmare of war in human history and at the turning point of World War II: Stalingrad.
