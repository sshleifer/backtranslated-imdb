Where do I start? I saw this movie for the first time in 1995 and I had no idea what to expect, I was at that moment looking for films in which Elijah Wood had acted and this was highly recommended. I sat down and watched the movie once and didn't know what to think. I looked at it a second time a few days later and the doors have just opened. Never before in my life had I ever really cried while watching a movie, and I was babbling, every minute and the maximum the film I was riding alongside, on an emotional roller coaster. <br /> <br /> It has struck such an emotional chord in me on many levels, the intense sadness and euphoria we see in the film, the wonder and innocence of childhood, the desire of a time that it was once, but it's gone. More than anything else, this film reminded me of my childhood (except for the abuse) during a period of my life when I had shaken off my childhood a few years earlier and hadn't even noticed it, I had given up and I moved to a life entirely without it. The radio leaflet made me wake up and suddenly realize what I had given up without even realizing it. From that day forward I immediately started changing my life and myself, and I did it. <br /> <br /> This will seem trivial but basically I rediscovered my inner child, I started a journey that has been going on for the last 6 years and changed me so much, so much for the best, embracing and living that part of myself. I discovered who I really am. I don't think it was simply the case of the right film that comes at a crucial moment in my life, The Radio Flyer really did something very special, and I still consider it an incredible job in all respects, an incredible film. <br /> <br /> In closing I cannot fail to mention the music. I'm a big fan of Hans Zimmer and this is one of his most beautiful works. The vastness and depth of the emotional expression that he put into the soundtrack of this film is a huge part of what makes the film what it is for me. Like the subtitles of a film in a foreign language, its slender music is a card for the intense emotions that this film will take you through. Find the soundtrack at all costs, it was sadly erased a long time ago, I never expected to find it, but incredibly, after chatting with someone I met on a guest book by Hans Zimmer. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, let yourself experience the emotions, don't get bogged down in trivial finals, be that kid again
