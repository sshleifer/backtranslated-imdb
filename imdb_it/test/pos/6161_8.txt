This is such a beautiful film! Not only does it represent war, it also has friendship and love. Slama's life is full of sadness, every aspect of her life has collapsed. I can only imagine how he would feel when his friend makes the maximum sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I see a slight resemblance to "Pearl Harbor", which also concerns two pilots who fall in love with the same woman. However this film is much nicer, because this does not represent the unfaithful and accommodating woman. The friendship between the two men is also much more convincing and well constructed. I highly recommend this film to all people.
