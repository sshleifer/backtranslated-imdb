The idea is not original ... If you have already seen this type of story, you would know what the ending will be after looking for the first twenty minutes ... the script, the positioning of the actors and the projection is too obvious ... If you've never seen a story like that, it's definitely a nice experience, you'll have fun at the end at the end ... don't forget to watch it again after knowing the "truth", you'll do it even more I like plots .. Even if at first I have a correct assumption, I could not continue to attach myself to my place until the end ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: a must see! ! This from Korea is better than any recent movie of the genre from Japan ... forget Hollywood! <br /> <br /> Don't miss it !!
