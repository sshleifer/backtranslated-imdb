The NYT review says that the character of Sigourney Weaver is tense and frustrated and, later, that she could be the sister of the MTM character in Ordinary People. What? There's no way. This lady was extravagant from the beginning. NOTHING like MTM in ordinary people. Sorry. <br /> <br /> Subsequently, the NYT goes on to say that Sandy Travis of Sigourney Weaver and Ben Travis of Jeff Daniel are 40, "children of the '60s". Mrs. Weaver has to dance a jig. I think he was 55 when he created Imaginary Heroes. She was born in 1949. Apart from the corrections to the perception of New York, this was a pretty good film considering that it was created by someone so young. Obviously Sigourney Weaver thought so, and so did Jeff Daniels. The young man who played Tim was exceptional. <br /> <br /> There are some critical comments I could make about the script. For example, I never really understood why Sandy Travis lost her son. His kind of blown behavior was perhaps triggered by his death, but that behavior lasted Â¾ of the way the film seemed to me to have more to do with his stagnation marriage, his relationship with Tim, and where it came from indeed, and other unresolved issues, that from every mourning of his eldest son. Ben's mourning was much clearer. <br /> <br /> So Matt Travis was an asshole. Did your mother think so too? Still, a very watchable movie. What is becoming clearer and clearer is not that there are no roles for women beyond a certain age, rather than what is needed is a director like this to be so clearly in love with an old woman (Mrs. Weaver) and almost making his film is a tribute to her. A kind of anti-Woody Allen.
