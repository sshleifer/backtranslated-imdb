This is a really beautiful and beautiful film. The underlying theme of this film is the innocent child (Heather Graham as Joline) who struggles to express her naive desires about how the world should make sense while being ceaselessly beaten by the real world. It's not an unhappy movie, though - just the opposite. It's a funny film with a sad side, but just thinking about the film makes me feel so happy. Near the beginning of the film, the beautiful and vulnerable Joline confronts an addict who tries to break into her friend's car. She reasons with him, convinces him to ask for help and gives him $ 30 as a start. At the end of the film he reappears to pay her back, explains that he is drugged, he is fine, and he thanks her. I can hear the cynics groaning. Of * course * that never really happened. This film does not take place in the real world. It takes place in the world we wanted to live in. The sad part is realizing that we don't live there. The happy part is knowing that there are people who want.
