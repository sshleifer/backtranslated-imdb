This is an interesting film. I think it's very funny, even if the humor is very black. Fulci is good and fun to play himself, he is a "self-portrait" of a really funny and really crazy artist ("I make horror films, if I made love films no one would buy tickets ..."). And it is also the SEXY film: Almost always there is a bit of "action" or current tension; and many sexy girls / women ... Maybe he goes to the heart of why someone starts making films / art in the first place ... It's a real psychedelic journey, perhaps better seen a little drunk or some similar mental state. There are also really bad gore scenes, of course, because it's Lucio Fulci. In fact, some of those scenes are rather disgusting. However it is one of the three best and most complete Fulci films I've seen (the others are House By The Cemetery & Zombi. I haven't seen The Beyond). In fact, the script is, in my opinion, too brilliant. You could see this film as a portrait of an extreme neurotic or a person suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (fashionable words): the character has a compulsive need to confess "crimes" or bad thoughts; Especially for the crimes that did not even FACT. And he continually questions himself: what if I did? What happens if I want to do it? I did it? I want do it? He overreacts and exaggerates his thoughts. I'm sure Fulci was interested in psychology and maybe even reading something about the area; in his "House By The Cemetery" -movie for example there is a character named Freudstein. This is perhaps the most concentrated and directly personal Fulci film. I also like the simplicity of photography / images in this film. The only thing that bothers me a little is sadism, especially towards women; I don't completely understand why? Is it entertainment? Is it art? Is it horror? However and overall, this is a really interesting and well made movie, definitely recommended for the classic movie at least for fans or anyone interested in this genre. It may be too much for others.
