I saw this version about a decade ago, and I've been looking for it ever since. I recently found an original VHS version and bought it for $ 125.00. It sounds crazy, but if you, like me, consider it one of the best that the Broadway musical stage has ever produced, you wouldn't think twice. <br /> <br /> Because, it's just a bit too expensive for a ticket for Broadway today. I really hope they release it soon in DVD format. It's a piece of musical theater that screams to be seen by everyone!
