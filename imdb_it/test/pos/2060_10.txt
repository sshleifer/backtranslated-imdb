I feel extremely sad for some of the people who reviewed this film. It is clear that their standards are so high that they will never be able to enjoy a movie just for fun. Or, perhaps, their enjoyment derives from the act of choosing films separately; look for some reason not to like him? <br /> <br /> The Long Kiss Goodnight is an action movie, in every sense. Sure, there are holes in the plot big enough to drive a semi-final, but none of them is enough to stop the flow of the film itself. I've never been a big fan of Geena Davis, but I was impressed by how she was able to create two very different characters, Samantha Cain and Charlie Baltimore. In my opinion, it wasn't even necessary to have changed his physical appearance to distinguish between the two ... his acting was more than enough to do the trick. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, however, this film was by Craig Bierko. In the hands of another, the character of Timothy could have been just another interchangeable villain. His decision to interpret it with a more casual approach was the right counterpoint to all the action scenes. It is not often that you find an actor who can express himself so well only with his facial expressions ... in case: the scene in the freezer with Charlie and his daughter. Where most of the films would have cluttered the moment of "revelation" with useless dialogues, Bierko's eyes told the whole story. <br /> <br /> The basic plot? Subtle, to be honest. An apparently average housewife suffering from amnesia slowly discovers that she was a murderer. As his memory returns, so do the people who want to kill the killer. Is it really Samantha, the housewife who makes cookies or Charlie, the cold-blooded killer? Or maybe a little of both? For me, The Long Kiss Goodnight was a pleasant journey to discover.
