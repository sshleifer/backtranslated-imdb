So many early British sound films that I've seen on video suffer from poor print transfer quality or poor sound or both. Fortunately, I was able to get a copy of this film on a video of excellent quality, allowing me to focus on the story itself. <br /> <br /> And, an excellent story has been. At first glance, passengers on the ill-fated bus seemed a pretty boring lot (except for the always adorable Jessie Matthews). But as the film returned to showing each passenger's story the day before the accident, I discovered that the cast, contrary to the initial appearance, was a talented group of artists, cleverly directed to bring true individuality to their distinctive characterizations. <br /> <br /> Spectators may have different preferences about which two passengers will encounter a tragic end and which will survive. But the film contains your interest as it keeps you guessing. This film deserves a much wider audience - a true gem of early British cinema.
