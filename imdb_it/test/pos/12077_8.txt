I was still living with my parents when they were shown on Dutch TV. It was usually me watching movies with the other who didn't care. But somehow we sat down and watched this movie. This type of film was aired Wednesday night. It is the story of a woman who will die soon. But before dying, she wants to make sure that her (many) children have the best adoptive parents possible. So we were watching this and my father (the most emotional of the four of us) started crying. I followed him almost immediately and soon my sister and my mother also broke up. Here we are, totally moved by this simple but heartbreaking story. If you want a good cry, this is the one for you!
