"The Couch Trip" by Michael Ritchie is a wonderfully anarchic comedy about what makes a good psychiatrist. It is so subtle and evil that you begin to understand what a biting satire really is. It is also the best film by Dan Akyroyd, made for him in a particularly beautiful film year (1988). First, "The Great Outdoors" and now this. <br /> <br /> Akyroyd plays John Burns, a career scammer who simulates the madness of escaping from prison. Now, a stupid play would only be on this. But "The Couch Trip" uses this as a springboard for everything else. Beverly Hills psychiatrist, George Maitlin (subtly hilarious Charles Grodin) has a nervous breakdown and a replacement is selected: Lawrence Baird, who happens to be Akyroyd psychiatrist! You can pretty much guess what's going to happen, but the nice thing about "The Couch Trip" is not what happens, but how it's done. <br /> <br /> "The Couch Trip" gives Dan Akyroyd the best role he has ever had. His John Burns is one of the truly original comic creations in the history of cinema. A thug and physical humor are part of it, but what makes it special is that Akyroyd makes Burns a lovable character. We root for him and we appreciate him very much during the 98 minutes of execution. <br /> <br /> But Akyroyd is not alone here. It gets strong support from other great comedians. Walter Matthau joins hilarity as the scam's minister who captures the secret of Burns and makes an elegant blackmail. Charles Grodin "burns slowly" his way to another great comic role like the burned psychiatrist. Grodin was one of Hollywood's most underrated actors. It is criminal that they have not used it more often. Richard Romanus interprets Grodin's evil lawyer to perfection. <br /> <br /> "The Couch Trip" is one of the many films made by the now-dead Orion Pictures Corporation currently invisible. MGM spent a fortune buying the Orion bookstore, but has yet to cash in its acquisition. "The Couch Trip" combines "Dressed to Kill", "Blow Out" and countless others in the collection of rotting dust in the vault. Shame on MGM for their inaction. We hope that, with the new management, "The Couch Trip" will find the public and the respect it deserves. <br /> <br /> **** on 4 stars
