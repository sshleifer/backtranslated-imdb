Choose your destiny: the terrible tykes of the fourth form, making practical jokes involving axes, or ... ummm ... well-developed sixth form girls, who discovered cigarettes, gins, sex some time ago and how easily men can be misled. The problem is that one set arrives with the other. They are all there at St. Trinian's, a remarkably simple English school for girls, led by director Millicent Fritton (Alastair Sim). As Miss Fritton points out, "In other schools the girls are sent quite unprepared to a world without mercy, but when our girls leave, it is the world without mercy that must be prepared." Miss Fritton looks like a fusion of Julia Child and Eleanor Roosevelt, and she certainly has Sim's funny and funny genes. <br /> <br /> In The Belles of St. Trinian's, a clever and chaotic comedy by Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat's team, St. Trinian's is, as usual, on the verge of financial disaster. Salvation may be at hand, however, when a wealthy sheikh sends his daughter to join the fourth form and receive an appropriate English education. The sheik is also a horse owner and one of his prize runners, Arab Boy, is trained near the school for a race. It is only a matter of time before the fourth-form girls form a racing pool and aim hard at Arab Boy, with Miss Fritton adding the funds the school has left to the pool. (Much of the girl's money from the fourth form comes from the gins they produce in chemistry, then they bottle and drop rope to Flash Harry (George Cole), a Cockney repairman, for distribution. "He has something ... Not I know very well what, "says Miss Fritton as she tastes things," but send a few bottles to my room. "). Miss Fritton, however, has a brother, Clarence Fritton (who, by some coincidence of casting, is also Alastair Sim), a bookmaker who not only has a bundle on another horse, but who also has a daughter. And he put the precocious Arabella in the sixth form to keep him informed. Soon the sixth form kidnapped Arab Boy, the fourth form took over the horse, Flash Harry joined forces with Miss Fritton, the sixth-form girls are determined that Arab Boy will not leave the second floor of St. Trinian's, Clarence and the his band from Homburg has arrived, the parents are driving for the Parents' Day and the Ministry of Education has arrived in the person of a very suitable inspector. Total war breaks out at St. Trinian's. It is difficult to say which is more dangerous, African spears or flour bombs. <br /> <br /> Alastair Sim while Millicent Fritton performs a tour de force performance. Miss Fritton is a tall woman with a majestic breast, passionate about long dresses with embroidered lace and Edwardian hats with many feathers. He takes everything calmly, even a fourth person who beats something in the chemistry class and, after hearing an explosion a few minutes later, the results. "Oh dear, I told Bessie to be careful with that nitro-glycerine!" She is firm in believing that St. Trinian's is "a gay arcadia of happy girls". Sim was one of Britain's great eccentric actors. Besides the pure chaos of all the little (and not so small) girls who do terrible things, it offers much of the pleasure of the film.
