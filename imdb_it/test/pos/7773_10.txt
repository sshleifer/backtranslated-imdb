This is a must for everyone, but especially for African Americans. The time has come for a film to express and show the concerns of African-American relations. It also allows other cultures to see in a humorous way fiction how positive are the African-American relations and their results instead of the undesirable stereotype that afflicts the African American community. I love this movie a must see !!
