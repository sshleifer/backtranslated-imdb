When I first heard that the topic of Checking Out was a self-orchestrated suicide party, my first thought was how morbid, insipid, and then a comedy above that. I was skeptical. But I was completely wrong. I loved it. The cast, the fun one, and above all the surprise ending. Suicide is a delicate problem, but it has been managed very well. Comical yes, but tender where it had to be. The check-out also deals with other common problems that I believe many families can relate to and with tact and humor. I highly recommend checking. MUST SEE. I look forward to its release to the public.
