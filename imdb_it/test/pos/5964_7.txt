The Frogs Who Wanted a King or Frogland is the most cautious tale of Ladislaw Starewicz about people who want the government to solve their problems that I've ever seen. The ironic thing is that they pray to the god Jupiter for their answers. Jupiter replies first by sending a tree trunk and then a stork. Nor does it work and the stork is particularly dangerous for amphibious creatures! Frogs have human qualities when we see them dressed in the latest fashions of the day and see photos or use a camera when the stork arrives! As I said, this short is a political allegory more suited to adults than to children. In fact, I saw it for the first time on the Rhino VHS that Bambi Meets Godzilla had. Only this should tell you what to expect here!
