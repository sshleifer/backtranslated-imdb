Is torture ever right? No The answer is simple and absolute without possible qualifications. The reason this film showed is the effect that torture has on a company. The values ​​that have been severely fought in Western society through centuries of revolution and struggle are destined for ALL men and women to be allowed to live in a free and open society. One in which individuals are treated equally and in respect of their essential human rights. To protect this society, institutions have been developed to deal with crimes in an open, fair and honest manner. These institutions have been adapted and refined through generations of hard work. It could be objected that these are the true foundations of democracy as they belong to all of us, allow us to be heard. If we admit undemocratic and inhuman acts to be committed in our name, if we divide our society into those who have rights and those who do not, then we cancel the work of our ancestors. Moreover we are all accomplices and all guilty and contaminated. It doesn't matter if those we accuse are guilty or not. We are defined by our attitudes and our responses.
