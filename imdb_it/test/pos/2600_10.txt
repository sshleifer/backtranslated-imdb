The "Hunting Trilogy" by Rabbit Fire (1951), Rabbit Seasoning (1952) and Duck! Rabbit! Duck! (1953) should be considered the high water comic brand of the collaboration of Chuck Jones-Michael Maltese. While they are rarely mentioned on the "biggest" or "most important" comics lists in animation history, they are certainly the funniest comics I've ever seen. Michael Maltese has never had the merit of having directors like Jones, Freleng or Avery, but his dialogues and the situations that make Warner Bros. cartoons, and these three in particular, some of the FUNNIESTs ever made.
