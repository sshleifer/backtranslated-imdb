This movie is a gem hard to find! It's the story of Juliette, a perfectly ordinary cleaning lady who works in the large corporate office of a yogurt company, and Romuald, its president. He pays no attention to her, does not consider anyone until several plots to snatch his company from him all hit at the same time. He is lost, no one to turn to and no one to trust when he finds Juliette. Like the cleaning lady, no one pays attention to her, so they say and do incriminating things in front of her that she's smart enough to catch and use to help her helpless and unlucky boss. The complications are unleashed, she is not as ordinary as she seems with five children of five ex-husbands who are still all madly in love with her, and she is not as cunning as she thinks she is. This film does not follow a predictable path and is what keeps you looking. The acting is superb and there are also very moving moments along the way. The working class shows more experts than those above them, almost in the same way that "Gosford Park" showed that the upper part of the crust is not completely destroyed to be mentally. I highly recommend this movie. Watch it! 9/10
