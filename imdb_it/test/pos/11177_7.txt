Being a big fan of Monkey Island fans, I have dispelled that this would have been terrible since Ron Gilbert didn't make it. The boy was surprised! Although he is still not as good as the first two, he has the comedy I wanted. I was a little nervous about the new graphics, the new SCUMM engine and the fact that it was on a CD. But it all came together and it was interesting to finally hear the voices of your favorite characters. I particularly liked that SWORD FIGHTING was back. And the whole story of finding the big untreated ring was simply amazing. Go ahead and try this adventure in two CDs. And now we can rejoice, because Monkey Island 4: Escape from Monkey Island is going to REALLY come out very soon! This fall!
