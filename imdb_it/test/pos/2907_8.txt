First came "the ten commandments" "land of the pharaohs" "Ben Hur" and is overlooked today. It is unfair! Based on Mika Waltari's gigantic novel, it's not a problem! Waltari's novel was so great that only a miniseries could have done justice (I hope it will be done someday). Waltari, whose message is essentially Christian, remains intact (another of his books "the secret of the kingdom" (first part) takes place after the death of Christ in the Holy Land). <br /> <br /> "The Egyptian" is the rise of a monotheism close to Christianity long before Christ: the pharaoh (Wilding) is a kind of Messiah who sacrifices his life because he knows that the true kingdom is not in the material world: it asks us to restore good to evil! And he has disciples, who will eventually turn into martyrs (the scene in which Simmons and the other worshipers of the Sun God are killed is visually stunning, like a pagan ballet). For the world the priests, on the other hand, this new religion would mean the end of their influence on the population, and that is why they seek a strong man (Maturo) who can lead the army against the Hittites and against their dangerous compatriots . Another religion, or non-religion, we should say, is Sinouhé (Purdom) who for two hours believes in nothing (the sequence of the grain of sand is absolutely sensational and increases the whole film well above the average peplum !! ) <br /> <br /> There is another fascinating aspect: the film looks like a flamboyant melodrama. only for the script (in particular the final revelation of Pharoah's sister (Tierney) preceding "the ten commandments" of two years), but also the splendor of the cinematography: Viviani, in his book on Curtiz, speaks of a Baudelairian atmosphere , blue and gold, particularly in the scenes involving the prostitute (Darvi) that contemplates her reflection in the water of her bathroom, supreme narcissism. Around the hero, all the characters appear, disappear, appear again, but when they reappear, they followed their path and all the subplots merge with the consummate skill. Besides, as often happens in "modern" melodramas, the story is a long flashback, framed by two short sequences that show Sinouhé an old man he is remembering. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful sword and sandal, which has had a strong influence, not only in America but also in Europe, particularly in Poland, where Jerzy Kawalerowicz directed a fascinating "faraon" (1966) that owed a lot to Curtiz.
