I'm really surprised that this film only has a rating of 6.4 for the moment I made this review. Although it's not exactly a great movie, I think it's one of Dietrich's best films, and it's a shame that it's no longer appreciated. I think a lot of the reasons why I liked the movie so much is that Dietrich's usual stupid character as "über-vamp" is not present and his role required her to act. I hate watching movies after films in the early days of his career where it seemed more like a caricature or a cliché than a real woman. I don't necessarily blame Dietrich for the stupid vampire movies he did in the 1930s - the audience loved them and made them famous. But here, he proved he could really act. After all, looking at her only in films like MOROCCO, BLONDE VENUS and THE BLUE ANGEL, who would have ever imagined that she was well launched to play a Gypsy! I was quite ready to hate the movie because of this casting decision, but it worked - it was very credible and also very fun to watch! The film is essentially a vehicle only for Ray Milland and Marlene Dietrich - the other supporting characters are very secondary to the film. Milland is a spy sought in Germany before the Second World War and in his efforts to escape, he runs into a rather lively solitary Gypsy (Dietrich) which immediately leads him to be a fulfillment of the prophecy - in other words, his new lover! Milland is rather stuffy but reluctantly agrees to travel in his wagon - even wearing body paint and piercing his ears to make it look like a Gypsy (hence the title of the movie). Over time, he slowly begins to realize that beneath his very crude appearance he is rather a woman and romance flourishes slowly. <br /> <br /> The film in one word is "fascinating". A beautiful love story with a good dose of comedy and fun - just the kind of photos you still want Hollywood. Also, please note the performance of Murvyn Vye as "Zoltan". It was very magnetic in the short period he was in the film and I loved his deep and beautiful voice. <br /> <br /> Finally, a sad note to consider. While the film is set in Germany, there is no mention of the next Gypsy Holocaust. During the war, throughout the German territory, the Nazis exterminated a huge percentage of gypsies and therefore the last fine ending of the film is a bit far-fetched.
