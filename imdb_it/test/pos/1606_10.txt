It might be difficult to explain how, but this film is a masterpiece. Perhaps, because I never imagined that a plot like this or a movie with so few words could convey all this poetry. The true poetry and aristocracy of human passions and obsession. Bogard is incredible and needless to say that Venice is used as a perfect scenario: dark, sinking and squalid just like the soul of Bogard. And classical music is more than just a background accompaniment to human feelings. In my opinion, a classic masterpiece of European cinema.
