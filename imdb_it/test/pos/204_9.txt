One of those films that I went through The Criterion Collection and as usual it turned into a change of pace. This was a great decision. I was almost mesmerized by the quality of the film, the story it told and the way it was told. The almost minimalist feel of the film with scattered dialogues and almost constant music only added an entire evocative level to the film. This is really a fantastic movie to spend some time with and have fun.
