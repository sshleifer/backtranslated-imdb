Patty Chayevsky was years ahead of most successful writers and screenwriters in tackling sticky subjects. In this 1971 film he followed Sinclair Lewis and A. J. Cronin (respectively ARROWSMITH and THE CITADEL) in looking critically at the world of medicine, although his focus is on a special stage: a modern hospital in Manhattan. Chayevsky's point of view is quite direct: the places in the hospital where people have to go to feel good or the money that organizations make where people die frequently because of incompetence. <br /> <br /> Like a person who has recently been a hospital too many times (and soon I will have to come back again) I find the HOSPITAL a very timely and rewarding satire. George C. Scott is Dr. Block, one of the leaders of the Manhattan Surgical Center, an important university hospital. He has just started his day when he is told that one of the second-year residents died during the night in an apparent confusion. He seems to have been sedated and drugged while sleeping on a bed (he had had an appointment with a nurse), and someone has tampered with an i.v. that he should have contained water containing glucose (later it turns out that he had an overdose of insulin in I.v.). Soon Scott discovers that every time another member of staff turns over, he dies of a heart attack or a failed operation. The key to all this seems to be a patient who came to the hospital ten days before for a regular checkup, and has since lost a kidney, almost lost the other kidney and is now in a comatose state (Barnard Hughes). <br /> <br /> Hughes' daughter (Diana Rigg) wants to bring her father back to his home in an Apache Indian reservation in Mexico. Scott is not entirely against the idea - after all, the hospital's mistakes almost killed Hughes. Furthermore, Scott is experiencing a mid-life crisis with the collapse of his marriage and his family, and his growing doubts about what the chosen profession really has. This is not just a case like Hughes's. The hospital is in a constant state of chaos in which the regular staff (Scott, Stephen Elliot, Nancy Marchand, Stockard Channing) is overloaded with work, and is at war with the company staff (represented by Frances Steenhagen in a performance really cold). The local community is hostile due to the hospital's expansion plans - but when they meet to "discuss" the issues with Elliot they prove to be divisions between them (Black Panthers militants against local clergy against birth control in search of women and clinical abortion types). Rigg (who falls in love with Scott during the film) becomes increasingly certain that leaving the madness of the city makes sense, and Scott also plays with the idea. <br /> <br /> Scott was at his height acting in this movie, something with ANATOMY OF A MURDER, THE HUSTLER, DR. STRANGELOVE and PATTON under his belt before THE HOSPITAL was made. His anguish is recorded when he and Rigg know each other (she prevents him from killing himself because of his desperation). He cannot tell if it is worth doing something in the hospital and screams out of the window the words in the "Summary Line". Even if he later relaxes a little of what his teaching has been good for the doctors who study with him, Scott is never really sure of everything, but fully accepts his sense of responsibility that others abandon to him. Rigg was also at the peak of his international fame (if not his acting skills) - his time as Mrs. Peel in THE AVENGERS was a few years old, but at the time she was recognized as one of Britain's top talents as a of the sexiest women interpreters of that period. <br /> <br /> Even the supporting actors are good. In addition to the chilling Steenhagen (which requires Medicare / Medicaid / insurance information from comatose patients in the ER), there is Hughes as a winning religious maniac, and Elliot as the hospital sick. There's also my favorite caricature: Richard Dysart as Dr. Elwell. Elwell is a butcher who has found a real home for himself on the Big Board of the Exchange, having incorporated himself for tax incentives. Anyone who remembers his performances as ethical types as the head of the law firm in L.A.LAW or as a friend and doctor of Melvin Douglas in BEING THERE, after seeing his greedy Dr. Elwell see another aspect of the talent of this underrated actor.
