A story of a young boy, Dexter (Joseph Mazzello) with AIDS who makes friends with a rough boy (played by Brad Renfro) his exact opposite, The Cure is sad, even if a little too contemptible, it pulls your emotions "message" film with his heart in the right place. Only for this, it is a recommended display. The highlight could be to simply observe them as they seek friendship and go out with others when no one else accepts them. <br /> <br /> However, since the real story centers on the boy's AIDS, things take off when a day at the local supermarket, Dexter notices a tabloid magazine that claims a New Orleans doctor discovered the care. Both, obviously a little naive, make a plan to leave for New Orleans in any way possible. That pulled me in two ways. It is a high pitch that warms the heart and I hate being fussy, but I found the plot to wander in a melodramatic and predictable sense and the acts have a polished hand on them as only films can do. I couldn't escape the concept of jerking that I was watching a travel movie about self-discovery, sickness and growth. For example, I know they are young, but I found it a real task to believe in the things these guys do. How to boil tree leaves and drink hot tea or eat an experimental diet of chocolate bars because they believe it will fight the devastating disease. Not to mention that they travel across the country as they do without legal or even terrifying repercussions. Apart from the doubts, those cinematographic conventions that you expect, it is a story that is worth seeing in particular with the family.
