This film is a very nice and slow movie. There is nothing in Hollywood about it. He is very Danish and the characters are very real. It is the first Danish film to take up this transsexual theme. It really is love that has no gender. I wouldn't say it's about lesbian love even though the two main characters (the transsexual veronica and Charlotte) are attracted to each other. It is a story of love and life. <br /> <br /> The story takes place practically in the two apartments. There is almost no background music, which makes it seem more real and intense. The two actors who play the main characters are fantastic. Make them really real. They are not archetypes, but real people that you could meet on the street. I think it's the first time I've seen a transsexual played so well. Very well done.
