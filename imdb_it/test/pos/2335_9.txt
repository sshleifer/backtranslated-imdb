This is one of those films where critics have really missed the mark. This film is practically the Navy of McHale for the 90s or the Police Academy at sea. Grammer shows he can play different roles as Frasier while outsmarting the Navy to get his subtitle. Rob Schneider is a coward as usual, the same in every role he plays, and Lauren Holly is the local sexpot albeit with a brain. Ken Hudson Campbell is fun as usual, with almost every line. The film has a wonderfully clever storyline and an unpredictable script that still surprises me every time I look at it. Many phrases and terms of the Navy go through my head, though, but it's a small obstacle to the absolute accuracy and realism of the film and its characters.
