Certainly it is not a film to revolutionize the sector or introduce new film production techniques, this is a very beautiful and solid production. It's miraculous that today we can enjoy it with superb quality on DVD - probably most viewers around 100 years ago saw a black and white copy, as the de luxe stencil edition was only available in the best theaters. Even if you're not fascinated by this movie or the subject, you can't miss the copy of Image Entertainment (along with another gem, From the Manger To the Cross, 1912). It is practically impossible to see a film that has more than a century of life but shows so little damage. The coloring process of the stencils was very effective and, compared to the occasionally blurred and stained images of hand-colored films, the colors are sharp and well defined. Shot within the limits of film production as it was known in 1902, when the shooting began, the static nature of the scenes can today be considered almost intentional, meditative and solemn. The tableaux continue to move at a steady pace, so the film never gets boring. You may not be fascinated by this film like a work of cinematography, but it is certainly as beautiful as a picturesque and artistic work of art. If you are a religious person, the fact that you are looking at anonymity, for a long time people who have abandoned characters who have been playing for a long time, add significantly to the mystery. A correct visualization for Christmas or Lent. <br /> <br /> P.S: I ticked the "contain spoiler" box just for fun. As you can see, I didn't reveal the ending.
