There were at least half a dozen mute versions of Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice" and there were several television productions. But nobody has ever managed to make a feature film with a big budget. . . until now. Given the nature of the game's most memorable character, Shylock the Nasty Jew, it is a good hypothesis that the unpleasantness that emerged in Europe in the late 1930s and 40s may have dampened the enthusiasm of filmmakers. Of course, the main motivation for Michael Radford's new film is to give Al Pacino the chance to scream, bray, hatch, murmur, and be tormented - which is pretty good at him. Like Richard III, the role of Shylock is a scenario dream. It is ridiculous to call Shakespeare an anti-Semite, since he never met a Jew. Jews were banished from England for 300 years before his time until a few decades after his death; and it is unlikely that he ever traveled abroad. At one level, Jews could also be a mythological race for him. But even if Shakespeare cannot have been anti-Semitic, his game certainly is. Pacino gives Shylock a strange accent that probably intends to suggest the slightest hint of Yiddish. Unfortunately, the result is a 16th-century moneylender with the unmistakable diction and cadences of Fozzie Bear. Radford's version begins with a scan of the terrifying terrifying of the Jews and then sees Antonio (Jeremy Irons) spit free on Shylock (Pacino), who is actually just hanging around, minding his own business. I'll buy it when it comes out on DVD, for sure! Sarge Booker
