TV journalist Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her radical camaldista Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) are in a nuclear power plant when a serious accident occurs. Production managers do without it, but Adams has filmed everything. Wells and Adams try to put it on the air but the company that runs the plant prevents it. Executive director Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) understands that there are serious problems and that the tests have been falsified. Try to convince the managers to believe him - only they know it. Wells, Adams and Godell discover that all their lives are in danger. <br /> <br /> I saw him in a cinema in 1979. I was only 17 and I was scared. To make matters worse, the Three Mile Island incident occurred around this time, making the film even more real. Seeing him more than 20 years later, it doesn't scare me but it's still an excellent film - it works like a mystery, a compelling drama and an exposure to the nuclear energy industry. Fonda (with red hair) has one of his best roles as Wells - perfectly conveys the growing suspicion and horror of his character when he realizes that a nuclear disaster could happen. Lemmon is (as always) excellent. He begins to believe in his company and in his work and slowly begins to extricate himself when he begins to discover things. He was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for this. Douglas is good but has a small part and is completely obscured by Lemmon and Fonda. <br /> <br /> A truly exceptional film, one of the best of the 70s. Don't miss this!
