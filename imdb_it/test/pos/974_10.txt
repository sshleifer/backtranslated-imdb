I could see this movie ALL DAY! I love it. Probably my favorite movies of all time. But, by the way, "badger1970" there are some parts with bad language, not too bad, but not exactly G evaluated. Great movie !!!!! I recommend it to everyone. In any case, he's making me type 10 lines of text, so I'll keep typing until he allows me to post this comment. Ok ... keep typing ... This is getting annoying. Ugh. I still have four to do. However, WATCH THIS FILM! Even if you've already seen it. DON'T ASSURE ME! Have they already been 10 lines? No. Only 2 more lines remain. I don't even know why he wants me to do it. I think I'm done. Wait a minute, I'm NOT done, I'm sorry, folks. I know it's a torture that listens to me. Suppose you don't have to read this comment ... But you should, because I wrote it. I'm probably done now. Finally, bye
