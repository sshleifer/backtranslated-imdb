This must be the funniest movie I've ever seen. Chritopher Guest is really talented. He has a gift for humor. I almost died laughing. Actually, when I saw him at the movies, I thought I'd walk out because the movie was so stupid. But it's stupid in a good way. It's funny-stupid. And this is really a good combination. You will be laughing from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> This mockumentary-style film follows a series of characters all competing at the Kennel Club Dog Show. The cast includes Parker Posey, Fred Willard, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, John Michael Higgens, Michael McKean, Larry Miller, Bob Balaban, Jennifer Coolidge and many others. <br /> <br /> This is a really fun movie that will make everyone laugh. Someone born without a personality would laugh at this movie. It is presented in widescreen format to give the image you are viewing a real documentary and that is probably what adds to the hilarity. BEST IN SHOW: 5/5.
