This film was an extraordinary tribute to anyone who has experienced this kind of pain and suffering. Acting was not the best, I admit, but she was passionate about her message, sending people to prison without a lawyer or some kind of trial is cruel and unusual. They even had a damn trial for Saddam, so why didn't all alleged terrorists have some kind of fair and justified trial and hearing about why they were tagged in the first place? I'm leaving the movie, but I think it's noteworthy for this sick and distorted idea of ​​the government. The way the film told the story and the background was a great mystery. The whole movie, I was trying to connect the daughter to the plot and eventually it became very obvious. There is no doubt that the direction was incredible, but the only thing I didn't care for was that there was no emphasis on the interest of the character of Reese Witherspoon and the struggle in the ideal that she claimed, a lots of jumps. Otherwise he was actually quite funny, and above all he kept my attention and interest in the two hours he played.
