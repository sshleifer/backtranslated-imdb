Plot: Ed and Alice are engaged. They live together and live boring life. He slept around before meeting Alice. You have much less experience. He decides that he needs to sleep before getting married. Very reluctantly he agrees that both should see other people for a while. <br /> <br /> At first he is not very interested. His wild days are behind him and he is simply happy. Until one day Alice returns and tells him she took out a random boy; who obviously starts to fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> Obviously this is a BAD idea that causes extreme strain on the relationship. <br /> <br /> Good movie. You can see the sinking of the arriving train, but still good. <br /> <br /> It is worth hiring.
