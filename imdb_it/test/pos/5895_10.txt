Thirty years before THE DEER HUNTER came this film, an excellent meditation on the effects of the war inflicted on the American family by both the heroes of war and their wives. A truly ironic title, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES is anything but since those times faded into still images and all that remains is an uncertain future for those involved. <br /> <br /> Truly a choral cast despite the top - the billing of Myrna Loy, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES focuses more on men's stories. Al Stephenson (Fredric March) returns to a family that has been irrevocably changed as his children have grown up, although he finds the support of his lovely wife Milly (Myrna Loy). Fred Derry, on his return, can't find a decent job despite being a war veteran and trapped in a marriage that Marie doesn't want, a carefree girl who wants more out of life and who comes more and more to hate him. Homer Parrish, on the other hand, has major problems due to his loss of hands in war and feels that the whole world - including the girl he loves and his family - thinks he is a monster of nature. <br /> <br /> At almost three hours in length, the film never seems long and pulled out. There are so many emotions that happen even in the small moments when the plot becomes lighter; nothing seems wasted or placed on the screen due to lack of editing. Not a performance sounds false, even though the prominent people are those of Dana Andrews in the role of Fred Derry, Harold Russell in the role of Homer Parrish and Virginia Mayo as Marie Derry. Even then, each character has his moment in the film, and the time was right to talk about all the pain and suffering that had not been seen in American films until then (including those made during the First World War, which did not delight in these topics). While there is never any obvious violence, it is all there, in the haunted expressions of the three faces of the male protagonists, in the lot in which the planes now reside, ready to be transformed into garbage (and therefore, forgetfulness), in the cynicism of shop owners who did not bother to employ these shocked men who had seen the battle or, worse still, to encourage them to wonder what it was worth. This is the film in which Deborah is indebted and the fourth of July is born. At a time when America had escaped from war films, inventing it when the end of the Second World War was still fresh was a necessity for making a more honest film.
