I saw this film in a special screening. At first I thought the film would be like a typical Amanda Bynes movie, but I was wrong. The film is based on Shakespeare's book "The Twelth Night". This film tells the story of a girl who lives playing soccer. Well, when the girls 'team is cut, they have to do everything to get into the boys' team at a different school to take revenge on the team of selfish kids from his old school. On her way she is captured in a long, intricate web of love, lies and deception. This film is this years Mean Girls. I think he shows some great skills for the new actors and there are provocatively some great stars to be protagonists of this film.
