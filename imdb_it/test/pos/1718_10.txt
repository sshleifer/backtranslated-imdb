As a fan of the old Doctor Who, and after the mediocre Fox movie, I was doubtful about this new Doctor Who series. I gave it a chance, and I'm so glad I did. <br /> <br /> Yes, some episodes are not as brilliant as others, but they are all amusing, and yes, the Doctor of Eccleston is far from all of us I did it before ... The doctor of Eccleston is just the best there is. His performance is sometimes comic, sometimes dramatic, sometimes completely crazy but always fantastic. <br /> <br /> This and Bille Piper like Rose make this series a cut above the rest (Camille Coduri is also fantastic as Rose's mother), and there is a depth of this series not previously present. This series is incredibly powerful, especially considering its science fiction. I mean, who would have ever thought of feeling sorry or crying for a Dalek before this, how many times in the history of this series we had moments like those with Rose's dad, the Emergency Doctor and the "Have you been fantastic? .. "So I was the last speech? I advise anyone, whether it's a Doctor Who fan or even the TV drama to buy this set on DVD, it's really" Fantastic! ". <br /> <br /> Now only 4 episodes through the latest series (and I'm looking forward to the new Cybermen) I must say that David Tennant's doctor is not as good, of course you may not agree, but I don't think his doctor is capable of those moments emotional seen in the previous series. I also have to say that, in my opinion, this series was not up to par, however the return of Sarah Jane and K9 was a fantastic episode, a real gem. Not to say that this series is not good, it's just not so good. <br /> <br /> So, like it or not, and if you prefer Tennant or Eccleston, The Doctor is back, and he's here to stay. "Fantastic!" - Almost as many "Fantastic!" As a Doctor! -
