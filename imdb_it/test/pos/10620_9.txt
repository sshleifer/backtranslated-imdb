I've seen this movie, just once, and I'm looking forward to seeing it again and again. Dear David (from Beligium), why did you take the trouble to write a comment on this film? I just think we can think of you (after reading your comment), that you're probably a non-sexual person (like Erika in the movie), and you're not ready for the new cinema that's coming. I guess you're a little old, and sexual expression is not part of your "face". The Cannes Film Festival is by far the best film festival, and I am happy to say that this film has been awarded with: Best Actress, Best Actor and Grand Prix. Isabelle Huppert is magnificent, as always, who would want to make this film like her? One of his best performances ever. The music is fantastic, and once again Michael Haneke puts reality on the big screen. It's like a kind of Dogma95 movie, because of the topic. Try to see it. <br /> <br />
