Is it a mystery to me why I didn't reach this masterpiece of the 50s? turned into a dark noir so far, but I am certainly pleased to report that it did not disappoint. I haven't seen any of Jules Dassin's American films for several years, but based on that I will probably come back to see "Brute Force" and "Night and the City" very soon. <br /> <br /> Jean Servais, a name unknown to me but a rather familiar face in his weariness and coldness of the world, has recently completed a long stay in prison and how is the way in these films (hey, don't it would be a story otherwise) he is not facing upright life well. An opportunity presents itself: an easy million-dollar robbery that can be done at night without fear of being discovered by a few men. The tense footage of the robbery, half an hour of total silence, is what most people remember of the film, of course, and it is truly remarkable; but I liked the incomplete position of the last shooting, once the theft was sharpened thanks to the big mouth of one of the thieves; the excellent portrait of the gritty sides of Paris in clear white and black; and Serva's channeling of both Eddie Constantine and Humphrey Bogart in his performance, but brutal. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a bit too sentimental in the end, but this is one of those classics that really make it up to reputation as pure entertainment even if what it has to say about the human condition isn't exactly deep or stimulating; George Auric, in turn, is the modernist, romantic and jazz soundtrack.
