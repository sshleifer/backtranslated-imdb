This is a GREAT movie. Hána is a very old boy with a very young heart. He knows how to live his everyday life by gathering with his friend, playing tricks on everything, even at his death. While his wife cannot manage his "irresponsible" behavior, he also knows that is exactly why he has loved her husband for almost half a century. I would love to go out with this old guy because he knows how to have fun live and not be afraid of death. He is joyful, witty, mischievous and never boring. Vlastimil Brodský brilliantly played Hána at the age of 79. Every look from his eyes and every movement of his aged muscles so transmit the character to the public. This is a film that leaves a big smile on my face afterwards, and makes me look a little closer at my life. Tomorrow I'm going to buy myself a villa and have a little fun. If Hána can, I can too. But I think I'll skip the smoking part.
