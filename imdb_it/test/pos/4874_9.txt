The first film at the Fangoria Festival in Las Vegas is the most challenging. It's not a movie for everyone. Many of the films that followed used predictable classic horror formulas to tell predictable stories. This photo seemed determined to do its thing. <br /> <br /> Tom Savini showed some comic jokes as the baddest. He dominated every scene he was in, flipping his cloak like Leslie Neilson playing Dracula. It was nice to hear his explanation after the movie. He had such a good sense of humor about the role. I was happy that I didn't have too many preconceptions, because the film offered many surprises. The story was funny, profane and unusual. There was a lot of love on the look. More important, he had a strange side. Unlike many of the films that followed and tried to use a similar classic horror style, this was a film that used its look for a purpose. <br /> <br /> There were many films at the Fangoria Festival with bigger budgets, but no one who dared to be so different.
