I saw the short title "The Reader" recently and discovered that the film was well planned and performed. I really felt for both characters that Morgan Hallett and Elizabeth Franz play in this movie. Elizabeth was able to show a wide range with her blind character and left me emotionally attached. Morgan was able to sell me that she was totally committed to keeping "Sissy" or Franz protected from the pain of losing her sister who lived in Copenhagen. The beauty of the film was in the short run time and in the budget of only ten thousand dollars, Duncan Rodgers was able to make a very well done film that kept the viewer's interest. Rodgers has a great knowledge of the actor's abilities and the transition of great shooting angles to show their talent. I always feel that a director can make a fantastic movie on a limited budget, so what can he do with a much bigger movie. Great job Duncan !!
