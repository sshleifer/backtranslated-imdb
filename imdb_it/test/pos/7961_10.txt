The last time I checked in here I think there hasn't been more than one comment. I am very happy that more people have been captured in this movie now, and even more about all your research. I took it on Christmas Eve 2004, and found myself unable to change channels on my TV, even though it was an Asian movie, and I'm sadly but really very used to not giving anyone a chance Hollywood Products did that night, though, and I thank God deeply for that. Since then I have not been able to shake that film out of my system - not what I have tried or wanted - and it still amazes me - in an extremely grateful way - that such a beautiful and wonderful experience came so completely unexpected , like a Christmas miracle. Please, if you have the chance to go see this movie, buy it or rent it from bootleg or something, but watch it. I guarantee you that it will affect you. I'm out of time, but I'm not done yet with my assessment here, so I'll be back as soon as possible.
