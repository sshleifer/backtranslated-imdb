The best romantic comedy I've seen in years. Not the kind of slick over the best Hollywood things of Ben Stiller or Adam Sandler and far less syrupy than an Hugh Grant epic. Julianne Nicholson and Jay Mohr are perfectly expressed and both offer professional services like the engaged couple who decide to spend some time sowing sexual oats before marriage. Instead of playing strictly for laughter, the writers and the director have invented a beautiful mixture of human feelings and comic action. Nicholson is simply fantastic as the awkward seductress and Mohr does a great job as the man who reluctantly enters the game, but soon finds himself having a little too much fun. We only see enough supporting characters to complete the plot without distracting from the main story. Andy Richter (sincere friend) and Helen Slater (shocked single mom) are particularly good. There is enough meaning and emotional complexity to make this much more than a standard boy-girl farce. In fact, with a slightly better rhythm and a bit more, this film would be one of the ten best comedies.
