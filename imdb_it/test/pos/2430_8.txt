It is beyond dispute that the real Anna Anderson was NOT Princess Anastasia. Apart from the very distinctive differences in physical appearance (Anderson's eyes are noticeably larger, thicker lips, larger nose and raised at the end ... etc.), Anderson is unable to speak Russian was ridiculous ... That's why I hate Anna Anderson and her companions so much. Not many scammers have the audacity and the resistance to deceive for more than 60 years with such a brazenly unsustainable scheme. <br /> <br /> However, to some extent I have sympathy for Anna Anderson. Life must have been hard for a young Polish peasant in those days. And impersonating another woman for over 60 years is a daunting task for anyone. He had to hold his full lips all the time to mimic Anastasia's thin lips, and occasionally he had to go crazy to make people believe that all his chaotic memory was just a result of mental problems. <br /> <br /> Anna Anderson was a fantastic woman on a wrong track. If she had put on her good looks, learned elegance, endurance, acting skills in proper use, she could have become a first-class actress. <br /> <br /> Side note: some main characters in this two-parter game seem to be based on real figures. Prince Erich could have been a mixture of Gleb Botkin (thought to be the brain as much as possible behind the whole scheme), Duke George and Dmitri of Leuchtenberg and many other figures. And Darya Romanoff seems to be based on the beautiful princess Xenia Georgievna Romanova. But unlike the real confederates, Prince Erich was without reason in this show and claimed Anna for love and sincere belief in her, which is touching. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a great show. A bit fictional but still true to reality. The power of Amy Irving's acting is that she has successfully represented Anderson's safety, the mixture of impersonating others and being herself is intriguing. Just as Princess Xenia said of Anderson: "She was always herself and never gave the slightest impression of playing a part". Highly recommended.
