A surprisingly good documentary. My surprise is mainly due to the fact that I was confused by the title. I thought it was the influence of drug culture on film production, but it's not a much broader and smarter movie than anyone could have expected. Demme did a great job encapsulating the period between the late 1960s and the late 1970s. Da, "Easy Rider" and the collapse of the influence in the studio, through all those introspective films about "real life", where young and brilliant directors tried to express themselves politically, sexually and artistically, up to the beginning of the blockbuster and the return of kingdoms to money, men and their studies. As someone who has seen the "real" films of Britain and the rest of Europe through the 60s and then the revolutionary American films of the 70s and it's sad that the sequel to the sequel is so much on the agenda, this was a most fascinating film. The interview clips are measured (thanks to DVD full interviews are available as extras!) And the movie clips are well considered. Also, as someone who has just joined, "Joe", I am impressed that this important little movie gets its well-deserved entry here.
