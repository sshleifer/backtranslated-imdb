There is a common thread in the cinematographic comedy that all the great comics are simply failing in the law or in prison. Think of Conman's Conman W.C.Fields in THE OLD FASHIONED WAY, or the Marx Brothers in A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, or Chaplin in THE ADVENTURER, in Mae West in SHE DONE HIM. The skirting board of the law is inevitable, and when they end up on the side of the law the results are actually still hostile between the police and the comic. Think of Lloyd in his first talkie, WELCOME DANGER, trying to "assist" the San Francisco Police Department in the midst of a wave of crime, and get police sergeant Edgar Kennedy to kill him. Think of Laurel and Hardy as unfortunate MIDNIGHT PATROL cops. I find this kind of hostility so evident in the comedy of all these giants (and their peers) that even a fake title for a film takes care of it. Think of Jerry Seinfeld in an episode of his series creating a short film Three Stooges, SAPPY PAPPIES, in which the boys end up struck by murder. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton often pulls law enforcement inside to be his opponents in his plays. Watch STEAMBOAT BILL, JR., Where he tries to give birth to his father from a calaboose. But he actually had more conflict with the police in his shorts. In CONVICT 13 he is dragged back to prison when he is mistaken for a convicted person on the run. In COPS (perfect title - if you see that you would understand) the police of a big city repeatedly searches for Keaton, mistaken for a terrorist). And in THE GOAT he can't avoid the police for most of the film. <br /> <br /> Keaton is a tramp looking for food only. But he is totally unlucky. When he sees a stranger throw a lucky horseshoe (which Keaton ignores before) on his shoulder, and then find a wallet full of money, Keaton looks for the same thing and hits a cop on his head. The policeman hunts down, and Keaton (as luck would have it) runs into another policeman, tries to behave normally, but ends up throwing the other policeman on the path of the first. Soon he has three policemen chasing him. Shaking them briefly, he walks near a window in the local prison where the local murderer "Dead Shot Dan" (Malcolm St. Clair *) is photographed. Passing behind the barred windows, Keaton is stupid enough to stop and look straight inside. The desperado notes this and the ducks while the photo is taken. When Dead Shot escapes from the police, it is Keaton's face on all the desired posters. <br /> <br /> (* St Clair would finally be a successful director of silent and primitive sound comedies, although in his next biography he would be a stint at 20th Century Fox, where his work with Laurel & Hardy was under the even. <br /> <br /> Keaton flees to another city by train (disconnecting the passenger cars containing his pursuers from the locomotive and tender) .This is the film (by the way) that has two famous Keaton's lines: his arrival on the locomotive is done in a distant blow, with it getting closer, and suddenly the audience sees Keaton sitting on the cowcatcher. <br /> <br /> The second famous sequence goes later (and could having influenced Chaplin a little at the start of CITY LIGHTS.) Keaton had accidentally knocked out a man who was fighting too violently with a beautiful woman with a dog (Virginia Fox). When he sees the poster who calls him a murderer, he thinks of having killed the man in this city by a suspected police chief (Joe Roberts) and momentarily loses Roberts in the park. A statue of "Man-of-War" is under construction and the sculptor is unveiling a clay model of the horse). Keaton is seen sitting on the clay model, trying to maintain his dignity as the horse's clay legs begin to collapse under his weight. <br /> <br /> Keaton manages to meet the beautiful Mrs. Fox, who invites him home for dinner. Only he doesn't realize that his father is Roberts. The last five minutes of the film deal with Keaton on the run and avoiding Roberts as he and Fox leave together. <br /> <br /> It's a fun comedy, and a wonderful example of Keaton's work at its best.
