Serendipity. I thought I was starting badly, bringing the wrong DVD home with "The Intruder". The staff of the rental shops! So I didn't want to see this movie, but I'm glad I did. In all probability, my chosen film would not have been an exceptional film like this delicious and delicate taste of what the independents in Europe and the United States can do together. Seven years later, two heroine sisters undertake fantastic journeys through the post-student demo of the 70s / Baader-Meinhof Europe. Sumptuously shot in the Algarve, in Portugal; and in Berlin, Paris and Amsterdam (which recalls the sensation of external shots in Paul Verhoeven's first masterpiece, "The Fourth Man"), is movingly starred by Brewster, Diaz and in particular by Christopher Ecclestone. The story is revealed on an abstract plot, capturing the ephemeral emotions of these characters as they face their relationships and see the idealized images of each other and themselves shattered. A film with great refinement and taste. Not for Arnie Commando fans, which is probably why the reviewer upstairs is so broad in the "his" brand that he claims this is a girly movie. Daft criteria Also wrong. Worth experimenting.
