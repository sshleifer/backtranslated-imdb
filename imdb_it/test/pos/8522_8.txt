You don't review James Bond films, you evaluate them, you evaluate them based on how much they meet expectations. There are some things expected, including the request for a James Bond movie and any individual effort or not. So here are ten elements that make a James Bond movie a movie. And even though NEVER SAY NEVER is not technically part of the official James Bond filmography, the mere presence of Sean Connery who returns as 007 makes it more than just an honorary member of the series. However, here's how to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /> <br /> Title: NEVER SAY AGAIN: The smart title has no apparent connection to the real storyline, but is instead an in-joke reference to Sean Connery's vow to never play OO7 again after being lured back once before, because DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. In any case, it's a catchy title. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Pre-credit teaser: perhaps trying to avoid any obvious parallel with the official EON series of the James Bond films, there is no Teaser; the opening scenes are shown behind the credits. And this too is disappointing: yet another "oh-no, Bond was killed" fakeout. 4 points. <br /> <br /> Opening Credits: In addition to a screen full of tiny 007s, they didn't even bother trying to revive the titles with graphs or split screens or interesting camera angles. 1 point. <br /> <br /> Song of the themes: as written by Michel LeGrand and sung by Lani Hall, "Never Say Never Again" would be the perfect part of a particularly long elevator ride. As a Bond theme, it's just okay. 6 points. <br /> <br /> "Bond, James Bond": Appropriately, since this film sees Connery called up as Bond after a ten-year hiatus, the story begins with 007 facing the question of whether Bond / Connery is still up to the job. Fortunately, Connery proves ready again for Bondage. Although it is a little grayer, with a little more circumference and a slightly more evident toupee, it seems to have no problem getting back into action. All in all, it's one of Connery's best and most relaxed character turns. 9 points. <br /> <br /> Bond Babes: Even in the best James Bond films, female characters are not given much dimension; largely exist as props necessary for the use of Bond. The future Oscar winner Kim Basinger has a wide margin of freedom in creating the Domino Petachi character and the film benefits from it. It does a good job - and it's not bad either to look at it. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Bond Villain: The accounts of his death are obviously exaggerated, Blofeld is back - at least for the moment - showing he has more lives than his prized pussycat. Max von Sydow, once a portraitist of Jesus transformed into a stereotyped bad author, does not have much to do in the role, but it is still a silky presence. But it is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximilian Largo. After a series of trivial Bond villains, it is so refreshing for Brandauer to give a performance that is both subtle but colorfully evil. Funny without being camped, ruthless without seeming to be a comic book; his Largo is placed right there with Auric Goldfinger as one of the best Bond villains. 10 points. <br /> <br /> Bond Baddies: Fatima Blush! What can I say? As she played with all the bold style of a particularly flamboyant drag queen, Barbara Carrera throws herself to the rhythm of the film, exhibiting a mix of self-amused mischief and more than a hint of pure psychotic madness. Bond has crossed a series of femmes fatales, most of which have been so easily disposed that they existed more like amusing sweets than characters. But few dared exhibit such light for dramatic or so fierce determination. Even his untimely death is spectacular, even by Bondian standards. 10 points. <br /> <br /> Sinister Plot: like a remake of THUNDERBALL, the film seems a bit "done there": nuclear missiles are stolen and large real estate will go into kaboom if all the countries of the world do not pay a ransom of many kazillion in dollars. But at least producer Kevin McClory was fortunate to find himself forced to redo one of Bond's weaker adventures. For comparison, this effort blows THUNDERBALL out of the water. And despite the absence of many Bondian brands, the film succeeds on its own. 9 points. <br /> <br /> Productive Values: The film begins with a difficult style, like a TV movie that tries to be more than it can. But as the story progresses, the film gains momentum and a sense of purpose, making it a superior adventure. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Bonus points: There are several odd changes that distinguish this James Bond movie from the official series. Miss Moneypenny is barely recognized; as played by Edward Fox, "M" is an irritable old fool with no respect for the "Double Os", an omen of how Judi Dench would later play the part; and "Q" suddenly has a cockney accent and is a friend of all friends. And there is a curious sense of nostalgia throughout the film, such as replacing Bond's Astin-Martin with a vintage Packard and a tango dance number that is skillfully incorporated into the story. And a great rescue towards the end is on horseback, a tribute to THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, which was in itself a tribute to the James Bond films. 5 points. <br /> <br /> Summary: NEVER SAY AGAIN it is a mixed bag. In the really important areas, more than just holds thanks to the hero Connery, the bad Brandauer, the murderer Carrera and the damsel in distress Basinger. But the devil is in the details; As seemingly unimportant as the opening titles, opening titles and the like, the film is missing due to their absence. Everything comes out like a fake Bond movie; a great replacement, but still a substitute. <br /> <br /> Rating Bond-o-meter: 78 points out of 100.
