I personally love this movie in the midst of the Halloween series. I found, after watching it with many friends, that you like it completely, or find it absolutely unbearable. Personally, I've watched it dozens of times and it never gets old. There is a great story in the film itself and many different things are finally explained. It's a pretty short film, just 90 minutes, but it's definitely a thrill. <br /> <br /> The shape seems to be rather brutal in this film, but the acting is still there with the way he walks, chases and kills. There are a lot of small and sharp screens with Micheal appearing in the background, which adds more than a ghostly element to the film.
