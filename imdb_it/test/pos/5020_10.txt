This film is my favorite of all time. I'm sorry that IMDb is no longer positive about it. I hope this does not prevent those who have not tried to watch it. <br /> <br /> I've always loved this movie. I watch it about once a year and I'm always happy with the film again and in particular with the stellar interpretations of the entire cast. I always wondered if Jean Stapleton had actually finished the dance with Travolta ??? ? If anyone knows this piece of curiosity, please leave a comment. <br /> <br /> Thank you and have fun!
