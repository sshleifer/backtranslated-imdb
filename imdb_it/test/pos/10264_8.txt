If you need that instant buzz that only the Euro sex movies of the late 60s / early 70s can give, look no further because you've just stumbled upon the praise of the mother! The following exercise by TV director Schivazappa in psychedelic porn (of the soft core variety) cannot generally be considered a classic of its kind but affects many more well-known titles such as Tinto Brass, Jess Franco and Joe D'Amato for a cycle. Radley Metzger was sure of this way before anyone else when he collected this wonderfully twisted small number for distribution in the United States through his company Audubon. The splendid cinematography (which favors symmetrical compositions) can arouse cries of "pretentiousness" on the part of those who swear by poor leather gestures shot in someone's backyard. Hey, as far as I'm concerned, it's their loss for this is a chilling run of a movie with twists so, well, twisted that you might not believe him even after seeing them on the screen! Dagmar Lassander (immortalized as the hostess of the seed of Lucio Fulci HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY) has never been more beautiful than her here, subtly portraying the innocent (?) Researcher held hostage by the mad doctor Philippe Leroy (with all his 'favorite art-house for his name, you wonder if he has the good mood to mention this in his curriculum vitae as their initially violent "relationship" turns to the love story of S & M. Nothing is what it seems however in this ill and imaginative gem of a film with several truly erotic moments achieved with surprisingly minimal nudity.I was the first to be completely baffled and enchanted by the way Schivazappa chose to suggest oral sex during a scene (I let you discover for myself ... .) and Lassander's boogie wrapped in gauze for an incredibly groovy 60s melody should have become iconic in a similar way to the image of Sylvia Kristel who reclines on that sed ia of wicker in his days EMMANUELLE. Maybe you don't know this movie yet, but believe me, once you've seen it you'll never forget it !!!
