I LOVE Dr WHo SO much! I think David Tennant is the best Dr ever had and Billie Piper the best companion! I liked the way in which Dr and Rose had such a connection and a great relationship and the Dott approached a couple of times to express his love for the rose! It has sadly come to an end after only 2 seasons. I will miss looking at the piles of roses and thinking that the show will not be the same without Rose! But David is still there to make me laugh and make you happy to see him play this fantastic role! I consider this 110% show to be FANTASTIC! The graphics and monsters of this show are wonderful and each plot is different but somehow connected and I actually learned something about the love, the world and the relationships of this show. So it must be one of the most fantastic shows of all time!
