Rudy Rae Moore is going out of jail and is taking revenge! Often referred to as the Godfather of Rap, he should also be the Godfather of great movies. The non-stop action will keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you to ask for even more. Fortunately, Rudy returns as Dolemite in Human Tornado, so sit relaxed and have the rewind button ready because you won't believe your eyes !!
