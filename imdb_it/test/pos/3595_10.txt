This film is a love story set against the backdrop of war. Everything in the film was perfect. I just watched the movie yesterday and I want to have my DVD soon and watch it several times. The story ends when it started. I was very happy that he came back and I was proud of her to become a doctor and fulfill her father's dream. He honored his father, boyfriend and husband and his lover. The character had many nuances. Christian Bale is also a phenomenal actor. Some stories have a happy ending. Apart from the corner of the love story, I thought about how a beautiful, peaceful and peaceful island had been hit by the war and made me realize that the real war of devastation can have on its people ... the government takes the decision while people suffer. His father was a very educated man and wanted more for his daughter while he was having normal dreams. I loved the scene where he complains about not having a dowry and I also loved the scene in which they both experienced the earthquake. They had survived.
