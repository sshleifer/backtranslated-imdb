Sometimes the Academy does not recognize the potential of some films, or does not name them because they are controversial or strong. Sometimes they are nominated, but they win nothing (I hope this does not happen this year with "American Beauty"). This is exactly what happened with "Boogie Nights", which was the best film of 1997. The Academy preferred to give the best Oscar for the film "Titanic", a purely commercial and empty film, and other awards for overvaluation " Good Will Hunting "" and the irritating "Full Monty". The other photos that have been nominated in the main category are "LA Confidential" and "As Good as Gets", great films, but "Boogie Nights" is even better and would have had to be remembered in multiple categories. <br /> <br /> This extraordinary film tells the story of Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg, in a surprisingly large performance), a 17-year-old bartender who attracts the attention of Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds, in a saving drama, a porn movie director. Eddie has a special 'gift', and this helps him get into the world of porn movies. He changes his name to Dirk Diggler and starts making a huge success. fame does not last forever, other characters have it ro parallel stories: Amber Waves (Julianne Moore, perfect), Buck (Don Cheadle) and others, including Rollergirl (Heather Graham), an actress who agrees to do anything but has to wear her roller shoes. <br /> <br /> What could have been a trivial, trivial film, turns into a perfect, memorable in the hands of Paul Thomas Anderson. What makes "Boogie Nights" such a beautiful film is its execution, added to a clever and well-written script, to an excellent soundtrack, etc. Each character is very well developed and each of them has its importance in the context. Every feeling, weakness, fear and emotion is explored, resulting in a masterpiece of modern American cinema. <br /> <br /> "Boogie Nights" is a strong and impactful picture that should be seen by all those who really love cinema. Under a plot that seems trivial to the first impression, there is a wonderful story of ups and downs, things we face in our lives. It is an extraordinary portrait of the late 1970s and early 1980s, exactly an age of ups and downs. This is what makes this film so special and a true masterpiece. <br /> <br /> 10/10
