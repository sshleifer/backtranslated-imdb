Attention, it contains spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Italian sleaze films I've seen. <br /> <br /> The plot has a girl who is interested in occultism and has supernatural powers. His mother is a member of the Satanist group and is afraid of what influences he will have on the girl. No need to worry, the girl only knows what to do and there is no return, she belongs to Satan .. <br /> <br /> During the film strange things happen in typical Italian style, there is no it's too logical, but it's just a good thing. It's amazing how fun these movies are. In the final battle we see her and her mother fighting each other (naked off course) and doing some mysterious rituals, you could guess who wins ... The final photos of the films leave you open mouth and wander around why can't there be more movies like this? <br /> <br /> There is superb music throughout the entire film and the actors are pretty good, better than usual in this type of film. Above all, Anne Heywood looks and does a good deed. It also has some unusual cameras and gles and stuff like that, so it's not boring at all. My rating is 10. <br /> <br /> I hope someone releases it on DVD.
