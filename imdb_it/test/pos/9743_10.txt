As stated in one of my great reviews, Universal Pictures' FLASH GORDON Trilogy should not be classified with other serials. Because, in fact, the three of them made a sort of electronic celluloid mythology for an incisive, phobic world of war, mid-twentieth century. They stand alone in the minds of many people like the example of what used to be a coat hanger. <br /> <br /> We can remember seeing Buster Crabbhe as a guest on NBC's late-night talk show, TOMORROW, hosted by Tom Snyder. This was around 1979-80. During the interview with Crabbe, he was asked about his personal fitness habits. He accredited weight training and swimming, combined with some healthy eating habits - which included vitamin and protein supplements. (And you would believe it, he smoked several cigarettes!) <br /> <br /> When questioned about his career, Mr. Snyder, of course, addressed the issue of his interpretation (and strong identification with) of the character of Flash. Buster said he had read and appreciated the feature in its original media, which is a comic strip owned by Hearst's King Features Syndicate. He said he thought it wouldn't work once it was transferred to the screen! Fortunately he was wrong. <br /> <br /> As for the first series, it was a great adaptation of the original Sunday Color Comics continuity. The world is about to end due to the imminent collision with Planet Mongo. It is the task of Dr. Zarkov, who works independently, to launch missiles on the wild planet to change course. He enlists the help of Flash and Miss Dale Arden, a newly discovered parachute from an airliner, which lands in Zarkov's property. <br /> <br /> The Serial has excitement and manages to make people feel that there is always some other danger lurking just outside the frame of the film. The costume and the furnishings are varied, from the Romanesque to the oriental up to the Art Decco. It would be easy to assume that this is due to frugality on the part of Universal, but again this was true to the creator, the visual concepts of cartoonist Alex Raymond (just look at the old strips as reprints in many collections) The rockets were used before in JUST IMAGINE! (Fox 1930), a sci-fi musical comedy. The other scientific laboratory equipment was provided by Universal to the department, being the best Hollywood company in the field of horror and skiing. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Jean Rogers (Dale Arden) and Priscilla Lawson (Princess Aura) joining a good girl against a bad girl battle on Flash. Charles Middleton plays the emperor Ming in a sort of melodramatic evil, but makes it work. Zarkov (Frank Shannon) is attenuated by the sheer madness he suffered in his appearance in newsprint. (By the way, do you ever wonder how Zar-KOV did with a brogue?) Richard Alexander makes a powerful and powerful Prince Barin, always available and so noble. <br /> <br /> The comedian Jack "Tiny" Lipson is the surprise of the cast, stealing scene after scene like a lascivious, Henry VIII's villain turned into an ally, King Vultan, ruler of the hawks. Among others, the most notable is Jim Pierce as Prince Thun of the Lion Men. Pierce, like Crabbe, had also played Tarzan in a movie, but later married Tarzan Creator, the daughter of Edgar Rice Bourroughs, Joan. <br /> <br /> FLASH GORDON and the two sequels, FLASH GORDON's TRIP TO MARS (1938) and FLASH GORDON CONQUER THE UNIVERSE (1940), have been a basic youthful food for generations, first in film companies and then in Television. Like good wine, they have seen themselves improve with age. <br /> <br /> We are all so happy that Mr.Crabbe was wrong.
