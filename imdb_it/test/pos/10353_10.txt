Totally disgusting and cheap obscene humor. I loved it !!! It is the most disgusting and totally horrible film, with the exception of Nicolas Read, who plays an undead court jester, for a brilliant comedy. But for me, I laughed so many times and I have to give it to the directors, it wasn't pretentious or ordinary in any way. Kidnapping, fighting, zombies spewing out on their victims of rape. What other movie does this have? Not for courtesy, but with a pizza, a bong and a six-pack of beer, you did it, if you have a cast-iron stomach and a sense of youthful humor like me.
