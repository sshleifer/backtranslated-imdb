This film offers you a fascinating journey through one of today's most exciting cities - Istanbul - and its musicians. Don't expect a compilation of Turkish folklore or something like that. Alexander Hacke, a German musician and member of the cult group "Einst√ºrzende Neubauten" travels to Istanbul to learn about the music scene. His voice spread over what he lives is a guideline through the film. But above all the Turkish-German director Faith Akin allows various Istanbul artists to speak and, of course, their music. <br /> <br /> A variety of characters, big stars and street musicians meet, young and old, people who play many different musical styles. But this film doesn't just introduce you to the sound of Istanbul. It also attracts a convincing picture of Istanbul today and how Turkey has made progress over the last decade. The film characterizes its protagonists with subtle humor, but never without respect. Everyone shares a passion for music and faith in his power. <br /> <br /> Akin once again demonstrates his talent for portraying diversity with ease when he brings you to completely different music scenes. After his award-winning feature film "Gegen die Wand" (Head on), Faith Akin demonstrates with "Crossing the Bridge" that he is equally able to touch, entertain and guide his audience in a documentary. If you've never been to Istanbul, you'll want to go there after watching the movie.
