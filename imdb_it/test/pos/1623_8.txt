So first thing .. <br /> <br /> Angels and Demons is a much better film and very different from the Da-Vinci code. <br /> <br /> After the recent series of comic films, remakes and questionable resurrections of aged franchises. It's refreshing to watch a very solid and fun movie that is free of tremendous cam-shooting techniques, lens flares, excessive GCIs and the most important action sequences. <br /> <br /> Angels and Demons seem almost old-fashioned in this regard. It offers a good and considered debate on the old theme of religion against science, offers an overview of the parallels between the great houses of God in Rome (magnificently photographed by the way) and the temple of modern science which is the great CERN Hanks is Hanks who pretends to be the smart guy and adapts better to the second role than his wooden performance in Da-Vinci. good support is offered by a solid rock cast, with a particular emphasis on Armin Mueller-Stahl's stoic cardinal. but the main thing that saves the film is its rhythm. for the duration of the film I was totally absorbed in the story and the film never gave me the time to sit down and find its flaws in logic. <br /> <br /> My only serious criticism is that part of the described science is at best debatable concerning the authenticity of the real world. But it is not the fault of filmmakers, rather an observation of the old adage that one should never allow the truth to hinder a good story. <br /> <br /> About which the story is a cracker, mixing adventure and a race against time with a good deal of intelligence and a nice round or two along the way. <br /> <br /> In general I highly recommend it to fans of both national treasure films (which this clearly imitates but with a much more serious atmosphere) and fans of adventure stories in general.
