I first came out of a Coen movie and didn't know how to hear it. The two best examples are The Big Lebowski and Fargo. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so full of strange humor that I liked it. On the other hand, there were some useless reveries with flying people and murderous bowling balls that didn't seem to fit the film's patterns. However, I liked the movie and now I have a copy. Fargo made me howl with hysteria, sometimes I wasn't sure why I was laughing so hard that it made me cry, but still I was. There were many seemingly strange characters in Fargo, but after further investigation, they were really just real people talking about real situations. This is why the man with the shovel (or broom) was so blatantly funny when he was telling the police officer about a strange-looking man in the bar the other night. And that is also why the theater burst out laughing when it said that there are some funny looking clouds coming in. (I also own a copy of this film) The Coens have a way of masking their film and their characters as something eccentric and maybe a little off the wall. But if you look more closely at some of the same characters that seem funny, you will always find that, in some strange way, they all sound real. This is what is exceptional about O Brother Where Art You? This is a movie that is out there. I mean, it's not even in the same field as a traditional movie. I saw the movie Shaft last summer and in it I said that Shaft was a film that I saw thousands of times before. But one cannot say about this on a film by Coen Brother and it certainly cannot be said of this. <br /> <br /> This film has everything in it from a prison, crooked Southern politicians, muses, references to what I can only suppose are historical figures, river baptisms, bank robberies, violence towards animals, herds of religious fanatics, KKK, lynchings and so on. Obviously there are also many references to Homer's Odyssey, but I wouldn't know, because I never read Homer in the Odyssey and I didn't even know a thing about it. All the other newspaper reviewers seem to know everything about it and think that this cynicism and almost false quality of the film make the film much better. Well, coming from a guy who doesn't know anything about it, I can tell you that it's still a funny movie. There were times when, as usual for a Coen film, I wasn't sure why I entertained myself or laughed, but I was. <br /> <br /> This is a street photo where three men travel down the road to find a hidden treasure that Clooney says he hid from his other two cell mates. He must carry them on because they were chained to him when they had the chance to escape. <br /> <br /> I like all the main actors in the film and many of them are Coen's comrades. It was good to see Goodman again. It was nice to see Hunter and especially Turturro who seems to have a place in every Coen film. Too bad they haven't found a place for Steve Buscemi, but this is a different story, all together. But back to Clooney. Man has only charisma. He is also a great actor and here he is not as lame as the others, but he too has his idiosyncrasies. His work here is really fantastic and I really hope this shows that he is capable of playing any kind of character. <br /> <br /> Now, after collecting all these praises in the film, let me also say this. At first I didn't really like the movie. I found it quite boring and a little boring. There were too many ideas in here and there wasn't enough care to exploit them for everything they were worth. But then the film started to grow on me. It took a while, but it grew on me. I don't think this is their best film, but it's still a good movie and I give it an 8.5. But the reason I recommend this film is just for a reason. <br /> <br /> Every day you can go take a look at the newspaper and watch the movies that are playing and tell yourself, seen, seen, oh, I saw it last year, it's the same of this film and is the same as that movie. Most films have been recycled in one form or another. Not Coen's films. They haven't been recycled and if they are I don't know anything. This is reason enough to see something they put out. Originality matters a lot in my books. The Coens are original and are good. And this is not common in today's cinema. Enjoy them while they are allowed to make movies. Because you don't have a vision like that in many movies, so when you do, have fun!
