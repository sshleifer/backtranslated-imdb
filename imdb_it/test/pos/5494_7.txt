This is another of Eastwood's many films that mix intrigue, action and a touch of romance, along with "The Gauntlet", "Firefox" and so on. Clint's acting range is now quite familiar. In this, he is taciturn and a little outrageous, especially with women and superiors. There are no surprises in his performance. But the film itself is something of a surprise; is above average. <br /> <br /> Clint is Frank, a secret service agent who, perhaps in a moment of doubt, failed to capture the bullet that killed JFK. Then he started drinking, which took away his family, and now he trudges through the bureaucracy until he is contacted by John Malkovitch, calling himself "Booth", who establishes a sort of distorted relationship with him based on their disenchanted and shared condemnation. that everything has no meaning other than the impulse to escape sadness and predictability. Now, this is rather a set of recessive attitudes for an artist like Clint to project, but he does it quite well, less robots than usual. And the memory of that moment in Dallas seems to carry with it like a weight of stone. It was tested again in the middle of the film. He hangs from the roof of a tall building, grabbing Booth's hand, and pulling the gun and pointing it at Booth, who asks him if he is really willing to shoot. If he does, of course, he saves the president from an attempted murder by a CIA-trained assassin, but he does so at the cost of his own life. Booth makes him understand the situation while holding hands in midair. And Clint also has a brief speech, talking to Renee Russo, about his failure to save the president in Dallas. "If I reacted quickly enough, I could have made that shot ... and it would have been all right with me." He is underrated, but his voice chokes slightly, his eyes water and his lip trembles. It is one of the few scenes in all of Clint's films that could properly be called "in motion". We know from his new resolution that, given another chance, he would take the bullet this time. (The irony is that he doesn't like the current president, who could? He makes pompous speeches in Colorado about how they "carved a nation out of the desert". Didn't they do the same thing in Las Vegas?) <br /> It is often said that a film is only as good as its bad. It is not true, nothing is so simple, but in this case one could argue for its truth value. The reptile John Malkovitch with his Tartar eyes is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about disillusioned. Okay, it can soften it up a bit, sniffing with disdain, even if it connects two innocent hunters between the eyes, but it's fascinating on the screen. Renee Russo has little to do. Fred Thompson, as the White House's main helper, is back in politics, a relief for film-goers. If Clint's acting range is limited, Thompson's is less. In every film in which he has been, he carries the same solemn and unsatisfied expression, as if he were constantly tormented by some form of volcanic digestive disorder. <br /> <br /> The direction of Wolfgang Peterson is as good as that of "Das" Boot, "which is quite good. There is a great deal of usual cross cuts in the final shooting. And when Clint and Russo fall into a passionate embrace in his hotel room and fall backwards towards the bed like two weasels in heat, Peterson playfully shows his feet together with a series of objects falling on the floor - not just the usual clothes but handcuffs, pistols, beeps, palm pilots, Dick Tracy wristwatches and other impediments. Interrupted, Clint lies down on the bed and sighs, "Now I have to put all that stuff back." <br /> <br /> Well written and worth looking at.
