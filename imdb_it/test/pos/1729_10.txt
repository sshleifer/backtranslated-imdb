Ok, I grew up on Who, but I didn't love a doctor from Tom Baker. Christopher Eccleston made me love again Who and I will be furious with him forever. <br /> <br /> The writing is great, the acting superb, the direction (which was terrible in the old days) is simply fantastic. I was very skeptical about this program, and I only watched it to be forced, but now I'm a big fan and I love it (I have a Dalek ringtone that screams "Exterminate" then). <br /> <br /> Some of the things I love about the new program - 1) people actually notice when Rose (Billie Piper) disappears from the planet. Some of the old ones show that an assistant would stop for a while, and then he will come back home as if nothing had happened, nobody noticed. 2) Chris Eccleston's doc loves Rose - whether romantic or not will be discussed, but there is no doubt that he loves and cares for his partner. It would destroy the world if it were to save it, which was missing from the old show - often a doctor would not be interested if he never saw his assistants again. 3) They talk and think like real people - when Rose is shown something bizarre or new (like aliens) she behaves like a real person - she stuns. I never liked it when an old show assistant, who never saw anything alien, adapted and adapted instantly. I want to see the surprise on Rose's face when she sees a plastic mannequin come to life. She gives it to me. <br /> <br /> The few things that I don't like about this series: 1) almost everything happens on earth (London or Cardiff) and I was hoping for a type of show more out of the world. 2) That Eccleston has left so quickly, he really made the show brilliant. <br /> <br /> But I can let those few things go - I like it a lot more than I ever expected, so I don't care if they have stuff on the ground. <br /> <br /> Just don't take this show seriously: it's fun, it's smart, it's fun, but it's not a heavy and super serious show. It's pure fun and pure English, and I can't get enough. Look at it with an open mind, and put your brain in a neutral position and have fun! <br /> <br /> ps - don't watch series 2 or later. series 1 was brilliant, the first episodes of series 2 were good, but don't watch it once it arrives at Love and Monsters. Absolutely rubbish, it completely destroys the show.
