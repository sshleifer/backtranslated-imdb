1891: Stalwart, a morally erect military doctor, Lieutenant Claude de Ross (solid Claudio Cassinelli) and many other survivors of the shipwreck fall to the shore on a remote tropical island ruled with an iron fist by the ruthless and sadistic Edmund Rackham (beautifully interpreted by the Richard Johnson's delightfully slimy hilt, who lives on the island with the exuberant Amanda Martin (a captivating and compelling performance by Barbara Bach) and her shattered father biologist rogue Professor Ernest Martin (a wonderfully obtuse portrait of Joseph Cotten). In addition, de Ross discovers that Professor Martin has control over a dangerous breed of fish animals that are exploited as slave labor by Rackham. The director / co-author Sergio Martino tells the lively and engaging story at a steady pace, offers a tasty evocation of the lush and remote tropical environment, does an expert job in creating and maintaining a disturbing and mysterious atmosphere in the terrifying third opening, further enriches things with a nice line of dry humor, and stages the heady climax loaded with action with remarkable roaring aplomb. While the central premise is obviously inspired by "The Island of Dr. Moreau", the story still has a great freshness and intrigue thanks to the wise fusion of elements as diverse as voodoo, the lost underwater city of Atlantis, an exciting destructive world volcanic eruption, buried treasure, unscrupulous genetic experiments, and even some thrilling fights between de Ross and Rackham during the exciting conclusion in a whole dynamic, imaginative and often immensely fun ensemble. The sound of the robust cast qualifies as a further advantage: Cassinelli is a nice hero, Johnson stirs his juicy villain with a huge smack of lips, Bach is a pretty attractive damsel in distress, besides there are contributions of Beryl Cunningham support like the left voodoo priestess Shakira, Franco Iavarone as the superstitious Jose, and Roberto Posse as the embarrassed jerk Peter. Giancarlo Fernando's sumptuous widescreen cinematography offers a wide range of visual effects while Luciano Michelini's throbbing tribal hits the funky spot. Even the amphibious creatures of human human fish look rather bizarre. An extremely funny film.
