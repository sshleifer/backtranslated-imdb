I can't believe how many excellent actors can be in a show. It is realism and acting that makes it real. This was the best comedy ever created to date and I love Seinfeld and Everyone Loves Ramond. It is simply fabulous and it seems that everyone in my family agrees. It is not my opinion alone. The whole world seems to talk about different incidents and try to rebuild them. My hat to the crew. Some shows have an actor that makes the whole show. This plot comedy has a parade (8). This is what makes it so amazing. Some people pray for health, wealth or fame. I pray that the show will never end. Sure John. LKHUBBLE2@talkamerica.net
