The man with the golden arm was one of the first films to have the tragedy of heroin addiction as the main theme (and, in some respects, the message). It is not even remotely a great film, but its importance lies in the dedication of Otto Preminger to making it feel real and at the margins of melodrama and naturalism. What I liked is that it's not so much an exhibition of drug addicts (if you want the best exposure of what Naked Lunch reads, if you can overcome it anyway, besides the point), but the nature of the urban environment of Frankie Machine lives . He expects that after he got out of jail for dealing, he went straight and narrow, to become a drummer in a band and make him legitimate as a musician. But he has his "paralyzed" wife Zosch, who can't work and needs money and often complains, and then there's the old neighborhood - he can't escape seeing Louie (Darren McGavin), who is still making games of back cards and, yes, push drugs. Like Mean Streets, it's difficult to escape the minutia unless you leave it. <br /> <br /> But then again, it's hard for Frankie Machine not to try to operate naturally in this urban neighborhood. It is just that he cannot escape the temptation of garbage (when he is booked with a false charge of theft with his friend, he sees an addict who goes mad, and forgets the fear of going back to his clean self). And personifying Frankie is Sinatra, and I can't see anyone else who could have interpreted it, not even Brando's original choice. It fits into the neighborhood and looks like the kind of guy that should be a step ahead of the game. But there is also a vulnerability to Sinatra that he pulls off wonderfully, and when we see him turning "cold turkey" in Molly's apartment, it's credible even if it's not the kind of thing that "my" generation would think of heroin (ie Trainspotting and certainly Requiem for a Dream). If for anything else, you want to see the movie to see what happens to Sinatra like this character. <br /> <br /> The flaws, however, come in some of the other performances, although it's a bit complicated. Eleanor Parker seems to exaggerate for much of the film, to deceive Frankie who is really paralyzed when in fact she can walk and tease him for one reason or another. But then it becomes clearer as it goes on - she should be crazy, and mad with jealousy, and at that level she starts to improve. Meanwhile, Kim Novak is good, though not worthy of Vertigo, as the possible girl in the part but more as the voice of reason in history. Then there is a detective Bendar, who could be one of the characters / shows with only one note ever. And also Sparrow, Frankie's nerdy friend, and the characters of Louie and Schiefka, and they're all played as you'd expect them to be (actually, McGavin is better than OK). As for the casting of other talents around Sinatra, Preminger doesn't do great things. And frankly, some scenes fall flat. <br /> <br /> But there is a lot of charm in the Man with the golden arm, and not just as a dated piece of sociological interest. It works like a compelling drama and like a message transmitted without being a preacher or campy. It is a genuine article, just not exceptional.
