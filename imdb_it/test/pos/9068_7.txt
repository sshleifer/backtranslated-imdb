The plot of this film is quite plausible, but the script required a disturbing boy to play the lead role, and in 1940 that meant Peter Lorre. And Peter is at its scariest in this as the owner of the island Stephen Danel, who takes his prisoners to work in his island's diamond mine. Upon arrival, the freed words discover that they are worker slaves of the mines who can be beaten or killed by the whim of Danel. <br /> <br /> Only two things seem to have it worse than the slaves; Danel's wife and the monkeys. The monkeys make him fall in love so much that his violence towards them probably leads to the only flesh that the slaves can get. <br /> <br /> Lorre is perfect in his role here, and insinuates the screen with industrial strength. Although the script is not as big as Casablanca, the editing is very tight and there are no wasted scenes. This is a very watchable story, but I'm not sure which little place this movie has filled. Too long for a short topic, and too short for a feature film, I'm not sure how this was distributed to the cinemas. <br /> <br /> I just picked up TCM for the first time late at night / early morning showing. Lorre fans won't want to lose it if they haven't seen it.
