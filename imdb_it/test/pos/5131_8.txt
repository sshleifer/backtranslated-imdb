I saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for children. A little predictable. The book was better, provided more details of the plot, information on the environment and how children discovered the conspiracy. I think Hiassen's distorted humor is better in the book than in the film, but there were also many funny moments in the film. Probably a little too slow for children under 6 years of age. I really enjoyed the casting of Jimmy Buffet as a science teacher. And those little owls were adorable. I wonder how they managed to film them. The film showed a lot of Florida at its best, made it very attractive. Am I imagining it or did the author Carl Hiassen make a brief appearance?
