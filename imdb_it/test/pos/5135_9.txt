This is a delightful gem of a movie, unfortunately pigeonhole like "only for kids". The plot revolves around a young man, Roy Eberhardt, who has just arrived in southwest Florida from the mountains of Montana. Trying to adapt to the other children in his middle school, Roy discovers a brother-sister team trying to protect the endangered den owls on an illegal construction site. Look for Carl Hiassen, the author of the book on which this film is based, as the male secretary of the evil leader at the corporate headquarters. Writer / director Wil Shriner is also the employee of the Public Records Office, where intrepid teen-detectives discover that the incriminating environmental impact report is missing. Luke Wilson almost steals all the crucial scenes of the charming teenage actors who have most of the best lines. Wilson is the innocent police officer in his three-wheeled electric police cart complete with blue light and funky siren. As a Dave officer, he tries so hard to do well, but usually ends up falling into manure, literally! Several times! Jimmy Buffet is rather low as the tacitly sympathetic science teacher. But the young actors Logan Lerman (Roy), Brie Larson (Beatrice the Bear) and Cody Linley (Mullet Fingers) are as superb as the guys who eventually put Agent Dave on the right track, following in the wake of the card left by the villain company boss. I hope you get away from this movie feeling as good as me. Simply fun! A small complaint, though. I hope all non-florids realize that not everyone from Florida is so grumpy with newcomers as depicted in this film. We are really a friendly group! Just ask Carl Hiassen and Jimmy Buffet !!
