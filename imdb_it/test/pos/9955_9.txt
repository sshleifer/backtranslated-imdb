one of my favorite lines in Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> * We have not finished with you for a long shot *, so not only does Shylock not get his kilo of meat, nor the 3000 or 6,000 or 36,000 (each of the 6 pieces were ducats) ducats, in a matter of minutes is ruined by having to give up all his possessions. and his daughter has already abandoned him for a long time. <br /> <br /> Revenge is a dish that should be served cold. but Shylock's attempt at revenge completely fails. <br /> <br /> I suspect that this comedy was and is popular because it respects our desire for justice. but the harsh reality is that the world is engulfed by injustice and most of it stands. some big names are thrown in prison, but the punk gangs lose their territory for the "good guys" but in reality most of the time it is the opposite. <br /> <br /> but not in this game. the long screams of racism and anti-Semitism forget that it could have been any other group of social outcasts that gets the right punishment, it's just that the money lenders of the time were Jews and therefore the needs of the plot put Shylock the Jew bad. <br /> <br /> Merchant of Venice is my third favorite work of Shakespeare, 1 and 2 are Hamlet and Macbeth. this production offers an excellent treatment of the moral of the story. it's worth watching the scenes with the suitors alone. also the embarrassment of the new husbands who writhed and minimized the fact that they let the rings they had sworn to keep forever easily slip away. in real life, this trick is the thing that the spouses use timidly to remind their sweetheart that promises MUST mean something and not be done frivolously. there is a much deeper meaning to this comedy than just the comic / dramatic aspect. it's about loyalty, commitment and love. <br /> <br /> it is worth looking at yourself again and again.
