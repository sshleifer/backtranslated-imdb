I have to admit that this is one of Cameron Diaz's unreleased films and I was also surprised to have an important role, but it wasn't the main character. I was very touched by the fact that I can really identify the pain of losing a loved one as I experienced it up close. <br /> <br /> Both Camilla Belle and Jordana Brewster were really good in their portrayal of the protagonist Phoebe and I also have to deliver it to the castings to find two actresses who look so similar that I really thought they were sisters real). This is one of those films that Cameron did for acting and not for writing stars. He played the part of the wonderful and rebellious hippie who wants to change the world even if sometimes he presents himself as a rebel without a cause. > <br /> Coming from a dysfunctional family in which her only source of strength is her older sister Faith, Phoebe is understandably very upset when faith leaves for Europe. Growing up, she goes in search of her sister and gradually becomes disillusioned with the truth about her sister and falls in love with her sister's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Great history and equally large locations around Europe. again.
