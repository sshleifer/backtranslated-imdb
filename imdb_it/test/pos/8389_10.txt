Bastardi senza glory does not make excuses, does not ask for forgiveness, is an assault to the senses with no holds barred. Tarantino does not care if he offends, if he moves on stereotypes and clich√©s, this is a film that makes him better. It's nice to see a director whose work clearly isn't interspersed with the powers that are. Tarantino is a master in effortlessly engaging immense tensions and suddenly mixing it with loud laughter; you are not sure if you should look away in disgust or roll around laughing, in any case it is a roller coaster and one not to be missed! It is not for everyone and I'm not sure how the Germans will take the film, certainly if you are not a fan of Tarantino's style, this could be a bit difficult to digest, but in any case, it is a film that simply must be seen This self-respecting cinema fan should not miss this. And the exhibition by Christoph Waltz ... Oscar does not dare to ignore it !!
