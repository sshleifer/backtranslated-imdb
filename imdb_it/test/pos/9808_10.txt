Even people who do not like the film, usually because they find the ending confused, should appreciate the strong acting of Elijah Wood & Joseph Mazello who played the two young protagonists of this film. <br /> <br /> Spoiler WARNING: In a literal level, the end makes no sense. People who think the ending makes sense at other levels are divided between those who think that the younger brother was killed by the stepfather or the only time that Mike (the older boy) was away to take care of the gang neighborhood, or have flown away the place of desire in his chariot to escape the situation through death and those 2) who think that his younger brother is imaginary and that his flight in the cart turned into a flying machine signals his overcoming of the abusive situation. <br /> <br /> I favor 2). It makes a lot of sense in terms of how many children face situations of abuse. It is not uncommon for an abused child to divide his psyche and project the abused self into something else; a stuffed animal, even an imaginary friend. In this way, it makes much more sense that he is always the younger boy who is abused and never Mike. In fact, it is unlikely that one of the two brothers will suffer any abuse, even if this happens. Furthermore, it is Bobby, the younger brother who is also the encouraging, who insists on being able to overcome the situation. Furthermore, the death of a real-life brother through abuse would have been too upsetting for an adult with this in his story to turn into such an optimistic fantasy ending.
