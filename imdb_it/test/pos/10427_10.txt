This must be one of the best films we've seen and we highly recommend it for its exposure to the injustices of bigotry. Billy Wirth is an incomparable and truly fantastic actor like Corby / White Wolf. However, he felt that the story would be improved if his character had more scenes. This is a film that can be watched over and over without getting tired.
