Just to clarify, Matthew Poncelet was not a real person, but a combination of 2 murderers who were sentenced and sentenced to death for a murder of two teenagers. <br /> <br /> I have read users' comments and react as if Matthew were real. The character is based on a mixture of two murderers, Elmo Patrick Sonnier and Robert Lee Willie (who murdered separate people) and the murder itself was based on what Willie had committed. The conflict of both that Willie had someone else present and both sides swore on the other the murder was included in the story. <br /> <br /> Prejean's approach is unique in the sense that it is not only assisting the condemned waiting for their death and helping them to take responsibility for their actions, it also addresses the families of the victims, to help them to know that the prisoner did, indeed feel remorse for what they did, effectively helping both parties. <br /> <br /> All the posts here seem to have strong convictions about the Death Sentence. It is not my place to say that it is right or wrong - in theory punishing death with death has a kind of karmic sense, yet denying a person his freedom for the rest of his days, even if expensive, makes more sense for me - being locked in a small room 23/7 (with an hour of exercise) for the rest of their days to be reminded of the cruel thing that seemed a more appropriate punishment: they are technically alive, but denied from living. To say that someone killed someone so that they could escape the responsibilities required by the person they killed (like Susan Smith who kills her poor children by pushing her car into a lake). I find it ironically appropriate that they would not get the "freedom" they crave and that now they will have to spend the rest of their imprisoned days. <br /> <br /> The Prejean point comes very well into the story. He has my respect - he manages to find that balance - he does not support a murderer, he is guiding them to accept what they have done. If they do not feel any kind of remorse, they would not ask for spiritual guidance. <br /> <br /> Ona's final note, when Poncelet apologizes to Delacroix's parent for killing his son, the parents of the murdered girl murmurs something about why he did not apologize for his death. I think the point was that throughout the film, Poncelet denies having killed both children. There is a doubt in Prejean's mind that he did both murders - there is a friend who was sentenced but not to death - my thought is that Poncelet killed Delacroix's boyfriend and the other killed the girl - so Poncelet was taking responsibility for what he did. If he had been responsible for the girl's death, he would probably have apologized for that too.
