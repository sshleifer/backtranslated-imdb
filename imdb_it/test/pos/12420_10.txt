I just managed to see Monster Man yesterday. It had been a long wait and after a lot of expectations and growth, I am happy to say that it arrived and met my expectations at all levels. True, you can't really expect too much from hearing the plot, but after reading some reviews, I was ecstatic. I mean, what rubbish fan wouldn't want to see a gore movie on a deranged ringed idiot who mows people with his monster truck? I waited for a cross between Road Trip and The Hills Have Eyes and I got a lot more. This was a horror comedy that really worked. The directors understood well when it came to making you squirm and at the same time make them howl with laughter. Congratulations to Michael Davis for doing everything possible with blood and pushing the envelope with sick humor. Let me just list a few reasons why I love this movie so much: First of all it's the story. He was killed in so many other films. A college boy has the wind that his childhood crush is getting married. He, being the twenty-five year old virgin who is, jumps on his Vista Cruiser and decides to make the journey to confess his love, hoping that he will fall headlong on the hills and on all that beautiful jive. Hidden in the back seat of his station wagon, he is a good Harley friend. Harley is the talkative, former friend, who laughs and talks just like Jack Black in High Fidelity. You can't help but love the guy, but if he were your friend in real life, you should keep a wad of whiffle ball handy (laugh all you want, but have you ever been hit with one?) To keep him under control So, he is a bit unpleasant, to put it mildly, but it can be said that he is a loyal friend, after all ... Anyway, I'm on the road and when they stop at a bar, they aggravate the locals. Now they are chased by a leather clone on a monster truck. That's all. Yes, along the way they take a beautiful hitchhiker but I'm too lazy and hungry to enter right now ... so just look at that damn movie. <br /> <br /> The second thing I love was humor. This has had some of the sickest laughs of any Cabin Fever movie. How messy is it? Well, I won't even go into the whole cat scene and as for the "corpse burrito" thing, I'll leave it to your virgin eyes. The bar full of amputees was a little creepy, and that boy who looked like John Turturro bothered me too much. Harley, even if he is a totally hateful kind of frat-boy, can really stick out of the covers. I love clogs, by the way. I need a new couple .. <br /> <br /> The GORE. This pours him heavy. While the first hour takes place as a demented street comedy, the last third concerns blood and courage. If the film had not kept such a clear tone everywhere, it would have been a little creepy, but seeing how it was all played for laughter, it is not possible for you to be annoyed. If you are still in your seat the moment you arrive, you will probably also see humor, but seriously, there were buckets of red stuff. There was a great plot round that I HAD NOT seen coming and when the credits rolled, I was completely satisfied. I got exactly what I came for and I'm really glad I bought it. Just like Cabin Fever, it will get a lot of replay. <br /> <br /> The look of the film was exceptional. There was this deliberately economic look that made everything scream at the end of the 80s and I adored exaggerated colors. It is obvious that Monster Man was made with a relatively low budget, but very similar to Cabin Fever (sorry if I keep comparing the two) it really works in favor of the film. Cabin Fever was an ode to the great 70s, this was the answer of the 80s to this. So take it for what it's worth. No CGI here. This is what we all need. I'm not exactly sure why a movie wasn't released because that's all that Jeepers Creepers SHOULD have been. Thank God for Lions Gate.
