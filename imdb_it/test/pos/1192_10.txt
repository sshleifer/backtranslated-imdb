I won't say anything about music, because this topic can be so profound that it can become a huge separate review, so let's focus on the film that is brilliant ... Without doubt, one of Forman's best works. <Br /> <br /> The simple story of love, friendship, freedom and ideals ... oh yes, the ideals for which even pacifists are ready to go to war ... <br /> <br /> Not there is only one false word, a single false character, a single false feeling in history, because love, freedom and friendship are not something complicated for the characters in the film. These things are not something that "everyone can see from different angles" These are not things that need much thinking to understand ... their love is simple, their friendship is simple, their ideals are as simple as the word " simple "and that is why these characters are so profound. <br /> <br /> Berger, the leader of a hippie played by Treat Williams is a guy who lives to live and this is the greatest happiness for him ... he has his ass - (as he sings in one of the scenes of the film) and just to make him happy with his property ... <br /> <br /> Berger never accepts that something cannot be done ... and his right ... If he wants to go to the banquet of some rich with his old dirty clothes and huge long hair, he will ... if he wants to go to another state to see only his friend, he will not ... he never thinks twice ... he does it and that's enough. <br /> <br /> How? why is it so powerful? the answer is simple: because it's FREE. <br /> <br /> Just look at how the wind is waving your hair in this movie and you'll understand everything, maybe you'll get rid of it too.
