This movie was fun. He provided a rather comical view of the British club scene, which, if you really look at it, is a fun thing. The characters in this movie were so realistic for those of us who watched here that it was like watching a movie about us. <br /> <br /> There were some key scenes that really made this movie work: the movie preparing the scenes; the scene "Take me a real doctor"; the white background scene that shows each character in a total sinking state, ending with the infamous phrase "what was I saying?" and the sunup comedown scenes. I experienced these moments myself and found myself laughing hysterically at my ridiculous behavior. <br /> <br /> I can't give this film a 10 because it's not as good as Groove, which I thought was out of this world, but it certainly has its moments. The staging and the work with the camera are exceptional, the special effects are noteworthy and the acting is fantastic. <br /> <br /> After waiting a long time for this film, I am pleased to say that I was not disappointed. I hope to see more from the writer / director in the future.
