When it comes to political films, I usually go out feeling empty. They generally take on a moralistic attitude and you have a clear story against a bad story as if it were some kind of Batman movie. <br /> <br /> But with Lumumba it is the first film I saw that showed politics for what it is, and the real problem of trying to govern a country of destroyed people who have not known other rules than violence. There were neither good nor bad, there were only interests and conflicts of interest. This is the only political film in my opinion that we can get out of it by really learning something. Especially for anyone dealing with politics as a career that this film shows you, you can't decide what you want for a country, but what your country wants. <br /> <br /> That's why I disagree with a lot of reviews that say everybody comes in bad, I think they're too idealistic, (Belgians want the perfect colony, Lumumba wants a perfect unitary Congo, Tshombe wants wealth and wealth, America wants the perfect ally against communism, Russia wants perfect help for communism). And the Congolese? They come out used and abused, (the best example in the film when Général Janssens tells his black troops your government has lied to you and leaves them all in turmoil) are always pulled and pushed to support this person or another. /> <br /> This film shows in politics a mistake that can cost you dearly and this film makes a mistake after an error until it intensifies and ends up destroying the country. Their intentions could be good (or at least in the opinion of the characters), but they are all the errors that lead to the fall of the Congo. I don't think anyone is bad in this movie, I just think they want too much from sick people to give and want to start taking. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not just the best political film, it's a great film in general. Acting is fabulous (Eriq Ebouaney as Lumumba was a perfect casting, I really believe it) impeccable screenplay, retouching of perfect rhythms and a higher production value than I expected for a Central African film. A must watch.
