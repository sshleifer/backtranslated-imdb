I really enjoyed this movie. It effectively combines humor, fantasy and some moments of horror with a solid film that makes effort from Higuchinsky. Brilliant images and a very original story about spirals. My only complaints are that he had his boring moments and wasn't as bold as he could have been. However, I give him a solid 8 out of 10. The United States should take note of this and other beautiful Japanese horror / fantasy films that have recently arrived and have them available on the Region 1 DVD. General has some of the most beautiful films that have been noticed by the American public because they are hard to find. I strongly advise people to go and look for these treasures, they are hard to find, but once you find them, you will be glad you did.
