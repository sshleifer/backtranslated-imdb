I thought the film was good, but I like to read the real story behind the films "based on a true story". Does anyone know the names and positions of the actual characters on which the film is based? I did a full internet search and can't find any information on this case. All I get is the information on the film and the fact that it is based on a "true story". I find it hard to believe that a judge would change his sentence made immediately in the courtroom, even after a speech so felt by his brother (splendid John Corbett), but overall the story was very compelling. However, if anyone knows the real "true story", I'd love for you to share it!
