Rachel and Chuck Yoman (Valerie Harper, Gerald McRaney), have decided that the city is too busy and dangerous for their family, so they packed their reluctant son (Gregory Togel) and daughter (Tammy Lauren) and returned to a lake like that Rachel lived as a child. <br /> <br /> They say you can't go home but this is an ideal rural home with what at first glance looks like a Mayberry feeling. Later the residence seems to be more similar to the people of Deliverance. Soon the bodies start to pop up and everyone looks suspicious, except for some friendly faces. This does not prevent the family from having fun running around in the woods. <br /> <br /> We discover that they must be super-ignorant to find the secrets and not tell anyone until they get the donkey-chickpeas as antagonists. <br /> <br /> Can the ignored young Stevie save his parents or their pursuer (or his pursuers) put his foot in? <br /> <br /> This film is more than most of the parodies that were played with narrow faces. They could not have chosen better actors and Daryl Anderson was incredibly disturbing. An added benefit is that they let us know what's going on before the characters find out, instead of pulling out a clue from the hat after the fact. However this fact for TV movies is good for some laughs.
