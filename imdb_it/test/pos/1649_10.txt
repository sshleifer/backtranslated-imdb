Many experienced and excellent actors mixed together in an unbroken plot of an unnamed part of World War II on the eastern front. Well-represented and unforgettable characters. An episode lets you desire the next one. Pay attention to the end credits the thousands of Shtrafbat battalions were listed. An untold story that involves hundreds of thousands of people. Sometimes brutal, sometimes romantic, always full of real people and dialogues. Produced with excellent sets and photographic work. Heroes and criminals, criminals and priests, patriots and traitors. Portrait of people struggling to survive and overcome a terrible moment. I want to buy a copy for my collection to be able to enjoy the series repeatedly.
