Terry and June in my mind, it's an all-time classic, along the ranks with blessing this house with the late sid james and the diana coupland, but I hope that Terry Scott will remain unfortunately even though he died in 1994. I have all the dvds are ready for printing and I can't wait to get all 9, it would be nice to see "happy after ever" published on DVD <br /> <br /> whitfield is still going strong and Terry Scott will always live in my memory <br /> <br /> terry scott rip there are not many comedies today that I can think of that will remain on the list of legends and yes the middle class piece gets on some people's wicks, but I don't mind, I think it would be great to see some celebrations of the life of Terry Scott
