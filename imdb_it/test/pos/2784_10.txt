A young French man uproots himself as he becomes an Erasmus exchange student in Barcelona and returns as a better man. Does it seem boring? There's no way! The film is full of colorful people, all stereotypes (the English twat and his racist brother, the sexually liberated Danish, the ultra-organized German, ...). In this case, however, stereotypes are made brilliantly. You feel like you know people like that (I first know an arrogant doctor and his trophy wife, and I'm just like the characters in the movie!), They feel REAL PEOPLE! <br /> <br /> Go watch this movie and enjoy the subtitles!
