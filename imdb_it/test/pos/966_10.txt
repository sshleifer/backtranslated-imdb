After seeing Big Fat Liar, I think Jason has learned a lot more. When he told the truth about Marty stealing his story, he was like the boy who cried wolf. People heard him, but they didn't believe him. No one has done anything to help him. Moreover, not only Marty's films stink, as well as his advice. The truth is not overrated. I'm so glad he was exposed for what he really is. Everyone found out he stole that boy, including his parents. Not only did he steal from that boy and lied about it, he gave them someone else's job and tried to call him his, which is plagiarism. Don't you know it's illegal to plagiarize someone's idea? Another reason why he was fired. It is not reliable. He's a liar, a crook, a thief, a crook and a plagiarist. Do you have that Marty? You are a plagiarist. Besides, you have everything you deserved.
