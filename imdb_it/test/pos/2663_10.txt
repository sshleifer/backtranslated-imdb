I write this review only after hearing about the death of Stanley Kubrick. It's a big loss, and I write about 2001: A Space Odyssey, because I feel it's the consummate Kubrick film, the one for which it will be most remembered. It's an image like no other, not only revolutionizing science fiction, but changing the way films are conceptualized. It was probably the first American art film and inspired George Lucas and countless other writers and directors. <br /> <br /> Apart from its visual size, the reason why the film generates so many discussions and analyzes is because so many people have so many different interpretations. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, his co-writer, had a vision, but we never really found out what he was going through their minds. Of course, the meager "message" is how the technology of the future will take over humanity and will decide the course of our lives unless we are careful. The 2001 finale is one of hope, a version of our rebirth through the flight of the earth-star on Earth. It makes no sense to many, but the discerning will understand. <br /> <br /> Although 2001 does not have the evil humor of the DR. STRANGELOVE or CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or they contain strong and eccentric characters that have filled his previous works like SENTIERI DI GLORIA or SPARTACUS, I still feel he would have liked to be remembered more for this. If anything, HAL will be his most memorable, dangerous, killer and artificial character. It was a half decade when Hollywood was still churning out boring music and was just waking up to the New Wave of French and Italian cinema. Kubrick was a nonconformist director who made great films on his own terms, in his time and to others to be amazed at. We'll miss him.
