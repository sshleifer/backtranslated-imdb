I don't know what exactly it is, but the film is happily sitting on my shelf, without thinking of ever leaving me ... Fulci has made one of the most ridiculous, bizarre, cheez-infested and unique films I've ever seen. I don't know what else to say about it, but I LOVE THIS FILM !!! The steak tartare scene is absolutely amazing, and the whole flask of Nazi torture orgies is strangely exhilarating ... I'm not sure what Fulci was trying to do, but someone heard that, based on this film, Fulci have you accused Wes Craven of ripping him off with "Scream"? "Cat in the Brain" is a must for lovers of bad movies everywhere ... Yes, surely I will say that it is not a "good" film, but I guarantee that some scenes will remain etched in your mind forever! This is an exercise of madness, folks ... I imagine that if I were a "serious" critic I would give a 3, but out of pure enjoyment (once again I can't really explain my affections) I would give it a 7 .... Colpo really scene ...
