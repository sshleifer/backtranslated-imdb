The role of the economy in the industrialized North American market must always have been theorized in the countries of origin of the creation of engines. People and industrialists such as Mercedes Benz and the Bavarian Motor Works (BMW) have certainly seized the opportunity of the North Ameircan market with the purchase of fuel and the number of cars purchased per family. This type of economic phenomenon has triggered the concept of Speed ​​Racer. <br /> <br /> After Japan's new constitution, the industrialization of the isolated island of Japan must still seek an opportunity through economic partnerships with its global neighbors. This has also helped to stimulate economic opportunities in the European and North American markets, if not in the global market. <br /> <br /> Speed ​​is a passionate young man who without knowing anything better is guided by his demanding father Pops Racer who has challenged his whole life to make a car better to win races. It was in fact Pops Racer that pushed his first son Rex Racer to the brink of destruction with his strategy on how to best use the technology he developed. Like a mature Racer, Rex finally realizes his intrinsic values ​​and becomes independent, but still feels obliged to annoy his children. Speed. <br /> <br /> The exact relationship of Rex Racer with people like the Inspector is never clear, but put into dramatization. In the end, Rex is accused of being a type of agent for a country or organization because of his ability to be in places at times when there is no other explanation of how he would know that Speed ​​was in trouble. Or the fact that the situations involved certain types of illegal activities was his secret knowledge exploited against an evil plot. This brings a level of swashbuckling romance to Speed ​​Racer. <br /> <br /> The blend of innocence speed with Trixy, Sprital and Chim Chim brings a level of comic human nature. This concept is a good form of rhetoric to balance the themes and textures as they are reproduced from one episode to another. So instead of a dry detective story, the thrill of international car driving, the romanticism of the cloak and the dagger and the comedy of human nature are put into a story, Speed ​​Racer.
