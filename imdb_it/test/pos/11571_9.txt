The years 2005 and 15+ have passed since this cartoon was first broadcast. Actually I haven't looked at it seriously or in close proximity in about 10 years. Now that I'm an adult in my thirties, I can look back with a serious eye while I watch the episodes again. <br /> <br /> In the concept, the comic is partly a tribute to the classic Looney Tunes but also to its own original show. There are some episodes that are structured like old cartoons. For example, there is a singer who attacks Buster and therefore demands revenge on this singer's concert, just like the old Bugs Bunny comic. The following cardboard is similar to Looney Tunes, just in a different age. If you look at the old Looney Tunes, they did a lot of things exactly like Tiny Toons did. The old Looney Tunes have made a lot of social commentary and parody. There were celebrity imitations. There were lots of jokes, dialogues and dialogues of the period. The play was surreal and extravagant. You can also tell exactly for Tiny Toons. The comic style is "spiritually" the same. Definitely a return to the classics that had not been done well (if at all) in cartoons in the decades preceding this show. We recognize the cultural references in Tiny Toons and we can look up when something we don't like comes out. But the reason why we don't think Looney Tunes is trivial is because we weren't alive in the 1940s. Furthermore, Looney Tunes was original again in those days, but today cartoons have been reworked over and over again. So it's easy to perceive Tiny Toons in an unfair light because of our exposure to current events and our overexposure to cartoons in general. <br /> <br /> There are certainly differences in many aspects: times, delivery and obviously the duration of the shows. They are two different styles from two different periods, made in two very different circumstances: Looney Tunes made for adults in theaters and Tiny Toons made for children watching TV. Even so, they did a good job making an original show with original gags and continuing to pay tribute to the comic style of the old Looney Tunes. <br /> <br /> Since Tiny Toons had much more time to play with, they had some genuine moments of great animated inspiration. You just have to watch episodes like 1 minute to 3, the episode of baby plucky toilet .. there are many more. For example, one of the best exchanges of never-animated comedy dialogues is in Thirteen Something when Babs and Buster are on the phone in a split screen, hoping that everyone will forget about the other. The miscommunication is spectacular. In particular, the development of the character in this episode and in many others (usually those written by Deanna Oliver or Sherri Stoner) is quite good. The female characters were taken seriously as personalities and developed, unusual considering that the opposite is usually true for the cartoons of that period. <br /> <br /> This was the first modern comic book that had a lot of both pop-referential cultures and referential self-humor. This was far ahead of its time. Tiny Toons has really opened a door for writers to take comic liberties that are so common in today's cartoons, instead of making the boring old shit we endured like 80s kids. Yes, I loved Transformers and Thundercats, but Tiny Toons has completely freed himself from it. It was a breath of fresh air. Bakshi's new Mighty Mouse adventures may have been a precursor, but Tiny Toons has made this surreal style of comic-strip comic that he wrote a real success. <br /> <br /> As a child I completely ignored some jokes. For example, an episode is a tribute to the Marx brothers that I completely ignored as a teenager. Now I have a new respect for this. There are so many inspired gags that I never noticed that they are really brilliant. It's that kind of comedy that makes me think of Looney Tunes and Family Guy. I never noticed that kind of comedy as a child. I thought about most of the episodes I recently watched. <br /> <br /> You will notice this kind of thing if you have actually WATCHED the show. Unlike other reviewers here who know that they judge him unfairly, I saw all the episodes and thought about them thoroughly, exposed both as a child and as an adult. <br /> <br /> You can say that there was a huge amount of attention taken even with the voice. I'm not just talking about the main characters, but the secondary characters have been made really well and creatively. But back to the main characters, some of the main characters have been brilliant. Tress MacNeille had, in my opinion, his best performances in this cartoon. It hasn't been the same since. Even Rob Paulsen has done incredible things here. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the show did not have bad episodes. He had a lot. They also had mediocre ones. But surely he has had many really funny episodes. Especially when it was broadcast for the first time it was really fun to watch. <br /> <br /> On 10 I gave a show of 8.5 and complimented me for pushing the envelope and tearing down the doors leading to a new era of cartoons.
