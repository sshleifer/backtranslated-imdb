This film has an exceptional acting, by Marilia PÃªra, and an extraordinary statement by the Argentine Hector Babenco. This is, in my opinion, the best Brazilian film ever made. The film was shot with a child from the "favelas", the Brazilian ghetos. The children were not actors and were cast by Babenco in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The story is about the criminal children being arrested in the correctional prison, which looks much worse than Alcatraz. The children are constantly raped and beaten by the policeman. Unfortunately this is not pure fiction, in Brazil it happens until today. A must see for those who love violent films. But take your mother out of the room, because it's a difficult film.
