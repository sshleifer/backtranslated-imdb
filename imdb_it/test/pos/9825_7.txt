I read the other comments here on this film before watching it. If you have read them, you will know that they are almost all negative. I really don't understand it. I admit it's too long (it takes about half an hour to accelerate a little). Music is often inappropriate. But the strong performance of Ford and Thomas is really enough to accomplish this. With all his fame as a movie star, I had forgotten that Harrison Ford could really act! This role of man who defined himself based on a lie is remarkable. I find it entirely credible that he wants all the details he can get so that he can see what was real and what the deception was. Thomas is always wonderful and is no exception. His initial denial that leads to confusion and then to inner calm is tremendous. This film will never be on the list of all the great films, but it's not so bad. I'm glad I waited to see it on video, but it's worth $ 3 or $ 4.
