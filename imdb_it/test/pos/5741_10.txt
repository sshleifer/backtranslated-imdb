My partner and I sat and watched this movie over a bottle of wine last Saturday and although we initially had our reservations once the story started, it was actually quite compelling. The scene where one of the characters brutally murdered by knitting needles was particularly shocking and echoed the work of the Korean new wave author Park Chan Wook. The favorite weapon was a particular master stroke and allowed us to see in the psyche of "Granny", heavily altering the connotations of a loving and warm grandmother in a homicidal shrew. The dialogue was incredibly moving and lyrical in expressing the most intimate paranoia of the protagonist. Pavlosky's mise en scene selections further enhance the nerve-racking and manic atmosphere of the evenings, combining with the worthy interpretations of the Oscars to create a chilling and inspiring masterpiece. The ending, which I don't want to spoil for you here, reminded me and my partner of M Night Shyamalan's institutional masterpiece The Sixth Sense for his mental change that let me think weeks after vision. Definitely one to watch, several times!
