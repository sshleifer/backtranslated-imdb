A rich old lady calls a flirtatious divorcee to snatch a Lothario from her stupid niece, who will soon be married. <br /> <br /> LET NOI BE GAY is an interesting domestic comedy that presents a harsh dialogue (courtesy of the famous screenwriter Frances Marion) and good performances. Although it is sometimes a little mushy, this can probably be attributed to the difficulties with the initial sound technology that tended to limit action and movement. Norma Shearer can be credited with appearing in this minor film, rather than using her undisputed influence as Irving Thalberg's wife to insist only on grade A photos. She is particularly effective in her early scenes, in which the makeup made-up flat makes it almost unrecognizable. His extreme transmigration from goose to swan could only happen in Hollywood, but it is not profitable to spend much time worrying about this. <br /> <br /> Rod LaRocque does not come out as well as Shearer's adulterous husband. Very popular during silent days, the talkies weren't particularly nice to him and his career would suffer. Here his role is not at all understanding and one must ask what masochistic impulse pushes women to desire cad so much. <br /> <br /> Magnificent Marie Dressler is available as an eccentric widow of Long Island. As a great friend of Frances Marion, one can easily imagine that the part was written expressly for her. Full of cranks and quarter-turns, it's a lot of fun. However, the enormous warmth and essential goodness that very soon would make his biggest star in Hollywood are largely missing. <br /> <br /> Among the supporting cast, Hedda Hopper marks as a slinky company snake, as does Wilfred Noy playing a butler comic. Mavens of the cinema will see little Dickie Moore in the role of her young son of Shearer and the elderly Mary Gordon as her housekeeper, both of whom are not accredited.
