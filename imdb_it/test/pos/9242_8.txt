I saw this movie at the Magnolia Theater in Dallas a couple of days ago. Punk! Everyone and everything involved in the film has helped make it more punk. Music, of course. But the film itself has captured the entire punk genre. Even a grandmother and a school teacher (me) can appreciate artists who are able to turn their ideas into reality (well, reality, film-essay). This film takes a handful of young young directors and shows clearly and cleverly the "why" of their anguish for not having received the green light on finishing Waldo's film. The (relatively) happy girl gave a good comic relief, a nice respite from the continuous (but understandable) rag on the type that left them at the mercy. I must love Stu, though. And make sure you watch / read credits: they are the icing on the cake!
