First, a word of caution. The DVD box describes this film as a comedy. I don't think it was the intention of anyone connected with the movie other than some marketing idiot. Although light and a bit funny in some places, it is NOT a comedy and if you expect it you will be disappointed. I had never even heard of this film and I had absolutely no expectations in one way or another. Considering that the other two DVDs I collected were big disappointments, I was so happy when I saw this movie. Acting, writing and directing were excellent. I was certainly interested in the story itself, since we don't usually see films about the last month of France before the Nazi occupation in 1940. He gave some ideas about the parasites that gave up so quickly and agreed to share their beloved country. Along the way, there are plots involving a selfish and weak actress, played very well by Isabelle Adjani - who looks wonderful after all these years. He kills an ex-lover and then finds a poor sap to take the fall. This sap escapes from the prison and finds it - with another lover - a senior government official and a weasel played by Gerard Depardieu. Furthermore, a subplot is introduced on a Jewish physicist who tries to smuggle deuterium out of the country and eventually becomes the main plot. The plot has many beautiful twists, a slight sense of humor (without trying to be a comedy) and some genuine moments of suspense. Together they create a nice package that you will surely enjoy.
