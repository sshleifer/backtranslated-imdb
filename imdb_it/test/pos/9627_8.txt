This is truly a kung fu classic. This film seems to have influenced martial arts films for decades. The background music of the Spanish guitar, the competing schools, the incredibly high jumps on the edges of the roofs, the launched lances, the cheating in the tournaments, the secret training for an exotic karate technique, themes of patience and perseverance, and many others have been copied by many later films such as "The Karate Kid" (1984), "Hero" (2002), "Kill Bill Volume 2" (2004) and "Kung Fu Hustle" (2004). <br /> <br /> I feel fortunate to have seen this film for the first time in 1972, shortly after its release, just before the kung fu films became mainstream and before Bruce Lee became a household name. I saw it with two friends of mine in a downtown San Diego theater frequented by sailors, and although the red-hot hand scenes and the gouged eyes got laughter, clearly the audience was coming in, like our small group . It was a very memorable film for me. Decades later, I could still remember several specific scenes, even after forgetting the title of the movie. This film is very special to me now because one of those two friends with whom I saw it for the first time (the sailor Kenneth Lee of the Kitty Hawk) has died since then, so this film serves as a reminder of that day together before that we take judo and karate lessons in later years. <br /> <br /> Compared to kung fu movies, I would rate this movie as 10/10. But since I have to keep in mind the great public of cinema, I will classify it in a more objective way as 8/10, due to obvious technical defects. I only recommend that novice viewers consider these technical flaws as proof of their vintage nature and authenticity, and then happily proceed to enjoy its testosterone-laden chaos.
