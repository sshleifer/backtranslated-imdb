Is it a bad movie? <br /> <br /> Obviously, what did you expect from a movie called "BEACH BEBES FROM BEYOND"? <br /> <br /> It is a movie "BABES in BIKINI" and has no pretensions to be otherwise. Given, this is not "A ROOM WITH A VIEW" or "SCHINDLER LIST". If you wanted a movie like "A Room With a View" then you wouldn't watch Beach Babes from Beyond. But if you're looking for a good Babes in Bikini movie with almost no storyline, this is the one for you. This film offers what it promises and then some. It's 100% pure fun. <br /> <br /> There were many BABIs in and out of bikinis. The film was pretty fun and good to see. These were some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen on home videos. <br /> <br /> Every high school child should watch at least one bad movie like this. This is actually one of the most memorable movies I've ever seen. So, shamelessly, I repeat ... If you only watch a movie "Babes in Bikini", that's it.
