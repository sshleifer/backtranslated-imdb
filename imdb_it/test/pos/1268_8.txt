There are two things I noticed in this film. (This is not a spoiler, just a mistake in storytelling.) When Cole brings Bill to his first B & E, he finds the "box". As soon as Cole finds it, he says "The box, everyone has a box". A minute later, just before unloading the contents on the floor, he says "We're really very lucky. You don't see them often". <br /> <br /> Observation # 2 (Spoiler Alert!) <br /> <br /> I had to look at it three times, I couldn't understand a couple of things. Then I looked at the chronological version and saw that they were having flashbacks from the latter to the previous one during the time changes. So in some places we were actually looking at three different times in about 1 minute of wall time. <br /> <br /> It was a good thing because I don't know how many times I could watch it before returning it to Netflix. <br /> <br /> Color me obsessive.
