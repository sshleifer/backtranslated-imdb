In my opinion, National Velvet is one of the best family classics of all time. It is characterized by Mickey Rooney as (Mi Taylor) and Elizabeth Taylor as (Velvet Brown). <br /> <br /> Velvet wins a racehorse, called (Pie) in a lottery. He immediately falls in love with this. With the help of Mi, a former jockey, they train him to run in the Grand National's. After the jockey who had planned to run Pie retires at the last moment, Velvet convinces me to take his place. <br /> <br /> It was a well made film. Fine texture and first-rate acting. The inner game between Elizabeth and Mickey was magical. This is a wonderful family photo expertly directed by Clarence Brown. Photography is amazing. This is a film that you will like for years to come. <br /> <br /> This image is what made Elizabeth Taylor a familiar name. Both Mickey and Elizabeth remained close after the movie. They continue to send postcards one after the other after all these years. <br /> <br /> A side note. Elizabeth loved the "Pie" horse so much that the studio had given it to her.
