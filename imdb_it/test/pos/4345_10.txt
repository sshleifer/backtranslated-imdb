This movie is really a classic 80s movie! A must in the 80s movie collection! Guns, Bad Guys, CREEPS, Gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and other CREEPS !!!! <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the best Death Wish movie. Tons of non-stop action! <br /> <br /> And in line with the classic movie "bad boy versus good boy" of the 80s - this film is about anything but the norm and everything about guns and CREEPS! We see Bronson mowing hooligans and CREEPS with a heavy machine gun of the Korean war of 30 calibers! A HEAVY MACHINE GUN TO FEAR OUT! When Charlie runs out of ammunition for the heavy machine gun, he runs back to his cradle and takes up arms with his long-range high-caliber pistol! This gun can stop a damn ELEPHANT and Charlie is putting holes of the size of the hub caps in bad! And if that's not enough, Charlie is also preparing an anti-tank grenade launcher, which by the way is good only if it manages to bring the CREEPS together. <br /> <br /> The acting in this film is "ha ha" great and many actors off the wall (mainly playing CREEPS) appear in the movie! The film is full of memorable linings and scenes! Heck, my favorite scene / line is the one in which the CREEP leader confronts Broson in Jail and explains quietly: "Tell you what I'm going to do ... I'll kill an old lady ... just for you! ... take it to six o'clock ". <br /> <br /> Is this film violent? Heck yes! But you'll laugh and shiver all the way !!
