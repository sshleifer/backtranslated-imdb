A fantastic feature B. A virtual two-hander set during the day, (you can see the origins of the stage and also how it must have worked like a radio game), and although it lasted only 77 minutes, it took place in similar sequences to something similar to the real time. Robert Ryan is the psychopath who keeps Ida Lupino trapped in his own home. Both are superb, especially the underrated Lupine, whose independence and self-control crumble early in front of Ryan's intruder intruder. Today, of course, it would be all the liver and the cold, but the moderation shown by director Harry Horner, (much better known as the Art Director), only adds to the suspense that is sometimes worthy of Hitchcock.
