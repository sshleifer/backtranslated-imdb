As a camera operator, I couldn't help but admire the great appearance that this image has achieved. Performance was excellent, as was history. Just when I thought this movie was going to slow down, it wasn't like that. Heart-pounding tension, great stimulation through editing and a soundtrack that knows when to be quiet come together here under a competent and capable direction. The camera was always in the right place. Love that.
