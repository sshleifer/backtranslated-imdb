I loved this thing. The most beautiful thing about Pink Flamingos is that it struggles desperately to have a horrible taste, but it has really gained a cult following the world. It says a lot about us (we are people), doesn't it? Pink Flamingos succeeds because Waters made the film he wanted to make. A film doesn't have to be disgusting to succeed, but it could be. When you watch this movie, you see things that are disgusting, but in the end they are brilliant because they are shown freely. What we have here is an honest piece of personal creative expression. Anyone who ever cares about success as an artist, whether it's movies or other media, should watch this movie.
