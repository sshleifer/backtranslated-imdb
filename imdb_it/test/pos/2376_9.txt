The third part of the Miike trilogy, Dead or Alive, has no relation to the first two parts as they were more or less between them. Mostra Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi are back for the main roles, but this time the film pushes us forward about 300 years into the future ... post apocalypse. <br /> <br /> Riki plays a tough cop, a guarantor for the extreme police policies of the corrupt city, and Show plays a tramp connecting with a group of oppressed rebels in the city. The film must have been shot in Hong Kong, since most of the rest of the cast are Cantonese, with Terence Yin and Josie Ho being the most recognizable faces. There is also a HK troupe of stunts available for the action sequences of the films, which are very cool in an HK-via-Miike style. <br /> <br /> This could be the fodder for a low budget B movie, but in Miike's hands they obviously become something more interesting. It is a rather slow and meditative film that moves slowly and does not try to force anything into the viewer's throat. The characters are rounded and interesting and the plot is an interesting structure but quite loose for the hanging story. <br /> <br /> All in all a fairly low effort up to the action scenes, which show the growing ability of Miike in the direction and choreography of a very beautiful action. Watching the Show & Riki short show in wire rig is really fun - you can tell they were having a great time <br /> <br /> The ending of the film tries to tie together the 3 Dead Or Alive movies, which is pretty useless because everyone is really independent. The explanation of Miike's connection is a lot of fun, and closes the series pretty well. <br /> <br /> Not as deep or well developed as DOA2, not as outrageous and intense as DOA1 ... yet another good film by Miike though.
