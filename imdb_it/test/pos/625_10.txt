This is certainly one of the scariest and most enchanting movies ever made. You are stuck with the film from beginning to end. Although there are some holes in the plot, it continues to be exciting for the final showdown. In addition to "8 MM" and "Peeping Tom", this is one of the best films on "Snuff Movies", a taboo theme of our culture. If you like the SCREAM trilogy, you'll probably love that one.
