Rita Hayworth as Rusty Parker is the COVER GIRL du jour - she's one of Danny McGuire's dancers, Danny's most special (Gene Kelly) and pretty much everyone you meet. Take for example the magnate of the magazine Vanity John Coudair (Otto Kruger): enchanted by the similarity of Rusty with his grandmother Maribelle (also played by Hayworth in flashbacks), who courted devotedly when he fell in love with her, tries to relive his youth arranging what he thought had gone wrong between him and Maribelle. He doesn't believe Danny could give Rusty happiness, or anything he should have been entitled to - even to Danny himself who believed. When Rusty becomes famous as "Cover Girl" of Vanity, Danny pushes her away in the arms ready and waiting for Noel Wheaton (Lee Bowman). So what happens when Danny returns to town with his partner Genius (Phil Silvers) in tow, only to find out that Rusty is going to marry Wheaton? <br /> <br /> Like a musical, COVER GIRL benefits from the beautiful soundtrack and written songs of Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin, including "Long Ago and Far Away" (perhaps one of the most beautiful ballads ever written and wonderfully , sweetly sung as a duet by Hayworth and Kelly), Maribelle's number "Sure Thing" (the most sparse "Poor John" is not a Kern / Gershwin collaboration) and "Put me to the test". The dance, of course, is of a high standard, since Gene Kelly had more than one hand in choreography. Show in the simplest dances, for example his dance with Hayworth on "Put Me To The Test", or the joyful exuberant number "Make Way For Tomorrow" (played by the trio of Danny, Rusty and Genius) ... which heralds the reaction of the character of Gene to the policeman in the title number in SINGIN 'IN THE RAIN. Kelly in particular obtained a technological and artistic coup with the dance "Alter-Ego". Like his successors in ANCHORS AWEIGH and AN AMERICAN IN PARIS (respectively Jerry the Mouse and the 16-minute ballet), this dance is an example of the incredible innovation and creativity that Kelly brought to the modern musical film: wanting to use the cinematographic medium for Present dances that could not be shown on a stage, and years before the CGI, Kelly insisted on dancing with the only person who could match him with talent and style - himself. The number is just five minutes long, but this (and Kelly's genius) still takes our breath away, even sixty years later. This is the reason why I saw COVER GIRL, and if nothing else, this dance is really worth it. <br /> <br /> It can be said that a great deal of money has been lavished on COVER GIRL and Rita Hayworth - not that she doesn't deserve it. Witness to the scene when Rusty hits Broadway - the big screen showing all the different cover girls gives way to an incredibly large stage equipped for Rusty's entrance. Hayworth is truly one of the most beautiful girls with no effort to show in the film, and dances with a style and grace that is almost worthy of Kelly. (Very few of Kelly's co-stars have that honor.) It's hilarious in some scenes, such as her drunken scene when John and Wheaton pick her up from Joe's. <br /> <br /> For some reason, however, his performance still lacks the spark of grandeur that would help COVER GIRL overcome his general curse of mediocrity. That curse is only raised whenever Gene Kelly is on the screen (dancing or not), or when Eve Arden, in the role of John's long-lived secretary, "Stonewall", makes his way with another sharp comment or intelligent remark . Since the film ultimately belongs to Hayworth, neither Kelly nor Arden can save it as a whole. This does not mean that the film is bad - it is not. It's fun, with great songs and nice numbers and lots of pretty girls to watch. But it's not really a classic. The dance is classic though - so look at COVER GIRL for that, and you won't regret it.
