After seeing Undisputed 2, I knew what to expect from Isaac Florentine. <br /> <br /> The Shepherd: Border Patrol is a decent film (not the best of Van Damme, but certainly not his worst). The cast of VD is supported, but it makes sense. <br /> <br /> The plot and the plot have already been done before, so it's not new. I mean, this is Van Damme. Do we really expect an amazing storyline? So let's talk about what we all want to see this movie anyway: the fights. <br /> <br /> Without giving up anything, I thought about the way the fights were shot and the shots were well made, much better than some of the recent VD movies like Second in Command, in which the entire final fight is HORRIBLE. With Florentine behind the camera, and if you've seen Undisputed 2, he seems to know how to photograph fights and have fun. Some of the fights in The Shepherd reminded me of the old things about VD which is what we all want to see. The fights were good, and I said "hah, fantastic" aloud a few times. But I was only hoping a little more considering how good it was to think of Undisputed 2. <br /> <br /> Something that I found intriguing was VD's daughter in the movie, I thought "wow it's a bit hot" come to find out, his Bianca Van Varenberg, daughter of the real life of JC. I've never seen it before, so it was a nice surprise. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film is not badly bad. Yes, the story has already been made, but at least JC was trying to make a good movie. Next time, however, add more melee fights! I think he still has what it takes to make another big budget movie ... his acting has improved since he made DTV and he's really in good shape at 47. I don't know about you but I am one of those who think that most of his DTVs are actually good except for the derailed. All he has to do is go back to the "bloodsport" form and make a martial arts movie ... and I think people respond well even if it's not a Li jet. This film is definitely worth hiring. =)
