As a former submarine (nuclear) officer I have to admit that this is my favorite submarine film (even surpassing Hunt for Red October). Someone knew something about submarines when they wrote the film. OK - unrealistic - but it's a comedy - and it has all the "jokes inside" of the submarine force. A great cast with the stereotypical submarine boys "Orlando" and our heroes on the diesel boat. Definitely "DBF" by the way = means diesel boats forever. But they want ten lines to post this - is Jees the current Admiral here? <br /> <br /> Line 10.
