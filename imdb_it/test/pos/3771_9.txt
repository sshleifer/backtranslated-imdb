This is one of those rare comedies where you can try as you could, you can't help laughing, laughing, laughing and yes, even laughing out loud. The protagonist's performance as Hyde is pure manic genius. See if you can keep a straight face when it makes its transformation. Good luck. :) On the negative side there are moments when the film gets bogged down. It seemed longer than its 90 minutes.
