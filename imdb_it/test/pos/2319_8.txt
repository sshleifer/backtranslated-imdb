The first few minutes of this film don't do it justice! For me, it's not funny until they get on board the submarine and those hilarious characters start to freeze. I was born and raised in Norfolk, Virginia, and met my share of "different" sailors - I even married one! Most of my favorite movies are fun, not up to date, not dependent on sex or violence and fun every time I see them. Groundhog Day, Bruce Almighty and Down Periscope are still fun even after reading the dialogue by heart. Kelsey Grammar with her "God I LOVE this job!" He was sincere, genuine and lovable. Rob Schneider is hysterical while the crew returns to annoy him. I'm still amazed by the size of that fishing boat next to a diver! I can understand why the people who live this life would notice that of uh-oh but it's not a documentary, after all it's a comedy and I love it!
