A rather stupid movie that you could love. <br /> <br /> Although it is rather banal and clich√© at times, it still works and makes the fun pure and clean. Five teams are engaged in a treasure hunt and fight each other and their wits to win the all-night contest - just for absolute joy "knowing that yours is the best team." <br /> <br /> Notable for several screen debuts including David Naughton's first film after Dr. Pepper's "Be a Pepper" commercials and before his major 1981 success "American Werewolf in London" . He also presents Paul Ruebens in what I believe is his first Pee Wee Herman taxiway a year before it was recognized. And, last but not least, Mr. Spin City and Alex Keaton himself, Michael J. Fox gets his first film role here. Fans will remember Stephen Furst as Flounder in Animal House. Outside of this, no name, but all the funny characters. <br /> <br /> I doubt he ever did it on DVD, but there are probably still some VHS copies floating around and you could even get to a late and sometimes late show. If you do, it's worth watching. You might hate it, but it could also become a weird little movie that you like to love.
