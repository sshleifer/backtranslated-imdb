If you are looking for a film with fantastic music, beautiful cast and a plot that is not difficult to understand; FAME is for you. <br /> <br /> I have several scenes that I love in this movie; some make you laugh, others make you contemplative. I think the editing is wonderful, very fast and often fun. Shure, maybe there would have been a little more potential in the whole thing, the whole story will remain somehow on the surface; maybe a little too many characters are involved. But I don't care, because the real stars are ... <br /> <br /> ... the music scenes! One of my favorites: the hot-lunch-jam sequence. That piece is so raw, funky and filmed in a special way ("chamber music" style), it's simply electrifying! I miss this raw energy in today's music clips; the only similar energy that I perhaps found in Bette Midlers "the rose", the whole video of the concert. He tells of capturing something "wild" that is "really" happening, and not just doing it perfect; take in your hand. <br /> <br /> So, FAME is a wonderful, nostalgic journey when synths are not available for weights and walkmans. I recommend it once a year; certainly not for everyone
