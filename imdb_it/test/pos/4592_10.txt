This film is "the" stupid comedy of the year, and probably the best thing from Mike Judge from "Office Space". If you are a Mike Judge fan, or like shows like Futurama, then you are doing yourself a serious disruption by skipping this little-known and limited version. Although the DVD provides very few "bonus features", this film is certainly fun enough to make up for its "lack of value". <br /> <br /> This film is about an army grunt called Joe Bowers (played by Luke Wilson) that is part of a top secret army experiment designed to preserve army personnel in peacetime so that they can be thawed in time of war to fight for our country. However, things take an interesting turn as the general manager of the operation is arrested in a prostitution ring and the experiment is almost completely forgotten. Bowers, and his aide Rita (played by Maya Rudolph) both find themselves in the year 2505, where through natural selection, the American population has become increasingly stupid. Now Joe and Rita must find their way to a time machine to return to 2005 with the help of Frito (played by Dax Shepard). <br /> <br /> What I liked most about this film was Mike Judge a comic satire on the course of US history over the past 50 years and how humanity progresses over the next 500 years. This is most evidenced by the advertising in the film, which has become a basis of American culture. With shows like South Park in the mainstream media, it's easy to see how conclusions could be drawn that in the future, vulgarity has become a marketing tool. This is portrayed humorously in the film with subtle things like "Fudd-Ruckers" changing their name to "Butt-F ### ers", and a billboard showing the ad "If you don't smoke Tarryltons ... F ## # You!". Also, I can't stop laughing at the role of Carls Jr. in this future, with their slogan "F ### you ... I'm eating", and their kiosks that advertise their "Extra Big-A # # Tacos ". (with more molecules)! This film contained everything I go to the movies for. Excellent comedy, acute, witty, as well as a compelling storyline make this DVD one of the ages. Be careful, though. If you're not a Mike Judge fan, you don't care about "Beavis and Butthead", or you don't have a sense of humor, then this movie is probably not a good combination for you. Otherwise, I would say that this is probably the funniest movie to come out in 2506 ... I mean 2006.
