Maybe it's just a personal affection for this film version of Mika Waltari's novel, or a passion for Egyptian things (I grew up loving to visit the mummies at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston) but I think Maltin is a little tough with this good movie. The production values ​​are great with regards to color and cinematography, and it seems that a certain effort has been made to historical authenticity (largely from the novel, I am sure). Purdom is certainly a bit stiff in the lead role, but this can be accepted as part of the Sinuhe character. Victor Mature is, well, Victor Mature. Peter Ustinov is a pleasure to observe in this type of role, which he has always done so well and so well. Bella Darvi's performance as Nefer is classically camp, and I even find the rather dry portrait of Akenaten by Michael Wilding to have its charm. <br /> <br /> The historical strangeness of Akenaten's monotheism, a brief detour in the theological history of ancient Egypt, is interesting, as is Akenaten himself, and it is worth reading; the religious wars portrayed here have a de facto basis. <br /> <br /> An interesting note about Darvi, whose birth name was Bayla Wegier: she was a Polish emigrant whom producer Darryl Zanuck and his wife Violet took under their wing (I think they may even have adopted it ). His name on the screen Darvi is formed by the names of Zannuck and his wife. She continued her acting career in France, but never achieved great success and, after a rather unhappy life, died of her own hand in 1971. <br /> <br /> Overall this is an interesting and entertaining film to watch for the visual values ​​alone. American Movie Classics shows this from time to time in a letterbox, which is essential to capture the reach and scope of the story.
