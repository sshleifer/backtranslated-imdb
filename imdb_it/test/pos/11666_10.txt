In a world where questionable and misunderstood subjects can be listed endlessly, this powerful 1995 movie takes one to the top of the list; moreover, it does it objectively and realistically, and with a sensitivity and sensitivity that make it a truly exceptional film from anyone else. And to add a little irony to all this, the subject of this film has also been widely misunderstood, since it is mistakenly perceived that this is a film about the pros and cons of the death penalty; it is not. In the heart of "Dead Man Walking", directed by Tim Robbins, it is a topic that is actually perhaps the most misunderstood of all, and with good reason, because it could be just the most difficult thing that can exist for a human being - and really-- you understand. And that's what this movie really is: forgiveness. True forgiveness; don't excuse a heinous crime or the perpetrator of it - don't say that what happened is okay - but find the strength to go on, and to do it by choosing life. <br /> <br /> The director / screenwriter Tim Robbins has developed and delivered a faithful adaptation of the novel by Sister Helen Prejean, in which she discusses her involvement with prisoners on death row whom she has ministered over the years her faith in God. As reported in the film, what for her was to become a permanent search not only for justice, but for human dignity, began with a simple letter from a prisoner in the prison prison of Louisiana, in Angola. Sentenced to death for rape and murder, Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn) was reaching out to someone he would listen to, when his letter ended up in the hands of Sister Prejean (Susan Sarandon), who soon found herself venturing into a territory she had absolutely no no knowledge or experience. And Robbins has successfully captured Sister Prejean's emotional and turbulent journey in a succinct manner, managing to keep him free from any mind-boggling sentimentality, which makes him not only real, believable and credible, but makes him an engaging and engaging experience the public. Through the medium of cinema, what had once been a personal and meaningful emotional experience for Sister Prejean, becomes for all those who see this film. <br /> <br /> For her exciting and passionate portrayal of Sister Prejean, Susan Sarandon deservedly won the Oscar for best actress. Sensitive and full of emotional depth, her performance is incredibly moving and real, especially in the way in which she transmits the underlying fragility and natural vulnerability of Sister Prejean, which she has firmly tempered with the harshness necessary to carry on her efforts to Poncelet account (and actually, a total of five since he started). Whatever your view on the issues examined in this film, Sister Prejean is undoubtedly an individual of heroic proportions, which Sarandon exquisitely personifies here; and it does so without resorting to some superfluous melodrama, but rather keeping it real, subtly and humbly exploring the humanity of the person in a credible expression of characterization. It's an extraordinary performance, probably the best of Sarandon's brilliant career. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Sean Penn was named best actor for his portrayal of Poncelet (he lost to Nicolas Cage, who won for his performance in "Leaving". Las Vegas). Perfect for the part anyway, Penn has never been better before or after. It actually presents Poncelet as a real person, rather than as an exaggerated caricature of a monster capable of perpetrating the crimes represented here. Not that it makes Poncelet less contemptible; Exactly the opposite, in fact. It makes it really disconcerting to have to face the fact that someone who looks like a guy who could live near you might be capable of things like that. And this is the strength of Penn's performance - it's so disturbingly real, presented with depth and nuance; you just have to look into his eyes to find the imperfections of a troubled soul. A formidable performance, and - as Cage was in "Vegas" - Penn should have received an Oscar for this. <br /> <br /> In another prominent performance, Raymond J. Barry is memorable in a supporting role of Earl Delacroix, father of one of the victims of Poncelet. With limited screen time, however, he develops his character in such a way as to allow you to empathize with him, as well as with Sister Prejean, since it is through him that we are given a vision of how complex and apparently tenuous his position, at least on the surface. Barry presents Delacroix in such a way as to provide the necessary balance and perspective to the story, which is ultimately extremely effective and helps underline the message of the film. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes R. Lee Emery (Clyde Percy), Celia Weston (Mary Beth Percy), Lois Smith (Helen's mother), Scott Wilson (Chaplin Farley), Roberta Maxwell (Lucille Poncelet ), Margo Martindale (sister Colleen) and Jack Black (Craig Poncelet). It is doubtful that this film will change anyone's mind in one way or another on the death penalty, but this was never the intention; what he was destined to do was a stimulating and engaging film, which is exactly what Robbins did with "Dead Man Walking". Regardless of your personal point of view, this film will have an impact and hopefully open some minds to the true nature of forgiveness. Because, as we see through the character of Earl Delacroix, true forgiveness is not something that simply decides to do, but is a task that can become the work of a lifetime. And it is perhaps one of the most difficult things in life to be accomplished effectively; and come away from this film with an appreciation for individuals like Sister Prejean, who dedicated his life selflessly to helping those in need, and to directors like Robbins and Sarandon for bringing it to life for millions of people who otherwise would never have known his. I consider this 10/10. <br /> <br />
