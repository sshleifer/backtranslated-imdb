Yes, let's try to get him out of the way before we start: * This is where Sean Connery came back in 1983 after the time we had with Roger Moore. * It's the last Connery movie. * And SI is a (kind of) Thunderball remake, but more of a movie inspired by it. If all the Bond purists out there think I'm going to be controversial, you're right. Bond is one of the biggest movie series ever, but that doesn't mean that a series should last forever. This, I think, is one of two films in which they could have done a great favor and put an end to the Bond saga. Not yet offended? Then I'll continue ... Hey, if you're thinking I'm indifferent to James Bond movies, you're wrong. I grew up with my mom who was OSSESSA with them. Every spare moment, Bond and his antics would be on TV.
