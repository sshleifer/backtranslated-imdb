Everyone who has worked on this film has done an INCREDIBLE job. This is honestly one of the best lesbian movies I've seen in a long time. Acting, writing, cinematography, music, images, everything was top notch. As a passionate fan of the genre (both for lesbian and gymnastic films), I was so incredibly satisfied with this film. It really gave me a lot more than I expected across the board. Listening to Q & A with the cast and crew was great, the lead actress has so much positive energy and is so humble and kind, it's a pleasure to see people who can have talent and not lose sight of what's really important . And the writer did an incredible job, as the direction and editing was fantastic. Thank you so much for making a great movie! Thanks also for the phrase on "if you are going to slam a label on yourself, it would be bisexual". I'm so tired of movies where characters who have a relationship with both sexes are homosexual or gay, it's wonderful to see bisexuals get awards for being and being part of the gay community, and it was great that the labels weren't necessary. in this movie. What an end! Just when I thought he couldn't give me more, it happened. Good work and my applause to all. I'll spread the word, this is definitely a movie not to be missed!
