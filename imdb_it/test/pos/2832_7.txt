Overall it is hoped that this is a better film, but it has enough flashes of intense energy to make it useful. Peck made this film during the same period he made The Gunfighter, before he apparently decided to be a monument rather than an actor. A shame! He was a good actor, perfectly willing to face characters who weren't very nice and who did them extremely well. The character he plays here is guided and, when necessary, ruthless. Given the mission assigned to the character and the "men" with whom to do so, those characteristics are essential. <br /> <br /> Without being a spoiler, think of this film as a first, grotesque example of The Genre Dozen Dirty. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this film is a bit amateur but it is atmospheric and intense and certainly tells a story that is worth telling. It contains a good job of all the protagonists and Barbara Payton too becomes a credible performance. <br /> <br /> This is not often shown on television, so your video store may be the only place to find a copy. Go ahead! Devote an evening to it. It's worth your time!
