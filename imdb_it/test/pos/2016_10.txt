I loved this movie. It is a very simple plot and from what I understand is based on a true story. Growing up in the 80s with hard rock / hair metal might have something to do with my love for this movie, but apart from music it's a really fun movie to watch. Give it a try, you'll like it unless you're the worst of critics and just like the likes of "Citizen Kane".
