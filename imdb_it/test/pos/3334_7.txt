The summary above is not really intended as a buzz against this film, as the series has followed a very similar format. As usual, Simon Templar ("The Holy") meets a lady in need and comes to his aid. He also comes to the aid of a police detective who has been accused of accepting a bribe. Along the way, he meets some interesting supporting characters (this time, Paul Guilfoyle as "Pearly" Gates) and during his breakup of this not particularly compelling mystery (none of them really is), Templar is extremely erudite and simply fantastic! George Sanders is once again the consummate British sophisticated who makes good and once again manages to make an excellent B-detective series film. Nothing particularly special, but a familiar and breezy product that will surely satisfy fans of the genre.
