Imagine the scene: a bored student with an empty day ahead, a video store with a special offer of 5 videos for weekly rentals. This former student has usually just grabbed a stack of dubious quality videos for the most arbitrary reasons (The Turning anyone?). Occasionally the strange gem to be discovered was not included in his video recorder, as in the case of this film. Everything about the film is good, but much more than that the parts fit together to provide something too rare - a good movie. Because this has never had a film release in the UK it is beyond me, especially when we consider the crap we have to face in the week-to-week multiplex. Although I will happily accept that this is not the material of the Oscar (but not even the Titanic was disgusting - it is an extremely enjoyable film. I was trying to think of a way to describe the best way to appreciate / accept this film - The perfect movie to watch while you bond with your father, after a return home for the holidays, after a big Sunday lunch.
