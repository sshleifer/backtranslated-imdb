I must say that this must be the best documentary I've ever seen in my life. First I tell the movie to my friend's house, and I didn't get the chance to finish watching it. From that moment on, I spent my free time trying to find the film. I never found it, but on my birthday, my friend who knew I had the hardest time to find the movie, took it for me as a gift. Sean Penn does a great job narrating the documentary. I liked how he told the story of each of the Z-Boys and the history of Dogtown. I have been to Venice and its surroundings many times, and I never knew what had happened, until I saw the documentary. I didn't get the chance to see the real movie and I felt that it wasn't close to what the documentary was. I don't know if I actually want to see the film, but who knows.
