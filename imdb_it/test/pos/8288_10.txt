I loved this movie when I was a child. I saw it theatrically. Randy Edelman did a good composition of the soundtrack. David Seville is the father and the head of the registration of the Chipmunks. The Chipmunks are composed by Alvin, who is best known for playing the harmonica, Simon, who is a brilliant and studious squirrel and Theodore, who is the youngest and is always hungry. There is a lady known as Miss Miller, who takes care of the squirrels and has 3 daughters known as Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanor, all of whom have the same character as the Chipmunks. My favorite songs from this soundtrack include "Diamond Dolls", Rock & Roll Girls ", and the touching" My Mother ". Alvin really wanted to see Europe when Dave had to go there on business. Chipmunks meet the Chipettes who play Around the World in 30 days of video games that led them to compete by doing the real thing.
