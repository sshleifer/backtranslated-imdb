"The Cure" is a moving and moving drama. The film focuses on two boys from the neighborhood who become good friends. One of the boys has AIDS. The boys become good friends despite Erik's apprehension at the beginning. The film shows the kids the journey to discover the "cure", which is in Ohio according to "The National Examiner", and how it affects their relationship. The acting is wonderful (I've never seen Annabella Sciorra do better), and the film is simply moving. I couldn't stop crying with the shoe scene. This is a good teardrop. Keep the kleenex nearby. 8/10
