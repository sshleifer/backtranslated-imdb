A short RKO subject. <br /> <br /> A group of turbulent little bullies receive a lesson in tolerance from crooner Frank Sinatra, who compares America to THE HOUSE I LIVE IN. <br /> <br /> This little film provides a pertinent message about the evils of prejudice and prejudice. Sinatra is a natural absolute in front of the camera; intense and sincere, he is the perfect spokesperson for the values ​​displayed here. <br /> <br /> Sinatra sings "The House I Live In" by Lewis Allan and Earl Robinson. This refined melody, with a solid and pro-American message, was the object of a return from the horrendous events of September 11th 2001. <br /> <br /> After Pearl Harbor, Hollywood went to war totally against the Axis. Not only did many of the stars come together or do the service at home, but the Studios' release was largely aimed at the war effort. Newsreels, of course, brought the latest war news to the neighborhood theater every week. The features show battle stories or war-related themes. The subjects and the short vignettes were also used as a rapid means of spreading allied propaganda, increasing morale or disseminating information. Together, Uncle Sam, the American People and Hollywood proved to be an unbeatable combination.
