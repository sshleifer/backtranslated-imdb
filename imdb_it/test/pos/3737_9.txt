I think this show was right for me. I watched it from the plane but in the film there were some parts that made me check from all sides. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane was very credible (fantastic acting in both parts)! I loved how Diane Lane's daughter also acted in the show. He showed maturity and the way he turned during the show was as easy to believe as what a teenager might be in real life. <br /> <br /> I love this show from beginning to end. Definitely recommended for romantic people out there!
