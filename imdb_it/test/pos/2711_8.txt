There's a clever little scene in The Karen Carpenter Story, where both carpenters are in a recording studio, and Richard makes a sudden decision to let Karen sing for the studio owner. <br /> <br /> Richard chooses the wrong key for Karen to sing, so Karen is singing over her natural range. You can see an aspect of fun on the face of the owner; he thinks she really can't sing. Richard quickly understands his mistake and tries again in a different key. The next thing you will hear is Karen's wonderful and beautiful voice, and the owner makes a priceless double. Well done! For some reason, I never forgot that scene. <br /> <br /> The Karen Carpenter Story tells the rapid rise of carpenters and Karen's struggle to overcome anorexia. Many things are ignored. This is not a documentary, and the film left me a lot of questions. Very little is mentioned on Karen's solo adventure (the CD was released just a few years ago. If you buy it, you'll wonder why they waited.) It's Karen's best job. The songs are not as timeless as his work with his brother Richard, but it was a good recording, in my opinion). I have heard that you can listen to a small radio that is poor and consumed in the middle of the Third World, it would seem to produce more static than anything else. But when a Carpenter song arrives on the radio, you'd think you were listening to a $ 1000 Hi-Fidelity unit. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie!
