First of all, I was a fan of the show when my PBS station started showing it in 1981. I learned a lot about the show and the people who were present or contributed to the show. <br /> <br /> This last episode of Doctor Who made a great impression on me. The original series, aka classic series, has been mocked by bad special effects and / or shaky sets. Well, this is no longer true. The special effects are fantastic, but what is even better is writing. You have the chance to learn more about our beloved doctor and perhaps a reason why he loves planet Earth so much. Without giving too far, it is a very useful series to look at. Christopher Eccelston brought a part of the Doctor that we never managed to see, a bitter and angry but at the same time amiable person. <br /> <br /> TO SEE!
