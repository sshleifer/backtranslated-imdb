When Northfork debuted at the Cannes Film Festival, many people didn't like it because they felt it was boring and too slow. While I agree that it was slow (one of the slowest films of the year), in no way was it boring. As Roger Ebert said, "there has never been a film like Northfork." Usually I don't agree with Ebert, but for once he tells the truth. Although the Sunshine State of John Sayles may have some of the same immediate themes, nothing I've ever seen or known can even compare to the surprising originality of the Northfork of the Polish brothers. <br /> <br /> Northfork is a perfect example of how many times it is better to do a few more minutes to go to an auteur film instead of the last Jack Black movie. The plot is not a trivial plot, biscuit cutter; it's so extraordinarily original. A small town in Montana named Northfork has a nearby dam that is about to be demolished. Therefore, the entire city must be evacuated. Some people, however, do not want to leave. In a plot, a young orphan (Duel Farnes) is very sick and bedridden; he is treated by Father Harlan (Nick Nolte). The boy imagines himself as a fallen angel, so to speak, who helps him in his period of illness. <br /> <br /> Although much of the film is simple, some of them could give David Lynch a run for his money. There are strange weather patterns, a strange thing, of wood, huge, and a symbolism that would make Fellini proud. It's not as confusing as a Lynch movie, but it's still pretty strange. This is what makes Northfork so exceptional: it is so out of the ordinary and at the same time simple and plausible. <br /> <br /> Northfork has a magical aspect: it's almost like you're looking at something you're not entirely sure what it is but you feel entranced by it. As I said before, I agreed with Ebert how this film is different from any other. However, I don't agree when he says it's not "funny". He goes on to say that it is simply "compelling". Maybe he just thought he should do good reviews because everyone else is, but instead of how slow it was, I always thought it was a lot of fun, something that many dramas can't do now. <br /> <br /> Northfork may not be the fastest movie or the most popular movie, but if you can get it, you'll be extremely surprised, as I was. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> I vote PG-13 for short sexuality.
