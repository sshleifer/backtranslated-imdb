This first film of the future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the yellow subgenre. Set in rural Italy, there is a serial killer of children in general. Add to the mix a series of characters familiar to yellow cinema fans ?? a madwoman, a journalist, an inefficient police, a sexy siren, a priest, a dumb girl, a lazy minded solitary, etc. This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70s. <br /> <br /> Unusually for a yellow, the victims in this case are young boys, which makes the most typical women change into a corner of danger. The fact that children are the target of the maniac only serves to make things a little more uncomfortable. Fulci is pushing the envelope a bit here and goes even further in a glorious and outrageous scene of a PC in which a boy is subjected to the somewhat inappropriate attention of a naked sexy young woman (Barbara Bouchet) who has been entrusted the task of delivering a drink. He shows himself openly and actively invites the young man to observe her; I finally ask him if he wants to sleep with her. Although she's clearly playing with him, it's still a rather unusual scene. To tell the truth there are one or two fragments of unwittingly amusing dialogue here, but it is very well photographed and Barbara Bouchet exudes high levels of sure appeal to sex. An exceptional scene. Even if you might feel slightly wrong looking at it! <br /> <br /> Together with Barbara Bouchet, the other prominent performance is by Florinda Bolkan, who plays a crazy woman who is accused of killing children. It is not directly responsible, but it is left to the viewer to decide whether his black magic may or may not have started the next murderous madness. Regardless of this, it is hunted by a lynching and a mounted chain while a radio car detonates rock music. This scene is very strong and unpleasant. His wickedness indicates the path that Fulci's career would follow later. <br /> <br /> Despite the visceral impact of the aforementioned murder, it is perhaps a bit strange that the other murders are either bloodless or committed off screen. The only other scene of death comparable to the lynch-mob is the death of the killer at the end of the film, although this sequence is rather stupid. The plot is twisted and flooded with false arches, although personally, I found the identity of the killer a bit predictable. However, this weakness is less problematic in subsequent visualizations ?? like most yellows, Do not Torture A Duckling is eminently re-watchable. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is well made with an impressive camera, solid acting and effective music by Riz Ortolani ?? particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female voice that seems to come from a distant hill. Fulci obviously continued to produce more violent horror films from a graphic point of view, but here he shows a talent for a slightly more sober material. It's still wild stuff, and it's highly recommended for fans of yellow cinema.
