This is simply a good old western style ... not overly complex or long. He does not delude himself into thinking that it was done but for entertainment. And yet, it is one of those westerns that you can look at once and deal with without coming back. It is characterized by former partners Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford, whose friendship is strong despite the fact that Ford Cheyenne Rogers was part of the theft of banks (he even steals Scott's Sheriff Steve Upton without knowing he is his good friend for whom he is a thief ). In the red valley, Upton is under heavy control for a bank robbery that ended with several deaths. Claire Trvor plays the Countess Maletta, a friend of Cheyenne who gives him and her friend "Nitro" (Guinn "Big Boy" Williams) a place to stay for the moment. Cheyenne wants to go straight, but finds it difficult when Jack Lester (Bernard Nedell) and his ugly group want to steal the Red Valley bank. Actually, Jack is behind the murders, but Cheyenne's difficult past is hard to escape. He and Nitro will be accused of the murders they did not commit (the theft was a Cheyenne did not commit) and it will be Upton who somehow must save the day before Lester leaves with the murder. There are sub-plots that include Cheyenne's falling in love with Alison McLeod (Evelyn Keyes), the irony of the story is that Alison's father, Uncle Willie, is actually in league with Banker Stanley Clanton (Porter Hall) in a joint theft designed with Lester to steal the city of Red Valley's loot}. Will Upton discover the treacherous scheme of Uncle Willie and Banker Clanton? Will Uncle Willie be able to cross it without his conscience always bothering him? This film has a fantastic bar fight and a dandy of a climatic shooting. Columbia could not have chosen a better genre to begin the coloring process since this film has some beautiful mountainous strokes as men chase horses and so on. Don't expect the stockings to be discharged, but the film is simple and well structured.
