Pink Flamingos is a film that no word can explain. It was just as good, I thought. Expands movies. Starting with a "multiple" start and ending with a shocking but intelligent ending, Pink Flamingos is one of the best films of the year. Don't miss this opportunity to see a great movie. Rent it on video or watch it at midnight, showing how I did it. But just see it.
