Universal studies. The name evokes so many memories to horror enthusiasts of beautiful opaque paintings ... er ... landscapes, fog-covered countryside, full moons, wolf-like wolves, taverns and crowds wielding torches. And yet, it is rather strange to look back at those films, how little the era that produced the real classics has lasted. The 1930s had its masterpieces, but those were mostly from the directors themselves and many of their films are mostly of historical interest today. The 1940s produced more incredibly fun matinee films than high art did, and many fans agree that the classic era of gothic horror films ended in 1945 with "House of Dracula," he met Abbott & Costello, and was officially dead in the 1950s and the advent of the atomic age. <br /> <br /> So it's strange that one of the best Universal Gothics was made in the 1950s! Only this makes the film an oddity, since costumed dramas were coming out EVERYWHERE. It may not be comparable to all-time classics like the films of James Whale and 'The Wolfman', but damn it condenses all the funny elements of those movies into a delightful gift! Get ready for nothing but pure fun! As various social customs have changed, the film also indulges in violence that would not have been permitted in earlier times; there is no blood, but we see the characters shot and stabbed directly, and there is even a torch lit on the face! <br /> <br /> The film may not be a horror film, but it certainly has the atmosphere, appearance and feeling of one! It starts in the middle of the night with howling winds (and wolves) while two men seal the graves of two apparently dead young lovers, BUT WAIT! One of them is not dead, but he cannot move! He is trapped, but speaks silently in his mind, unable to communicate! What is your story? Now that's how a horror film starts .... <br /> <br /> The English businessman Sir Ronald Burton (Richard Greene, who offers one of his best performances) starts from the pseudonym Richard Beckett for investigate the disappearance of two of his missing friends at the castle of the Austrian count Conte Von Bruno (did you see Sacha Baron Cohen see it?). It seems that many years ago Von Bruno posed as indigenous people in Africa to steal ivory, was exposed by Burton's men and the natives disfigured him. Now he wants revenge. <br /> <br /> The film has all the clichés, a Jonathan Harker-style ride to the castle, an inn full of wary peasants, deadly traps and a backbreaking servant (Lon Chaney Jr.). The scenes of the torture chamber are genuinely intense, including a panel in the floor that activates an underground door (which represents an ingenious escape scene later), a hunting expedition involving an imported panther (!!! ??) and even an alligator well! And then there's the fake Romeo and Juliet style death that leads to the prologue of the film .... The plot is a cliché and the worldview is in black and white. But it's still incredibly fun, with director Nathan Juran making every scene appear on the atmosphere and it looks fresh and new. there are also many weft holes. Why does Ronald try to leave the castle so early? And he never solves the mystery of what happened to his friends even if it's obvious, but he doesn't know when he gives up and he seems so sure before. Strange. <br /> <br /> All the actors are fantastic. Despite being a rough upperclassman, Richard Greene makes Burton one of the most likeable characters I've ever seen in a horror movie. Rita Corday is excellent as the count's "peasant wife", who becomes Burton's love interest, could have the stereotype of "falling in love with a simple look" of all the film heroines of this era, but her portrait of a long-suffering woman in a loveless marriage with a sadistic monster is very convincing, also shows a suspicion and the spirit of some heroines of the film of this era, even seeing a forced attempt by Burton to reassure her (And to beat her necklace, even if it's simply to analyze how he has an important clue) as an attempted rape, but he never seems ugly in his paranoia, the audience sympathizes with her. Although he cannot make Von Bruno seem truly foreign and otherworldly (after all he is a villain in a horror film), Stephen McNally offers a truly chilling performance like the noble sadist. When he reveals his burned eye and laughs madly, it's really scary. Lon Chaney Jr. is also as big as his silent henchman Gargon. <br /> <br /> But the best interpretation is undeniably of Boris Karloff as the mysterious doctor Dr. Meissen. At first he has little time on the screen, but he steals every scene in which he finds himself. It is a performance that is both gruesome, sad, mysterious and ultimately heroic. While evil insults while applying leeches to one of Bruno's henchmen, spies our hero and speaks in that famous "you know I'm sick" voice only Karloff could do, you wonder if he is a hero or a villain, always furtively. And although he acts as the main agent of our hero's escape, he still shows human frailties like greed and fear for his own life, even poisoning a man in cold blood for Burton's benefit, even before Burton accepts. His plan to help our hero and heroine escape also puts them directly into the clutches of Von Bruno as he organizes an incredibly sadistic (If incredibly imperfect) death for them that must have inspired similar scenes in Corman's Poe series. It may not have much screen time, but this is easily one of Boris's best performances. <br /> <br /> While the ending may seem abrupt and anti-climatic for some, half the fun is coming, and there is a lot of excitement to be had. Relax and relive the days when heroes were heroes and villains were bad. It is not a masterpiece, but it is fun for the best escape.
