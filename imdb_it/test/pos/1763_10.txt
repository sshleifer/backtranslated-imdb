Could it be one of the first color films? In reality it is the second. This is a beautiful film produced by Thomas Edison. This was one of his many other films. I think this is the most beautiful of all Thomas Edison films. Show a girl who dances and moves her dress around, which turns red with the film. It is simply beautiful. <br /> <br /> You are looking at the timeline when you look at this. You're looking at what started making the movies of the day great! This may not have a plot, or something very interesting, but this is the second color film ever. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone, especially if you teach students the shootings or something, you have to show them what the color films started!
