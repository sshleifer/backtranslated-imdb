Walt Disney's 20th animated film was the last to be highlighted by the great man himself (he died at the end of 1966) and is not generally considered among their best results. The main problem is that, on the surface, the film seems to be simply the feline version of LADY AND THE TRAMP (1955) or 101 DALMATIONS (1961), both surely most loved by fans. Even so, being both an animation and a cat lover, I dug this reasonably bouncy mixture in which a cuddled cat (voiced by Eva Gabor) and her three kittens are thrown into the streets of Paris by a rich butler (Hermione Baddeley). Fortunately, they meet a streetwise alley cat (Phil Harris) who guides them on the return journey and is further helped along the way by a feline jazz band (led by Scatman Crothers) and two friendly and likeable dogs; Meanwhile at home, butler Edgar celebrates his alleged legacy and the mouse and horse do their part to help their similar feline pets. Legendary entertainer Maurice Chevalier was kidnapped from the boarding house to sing the title song (which includes a verse in French) and Scatman's band indulging in an airy number "Ev'rybody Wants To Be A Cat".
