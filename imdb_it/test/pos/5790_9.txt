This documentary was my first introduction to the theory of Peak Oil. A fascinating concept that has many frightening consequences if it turns out to be correct. I had absolutely no idea that the effects of oil depletion would come so soon, it literally took my breath away. This film will probably open its eyes to how strongly the American lifestyle depends on the abundance of cheap oil - a term used throughout the film. Many of the arguments are common sense, and do not enter into an enormous amount of depth on any of them. But you probably never put all the pieces together like this movie does. Interviews with authors and energy experts are all very interesting. I don't think this film is meant to scare people. It just means informing people about what to expect in the years to come, and maybe encouraging you to think twice about commuting 100 miles to work and leave your lights on all day. <br /> <br /> After watching this film I was no longer able to watch the cars and buses that magnified the same. Great documentary, everyone should see it.
