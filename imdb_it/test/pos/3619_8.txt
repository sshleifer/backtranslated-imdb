As often happens when you try to take a book of over 400 pages and insert it into a two-hour movie, you lose a lot. Here director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) embarks on an extremely ambitious project and almost takes it out. What we get is a fascinating and exciting film that seems somewhat incomplete. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of this film that is wonderful and fantastic. The cinematography of John Toll (director of photography for Braveheart and Legends of the Fall, who won the Oscar for both) is splendid. Working with Madden, the choices for locations on the Greek island of Kefalonia are superb and the visual images that come from the photography of these majestic variable-light locations are lush and beautiful. Madden also uses numerous Greek actors as inhabitants of the city, giving the city an authentic atmosphere. Even the soundtrack is fantastic and the passages and voices of the mandolin players of the Italian soldiers are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Madden does a great job in bringing us the Italian occupation and romance, which occupy most of the film. There are numerous sweet and fun moments in this segment. However, when the serious battle drama is ready to take place, there isn't much film left in the reel and this component is extremely fast and shortened. While the battle scenes are well done, after the battle it is obvious that more and more compromises are being made to keep the film too long. The moment we reach the post-war scenes, the treatment is simply skeletal. Another downside is that the DVD is particularly basic on features. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is charming in the role of the romantic protagonist as the sentimental captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight. When he fights he must, Cage changes gears seamlessly in a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains credible in both characters. <br /> <br /> Penelope Cruz, which the camera loves, gives an uninspired performance like Pelagia. In part this is due to the fact that Cage dominates the screen, but Cruz seems too quiet in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic. It allows the character to be objectified as Corelli's love interest rather than affirming him as a powerful character in its own right. <br /> <br /> John Hurt offers a fantastic performance like the old wise doctor, who knows a lot about human nature as medicine. However, Christian Bale seems a bit exaggerated and rigid as Pelagia's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie an 8/10. Despite some drawbacks, this is a touching film that is worth seeing. Photography alone is worth the price of admission.
