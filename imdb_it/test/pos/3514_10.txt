Just Before Dawn is an excellent horror film. It is atmospheric, full of tensions made of wonderful shots of wild nature, in which few young people meet their destiny, in the form of two fucking, fat bastards, who massacre them. Jeff Lieberman is a very talented and intelligent director, unfortunately underestimated. He reached the tension, not with blood, but showing a threatening natural environment. Lieberman manages to build a tension in a very linear, simplistic way, which is also the best way, not to show the viewer the blood, but to make him imagine the worst thing that happens to the characters. <br /> <br /> Just Before Dawn has always been compared to the massacre of the Texas Chainsaw, Deliverance and Hills have eyes. It's as beautiful as Deliverance, better than Hills, I mean scarier and better realized, and it's as disturbing as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. <br /> <br /> JBD is one of the best horrors of the last decades, which finally lives on DVD!
