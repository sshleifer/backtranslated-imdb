This short film certainly does not punch. The story is of a butcher who unjustly kills an innocent man who he believes has sexually molested his retarded daughter. The film shows how the butcher serves his time and comes back to life with his daughter in care, and has to deal with a life without a future. <br /> <br /> The opening scenes of a horse being slaughtered and the complete frontal birth of the butchers' daughter puts you in a brutal mood that accompanies you throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The lively flow of the film is very direct and increases its brutality. As a result, a lot of land is covered in the 40 minutes. You are completely absorbed by non-life butchers, particularly after losing your daughter in social services and her business. His story continues in the excellent movie Seul Contre Tous
