I hate soccer !! I hate soccer fans! I hate cars! but this film was the funniest thing I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> I was given the great opportunity to watch this movie over the weekend, and all I have to say is that I laughed until I cried, and when it will be available in the UK and in Denmark. Girls, this is a football movie that you'll need to see, its hilarious! <br /> <br /> The fact that this film started out as a crazy advertisement for a phone company is simply amazing, the guys might not be well-known actors, but this is a real humor, with real people, and I first applaud them for bringing it to the screen. <br /> <br /> WELL DONE!
