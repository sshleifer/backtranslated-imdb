It seems that all people didn't like Steven Seagal: just take a look at his nomination list, there are only nominations for the Razzie awards (with a win) for him, but I think he didn't make any money. I've seen good movies with Steven Seagal, I've seen bad movies with Steven Seagal. AND THE PATRIOT (1998) is one of his best films, almost like UNDER SIEGE (1992) or HARD TO KILL (1990). THE PATRIOT shows its activities to protect nature. Surely, this film is not exceptional, and I must say that there is more violence than I like, and why does Seagal's best friend, L. Q. Jones, die from the death of a victim? Dr. McClaren's role is one of Seagal's best shows. He has, as always, an excellent charisma. And in summary, THE PATRIOT is good entertainment and with an average rating of just 4 points the most underrated film of all time. <br /> <br /> Kind regards, Hans-Dieter
