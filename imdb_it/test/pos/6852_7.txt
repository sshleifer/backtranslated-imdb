OK, Anatomie is not a reinvention of the genus Horrormovie, but nevertheless it is well done. The good actors (Potente and FÃ¼hrmann at the beginning) and some nice ideas made me happy. Maybe I wouldn't have been so positive if this wasn't a German movie, but who cares. It's nice to see familiar faces in a good story, with some gore and a few jokes. You all complained about dubbing: I didn't see a dubbed version (of course), but I think it's not easy for you to watch dubbed movies. We (Germans) are used to watching movies like that, so it's not a big deal. But try looking in German with subtitles. The actors are really good!
