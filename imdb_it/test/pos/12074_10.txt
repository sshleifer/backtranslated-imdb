Ann-Margret has done the best job she has ever done in her film history. I felt like she was Mrs. Frey. There may be one or two Ann-Margret films that I haven't seen since his feature film debut in "Pocket full of Miracles" with Betty Davis in 1961. I feel it was totally undervalued in the industry. Although she was nominated for an Emmy Award for this role in "Who Will Love My Children", she was neglected. As if nominated for an Academy Award for her roles in "Carnal Knowledge" and "Tommy", she was snubbed. Overall, I think everyone has done an excellent acting job, including all the kids from "Who Will Love My Children". Yes, it's a sad film (like real stories), but it's worth it. Thank you.
