If you read the book by Carl Hiaasen, the film practically follows the form, with some minor changes to Hollywood. In my opinion this is a great family film. Luke Wilson (Officer Delinko) steals the show well from a cast of stars that includes Robert Wagner and Jimmy Buffet. The film guys do a great job led by Logan Lerman, Brie Larson and Cody Linley. <br /> <br /> Brie Larson is perhaps a little too small to play Beatrice. I imagined an older girl, maybe 6 feet, 175 pounds, in the role of Beatrice. This could have made her more credible in her role of beating Dana. They should have developed more of his "tough girl" character and bitten her through a tire, or kicked a soccer ball through a person. She's very pretty, and I understand why she was cast, it's a box office attraction. <br /> <br /> This is about the PG of a movie these days, no sex and very little violence. This film is a dream of parents that becomes reality, a film with a strong environmental message, with kids who deeply appreciate the beauty of Florida and its wildlife. It shows how adults have fallen into the administration of our planet and that our children can ask for better. One of my favorite jokes in the film is when Mullet Fingers says: "Florida could use mountains like Montana, Florida is so flat that there is nothing to stop developers from cleaning it from coast to coast". Furthermore, Florida wildlife photography spoke without dialogue. As a film for families with children aged 5 to 15, this is a great movie! As a bonus, parents will be entertained, especially if they are "parrothead".
