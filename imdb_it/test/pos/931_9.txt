and there are not many in the history of cinema. "Rouge" seems to be a bit of a hope. I hope in the human race and in life. But to say only that it can be naive. Kieslowski could find the right way to tell the story of that embittered judge and the twentish but wise model. Perhaps that old and disappointing love story will not be repeated - this is the new couple with the young judge after the accident-. But what about this camera master? You can't miss a second of the movie because you have to look at each of those faces. Kieslowski loved humans and this is quite evident in the way the camera treats the actors. Ms. Jacob and Mr. Tringtignant are perfect. It's not just this movie, but the "Don't kill" and "A love story" downbeat that you can think of contemporary cinema as a way of expressing the point of view of a artist. Too bad the American public - the average one - can't see these films. At least I'm not in the Maltin dictionary. And even the Baseline doesn't know what to say about this unique man. abel posadas
