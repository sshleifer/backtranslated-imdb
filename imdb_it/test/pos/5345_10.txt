Who can ask for more? Taking my 2 and 4 year olds was a risk, I admit. But it's worth it. They were fascinated by credit credit, with their parents next to them. <br /> <br /> I took the children to films before with mixed results: too scary, too boring, too sophisticated, anything. With this film, however, I was happy to see an intelligent film with wit, style and a sense of passion that emanated from the screen. Any film that takes 5 (!) Years of production to produce, for better or for worse, deserves respect for the courage and patience needed to shoot a film like this. <br /> <br /> O.K. I'm gushing a little. Then again, why wouldn't I get excited? Watching the list of films today only reminded me of the poor quality of the films distributed. At least for the moment Regardless of this, W & G is a well-made film. Perhaps the originality was not the most inspired, however, well told and well done. <br /> <br /> Too much adult humor? Too many sexual references? Could be. Even if my children didn't really catch them. Too young So, in my case, I never noticed. <br /> <br /> Well, needless to say, I liked it.
