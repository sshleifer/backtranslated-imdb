I wasn't even born when this series was released in the United States. It took about a decade before British television networks took care of it. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was lucky enough to see the very first episode, in which The Lone Ranger was one of a group that came across an ambush and massacre. TLR was the only survivor. Although seriously injured, he was rescued by a passing Indian called Tonto. I believe he wore a mask to hide his true identity for fear of reprisals. But instead it has become all the more recognizable. I don't know if he wore it in his sleep. <br /> <br /> This was Saturday's tea time. The trumpets of the fanfare of the overture of William Tell foresaw a leap to television, food still in hand. Although it soon became a repetitive and predictable hokum. No one has ever unmasked him. No one ever managed to punch, no one ever shot him. He was a little too good, and only a little too encamped in his suit for most children. Poor Tonto, on the other hand, became his aunt Sally. He always made fun of himself and tied up and kidnapped and stuff. <br /> <br /> And what did you keep calling The Lone Ranger? 'King Savvy' was the general consensus in which I lived. He seemed to imply "the great acquaintance" in the Indian language. But it sounds like something else, as if Mr. Silverheels had a speech impediment. 'Kemosabe'; what the hell is it? <br /> <br /> A duo later and less well-marketed called "The Range Rider" and "Dick West" eventually won my vote. This featured a Jock Mahoney with a naked face that beat pretty well in each episode and was less overall camp, less super and more believable. <br /> <br /> Still; even today I can't hear the opening of Guglielmo Tell without expecting the hoof gallop and a friendly Hi-Oh Silver. Stupid devotion.
