Usually I don't like watching movies while I'm still in theaters because of the high ticket prices, but I saw a poster for Some Things That Stay and I thought, "that young actress seems smart and mysterious, not like the usual BS teenybopper ". So I decided to take the plunge and see this movie on its opening night. <br /> <br /> I have to tell you, I was happily surprised. I went to this movie without expectations. I didn't really know what it was, but the raw emotion and honest teenage experiences expressed by Katie Boland left me quite satisfied with my decision. Even Alberta Watson did a fantastic job as the role of the mother suffering from Tamara's illness and I must also add that I was very impressed by Megan Park's comic style as Tamara's friend Brenda. <br /> <br /> The film was wonderfully directed by Gail Harvey, and worked together in that kitschy way of the 50s that leaves you warm and happy, even though the plot tended not to be so uplifting. I also thought the film was well shot, many beautiful images of a 1950s campaign will remain in my mind for weeks to come. <br /> <br /> This film as a whole was extravagant and grandiose. I found it unpredictable and although the story ends in a somewhat open way, I was satisfied. Whether you are looking for a fun, but powerful, or simply wanting to remember life story in the 50s, I guarantee you that this film is for you. Even if you have no expectations, it is likely that you will be more affected. Give this a shot!
