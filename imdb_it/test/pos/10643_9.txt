After reading a biography of the last Russian tsar (Nicholas II) and his failure to guarantee the support of the army, I decided to try this film. I saw it with a completely open mind, not knowing everything about it (except its reputation). <br /> <br /> These are the things that impressed me the most. <br /> <br /> 1) The shots of warships and soldiers used as extras. More than once I stopped to think "if this was done in this time and place, 80% of this would have been computer generated". <br /> <br /> 2) Realism in it. From the meat infested by the larvae to the shot of the sailor with his candle and to the legend "Killed for a bowl of soup", this film makes no concessions to the cause of the PC (which, fortunately, had not yet been invented). <br /> <br /> 3) The slow descent into the madness of the sequence of Odessa steps. From the first blow, when the man without limbs appears, one gets the idea that something could be wrong; since the overall shots are composed, however, you end up feeling comfortable in your environment. Then an amputee appears and people begin to fall into dramatic poses. However, the shots are composed ... until the Cossacks appear on stage and the incredible strikes appear. This scene is easily worth the admission price. <br /> <br /> 4) The fact that this film is 100% pure propaganda. Then again, when Rambo fought in Afghanistan, he was also having something to do with "propaganda"; just a different type. <br /> <br /> In general: a film marked by some slow narrative. However, Metropolis, Dr. Caligari's cabinet and this film are perfect examples of imaginative and inventive films that are still remembered for their merits. They make boring and repetitive modern movies really boring.
