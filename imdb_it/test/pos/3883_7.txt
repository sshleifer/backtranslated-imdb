James Aaron, a plump actor who lives in Chicago, is a man who loves to eat things that are not good for him. This is clarified soon, as Dick, a friendly salesman, advises him to stay away from junk food. Aaron, an actor working in the Second City of Chicago, is a loving man with not much luck in the love department. He still lives with his mother, a spunky woman who encourages him to go out and have fun. James has another job in a sort of "Candid Camera" where people are set up for unusual situations, like surprising a mechanic and telling him that he is the father of a daughter he never knew. <br /> <br /> The day he meets his friend Larry, he learns of the casting for the remake of "Marty", his favorite movie. Being a large man, he clearly identifies with the character of the film. In many ways, James' life itself is comparable to that of Paddy Chayefsky's creation in the photo. He wants to try the part because he knows he can do justice to the role. <br /> <br /> One day he meets Beth in a soda fountain. James likes the woman, who one day invites him to go shopping with her for underwear. He ends up having sex with her, thinking they are going well, but Beth has another surprise coming when she tells him that the reason they went to bed was because she had never done it with a fat man. After being disappointed, James runs into an attractive elementary school teacher who seems to share his love of jazz. In the end, we watch James realize his long dream of acting in a theater production of "Marty" in a nursing home. <br /> <br /> Jeff Garlin, who is a fascinating character, shows a talent for the type of comedy associated with his friend Larry David. Although both men differ in acting styles, his interpretation of James Aaron is right. As a director, he has already done so, although this is an original concept he should pursue. <br /> <br /> One of the strengths of the film are the people involved in the project. Sarah Silverman makes an impression for her interpretation of Beth. Bonnie Hunt underestimates her role as a school teacher with good results. Mina Kolb, is seen as her mother, a role she played in "Curb Your Enthusiasm" with excellent results. Director Paul Mazursky is also in a minor role. Joey Slotnick, Tim Kazurinsky, Richard Kind, David Pasquesi, Larry Neumann Jr, Gina Gershon and the rest of the cast make a valuable contribution. <br /> <br /> Jeff Garlin is a talented man whose next engagement will be welcomed by his fans.
