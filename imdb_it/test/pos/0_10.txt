I went and saw this movie last night after being convinced by some of my friends. I admit that I was reluctant to see it because from what I knew about Ashton Kutcher he was only capable of doing comedy. I was wrong. Kutcher played the character of Jake Fischer very well and Kevin Costner played Ben Randall with such professionalism. The sign of a good movie is that it can play with our emotions. This has done exactly that. The entire theater (which was sold out) was overwhelmed with laughter during the first half of the film, and they were moved to tears during the second half. As I left the theater I not only saw many women in tears, but also many adult men, desperately trying not to let anyone see them cry. This film was great and I suggest you go and see it before judging.
