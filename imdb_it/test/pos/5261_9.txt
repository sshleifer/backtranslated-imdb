I'm a 58 year old man. On a rainy afternoon my wife suggested I go and see Women. After reading the reviews I thought it could lead to an afternoon nap. Wrong: this film aroused my interest from beginning to end. It was nice to finally see Meg Ryan look super again. Let's face it, Meg looks much better with long hair. Annette Benning looked different to me in every scene she was in. Candice Bergen shows her age as Carrie Fisher. The daughter, Molly, was exceptionally performed by the young India. I was able to understand the dialogue that is difficult in many current films due to the rapid speech. Cloris Leachman and the Finnish woman were as fantastic as the cleaning ladies who extend their regular duties. The New York scenes were beautiful to look at. Oh, and Bette Midler had a short role but as usual it was great. So I gave this chick flick a 9. Boys - Go see it just for the sweet eyes like Eva Mendes. It will not disappoint.
