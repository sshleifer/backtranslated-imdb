I saw some of Mr. Boorman's films and I didn't like it very much. Not that they are bad films, on the contrary they are good films, but not satisfied personally I found them amusing. However I think that Where is Heart Is, despite being made to satisfy the American public less expert in art, is as masterful as satire, and as a social commentary of the times in which it was created. I had to replace this film in my collection at least half a dozen times, since every time I borrow it from someone I know, he could appreciate his artistry at all levels, my copy can't get home from me, lol. The last time it took 7 years to replace it since it was out of print for VHS sales, it was never made like a DVD I know, and I had to wait until one of the premium cable channels had run it before I could try again. <br /> <br /> My favorite aspect after the social comment "nail on the head" are the paintings of Timna Woolen. I have been trying for 15 years to find someone or anywhere that could take me to where his work is available for sale. Or better yet, a copy of the film's paintings without the end credits that cover them. I have a room in my house that I dedicated to making copies of his paintings, and no one seems to know if it was ever published as a desktop book, or aquarium video, or as a documentary of his work. If anyone knows where I can buy a copy of Timna's work or where his studio is located in England, don't hesitate to contact me via email.
