Lucio Fulci, later known for his horror graphic films such as The Beyond and Zombie, was years before a master of Italian crime fiction (in the company of Argento and Bava) with films like A Lizard In A Woman's Skin and his masterpiece, Do not Duckling Torture. This film has all the elements of the Italian mystery / thriller genre known as the yellow, but it really attracts viewers by having each key character with a skeleton in their wardrobe. This helps you do all the detective work of the detectives in the film itself. Who is killing the young boys in the city? The rich young woman who is so bored that she sexually taunts potential victims, the journalist who likes to tamper with a crime scene to get a better photo, the village woman with a mentally retarded daughter, the local witch, the idiot of the city ​​.. ..the list goes on, and you have to keep mental notes like a real game to play and solve. The themes of this film are very bold and made with that perfect Italian style in the early 1970s. It is certain that no American studio would have ever thought of making a film with such strong content, and this is precisely why this is such a satisfying film (despite some unusual dubbing choices) and it will surely have people discussing it much after seeing it. As the saying goes, they don't make them that way anymore, so take a copy and keep an important movie like this!
