If we maintain a rigid historical perspective, this film is quite funny. He has action, adventure and romance, and one of the first casting castings of the time with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the lead roles. As evident in this forum, the image does not go unnoticed with the purists who seek 100% accuracy in their story. To go further, just put aside the history book and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. I know, I know, it's hard to do if you consider Custer's last resistance to the Little Big Horn and its importance in the history of post-civil war America. So I imagine there is an unresolved dilemma with the image, no matter how you look at it. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to see here even if for the two hours of the photo plus the running time. Custer's arrival at West Point is probably the first scratch card, riding like he does with military insignia. The practical skirmish of Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) who placed him in the major's headquarters probably should have got them both into trouble. <br /> <br /> Ironically, many scenes in this military film play for the comedy, as in the case of Custer's first meeting with Libby Bacon and subsequent meetings that include tea reader Callie (Hattie McDaniel). I hadn't noticed it before in other films, but McDaniel reminded me of a lot of another favorite character of mine from the 1940s, Mantan Moreland. So much so that in one scene it looked like Moreland had covered it with a dress. With that in mind, even the owl scene was a blast. <br /> <br /> As for Flynn, it is interesting to note that a year earlier he played J.E.B. Stuart in front of Ronald Reagan's performance of General Custer in "Santa Fe Trail", both vying for the attention of none other than Olivia de Havilland. In that film, Reagan did not put arrogance and ostentation in the Custer character that history remembers, while in Flynn's portrait here is more than evident. But it doesn't come close to that of Richard Mulligan in the role of the military hero in the "Little Big Man" of the 70s. Let's just say that one was a little exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Better to take away the image I had for myself was the way Custer persisted in maintaining his good name and not betting on a risky business venturing. This is his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed throughout history. The most touching was the final confrontation with the bitter rival Sharp just before getting on the Little Big Horn, in which he declared that hell or glory depended entirely on a person's point of view. Previously, a similar observation could have given us the best intuition of all about Custer's character, when he declared: "You glory with yourself when it's your time to go".
