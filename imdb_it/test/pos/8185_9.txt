Chen Kaige gives us a magnificent depth of atmosphere. Yes, it's a "vintage piece", but the artistic use of images of Chen makes it something more. Actors often act as players using the stylized diction, postures and facial expressions of Peking Opera. All the actors in a scene play at the "back wall" even when they talk to each other. They are like the spirits of the past who powerfully enunciate a story with an urgent meaning for those in the present. Combined with a particular attention to the dimensions and to the masterly cinematography inside and outside, "Jing ke ci qin wang" is a breathtaking story told with great reverence in its own language that fascinates completely.
