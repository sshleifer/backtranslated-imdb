yes, barney doesn't make sense now, but when I was a kid it made perfect sense. <br /> <br /> I did not have more intelligence, but I liked it. as a child I was mocked because nobody could say my name so I changed it. since I was 4 I took the name of Tina from Barney because I could identify with her in a different culture. Now I'm 17 and Barney is a huge part of my life. ... my name came from this .... I can't see the show I grew up, no matter how stupid it looks now. <br /> <br /> I don't care if I get stuck I don't have anything to say. they shouldn't do the 10 minimum lines because some people don't have much to say. OK done
