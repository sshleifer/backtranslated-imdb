I too must apologize for having a somewhat biased opinion about this attempt while contributing to the soundtrack. However I received my copy, I sat down and enjoyed the cast of characters that were perhaps more colorful than the characters they were creating in this story of a shanghai movie sequel. For those who believe that George Bush is a "credible Texan", one should not look beyond this film to shatter the image that Texas is full of guided trucks, one-dimensional rednecks. The cast contains some of the most intelligent, peculiar and humorous people that you will find everywhere as they make their stories of suffering, bliss and disappointment in a great film sequel, without budget, guerrilla style (ie "punk rock style" as each person helps define ). <br /> <br /> This is a great documentary made with passion and courage and all the poison that you will have to break through on the other side of any bs and double sector you are dealing with (take note of authors, painters, musicians and fellow directors). Return to the credibility of the first wave of American hardcore music when the term "D.I.Y." It was the standard, a period in which courage, passion and commitment were much more important than technique, style or precious calculations. Not that there isn't much technique or style for this ... the tone of the documentary is rather refreshing. Editing cuts provide as much drama as dialogue in it. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​creating a documentary from the sad fate of the cast, crew and initial intention of the director is brilliant, totally Texan and absolutely punk rock. In the true sense of the term.
