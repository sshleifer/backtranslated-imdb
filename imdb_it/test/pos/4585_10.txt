I am considering this an 8 due to the premise of the film. The acting was fine, there was no one who stood out as surprising or terrifying. It is disturbingly true that intelligent people are having fewer and fewer children, or they choose not to have any at all ... while the stupid "W in '04" supporters are procreating rabbits. And, although I don't think the earth will actually exist for 500 years, I can see Mike Judge's parodied prophet coming, like life imitating art. The world is run by idiots and will get worse when intelligent people who think freely become the minority and "deceived" fans will outnumber them. The proof is our farce of an election. <br /> <br /> But I digress. If you are lucky enough to have this game in your city, go see it. I paid my $ 7.50 more popcorn to see FAR WORSE rubbish than this (Date Movie or Napoleon Dynamite someone?). There are laughs, there are chills, but overall this is fun. If you have half a brain, you will think to yourself how this movie, even if funny, is well chosen (precise) and a * very small * a little disturbing. I am not at all surprised by the fact that this film is almost completely unknown, as Fox was the one who distributed it, and did not want any of their sheep to see it and thought "maybe I will read a book and will not watch" Next ', or' Cheaters' , or 'Ow my balls'. "If our society doesn't block the dumbing down of everything, and the bastardization of the English language (ahem, Mr. Bush), then this is really where we are going.
