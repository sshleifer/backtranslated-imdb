Three American guys are making their way around Europe, challenging each other to rack up so many reckless stunts and Hot Babe throws as much as they can, But Andy seeks true love. He finds it during the bungee-jump attempt on the Eiffel Tower, when he incredibly meets and saves Julie Delpy, a suicidal woman with a beating heart. His attempts to find this girl and the secret he finds bring him and his friends on a frantic adventure full of action, romance, blood and inspired humor, never taking themselves seriously, or striving to be something other than wild fun 90 minutes of running. I've seen this movie a number of times and found it a much more rewarding experience than the original "London", even though both films are so different that it's not fair to compare the two or even consider them a sequel.
