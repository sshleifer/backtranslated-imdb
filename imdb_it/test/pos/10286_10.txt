Much has already been written about the film itself, so instead of adding to the noise I just want to say a few words about the two female actors. <br /> <br /> It must be a daunting prospect for any actress to play, in a sense, against the spectacular Monica Bellucci, but Romane Bohringer pushes her to sensational goals. A film starring Monica Bellucci where I fall in love with the other girl ?? This should not happen. <br /> <br /> It has been said a thousand times, but Monica Bellucci is the saddest figure in modern cinema. I have never seen such innate sadness before. She wouldn't have been out of place in Lon Chaney's heart.
