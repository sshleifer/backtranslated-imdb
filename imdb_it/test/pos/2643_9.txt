Straight, I love this movie. I like everything about it. It has a fantastic soundtrack, has many recognizable faces and is fun to die for. There are so many plots in this movie and each of them is fun in one way or another. <br /> <br /> When Spicolli lights up the screen two years ago, Drake is almost as memorable as a character. All he wants is to have fun. He moves out of the house without parental consent, skips work whenever he wants, is sex-obsessed, loves his drugs and alcohol and tries to be a good friend. It's his carefree attitude to make him so happy to watch. And it comes out with great lines. And there are so many little observations that you don't see coming but they make you laugh at the speed when it hits you. A special moment is when Tommy and Bill are talking about Bill's ex-girlfriend with someone else. At the end of the conversation, Tommy takes his huge bottle of beer and throws it on his shoulder, casually. Then he says good night and the scene ends. It's a perfect scene. Tommy's world is his. He really lives at the party and has fun. When the conversation is over, his time is up and he doesn't care who offends in the process. He has an innocence on him. "It's casual" is his favorite saying. <br /> <br /> Another such classic scene is Reggie giving Bill a donut. He says something to him that my friends and I will never forget why we rewound the film ten times and we watched that part over and over again making us laugh. They must be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Wild Life is a return to when teenage comedies were funny, vulgar, had a good ear, entertained us and just wanted us to lose ourselves in their world for 90 minutes. Wild Life does all those things perfectly. If this is a movie you haven't seen, give it a chance. It's a classic. <br /> <br /> Also take a look at the guy in the gun shop with whom Jim has problems. It's a very familiar face now and it's his first big screen role.
