I saw The D's new film tonight at a special screening, and I was so shocked by its sheer size that I felt I had to go to IMDb and get the word out. Of course, I was already a big fan of D's work: I loved the HBO series and listened to their music every week (there's nothing better for singing together), but this appreciation made me more apprehensive about showing tonight (for us, they've all been disappointed at one time or another by something we love when they tried to jump to the big screen). With "The Pick of Destiny" by Tenacious D, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this movie is harder than any I've ever seen and it's more fun and majestic than anything else, Peter Jackson, Pixar, and Will Ferrell together could produce. It tells the story of D before we got to know them, creating intriguing educational stories of Kage and Jables, their stories together, and how they were inspired to write songs about things like Lee, Sasquatch and God. Above all, they reveal the real inspiration for the biggest song in the world, "Tribute", and how it was born (which is different from the HBO series). After seeing it, you probably won't be able to remember it (hence the Tribute), but your mind will change forever with its genius. <br /> <br /> I don't often go to the cinema anymore because of the high price of the ticket and the hassle of parking, paying scandalous concession prices, etc., but I usually make exceptions when acting with someone I really love or that concerns something of the same variety. "The Pick of Destiny" was so beautiful that I have no problem coming back to see it again when it comes out nationally, and I'm going to convince all my friends too. Last week we saw "Borat" and we loved it, but this is honest for good, TEN TIMES BETTER. For all those who really love rock music and comic genius, watch this movie. The talent of these guys is so great that you shouldn't hesitate to support their cause. You will not be disappointed and the Rock Lords will smile favorably on you.
