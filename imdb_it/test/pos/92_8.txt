I imagine this film could get rave reviews in Canada, particularly in Quebec. This is because Canadians have traditionally loved hockey and Canadians in Montreal have been like gods in Canada for decades. As an American, the closest thing we have to them is the New York Yankees. If you are a fan, then you are the biggest and most successful team in history. If you're not a fan, then I'm Satan's team !! Well, at least that's how I grew up in Washington, DC with regards to the Dallas Cowboys. So I'm pretty sure when this movie was shown in the North that everyone suffered a strong emotional reaction: their national sport And the closest thing to a national team in the NHL. <br /> <br /> Now the cartoon itself is moderately interesting when it starts and the main character talks about growing up around Ottawa and rooting for Canadians And Maurizio "the rocket" Richard. However, when his mother accidentally bought him a Toronto Maple Leafs shirt and forced him to wear it, I knew immediately what would have been horrible and shameful for a boy. This ability to connect to the character - even if he lives in a distant land is what made this short film very special. The way the other children treated him and his conversation with God eventually made this a delightful nostalgic film. Very clever and memorable.
