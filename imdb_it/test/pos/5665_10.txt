Giorgino is a long, atrocious journey from evil to worst in the protagonist's life after which the film takes its name. A young lieutenant demobilized, poisoned by gas, a very delicate health lieutenant, who was previously a doctor in an orphanage for children with some mental deprivation, he goes in search of their new position and finds much more than he ever intended and rather than a different nature. Depressive atmosphere of extreme desperation, in which the crowds are much less horrible than the healthy ones, where madness is a kind of poetry, will keep you mesmerized from the first shots of this film to the last. And all the beauty: beauty of winter and mountains, beauty of snowy landscapes and wild woods, I don't even know how all the pain and sadness of the last days of war can be made so beautiful.
