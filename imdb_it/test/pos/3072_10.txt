There won't be a moment in this movie where you're not laughing. This is Mel Brooks in one of his best moments, and Cary Elwes takes away the part of Robin with convincing humor. Every time you watch this movie you will discover a new joke, but the ones you've noticed before will never grow old. Highly recommended!
