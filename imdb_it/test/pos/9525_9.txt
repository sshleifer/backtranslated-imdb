The Railway Children, at least in this 1970 film version written and directed by Lionel Jeffries, a longtime historical actor, is a classic ... not mitigated. It tells a childhood story with great simplicity and charm; sentimentality is silenced; the evocation of childhood adventures is engaging; and Jeffries brings intelligence and style to its production. <br /> <br /> The Waterbury family lead an idyllic life in Edwardian London. The father is prosperous, the mother is beautiful and loving, the children are polite and affectionate, their home is warm and welcoming. Then one night, during the Christmas holidays, two men appear on the threshold, talk quietly to their father and then take him away. In a moment the lives of Mrs Waterbury (Dinah Sheridan) and Bobbie, 14 (Jenny Agutter), Phyllis, 12 (Sally Thomsett) and Peter (Gary Warren) have changed. Only their fortitude and good humor will see them through. Now faltering in poverty, Ms. Waterbury takes her children to live in an old, moldy brick house in the countryside near a railway line, not too far from a small village with a train station. The children discover the railway and sit regularly on a small hill to greet the passengers as the train approaches. One day an old gentleman, going about his business in the city, looks up from his newspaper and finds himself greeting him. It will not be long before he will play an important part of the story. <br /> <br /> As time goes by, Mrs. Waterbury brings all her love and intelligence to bear her children. Start writing stories to earn money. She teaches them their lessons and provides a home of warmth and security for them. The story, however, concerns these three children, particularly Bobbie. At 14, she is old enough to want to share her mother's concerns, yet young enough to enjoy her adventures with her sister and her brother. They find a poor man at the station who can't speak English. They find out they are a Russian refugee who no longer knows where his wife and son are. They insist that he must go home with them, and their mother welcomes him. Shortly after the children wrote a large sign to the old gentlemen on the train to ask for his help. They help a young man participate in a hedge that breaks a leg in a railway tunnel. Soon, he is home to recover. They decide to organize a birthday party for the station master of the station, a man with few friends and many children who is a bully for his dignity. It is not long before the children help him to understand the difference between friendship and charity. In other words, the three children encounter all sorts of problems in their childhood adventures and manage to be instrumental in seeing that all problems have a happy ending. <br /> <br /> But what are their problems? Eventually Bobbie learns from his mother that his father was taken away because he had been accused of treason, giving state secrets to the Russians. Will Bobbie be able to find a way to help? Will the old gentleman be more than just an old gentleman on a running train? Will the father's case be reopened? Will there be a happy ending? <br /> <br /> Jenny Agutter was almost 18 when she turned her part; the fourteen-year-old Bobbie plays with great naturalness and charm. As important as the other players, especially Dinah Sheridan as a mother, Agutter is the heart of the story. For me, it's the talent of Jenny Agutter and the style and moderation of Lionel Jeffries that make this film so memorable. The problems of history have no serious doubts, but they will be solved. And Jeffries not only gives us a well-adapted and direct film, he adds touches that are barely noticeable but that enchant us. This could include only a fraction of a second of a still image when two people talk; or a slow close-up of a small yellow flower in the grass outside Bobbie's house, then a slow return from a yellow oil lamp that was inside; or the awareness that a delightful inner shot or a view of the green countryside or a look at the train station from a hill ... all suddenly remember those fascinating hand-dyed Edwardian designs of a perfect past time. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this sweet story cannot compete for the time children need nowadays to perfect their Nintendo monster-splitting skills. I'm pretty sure it would never catch the attention of most of their parents, especially those weaned on Batman and Leo. Still, it is a perfectly combined film and should not be forgotten. Incidentally, 19 years later the story was told as a television program. This time, Jenny Agutter played the mother.
