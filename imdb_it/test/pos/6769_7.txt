Send them to the freezer. This is the solution that two butchers find after discovering the popularity of selling human meat. An incredible story with humor and possible allegories that make it much more than a horror movie. Complex characters challenge the superficial classification and make the story intriguing and useful - if you can stand it. Definitely a dark film but also a little redemptive.
