First of all, I have to say that I love this movie. <br /> <br /> It was the first film I saw from director Michael Haneke and I was impressed that the management was good! <br /> <br /> Haneke surely knows how to direct the actors. What I found interesting is also Haneke's scenario. At first you saw a woman who is very heterosexual and seems to be a good piano teacher and very loved and respected by everyone in her entourage. Then you realize that she has a mother who is a contrite maniac and is too present in her life. Now you know that she's unbalanced, that she has emotional problems, but you don't know exactly what. And then you fall into its dark side, but its dark side is revealed only when a student falls in love with her. He can no longer control himself. <br /> <br /> The roles are very complex and difficult to interpret, but Isabelle Huppert is wonderful in her role and deserves the recognition she received at the Cannes Film Festival. Benoit Maginel is also very solid, but somewhat eclipsed by Huppert's performance. <br /> <br /> There is one thing that I found strange in the scenario is how the character played by Magimel is not very credible. He's too talented! It is rare that a person is a virtuoso of the piano, but he spends the maximum of his time playing hockey and studying ... He thinks it is a weak point, but only a small flaw. <br /> <br /> I just saw the movie once, so I can't do a very complete critic, because I haven't analyzed the film. I like what I've seen! so I give the film an 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Oh yes ... as for the end, Haneke showed he really wanted to shock his audience. A motivation that he doesn't believe is necessary to make films, but Haneke does it with style and precision, that's why his film is better than Baise-Moi for example. <br /> <br /> Vince
