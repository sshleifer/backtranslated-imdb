David "master of the debonair" Niven plays the Big Boss (IVAN) who entrusts the unfortunate Richard Jordan (PINKY) by forcing the unfortunate ex-con to exploit his new badly found position in a bank. Elke Sommer (Miss PELHAM) provides the female interest more effectively, to which Pinkie cannot simply not resist. They seem to have been unable to decide a single name for this film, so instead they used four .... Honestly, this turns out to be one of Niven's last roles. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is fun and worth watching if you can catch one of its rare or late TVs. <br /> <br />
