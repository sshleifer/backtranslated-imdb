Empire of Passion starts misleadingly - that is, if you immediately expect it to be a horror movie. It's like a riff on James M. Cain of The Postman Always Rings Twice, at first: Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) is a mother of two children and a respectful and hard-working wife to the rickshaw pilot Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura). But when he's not around, and she's home with the baby, the young and unprejudiced young Toyoji (Tatsuya Fuji) comes around to bring some grain to Seki ... and a little more. They are soon sleeping together, but after doing something to her (let's just say a "shave"), she knows she will find out, and immediately proposes to kill Gisaburo. They drink it, strangle it and then throw it into a well. Of course, this will come back to haunt them - but that is literally, at least to them (first Seki super-terrified and then only later skeptical Toyoji), changes gear in the Kaidan, a Japanese ghost story. /> <br /> This is a film in which horror does not simply derive from "oh, ghost, ah", but from the total terror it creates for the characters. In a sense there is the mechanics of a film-noir at work everywhere, if not freely translated by a 19th-century Japanese village in contrast to an American city or a small city (ie the nosy cop, the "proof" probably found by another, going around, aroused suspicions, etc.). It's compelling because Seiko was actually against the plan from the beginning, manipulated by the lusty but ill-prepared Toyoji, and her reactions to Gisaburo's re-appearances are puzzling to her. Take the one that comes closest to poetry: the ghost of Gisaburo, the pale blue face and the mostly silent and chilling look, Seiko's movements to climb the rickshaw. He does it, reluctantly, and he pushes her into a street that he doesn't know, in the early hours of dawn, surrounded by smoke. Most Japanese ghost stories want to be able to get this heartbreaking look. <br /> <br /> As he begins to veer towards the hysteric towards the end, there is so much that the director Oshima manages to make this a distinctive job. Having achieved a huge success in the world of international cinema with In the Realm of the Senses (which, ironically, was banned in his country), he realized something that he said was even more audacious than "Senses". Perhaps he was right; Empire of Passion has less graphic sexual content by far than its predecessor (also played by Tatsuya Fuji, a magnificently physical actor with a huge range variety), but his boldness is to create a world of terror. You can believe in the ghosts of this story, but you also have to believe how far the two lovers will go. The nosy detective or gossiping citizens are the least of their worries: the fate of their souls is at stake. <br /> <br /> And Oshima takes what in other hands could only be juicy pulp (unfortunately, it wouldn't surprise me if an American remake was already in the works) and the artisans taken after a great shot, with the repetition that he made his way into the mis-en-scene (ie the shots of Seiko and Toyoji walking on that street, the camera of a Dutch corner, the world tilts and surrounds them in a grim blue tint) and some movements that influence what will stay with me long after I finish typing this (ie Toyoji who throws the leaves with one hand in the pit in slow motion, or as Seiko the naked body is revealed after it goes blind). It is bold to lie in connecting to a level of the spirit - not to be confused with the spiritual, although there may also be something with that - about the connections between life and death to one another, inextricably. It's a classic waiting to be discovered.
