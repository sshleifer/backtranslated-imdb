Yes, I know, Roscoe Arbuckle didn't like being called 'Fat', but I couldn't resist the joke. <br /> <br /> This is a nice Lloyd Hamilton short of his peak period, directed by Roscoe. The two work together with lots of good gags and Roscoe's usual attention to the details of shooting the photo in an interesting way. Most comedians preferred flat lighting and a camera to make them more interesting. Roscoe uses a couple of long tracking and some tricks to tell his story and show Ham a good actor and a talented comedian. <br /> <br /> This story plays with some interesting themes, such as Lloyd MOVE LONG's classic: here it is about the perceptions of reality and the confusion that films make of it. Or you could choose to ignore these problems and laugh out loud.
