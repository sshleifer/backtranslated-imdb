Normally I don't go out of my way to look at romantic comedy, and maybe I'll do it in the future after seeing Return to Me. The plot was simple and without secrets after the commercials. You don't have to be Einstein to guess what will happen after the first 15 minutes. What you can do is relax and let the cast take you into a world where the "chemistry" abounds and the good guys win and you can just laugh and have fun. I LOVE this movie .... and I have the DVD to order!
