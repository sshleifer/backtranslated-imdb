As you can see from the few comments posted here - mine could very well be the last one you'll see, unless there's a big DVD release or TCM playing it again! - this is a film of the "Our Gang" genre with lots of different guys. MGM was certainly the music studio - if the musicians, dancers and singers were not under contract, they were on tap. Heifetz was one of the most expensive ..... he does it for a little charity work !!! The tax he received at that time was unheard of. Another musical film with Jose Iturbi (Mexican pianist) saw about 100 children play a simple tune on 100 pianos ...... so, those skeptics who think that small children are not musical are wrong: I was one. <br /> <br /> As everyone writes, "Frankie Smith" - the good American name - (Gene Reynolds) was the good bad boy, who is kidnapped from the streets by the owners of a music school. Can you believe that Walter Brennan ("Prof. Lawson") of all those western movies was the man who ran the school? Joel McCrea ("Peter McCarthy") and Andrea Leeds ("Ann Lawson") were the protagonists of "They Shall Have Music", with a series of well-known extras (many of whom became protagonists of star rights). As others have commented, almost all the children of the orchestra (actually, The Meremblum Symphony of Los Angeles) have achieved great successes in their lives, both as musicians (for studies) and for other commercial activities. <br /> <br /> Sad to say, today there are not many young orchestras - a sad mistake. Parents with children at school are usually so busy trying to keep their heads above water, and many don't even know what's happening to children at school. The music lessons can become expensive, and almost ALL would prefer to have a football team ..... <br /> <br /> This is Jascha Heifetz's cheapest concert you've ever heard is contained in this film. .... in those days, a quarter. His way of playing is brilliant, even if it seems that he would prefer to be elsewhere ... without emotions. By contract, any Yo-Yo Ma concert is so joyous, it makes you want to run out and buy a cello ..... this guy is having fun .... like kids in the "street" concert, when they deceive Heifetz to play in their school. <br /> <br /> All the orchestral numbers are interpreted by "the children", and make it seem easy. I love this kind of film - their plots are so simple, it doesn't take you two days to figure out if you liked - or understood - the movie, at all. We need some new movies like this - I can't help but inspire the little ones to play other instruments than the guitars ....... Bravo!
