I feel fortunate to have seen a wonderful film with two wonderful actors. "Kramer vs. Kramer" was fantastic for me because I think I could identify with it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, my parents are divorced. Even though I was older than Billy in this movie, I felt his pain and confusion. Having two parents that you thought were happy and ending up hating each other is the worst. In fact, through this film, I think it made me realize that my parents are people too, and they had just as much pain as me and my sister. <br /> <br /> Going back to the movie, this was a good one. Yes, it's dated and Meryl and Dustin are very young. But I would recommend it to many people, because I think most of them can relate in some way. There are funny, sad, happy and relieving moments that are taken away in a terrifying way by these great actors. It's a good film and deserves more credit than a 7.5. <br /> <br /> 9/10
