Boogie Nights is one of the best movies released in the 90s and I'd say it should be in the top 250 of IMDb. I can understand why many people don't like it, because of the topics covered. However, I personally believe that many do, judging by the acclaim that this film has received from viewers and critics about whether it is the creation of topnerc films. <br /> <br /> The direction and the acting in this film are better and reach the level of brilliance. it is not a scene in this film that is not surprising. Individual characters reach and touch you. Since this is a film about the porn industry, we don't imagine that sex scenes can be managed with such sensitivity, but they are. The director is among the best I've ever seen, and I've seen many movies. <br /> <br /> The film does not speak of the history of a particular individual, but of many. It is a study of the characters of people who have many layers to them and who might find aliens in one area but still dream of the same dreams and have both bad and good for them. Boogie Nights throws you into their story from the beginning, and even if the film is long (I think it's almost 3 hours) you honestly don't even notice. And when it ends you don't seem to want it .... <br /> <br /> I am not easy to impress, that is, there are not many films I would rate 10 out of 10 but this is one. Beyond the multiple character study, is the use of music in the film. I have never seen, in all my years of watching movies, that the music told a story as well as in this film. There was such impeccability, you know it's not something you will see every day. <br /> <br /> Burt reynold's performance was perhaps the best I've ever seen, and Mark Wahlberg is incredible (I'm stunned, there are still people who say he doesn't do well, I don't know how anyone can see it). the person who really surprised me was Heather Grahem (Rollergirl) who is absolutely fantastic in her role, in particular the only memorable scene with Burt Reynolds in the Limousine, towards the end. <br /> <br /> Again, I will echo other IMDb reviewers to say that this movie is not for everyone. But I still think this was topnotch.10 of 10.
