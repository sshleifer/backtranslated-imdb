Man I am thrilled I can leave feedback for this 10 minute game. I love it. <br /> <br /> After not having seen it for years, it happened to me the other day and I watched it over and over again. <br /> <br /> 'Stop shaking your eyes' and 'shake a rock'n'roll band' and 'stop sawing the table' are scary classic lines. <br /> <br /> The art is deliciously raw. The dialogue is scarce and wonderful. Just find it and love it. I can't recommend it enough. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the high school art teacher Mrs. Kogan for showing us this and over again. Thanks NFB for doing it. Thank you MTS for showing it (for free at least for the moment). <br /> <br /> I want a Big Snit shirt now. I'd like an animation cell, but at 440.00 a pop, this won't happen. <br /> <br /> Find this movie, and watch it.
