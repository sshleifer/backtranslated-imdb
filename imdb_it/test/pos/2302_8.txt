This is a film by Oshima, the director of the infamous "In The Realm Of The Senses", a film so sexually burnished and blatantly controversial that it has been banned for a while. This film takes place initially in 1895 in Japan and sees the beautiful Keziko Yoshiyuki in the role of Seki, the wife of a rickshaw driver who falls in love with a much younger man who is courting her in nature. That man, Toyoji, comes to her while he sleeps and seduces her, though soon she's rather willing to be seduced. Soon they will have a relationship and a plot to kill Seki's husband, to be together forever. They do it and throw it down a well. However, they did not count on the ghost of the dead husband who persecutes Seki and others in the village! This film is visually very stunning, the use of shadows that highlight this story of passion murder. Ms. Yoshiyuki (who is still active as an actress) is particularly good in her role. It's sexual sometimes, but not like "In The Realm Of The Senses". Some of what follows depends on our imagination. I found this film with a coherent mood that makes it very watchable. A little disturbing but that goes with the territory. I would recommend it.
