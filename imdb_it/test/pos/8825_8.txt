Watching this PPV, I had high expectations, given that Smackdown is the best show in WWE, this is a great PPV as it is the last before Wrestlemania. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH-HARDY BOYS & CHRIS BENOIT VS. MVP & MNM W / MELINA IN 6 MATCH TAM TEAM MAN A good way to start the game. At first it was a bit slow, but later the pace increased and the game became more exciting and fun. Benoit passes and makes Joey Mercury touch to get a win for the Hardy Boys and for himself. 6/10 <br /> <br /> SECOND MATCH- GRAY HELM {CHAMPION} VS. SHANNON MOORE VS. FUNAKI VS. CHAVO GUERRERO VS. DAIVAIRI VS. SCOTTY 2 HOTTY VS. JAMIE NOBILE VS. JIMMY WANG YANG IN A GREAT INVITATIVE GAME CRUISERWEIGHT FOR THE WWE CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP I'm a big Cruiserweights fan, and I'm never disappointed watching them, especially in this game here. Chavo Guerrero nails the Frog Splash on Jimmy Wang Yang to win and become the new WWE Cruiserweight champion. 5/10 <br /> <br /> THIRD MATCH- FINLAY & LITTLE BASTARD VS. BOOGEYMAN & LITTLE BOOGEYMAN This was not really a wrestling match, it was more like a comedy, although it was not a clear wrestling competition, it still entertained me with funny antics. Finlay nails the little Boogeyman with the Shillaegh to win. Boogeyman does not deserve to be on a PPV, and does not deserve to be in WWE. 4/10 <br /> <br /> FOURTH MATCH - KANE VS. KING BOOKER W / SHARMELL This was a surprisingly good game, I thought it would be mediocre, but it turned out to be a real wrestling competition. An affectionate greeting to both men, playing a very funny game. Kane wins after a Chokeslam on King Booker. 6/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTH MATCH- PAUL London & BRIAN KENDRICK {CHAMPIONS} VS. DEUCE & DOMINO W / CHERRY FOR THE WWE TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS It's not really a good game, Deuce and Domino need more training to fight, and London and Kendrick are the only ones to maintain this fast pace. London and Kendrick keep their titles after Kendrick gets a roll-up on one of the boys for the win. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SIXTH MATCH- BOBBY LASHLEY {CHAMPION} VS. MR. KENNEDY FOR THE ECW CHAMPIONSHIP Mr. Kennedy attacks Lashley from behind, before the game starts. It was a good game, but not very good. Lashley and Kennedy have some chemistry, but not enough to pull a big game. Kennedy wins by DQ, after Lashley nails him with a chair, then assails him with the chair up to the entrance. Lashley still retains his title. 4/10 <br /> <br /> SEVENTH MATCH - JOHN CENA & SHAWN MICHAELS VS. BATISTA & UNDERTAKER This is probably the biggest tag team game I've ever seen. An affectionate greeting to all these men (yes, even to Batista) for having approached as a classic 5-star event. All 4 men played their parts very well in the match, as it was a very nice and fun tag team game. Batista turns his back on Undertaker who hits him, then leaves the ring, which pushes Michaels to nail Sweet Chin Music, then Cena to nail an F-U for the hard victory. 7/10 <br /> <br /> I don't know why everyone says this PPV is not good enough, or it's boring, I just don't understand. It's a great PPV that Smackdown always offers. An excellent PPV. <br /> <br /> In general, I will give it 8/10 and a B +
