This is an excellent film, but Momento (Nolan's other big-budget film) is much better. I would advise people to go and see Momento and then if they like, watch this movie. The film is shot in black and white, which initially bothered me a little, but once in the film you understand that black and white is the best way to see the film. It is extremely compelling and reasonably easy to understand even though the way it is made is extremely intelligent. I think the plot elements are a bit stupid but the film is certainly worthy of a second vision. Reconciling the film has an intelligent plot, clever twists, very good acting and keeping in mind the film's budget. I must say that it is really surprising.
