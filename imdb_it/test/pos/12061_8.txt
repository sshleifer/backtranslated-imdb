I really like this series. his fun and unique style of off the wall, sometimes controversial comedy, is a new interpretation of the genre. while it is a sitcom, it stands out for what could be uncomfortable topics. <br /> <br /> every aspect has a turning point in comedy, and the show is very good indeed. my favorite part of the program is the rather strange comments of the father, dave. his invectives interrupt the program and allow a really good flow. not perfect, because sometimes comedy is not a funny laugh, and actors sometimes seem to wait for an audience response, but otherwise this program is good. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this program, and I am very sad that it has been deleted please do another series and finish it correctly
