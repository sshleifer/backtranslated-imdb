I loved this movie which was a great portrait of a family that had a series of ups and downs, but in the end they knew that the special love they had between them. I have seen many movies with Jaclyn Smith, but my god was one of his best, even though it came out 12 years ago. This film contained a cast of famous actors, and what I liked best was that he opened my eyes to see other actors I had never seen before. This film was long lasting, but I loved every minute. It's a movie you can sit with your family and watch, even if we had to cover children's eyes a couple of times because of the discretionary love scenes. Overall I consider this film a 10 on a scale of 1-10. Life is not enough, so if anyone knows which store sells let me know because it's a must.
