Every so often you come across a film that surprises you and this is one of them. On the surprise scale this would be the sharing rate of a hot tub with Jessica Alba while a band composed of Elvis, Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, Phil Lynott and Keith Moon plays music for the night. The reason why this film will surprise you is that due to the low budget they had (Â£ 8,000) and that this was done by a group of comrades who just wanted to try it out, they produced something very polished and seems 100 times more than its budget . <br /> <br /> The plot is simple: a team of mercenaries carrying a dangerous prisoner through space is attacked and forced to crash on a nearby desolate planet. After some checks, not only does the planet not exist according to the star charts, but they are not alone as it seems and something very hostile begins to take them one by one. It looks like a very standard Sci-Fi fare that mixes elements of Aliens. Predator and Pitch Black, but it takes all this and turns them into something that looks fresh and original. <br /> <br /> Location filming in this is fantastic, making the most of Balmeddie beach in Aberdeen and genuinely feel that you are an alien world. The seemingly endless sand dunes and intelligent lighting effects give a very sad feeling, you really think the crew is stuck on an alien world. Even the action sequences are superb, the mercantile opening assault a great showcase of what special effects can be achieved with a budget and the gunfights and the breathtaking finale showcase the inventiveness of the film. <br /> <br /> As for the mercenary team, the cast excels. For an independent low-budget film, the casting here was done through local media and it seems they have chosen some possible stars for the future. The local body building builder Mike Mitchell, while not a natural actor, is part of his role as leader of the Arnie-Esq mercenaries. From the rest of the cast there are two prominent shows like Patrick Wright as second in command McNeal and Scott Ironside as the rough and ready engineer Vince. Both have some of the best lines in the film and Scott injects quite a bit of humor into the film with his performance. Patrick gives a well rounded performance like the cooler at the command of the ice. <br /> <br /> Director Mark Stirton can be very proud of what he has achieved and proves that Scottish cinema does not have to be all "Kilts and Ceilidhs" or Scottish films of "Slums and Drugs" can be fresh, imaginative and above all very funny. This film is Scottish (with a touch of the north east) at the center and praise the actors and directors for keeping the accents intact that adds to the charm of the piece. Although the budget limitations show from time to time (the only mistake I could find) is predictable. This film, its cast and crew deserve all the success they get and then again. I for one wish Mark and his crew every success and theirs is a career to keep an eye on. <br /> <br /> Vote - 9/10 The first Scottish science fiction is bold, fresh and inventive triumph. <br /> <br /> Reviews of films, news and opinions like no other, plus the weekly beep podcasts. <br /> <br /> www.fightrunner.co.uk <br /> <br />contact@fightrunner.co.uk
