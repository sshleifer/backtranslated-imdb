This film was a pretty nice watch for me, I mean it wasn't great, but it was one of the best horror films of recent times. It seems to have been low, almost the state budget, but it has its charm like the adorable ladies. Even the atmosphere was good (which is what lacks a lot of horror movies these days). Acting was the typical low-budget affair of the 1980s, which if you don't know is that it's a "dud" acting. But this is what the films of Lucio Fulci were full of, they like that this film had an atmosphere that was missing in the plot and in money, etc. More than compensated for in the horror and in the atmosphere and atmosphere for the film, it is itself. <br /> <br /> It's just a typical low-budget horror movie that is watchable, I've seen it all the way through and I love horror movies. I have seen films where I switch off only between 10 and 20 minutes or sit down and move it forward quickly if it's on video, or skipping a scene on the DVD. This film didn't make me want to do it, I sat down and watched it until the end, without wanting to skip the parts. <br /> <br /> I would have liked it anyway if the zombie-type people in this were a little more scary since they were as scary as having Freddy Kreuger as a nanny, no. But seriously if they were a little better it would have been the low budget perfection, maybe. <br /> <br /> The music of this film was first-rate stuff, ideal horror music, so it was. I saw horror movies where the music is good or average, but it could have been better, thank God even if this movie didn't have the music of Metal. <br /> <br /> I have been a hard metal fan since 1990 but in horror movies metal music ruins it, the film loses a lot of atmosphere when you play any kind of music other than a soundtrack. So I'm glad there isn't any music in this movie besides your typical rather creepy, well done soundtrack. <br /> <br /> You could use "Profane Grace - Shattered Dreams Epitaph" on it. Since it is keyboard music, no guitar is anything but "really" disturbing keyboard tracks. As a trace of a "Forever Sleep" you can hear the wind blowing all the way and a bit of goose that induces the music of the keyboard that follows it. Always tracking on that cd is the same, ideal horror music at its best, it would have been perfect for this movie. <br /> <br /> The only unattractive girl in the film for me was the one that was milled / killed (or so we are led to believe) and we hung up like a scarecrow, just to free ourselves and try to escape more late. Every other woman in the movie was really adorable, a great 9 out of 10 for everyone except the one I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> I hope that Hollywood (the mainstream side of things) can give Romero money and the guy who made this film. Giving them for the films is a much better decision than giving them to a muppet goon called Paul Anderson of the triton "resident evil". <br /> <br /> Well done guys, it's not bad, not bad at all, I loved the end credits when they kept showing you videos that depicted them (behind the scene). Not many films do this kind of thing, which I thought would add some to the film, as it also showed you like some types of releases and this is always a good thing if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Evaluation for this film 8/10, evaluation for the adorable women in the film 9/10, evaluation for the atmosphere in the film 9/10, score for the score for the film 9.5 / 10.
