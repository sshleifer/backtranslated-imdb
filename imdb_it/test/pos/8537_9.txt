My God. Obviously, when you rent or buy it, you don't expect to see a documentary about the mating behavior of small rodents in their natural habitats. You expect a visual feast of blood and blood and maybe even a fright or two. Well, for those who are sick and twisted like me, you won't find many fears, but you will come very close to urinating on yourself in laughter. the catch phrases in this movie will remain with you and your friends forever. The first time I showed this to my friends and colleagues it was more than 3 years ago, but we still laugh out loud and use catch phrases. it's as addictive and fun as Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn and Peter Alive Dead Alive / Braindead. From the absolutely ridiculous dialogue of the opening scene, to the most refined works of the Department of Splatter and Gore, to the wonderful abilities of Ed the movie cutter, you'll laugh and laugh again. As for the visual feast of blood and blood, oh yes, they have it. And they are pretty damn good ... "The neck bone is connected to the bone of the head ..." This movie might even have made the best nightmare / hallucination / totally crazy scene I've ever seen. and this does not mean to be funny, but man is well done (and disturbing). In general, to all those who are not against a lot of blood and a beautiful moment, IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN THIS FILM! it's on Netflix, I know for sure.
