This is one of my 3 favorite movies. I've been in the water since I was 13, so I had a lot of humor in addition to recognizing a lot of landscapes up close (the film, even though it took place in and around Virginia, was shot around the San Francisco Bay), in especially the mothball fleet east of the Benicia bridge, where the character of Kelsey Grammar was first introduced in the USS Stingray and the piers of San Francisco at the end of the film (including a boat I worked on). As others have said, the actors seem to enjoy making this film and making it fun. The line "We are getting closer to the bottom, sir! I can hear a couple of lobsters licking it" is, at least for me, priceless. <br /> <br /> I am one of several people who look forward to a DVD in a Down Periscope letterbox format.
