I saw this movie on a big screen a few months ago. I didn't know what to expect with precision, and for the first ten minutes I feared that I didn't like this movie. He was starting very slowly, in silence and almost in banality, which was much less exciting as the sound was rather bad and the subtitles sometimes impossible to read. <br /> <br /> But I don't regret having continued watching it. It's one of the most beautiful Bergman movies I've ever seen, at once human, ruthless and psychologically so convincing. <br /> <br /> I have rarely seen actors act so wonderfully, with such intensity on their faces: Liv Ullman's performance is unforgettable and Sydow is also excellent. <br /> <br /> There is always psychological violence in Bergman's films, and this could be the most violent of all. The tense relations between man and woman evolve in parallel with the physical violence that surrounds them ... <br /> <br /> Finally, this sober, violent and powerful film contains a surprisingly surprising human depth. An excellent Bergman. <br /> <br />
