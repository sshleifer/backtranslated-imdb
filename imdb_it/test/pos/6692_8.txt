K-PAX is exactly what a cardiac heating film should be. The story is about a mysterious mental patient Prot, played by Kevin Spacey, and his incredulous psychiatrist Dr. Powel, played by Jeff Bridges. The two have a very friendly relationship, and as their relationship grows, Dr. Powel cannot help but wonder if there is anything more in his mysterious patient, who insists that he comes from another planet called K-PAX. This movie is a lot of fun, and Kevin Spacey rolls a well-placed groove as if it were his second nature. K-PAX is an intelligent film, and I didn't expect it to go where it was. In the end, I found myself thinking about the little things in life, the wonder and magic of everyday life that we often take for granted. I left the theater with a warm feeling of confusion inside, and for families and couples on a date, K-PAX is a splendid film, which will not disappoint. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in anything more than the monotonous versions of lustrous, action-packed and bloody.
