I always knew the day was coming. We all knew it. There is only so much oil in the ground and one day we will run short. But shouldn't there be enough coal to use instead? And wind power, or something like that. Things for future generations to worry about. <br /> <br /> So this documentary struck me between the eyes. The oil makes the fertilizer that is the reason for the first time in the history of the world practically no one lives on the farms. When the inevitable oil shortage has hit, many things - air travel, many drugs, plastic, life in the suburbs - will become impossible. But the craziest intuition of the documentary is this: oil gives us so much energy with so little effort, that without it our lives must change. Even if substitutes and conservation are implemented immediately, at best they will settle our landing in a strange post-oil world that (the documentary's claims) could begin NOW. <br /> <br /> Despite its grim message, the documentary is often very funny. It contains fabulous historical footage (sober images of dark urban buildings and funny stuff from the 50s) that reminds us why we moved to periphery. It also offers the hope that a huge effort started now can ease the transition from oil and make the world a better place. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the documentary is that it does not spend time on the mystery of why we are discovering this stuff now. How can it be a big emergency suddenly? We knew that in the 1970s we had to prepare for a post-oil world - and we started preparing ourselves with alternative energy research and smaller cars. If our inability to follow President Jimmy Carter's initiatives 25 years ago condemned us to a hard landing in a post-oil world, why was no one screaming about him on soapboxes? <br /> <br /> In the end I found the documentary very persuasive; and left me the terrible thrill of being dragged out of a very beautiful dream. This is a must see for all those who are not afraid of facing a near future very likely that we still have time to do something. <br /> <br /> - Charles
