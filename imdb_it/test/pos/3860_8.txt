The first Disney animated film without the strong involvement of Disney itself, this film suffers from the fact that the story is not particularly original or interesting (this is, I believe, the only Disney movie animated since 1940 that is NOT based on a previous book or other work, but it is rather an original story). As others have noted, the plot is essentially a cross between the love story of Lady and the Tramp and the kidnapping / travel story in the 101 Dalmatian. <br /> <br /> But to overcome this flaw, the directors have successfully used many of the best features of most of the Disney animated films of the previous 10-15 years: Phil Harris (from The Jungle Book) which expresses one of the main characters, follows his duet with Louis Prima in the previous film with another here with Scatman Crothers. The quality visual aspect of this film is virtually reported by "Dalmati" (with some pleasant hints of French Impressionism, it seems), and the villain here (the butler) strongly resembles the henchmen of that film. (This is probably one of the least memorable villains of Disney.) The main story goes back and forth between the cats and the ongoing butler difficulties with two rural hunting dogs (with great vocal work by Pat Buttram and George "Goober" Lindsey "). The various animal characters are just as familiar to those who have seen" Tramp "and" Dalmatians. "The cat owner, despite having a striking visual similarity with the evil stepmother in Sleeping Beauty, can not stand any of the bad traits of that character and comes across as very warm and generous. <br /> <br /> The real strength of the film is the vocal work, after starting to use mostly familiar actors in The Jungle Book, the tactic continued strongly here with Disney veterans Harris and Sterling Holloway of The Jungle Book and Eva Gabor (who would make a character very similar in the next film The Rescuers), as well as Crothers and Nancy Kulp. All are excellent q ui, in particular Harris and Gabor in the protagonists. the action is excellent as you'd expect, showing a variety of emotions. <br /> <br /> Younger children can be disturbed by some brief episodes (an escape from the path of a running train, a near-drowning by one of the children), but these are not presented in a particularly scary way or dark and ended very quickly. Overall, there is very little of the kind of scariest scenes found in many other Disney classics. <br /> <br /> A minor oddity is the way in which some visual aspects of the culture of the 60s are depicted among the cats playing jazz in 1910 Paris; one cannot help but wonder why the story was not firmly fixed in the present, apart from the great agreement that Paris had changed much of its appearance in the meantime. It really made more sense that way. <br /> <br /> The songs, although pleasant and sometimes very funny, are not particularly memorable. Nevertheless, the general energy applied here, excellent vocal work and excellent animation all contribute to overcoming relatively small weaknesses. Far from the grandeur of the classics "10" like Pinocchio or Aladino, and not quite up to the "9" that could be given to Sleeping Beauty or 101 Dalmatians, this is probably a rather 10 marginal 8; maybe a 7.
