Originally filmed in 1999 as a television pilot, "Mulholland Dr." has been refused. The following year, David Lynch received money to film new scenes to make the film fit to be shown in theaters. He did it and created one of the biggest, most bizarre and nightmare movies ever made. <br /> <br /> The film really has no main characters, but if there were main characters, they would be Betty (Naomi Watts) and Rita (Laura Elena Harring). Betty is a lively blonde who lives in her aunt's apartment while auditioning for parts in movies. Find Rita in her aunt's apartment and decide to help her. See, Rita has lost her memory. He has no idea who she is. He takes his name, Rita, from a "Gilda" poster in the bathroom. So the two decided to find out who Rita really is. <br /> <br /> David Lynch is known for making some strange films, but this film is the definition of strange. It's bizarre, nightmarish and absolutely indescribable. It's like a dream caught in the film. By the 100-minute point, the movie has become extremely confusing, but if you've looked closely, it will make perfect sense. After seeing the film and reading an article on the Internet that indicated things in the film, I now completely understand the film. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good. Watts is fantastic. Justin Theroux is very good as a Hollywood director who has problems with the local crowd. The music is excellent. Angelo Badalamenti offers one of his best scores. And the director - hah! David Lynch is a masterful filmmaker as always. <br /> <br /> Is this your kind of movie? Well, that depends. You should probably see more about Lynch's work before watching this movie. You will need to be patient with the film, and probably watch it a second time to collect the many clues Lynch left in the film. For Lynch fans, this is a dream come true. <br /> <br /> "Mulholland Dr." it's a masterpiece. He is brilliant, enigmatic and masterfully filmed. I love it.
