I found this show by accident and was surprised to find that none of those I know have ever heard of it. This was by far one of the best shows I've seen in months if not years and I'm looking forward to more episodes. Sleeper Cell portrays a psychological struggle of an undercover agent within a terrorist cell that must constantly make difficult decisions to maintain its coverage while remaining true to its true cause. This is an extremely well done show. It keeps you intrigued by the first episode until the end and, although progressing slowly, it's fast enough to make you feel at the limit. Fairly realistic and human, it touches on important topics and each episode presents an interesting question to think about. This show is not 24 or none of the cop shows on TV and is not trying to be anything either. It is genuine and unique. It is a show about a human being, his difficult choices and his life of struggle in which a simple mistake can cost him everything. <br /> <br /> I gave this show a 10 for plot, good progression, excellent cinematography, excellent music and realistic characters each with a story to tell.
