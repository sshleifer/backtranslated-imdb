The photography and editing of the film are exceptional for the period of time. Eisenstein builds on every scene of the film that leads to the sailor's revolt and the massacre in the city. Although the film is a culminating point in cinema, it is also an example of SZocialist Realism. in 1925 the Soviet government actively used the arts, including cinema, as a means of spreading the message of the revolution. Eisensteins portrait of the revolt on the Potempkin warship offers the viewer information on the message of the Soviet elite. Marxist theory and the perspectives of the class struggle are shown as the sailors who represent the oppressed workers and the officers who represent the elite of society. Much of the film demonstrates the communist party's message and the way the film was used as a propaganda tool.
