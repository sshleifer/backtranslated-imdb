This short short absolutely fascinates me. <br /> <br /> The only thing I have seen so far is the work of Sam Brakhage, the creator of Dog Star Man. However, where Brakhage is trying to get nervous "letting us learn to see again" and offering an affront of headache that induces brilliant colors and flashes (which I continue to dig and totally embrace as high art ...), this film that I would call very relaxing and mesmerizing. Man Ray's general use of rotating objects / cameras does not create a vertiginous sensation, but a warm flow of senses, which mix and go hand in hand with the gravity of the world that moves around us. <br /> <br /> An interesting presumption of this very short work is that as it goes on, the objects become more and more recognizable until we end up on a naked torso (of which I feel the less rounded female breast I have ever seen ). The circles and spirals of shadow and light on the torso make it an object of surreal beauty, something to hang on the wall and dig forever. It is because of this and other images in this film that I had to watch it again and again (possibly a total of seven times) just because it fascinates me completely. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
