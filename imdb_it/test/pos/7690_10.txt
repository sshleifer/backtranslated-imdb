I saw it on television several years ago than I can remember, but I never forgot the performance of Sammy Davis, Jr. I thought about looking for it on video. This interpretation of Porgy and Bess is a treasure. I'd like to see him again and introduce my son too. I can't imagine why it wasn't announced as one of the greatest interpretations that Sammy Davis, Jr. ever gave. Anyone responsible for not bringing this to the public should be ashamed of his ignorance. I will continue to look for it though. Perhaps the leaders responsible for such things will come to realize the forgotten work of so many African-American actors.
