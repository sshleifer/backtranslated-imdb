Looking back at the works of Jim Henson years after his death is like looking back at another age. Unlike most of the so-called creative types who try to sell, or worse still cynically exploit children today, Jim never really seems to forget what it would be like to be a child. And if ever it was a time when he demonstrated this, Labyrinth aside, it's the 1979 Muppet movie. Shot as an allegorical story about how Henson came to work in children's television as a puppeteer and ended up with a half show time of his first television, the film Muppet ends with the affirmation of everything that is more progressive, the kind of understanding would tell children who have not respected the norm foreseen in the 80s. And while we enjoy the fruits of an era in which we are gagged and forced to talk about anything for fear that someone might be offended, the open celebration of the difference or diversity that has formed much of The Muppet Show is offered here. I've said it in other comments, but I have to say it here. A great light in the world came out the day Jim Henson died. <br /> <br /> The film Muppet starts with its cast sitting to see the first of what they were going to see in the next eighty minutes. In short, precise traits, we are introduced both by the main actors and by some minors. And when the real story begins, boy, we are given a great song to bring us to the moment. The Rainbow Connection painted both a beautiful and sad image of what the Muppets, especially Kermit, were. These were not just a group of felt puppets with singular personalities who came together to stage a show. They lived things based on a part of us all, they wrote only in a much more courageous way than we are used to. As each Muppet was presented to us in turn, we saw another reflection of part of ourselves and, of course, the children of the audience would respond differently to each character. So everyone had a favorite. When Animal appeared behind a drum kit and tried to eat a dish, I knew I had found one of mine. Nowadays, I'm more of a fan of the Swedish Chef, but what happened. <br /> <br /> To complete the characters there was a series of musical numbers that further developed their motivations and personalities. Can you imagine it? shared an overview of Dr. Teeth and his band, as well as the creative soul of Henson. But the most relevant song for me was Gonzo's number, asking him what it was and where it came from. Many of us would spend a lifetime looking at the stars and, like Gonzo, saying that we knew we would return one day. Not that all the songs were so terribly serious, of course. Fozzy and Kermit share a number after they decide to combine their talent (or lack of it) and travel. If it were necessary to show that today's "musicians" have lost the ability to use the pop structure to create something audible, this number would be. Never before, and never again, the dynamic group of a cast and the music complement each other perfectly. With the puppeteers and voice actors so perfectly on top of their game, the human cast has had a lot to live. <br /> <br /> Which makes it even more surprising that the human element has lived up to the end of the business. The cameos literally punctuated the film, with all those of Steve Martin and Telly Savalas making their entrance. Even Richard Pryor, the last man you'd expect to see in a Muppets movie, seems to be organizing a hilarious moment. Mel Brooks cameo bothers me as much as he did when I was a kid, but I suspect it's because Henson knew why I would find it disturbing now. The great acting force, however, comes from Charles Durning, who like Doc Hopper embodies everything that Henson and his audience have decided to resist. At each intersection, Hopper arrives to offer Kermit the chance to sell off and betray his species. Or perhaps the offer stops being the right word when Hopper's attempts to ensure Kermit's compliance become progressively stronger and more violent. The whole is a great metaphor for how each artist has his heart broken by the world. <br /> <br /> Naturally, Animal also presents itself to remind us that just because our friends are not sweet and cuddly, it doesn't make them less than a friend. Actually, Animal turns out to be the best friend Kermit has at the time. And this was the main message of every good show or film in which Henson has been involved since then. That rejection or dismissal of others simply because of linguistic or aesthetic differences could literally be the worst mistake ever made. There can be little doubt that in today's world where an idiot in a purple suit can tell my children that they are not good if they do not feel good for fifteen seasons and are not yet subjected to serious investigation by Children's well-being, Henson's lab may never have taken off. To misquote the title of the album, daring to be stupid is one thing, but imposing the choice on others is something else. The Muppet movie shows how Henson dared to ask us all to think, both inside and outside the proverbial box. There will never be another like him, but he would never want us to stop trying. <br /> <br /> So, the film Muppet is the epitome of a ten out of ten movie. If we were to send a film to the cosmos to show intelligent life that we are worth more than being canceled, that would be it.
