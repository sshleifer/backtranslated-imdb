The man with the Screaming Brain is certainly not a perfect movie, but I'm pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a stellar vehicle for Bruce Campbell, which means that it works like a sort of summary of his entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action and happy ending. Campbell is, as a writer, uneven - there are many things in history that don't make much sense (why does the robot suddenly have breast just because a female brain was implanted in it?), And some scenes look like reconstructions of other better incarnations (the scene in the restaurant, where Yegor and William fight to control William's body, came directly from Evil Dead II). There are, however, many small touches and non-sequiturs that seem quite bright, like when William is in the midst of his panic and shouts at a statue, "What are you looking at ?!" The film looks like a Sci-Fi Channel original, probably because it was. The acting is actually pretty good. I particularly liked Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; she was ruthless and cunning, yes, but she seemed to have a tragic air about her at certain moments that history had never explored. Ted Raimi has admirably managed the standard "house painter" role, and Bruce is as fun as the arrogant, sardonic, condescending American jerk. (Now that he is writing his films, you would think he would play a role he had not already entered the scene.) The man with Screaming Brain is a bizarre and nonsensical b-movie that should be fun for anyone who can avoid to make a cinematic experience too seriously.
