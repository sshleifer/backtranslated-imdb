I rented this movie without having heard (or read) anything about it. What a pity! This film is intelligent, witty, hilarious, fast and realistically ridiculous. The characters manage to develop without relying too much on clich√©s, tired stereotypes. It was nice to watch. I couldn't help but think that marketing would help lobare this not-so-mainstream film in the mainstream of hunger-for-smart-comedy. The quality of the dialogue and the ease with which actors perform a wide range of embarrassment, heartbreak and comedy are so rare these days - I have heard that actors must have really enjoyed participating in something so rich. How was it that the national treasure was the number one at the box office for three weeks in a row - it's so weak in too many ways to talk. I guess I'm happy that movies like "Seeing .." are still made somewhere out there.
