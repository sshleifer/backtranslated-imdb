People seem to expect Citizen Kane here! The Planet is a B-monster movie and as such is fun and different enough to be appreciated. The director clearly has something to offer - not so sure about some of the cast. What about the effects? Â£ 8000 is not a lot of budget for the effects. I, for example, would happily recommend this release to a science fiction boss or anyone who doesn't take monster movies too seriously. If it is so? Look instead at 3 blue colors. I noticed a review that said it had ripped Alien. Like Alien, it hasn't erased things. The best thing about the movie? Director. The worst thing about the movie? The cast. Maybe it's time for the director to move from Glasgow to London and find some talent. Meanwhile, well done. At least you're trying to do something.
