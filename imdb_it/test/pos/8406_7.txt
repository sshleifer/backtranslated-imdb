Having grown up with GWTW, I avoided the sequel book "Scarlett" and the miniseries so far. When I first saw the video for the first time, I was amazed at how much I enjoyed watching Timothy Dalton's description of Rhett Butler and Joanne Walley-Kilmer as Scarlet. I feel that "Scarlet" should be judged for its merits rather than attempting any confrontation with the venerable Selznick GWTW masterpiece. While the plot of the "Scarlet" series and some dialogues have suffered from the lack of an inspired writing, overall I thought it was an interesting dramatization of what could have been between Scarlett and Rhett.
