I was lying on the bed, flicking through the channels ... and boy do I have the channels ... 500 of them. With over 70 movie channels, I probably watch a movie on cable, once or twice a month ... The DVD blew me away. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm flipping through and coming to this movie and because I see Natilie Portman, I'm interested. 110 minutes later I'm still interested. How can it be? When I first saw the previews of this movie in the theater, I remember mocking it. I never thought I'd look at it ... no matter how. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a book and you can say it. The film is very episodic, and it's not like the film has a fantastic plot, it just makes you sick. Maybe it's his performances doing it. I'm pretty sure it must have been. <br /> <br /> This movie was good without reason ... <br /> <br /> Peter's Movie Rating (out of 10): 7
