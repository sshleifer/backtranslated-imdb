Yes, this is one of the best-made television films and I wouldn't expect less from Joe Sargent. One thing for this review is that I was also a big fan of The Carpenters, I could sing all their material in the choir of elementary and middle schools and I got to do most of the solo material that Karen sang lead. I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70s - and being a child / teenager singing these songs and learning music - the only thing I couldn't wait to meet this woman. I never succeeded, she died three weeks before this happened. And yes, this struck me because I knew nothing about anorexia - and I couldn't completely understand what had happened. <br /> <br /> When this TV movie was produced, I had some understanding. Perhaps not everything in the life of Karen and Richard is open to television audiences, but in opening the parts that were shown, I understood a lot from the music industry of that time. What upsets me is that I'm writing "of that time" and seeing "now". No one has learned a damn thing, even though this was a very informative and heard glimpse of a family's problems in the music industry. <br /> <br /> These films are not made for fun, they ended up opening a door and showing us something. Here is a wonderful woman who got involved in the idea that her talent was based on weight. He was fine. I didn't know. He received mixed messages about his weight from the brother he loved, the parents he loved and the music industry that cared more about his appearance / weight than his inner talent. With the start of MTV, it got worse. With 'American Idol' it is like a puss that celebrates with an English accent. <br /> <br /> A wonderful TV movie, I'm sure someone could give you HBO treatment later, but in both cases, lots of lessons to learn and the absence of another wonderful talent.
