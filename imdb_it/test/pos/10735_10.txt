No, this has nothing to do with the sitcom "Seinfeld" or its eccentric and funny character Cosmo Kramer. In fact, "Kramer vs. Kramer" is a dramatic film, without doubt one of the best of its kind and one of the greatest films of all time. I'm glad he won more "Apocalypse Now" Oscars because he really deserved this glory. <br /> <br /> "Kramer vs. Kramer" is an excellent film, so well made and so perfectly balanced that I wouldn't want to change anything in any way. There's nothing wrong with the film. It is very high quality film making. And it also stands the test of time. Not only does it not seem dated, but its cultural impact is also lasting and its realistic history remains as significant as it was when it came out in 1979. A timeless classic. Today they don't make films like this. <br /> <br /> This film is dramatic, realistic, simple but brilliant, intense, powerful, sweet and even tragic and sometimes depressing. However, it also has a good mood. It has no special effects, but who cares? This is not the film or the place to discuss this. For a film like this, such a thing would be useless and absolutely useless. <br /> <br /> The plot is very interesting. The chemistry of the actors is simply perfect. All the actors are fantastic, but the top 3 are the best. Dustin Hoffman, a brilliant actor, has his greatest performance here as the lovable but distant workaholic Ted Kramer. Meryl Streep is as big as Ted's wife, Joanna. And the cute little Justin Henry is as formidable as the loving but sometimes stubborn Billy, son of Ted and Joanna. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is all instrumental and wonderful. The opening song (by guitarist Frederic Hand) is brilliant. The rest of the soundtrack is mostly classical music by Antonio Vivaldi and is simply dazzling. <br /> <br /> This film also has an incredible development of the characters. See the character Ted Kramer: a workaholic who becomes an extraordinary father after being left with no other choice but to care for his son, trying to adapt these new responsibilities to his work after being left by his wife Joanna. With this, Ted discovers the most beautiful things in life, but he also understands what life is like, with the problems of his work and the return of Joanna, who wants custody of his son. But Joanna also changes for the better and the ending is an unexpected surprise when you see it for the first time. <br /> <br /> This film also has some things, like classroom scenes in which Ted and Joanna face the brutal character of murders unleashed by lawyers. Another thing to see is when poor Billy falls from a jungle gym with his toy (an airplane) and seriously injures his face. But then again, the scene is very well done and what comes next is very intense: his father runs fast and crosses numerous blocks, ignoring the traffic to take his son to the hospital. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a film that is a good life lesson. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be in the Top 250.
