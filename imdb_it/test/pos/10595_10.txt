totally a brilliant CKY crew film ...... (not the jackass guys ..... johnny knoxville, chris pontius, steve-o etc are not in this movie <br /> <br />) . OK, maybe they're not the best actors, but that's not what you call a serious movie ... but hey there's no fun and it's absolutely fun to watch. who does not want to see don vito dressed as a Roman emperor! <br /> <br /> an absolute must if you like the bam or CKY ............ an incredible soundtrack by the almighty HIM, CKY and others ...... give it a look at the extra features of the DVD, in particular the Bran freestyle <br /> <br /> Chinese rap number two ...... really hilarious ..... ...... check this movie .. ...... you won't regret it ......... 10/10
