Have you ever wondered where that episode, "Tuttle", arrived in the middle of the first season of M * A * S * H? Well, now the cat is out of the bag: they took it from this Soviet film, a satire on how stupid the tsar is, due to the slipping of a pen (making the phrase "the Lieutenants, but ..." in " Lieutenant Kizhe "" that has no meaning and no one is honest or courageous enough to contradict him and just tell him the truth - Kizhe does not exist and has never done it. later, David Ketchum and Bruce Shelly borrowed this strange plot and gave us essentially the same story, just on the other side of what had become the Cold War, showing that people in high positions can be equally stupid, not no matter what their loyalty may be!
