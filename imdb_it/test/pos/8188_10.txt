This film is beautiful in many ways: the plot, the depth of the characters, the splendid photography and acting, the blockbuster-like scenes of the battles (no computer graphics here, only thousands of people). Someone said that the story has something to do with Sheakespeare's tragedies. I also find some links with the tradition of Greek tragedy. <br /> <br /> The emperor, extraordinarily recited, struggles between power and love, but is forced (for the greater good, by the will of his ancestors) to choose power (and solitude, hatred of his subjects and relatives) as his destiny. He, like Creon in Antigone, was a good boy before he became emperor. Once he has gained power, he must be ruthless and cruel (with innocent children, his mother, his father, etc.) to defend and expand the empire. Swallowed by power, he becomes a monster. Overall, Emperor Qin is a majestic Greek tragedy figure. <br /> <br /> The killer evolves in a different direction: from pure evil to heroism and morality. Also this character is forced towards his destiny by love and his new ethics. This character is also truly unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Lady Zhao, a wonderful Gong Li, is the morality incorrupt, neither by power, by love or by hate. It is morally opposed to power, somehow like Antigone. His conspiracies (for and against the emperor) always have a moral logic. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, a wonderful film. If you love cinema and want to try Chinese films you can start here.
