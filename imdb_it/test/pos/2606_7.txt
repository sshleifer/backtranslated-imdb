The film begins with the promise because there is more interaction between Spanky and Buckwheat, but as the film progresses, the two guys have fewer scenes together. This slows down the pace considerably. Billie "Buckwheat" Thomas gives a very strong performance in his early scenes. When he is left on the boat, his fear and abandonment are palpable and his tears are truly heartbreaking. When he passes from man to man asking for help and is repeatedly refused, the viewer really begins to wonder whether it is a comedy or not. Watching a child's birthday party through a fence is another exciting time. As another reviewer mentioned, I was also worried about the big dog choking on chicken bones! Once Spanky and buckwheat are in Marshall Valiant's house, Spanky tends to interact mainly with adults and children's chemistry is essentially lost. <br /> <br /> The setting of the Old South / Huck Finn doesn't do much for the plot except to allow children to stay away from home a lot. Ralph Morgan is the most attractive adult, but the other roles really don't have much substance for them. Louise Beavers runs some fun moments with a Yankee soldier near the end. <br /> <br /> The bad guys are not bad enough and the lovers are not intense enough. Still, I think it's worth seeing if you're a fan of Our Gang, if only for the strange curiosity of the whole piece. I give him seven stars because, although not a great film, he kept me busy all the time and curious to know what would happen next.
