I wasn't sure what to expect from THE BOX. I'm a big fan of Darko, but I also saw the mess that became of Southland Tales, whether or not it was a notice in the studio, who knows. With the box I was pleasantly surprised. It was a return to the classic science fiction paranoia films that suggest much more ambiguous events, but at the center of an intimate character base. <br /> <br /> The slow construction and the disturbing tension were very effective for the tone and the theme of the whole film. Any change in this rhythm would have led to the typical Hollywood or 'MTV' style, which would never have served the purpose of this story properly. Everything, from the strange effects / acting scattered everywhere, to the low-level score, to the minimal explanation of what was happening, added a whole focused thread of underlying terror, and the sense of shrinking hope for our greedy, though meaningful, characters main. It was something well thought out and set in motion by Richard Kelly, from the first act to the end. Richard Matheson's short story, which was based on, NOT the Twilight Zone ep, which was another version of the story, was one of morality and greed that was still the core elements of THE BOX. Being only about 8 pg in length, expansion into a function with substance would not have been an easy task, but was done with style, originality and leaves the viewer with persistent thoughts about the film. Many have compared him to DARKO because he is so deep or not, but I found it to be a completely different film, thematically and emotionally. The tone is completely different, as are the messages and intents of this film. Where Darko left us questions internally, THE BOX leaves the viewer with other external questions, involving the world around us. For example, knowing the human nature, would the BOX test ever come to an end? The decent acting, the great gruesome visual effects and the looming atmosphere are added to the slow and chilling run. It is not for everyone, but for those who come from where it comes, it is a pleasure.
