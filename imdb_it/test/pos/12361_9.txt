The last person to die before New Year is cursed to drive Phantom Carriage for a whole year, gathering the souls of the dead. <br /> <br /> I saw a scene from this old silent Swedish horror movie on Youtube and decided to track down the entire movie. It was worth the job to find it, because it is an absolutely incredible film for the moment it was made. It has a wonderfully disturbing atmosphere. The creators of old-time horror movies really knew how to create the perfect atmosphere. Unfortunately, many of today's filmmakers don't seem to understand how important the setting and atmosphere are, and go chop cheaply. The visual effects are excellent, considering the production date. If you can find a copy, I strongly recommend that you give it a watch. 9/10
