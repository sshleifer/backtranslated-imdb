This is a nice underrated movie and Rip Torn, as far as I know, is a seriously underestimated actor. I read Howard Frank Mosher's novel many years ago. How well Craven captures the book and the beauty of the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont! I was lucky enough to grow in VT in the 40s and 50s and was still living there when "the Irasburg incident" occurred. I didn't see _Stranger in the Kingdom_, the incident-based Craven / Mosher collaboration (and another Mosher novel), but this film inspired me to track it down.
