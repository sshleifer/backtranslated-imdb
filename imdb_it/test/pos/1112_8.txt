We see a man move from the city to the "out-of-bounds" and change radically - his family asks questions, but he goes crazy. <br /> <br /> Strange, brilliant film for showing here in Israel. Wonderful places, great actors, a film that masquerades as a "thriller" but that is more a case study on madness in the lead man. <br /> <br /> The film was far above the other films shown as part of the AICE festival here in Israel. Good luck to the team that came to this movie. It is a Grand Guignol, a small masterpiece of noir. <br /> <br /> My only criticism that prevents a "10" is that sound and music are overwhelming at times. It tends to hinder images, which speak for themselves.
