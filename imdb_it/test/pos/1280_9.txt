It is an interesting exercise to witness the first works of great artists. Sometimes, even without the 20/20 vision that offers hindsight, you can see the gears and wheels that make these people what they are. One of these looks on the past of Christopher Nolan, one of the great narrators of the past, follows. <br /> <br /> The cinematographic style of Christopher Nolan places great emphasis on delivering the story. Even though people might complain that it relies too much on moving the time back and forth, I still find it fascinating to see how they use that technique differently each time. Memento was probably the most complicated piece of storytelling I've ever seen. Discount the hardened cynics who say that it is an old piece of meat wrapped in an elegant dress. Memento shows how even the simplest of stories can be transformed into a mind bender. The Prestige, which was greatly reduced by comparison, still showed creativity in the way its three stories were intertwined. Even in a worn-out feat like the Batman series, Christopher Nolan sprinkled some of his exceptional yarn weaving tricks, giving new life to the dark knight. <br /> <br /> It follows an intense story of intrigue and mystery, in which we see an amateur writer, who becomes a reluctant voyeur, who becomes an unwitting accomplice of a variety of small crimes, and finally sees an end that no one could have expected. Having never heard of Later, I had no idea what I expected. At every point the film made me understand how he was leading me. Since the mysterious corner was clear, I was constantly trying to figure out what would happen next. And this is where I think the film has been so successful. The film has many elements that have led me to many wild geese pursuits. <br /> <br /> The film is entirely in black and white and told in several timelines, both of which are considered deceptive these days. Follow this in the least formulated or invented way possible. There doesn't seem to be a reason why the story is told the way it is, but you don't feel like you're taken for a ride. The lack of self-conscious pretense or arrogance is what makes this style of storytelling. Highly recommended!
