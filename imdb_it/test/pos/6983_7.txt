In the future, a heterogeneous group of people sleeping on board a commercial spaceship are forced to improvise their own survival when the spaceship crashes on a remote and arid planet. They already have a problem as one of the passengers is the intense criminal Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel, in his first leading role); however, they are soon exploited by a strange species of predators that thrives in the dark - and soon a rare solar eclipse will occur. <br /> <br /> While the screenplay for this film is ultimately on the routine side, it is decently performed and is particularly well done technically. The work on location, photography and design (production and design of the creatures) are all very impressive. It is not the most original or challenging science fiction / horror film ever made, far from it, but still offers good entertainment. Diesel is particularly good at getting under the skin of his intimidating character. However, it is not COMPLETELY predictable and gets some points for <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> which has a politically more correct ending than most of its type. <br /> <br /> Shot on location in the desolate area of ​​Coober Pedy in Queensland, Australia. <br /> <br /> A sequel of this kind is in the works. <br /> <br /> 7/10
