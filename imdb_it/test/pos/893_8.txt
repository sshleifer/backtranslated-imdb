The incomparable Laura Gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene from the French "Emmanuelle 2." This extraordinary woman did not go unnoticed and was soon chosen as the protagonist in this new, entirely Italian series, in which she is at the center; a beautiful photojournalist who travels the world experiencing all the mysterious eroticism that the world has to offer. In this first episode, Mae Jordan / Emanuelle is sent to Africa to photograph people and the wonderful landscape and wild exotic animals. Very similar to the character of Sylvia Kristels, Emanuelle did not have the best when it comes to being open and at ease with her sexuality. This first film basically talks about how it becomes the "Emanuelle" with which many fans of exploitative cinema are familiar. Filled with stunning cinematography, beautiful people and a heady 1970s score by the legendary Nico Fidenco, this one will surely please. Those who love the style most inspired by the history of the French original "Emmanuelle" should surely appreciate this too. The main story here is an interesting cat and mouse story of a cheesy playboy who realizes he's in love with a woman who is the female version of him! Sexy, fun and totally fun in everything; a soap opera to be sure, but one with enough skin and a general eye candy to entertain male spectators. For some reason this is the most difficult of the series to find on DVD. there has never been a legitimate DVD for this, which is very strange. The bootlegs that sometimes appear online will have to do as long as someone doesn't give this diamond of a movie a correct version.
