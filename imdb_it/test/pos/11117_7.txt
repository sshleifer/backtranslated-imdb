This film and the subsequent follow-up of the TV series have become the iconic stand-in for what is exceptional for America. <br /> <br /> Fame is famous for its music and performances. There are several characters including Irene Cara, Paul McCrae, Anne Meara * and the superb Gene Anthony Ray. The latter who plays a dancer without academic credentials or other than "street" is an extraordinary personality and is worth looking at for what is essentially a portrait of himself. A marvel to see, as a king said. <br /> <br /> The plot follows an interesting format - chronological at times, genre in other moments, personality in some cases ... but, everything really ends up in a sort of mush. <br /> <br /> Where Parker manages to push this film into a periodic overdrive - with the score of extremely touching and sometimes beautiful and definitive campy music that fits musicians step by step. <br /> <br /> The climax of the film is a climax for all time. And this complete cast of many musicians and dancers and very talented music is fortunately repeated during the closing credits. These are a set of credits that are worth looking through ... a result for centuries. Christopher Gore's music is a gift to see.
