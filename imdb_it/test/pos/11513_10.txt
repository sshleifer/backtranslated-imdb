It's the best movie I've seen in the last 5 years. Surely, he will be in the same row with masterpieces like The Platoon, Apocalypse Now, The Doors, The Dog's Heart (Russian film). In reality, the game of the boy and his parents is so good that you can't even say that they "sound". No, they LIVE like it's happening to them. Notice the smile on their faces when the main hero agrees to go for a walk with them. Hate and love in one piece. And the final scene! <br /> <br /> Really, I'm still under the impression of that movie. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to combine humor and tragedy, but if you can (and Frederikson did it) the impact would have been twice as strong. <br /> <br /> I compared it with "ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST". I also like this film (and the novel is beautiful too), but after Frederikson's film it seems simple. (the same difference I noticed after seeing the film "American history X" and "ROMPER STOMPER" - the latter is deeper). I mean that Milos Forman has only shown the material point of view of the problem. You look at it, then you say Yes, it's a good film, I like it, I don't like it, and that's it. But "Angels" leaves you with a broad basis for thinking. There are no bad and good guys in the movie. Because each of them has the right to behave the way he does it. Like the girl of one of the patients. Of course she is young and pregnant and this is a problem for her that her husband is in the clinic, but the feelings and emotional experience of his ex are even stronger (the result is his suicide). Why ask him what he did? Aren't you crazy to ask? Why don't they support him, help him, understand him? Finally, it's also fun when these people talk to each other. They say brilliant things! There are many things I would like to say about this film, but I'm not that good in English. But I'm sure, those of you who have seen the movie understand me. <br /> <br /> Good luck! <br /> <br />
