I really like the Surface show. The show is a lot of fun and it's a clean show. A show like surface is interesting. Keep my attention. He has compassion and suspense. I love all the cast members that are on the show. They are all very good choices. I think it's very important to have the right cast of Any Show because that's what makes a show a success and, of course, the scenes and the show itself. Television has changed so much over the years. It has changed in good and bad ways. I love watching some comedy, action, suspense and romance. And scifi. But Surface is a show that I hope can come back for many seasons because it's a great show and something that families can see. My kids grew up, but my husband and I like watching these types of shows. I appreciate your time and let me comment on my opinion. <br /> <br /> Thanks. <br /> <br /> Paulette Blackwell
