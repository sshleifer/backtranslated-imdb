Read a biography of the late George C. Scott and find out why he was so enormously talented. He was asked by an interviewer what his secret was when he made every character he interpreted as his. Scott answered, he had a burning fire within him that guided him. In one of his last interviewers, he sadly revealed that he had lost the unit. This was not the case when he starred in the movie "The Hospital". In this offer, he interprets the talent of Dr. Bock, medical director of one of the best hospitals in the country. However, life has caused him some paralyzing problems, such as the loss of his wife in divorce, the alienation from both his promising children and, worse still, the conviction of being physically impotent. At this point, he is becoming complacent, gloomy and often fantastic about various ways of committing suicide. To add to his growing list of personal obstacles, his main reason for being, his hospital was besieged by students and demonstrators from the neighborhood, incompetent doctors like Dr. Welbeck (Richard Dysart) and a mysterious doctor. who kills patients and doctors alike, because he believes he is "the wrath of the Lamb". (Barnard Hughes). Few choices are left to Bock. One is the promising Dr. Brubaker (Robert Walden) to whom he confides, saying, "If there were an oven in these parts, I'd put my head in it." The second is a juicy young woman named Barbara who is attracted to Bock because she acts like a wounded bear. Paddy Chayefsky wrote the script and Arthur Hiller did a great job in directing this dramatically interesting dark story, but still a vehicle, lit by the fire of George C. Scott. ****
