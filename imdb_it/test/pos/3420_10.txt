what was the quote from the archbishop tutu at the end of the film about a person's past? this film was very disturbing to look at in the sense that it was a true story and to think that humanity is still so cruel after all these years makes me feel ashamed <br /> <br /> everyone is human and everyone has the right to live their lives in peace and harmony <br /> <br /> live and let live <br /> <br /> if someone knows the quote please let me know Thanks <br /> <br /> this movie should be shown much more publicly as true as horrible events like those shown in the film should be known to everyone in the hope that things will change sooner rather than later.
