We still love the movie and the "Valley Girl" soundtrack. I owned it on video for eons and ran out of the original soundtrack. I have several friends with whom I get together and we have "80's Raves" - parties where we get together and play 80s music and play "Valley Girl" on the big screen - and we're all in our thirties. We have an incredible time. <br /> <br /> It's all very funny, like, you know?
