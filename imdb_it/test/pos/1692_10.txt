Krajobraz bit bitwie like many Wajda films is, perhaps, not understandable for the "rest of the world". History based on the few stories of Tadeusz Borowski, who during the Second World War was a prisoner of the fields of Oswiecim, Dachau and Dautmergen. Borowski in his books describes the inhuman life in the Nazi camps from the vorarbeiter Tadek point of view - he carries author's words that were also found in the privileged position among the prisoners. Borowski was ruthless for humanity and no mercy for himself. Describes human history as the endless chain of exploitation and humiliation. Ironically, after returning to Poland, he stopped writing artistic prose and became a communist propagandist, producing a flow of anti-imperialist and anti-American press publications. After a few years he committed suicide. In the film Wajda changes the point of view. Vorarbeiter Tadek - character created by Tadeusz Janczar - plays only a supporting role. The story centers on the poet, destroyed, burned by war and imprisonment and by his one-day love affair with Nina, a Jewish girl who fled communist Poland even though she actually hates the Jewish life and mentality. As a background we can observe the grotesque sadness of the so-called "dipis" (displaced) life, which after the liberation is established by the Americans in the barracks of the SS. Brands, patriotic kitsch mixed to hunt for the extra dose of food and / or prostitution of German girls. <br /> <br />
