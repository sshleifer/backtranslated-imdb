This is one of the most exceptional horror movies I've ever seen in my life. Forget the exorcist and all the other horror horror films. John Carpenter has created a horror epic tour-de-force with extraordinary special effects by Kurt Russell and a great soundtrack that will haunt you forever! The best thing about this movie after 17 years is that it is not dated it looks fresh and new and you don't get many movies like this. In 1982 this was against E.T. and of course it failed and it was a box office bomb. Over the years THE THING has become a cult followed by t.v's videos and sales and by many new fans. In the end this movie kicks my ass and for me it's a loss never seen before to scare you pants and for me a horror movie. Long live John Carpenter !!
