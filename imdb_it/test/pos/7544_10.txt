Alistair Simms is a marvel in this. She is a good director. The role given here for George Cole was made for him. So the casting work on this film was perfect. I think it was one of those rare occasions when everything clicked. the plot was good, the comic dialogues were a scream and the prefect's older girls were happy !! Every character you're dear to, even the bad guys. Because we can no longer make films like this. Basically, this is a very English comedy with good movement and fluidity.
