Radio was a great movie and I honestly never cry in movies. But he made me very close to tears. It really struck me when Radio's mother died and he didn't want to leave his room. I felt really sad about how, if you were mentally retarded, you wouldn't really be able to understand death. I really liked the movie, and it's a must see.
