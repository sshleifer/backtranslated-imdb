My ex-wife and I saw and were intrigued by the trailer for this movie. We waited for it to come out, but when it was done it didn't stay in the cinemas very long. Several years later I bought it on VHS and I'm transferring it to DVD to keep it. <br /> <br /> I found it very moving. These are real events in a real country. BURMA has had such a bad reputation for the political oppression it has created that it has changed their name. <br /> <br /> I find that women with a little makeup are very sexy. Patricia Arquette is in this film. Frances McDormand and Spalding Gray are in it for only a brief moment. <br /> <br /> After returning home to find her brutally murdered son and husband, Laura (Arquette) is afraid of blood. Bad trait for a doctor. Her sister (McDormand) summons her to go on vacation to Burma. While there, he witnessed a peaceful demonstration and his passport was stolen. In a bold (or stupid) move, he asks a tour guide to show her something off the tourist trail. His guide is wounded by the soldiers and she spends the rest of the film trying to get to safety. <br /> <br /> Every time I look at this it reminds me that in the United States we forget that a farmer living under military rule, socialism, where at least eating is practically guaranteed, seems really damn good.
