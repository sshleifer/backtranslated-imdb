When I went to see Bon Voyage, I expected a good multidrama on the orders of the Grand Hotel (1932) and Les Enfants de Paradis (1944). It was better than that. With few exceptions, none of the characters was totally good or totally evil - just like in real life. The acting was wonderful, especially those who played Frédéric, Raoul and Camille. The photograph was amazing, as it perfectly recreated the period and managed to shoot in Bordeaux during a period of new public works, but managed the "look" of June 1940. The costumes and make-up were accurate. There is so much in this film that it's worth a second viewing. It's exciting, fun and ultimately moving. N.B.-- Make sure you see it in a theater with a good quality projection. It is on the big screen and in the theater where I saw it (the Clairmont of Montclair) the first 30 minutes focused the subtitles at the bottom, but the faces of the actors are slightly blurred! This was eventually corrected, but it detracted from the pleasure of the film.
