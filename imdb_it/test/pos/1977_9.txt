<br /> <br /> my favorite science fiction, incredible race through mistrust and deformation of reality. Probably the best performance I've ever seen playing Jude Law. Incredibly original with interesting character developments and a plot that transforms and transforms so quickly that it takes a couple of minutes after the film to fully grasp its genius. Even more fun watching it again for the end changes the beginning.
