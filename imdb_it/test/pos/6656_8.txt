I watched Cold Mountain and the English patient again this weekend. The first is a Civil War melodrama about Inman (Jude Law), a Confederate soldier who deserted the army to return to Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) a girl he barely knows. Both films have been lovingly directed by Anthony Minghella who does an exceptional job. Although, Cold Mountain is very good, it could have been a great movie with the right cast and less folksy, the backwoods dialog. <br /> <br /> Romantic epics need a convincing heroine. The English Patient, had Kristin Scott Thomas who was chosen to play the seductive and charming Katherine Clifton. Cold Mountain's main problem is Ada who looks silly and dark and doesn't have the same quality to make you believe that Inman could become obsessed after a kiss. As an actress, Kidman has a limited range, usually playing women with a severe face who face adversity with stoicism. Kidman was also too old to interpret the love interest of Ing√©nue and Law. The film needed a young actress who could play fascinating, warm and vulnerable characters. For someone who would have to endure hardship and starvation from hunger, she seemed ridiculously well fed and too dressed. Kidman was so impeccably groomed that he seemed to have spent three hours putting on makeup for every scene. Michele Pfieffer could have played the part perfectly in his younger days. Natalie Portman would have been an improvement too. <br /> <br /> Renee Zelleweger was dressed more appropriately, but her animated performance chewed the landscape but maybe she was trying to make up for Kidman. Jude Law was in his silent film in the role of Odysseus, but he played his part well. Ray Winstone was as good as the evil Londoner / Southern. During the civil war, people were probably not very well educated by today's standards and perhaps spoke in monosyllables. However, if you look at the BBC adaptations of Dickens, Austen or Mrs. Gaskill, they are all articulated. Maybe this isn't realistic but it would improve my entertainment.
