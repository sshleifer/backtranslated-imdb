Spoiler Alert - although this is an almost impossible plot to ruin as it is to explain completely. <br /> <br /> 'Mulholland Drive' is by far the most successful expression of David Lynch's film style and vision since the first season of his TV series "Twin Peaks". As Lynch fans know, does his style and vision merge only with film noir, horror films, surrealism and parapsychology? with a healthy dose of postmodern self-awareness and black humor cast for good measure. All these elements are fully at work in "Mulholland Drive", creating a compelling, captivating and very satisfying cinematic experience ?? especially if you don't become too obsessed with trying to fit all the pieces of the plot into a logical and mysterious whole. <br /> <br /> The film presents wonderful performances by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring in the main roles of young women whose lives intersect in various ways in a Hollywood context that is itself a hallucinated blend of contemporary reality, nostalgia 1950s retro and satirical irony. Their seemingly casual encounter occurs after the opening scene of the film, in which the character of Harring escapes an attempt on his life thanks to a fortuitous, not to say horrible, car accident. Staggering down the hill from Mulholland Drive to Sunset Boulevard (the two most famous Hollywood arteries), finds the way to the apartment that Betty (Naomi Watts) is about to sublet from her "Aunt Ruth", a supposedly successful actress who is in Canada to start a new movie. As we learn later, Betty came from Deep River, Ontario, shortly after winning a jitterbug contest. <br /> <br /> A highly energetic and stylized flashback to the contest forms one of the two pre-credit prologue sequences that frame Betty's lineage from the clich√© of the innocent innocence of the star-starlet to the cheeky madness of the rejected lover and dry actress. Unable to remember his name, Harring's character adopts the name "Rita" from a movie poster for the classic noir film "Gilda" that adorns Aunt Ruth's apartment. (In fact, Aunt Ruth has long since passed away and whose apartment we are really in is a good question to solve in the future.) In any case, Betty decides to help Rita find out what happened and to find out the source of the rolls of cash and a mysterious blue key that women find in Rita's bag. The two women begin to put together the clues that seem to lead to Rita's true identity. They too, by the way, become lovers, at a certain point they radiate such incendiary chemistry that I can't remember its equality in the traditional treatments of lesbian amateurs (if a Lynch film can ever be called "mainstream"). <br /> <At the local Winkies restaurant (a recurring place full of dreamlike significance behind its filthy and realistic facade), Rita's attention is captured by the name of a waitress who reads "Diane". This brings her to remember a person named Diane Selwyn, whose apartment the two women visit early and, at Betty's insistence, burst in. I don't want to reveal what they find inside, but suffice it to say that the scene is rendered with vintage Lynchian creepiness. Subsequently, Rita wakes up in night sweats speaking Spanish and hurrying Betty to an all-night magic show / theater called 'Silencio', where the arts of illusion and the synchronization of the lips / instruments are practiced with manic intensity and where the Blue - Haired Lady, as she is noted in the credits, reigns as the presiding muse. Framed by the Silencio theater, lit up with blue and red curtains, the blue-haired lady takes the last shot in the film, perhaps a symbol for the dominant artistic imagination? a bit like Steven's "man with the blue guitar" filtered through drug surrealism. <br /> <br /> During the sequence of Silencio, and as a cameo of Rebekah Del Rio synchronizes the lips with his powerful Spanish interpretation of "Crying" by Roy Orbison '), a shocking epiphany occurs when Betty opens the his bag to discover a blue box with a keyhole that obviously matches the key in Rita's bag. Even if we do not deepen Freud's sexual symbolism of bags too deeply, the moment is singularly Hitchcockian since the combination of the key and the box leads to a complete inversion of what we thought we knew and in a completely new set of relationships and character meanings . Not the least of these reversals is the discovery that Betty is the wanted Diane Selwyn and the rejected lover of Camilla Rhodes (ie Rita). Camilla in turn is a star of the femme fatale cinema, to whom Diane is indebted for the few minor roles she has managed to protect and, more significantly, to those who are emotionally subjugated. <br /> <br /> After these and other discoveries in the last third of the film, the problem of accounting for the first two thirds of the film is not solved as directly as in "Vertigo". While fragments of images and dialogues suggest that much, if not all, of the previous material is projected and moved by Diane's feverish subconscious itself, other fragments suggest the perhaps supernatural intervention of a cast of characters who draw inspiration directly from "Twin Peaks" , including Michael J. Anderson who takes up his supernatural dwarf powers and a Bob-variant that hangs behind Winkies and is the definitive deposit for the blue box and its id-like associations. <br /> <br /> However one fits the pieces together, however, the whole 'Mulholland Drive' is much larger ?? and more mysterious ?? of the sum of its parts. Lynch takes us on a wonderfully inventive, provocative and pleasantly disturbing mental journey. Furthermore, the film's cinematography is extraordinary, the soundtrack is full of evocative atmospheres, superb acting and masterful editing / editing. This could have been the 2001 Best Picture not recognized among the major American releases.
