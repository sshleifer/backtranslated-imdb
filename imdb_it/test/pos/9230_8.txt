The bullets may not have bounced off his chest, but The Lone Ranger was for me the symbolic icon of my other hero of my childhood: Superman. He represented the truth, justice and the American way in a classic Western television scenario, living according to the principle that he would never use his gun to kill, while he scoured the American Southwest with his faithful Indian companion Tonto to deliver every single outlaw to justice. The advent of TV has provided the perfect opportunity for a post-war generation to find the ideal in an enigmatic masked man who supported law and order, while offering unparalleled entertainment for five seasons of almost eight years. <br /> <br /> Today I had the opportunity to see the three-part episodes from the beginning to the end for the first time without the standard opening and closing sequences to interrupt the continuity of the story. For Ranger fans, this is the great dad of all the western sagas, telling how the Texas Ranger John Reid survived the Butch Cavendish Gang ambush, and how he was healed by an Indian friend of his childhood. Tonto (Jay Silverheels) declares his "trusted scout" companion and calls him Kemo-sabe. I have read various interpretations of the origin of the term Kemo-sabe, but I am satisfied with the explanation of Tonto. Reading too much is enough to detract from the story, just like the English translation of "tonto" from Spanish, which I won't reveal, because it's just better not to know if you can help it. <br /> <br /> I thought he was smart enough how the story of origin created the mystique of the Lone Ranger, like the sixth tomb that created the illusion that all the Rangers died in the ambush of the canyon. You never see the face of a man who becomes the Lone Ranger, as he is always rejected or obscured to hide his true identity. Silver's origin is also brilliantly managed; the voice of the storyteller who describes the sterling qualities of the wild stallion. Would this refer, for example, to the pound ..., silver? I got the greatest success from this. <br /> <br /> Obviously with the passage of time, watching the episodes of Lone Ranger today offers a vision of how unsophisticated the show was beyond the history of origin. Some of them are full of embarrassment, particularly when it comes to a Lone Ranger showdown when he shoots in the middle of a mob of villains to throw a gun out of the owner's hand. And what about that small wave that gives Tonto when they're about to ambush the bad guys: it's always the same gesture, but Tonto always knows what it means in different circumstances. Then you have the episodes in which Clayton Moore takes off the Ranger mask to wear a different disguise to impersonate another character in the service of history. He even went undercover once as an actor portraying President Abraham Lincoln to discover a villain, a top hat and everything! <br /> <br /> Few fans I know know that actor John Hart replaced Clayton Moore for the 1952/53 season in a contract dispute that Moore had with the producers of the show. If you've ever seen that "Happy Days" episode where Fonzie idolizes his childhood hero, you'll notice that it was John Hart listed in the credits. Actually it's hard to tell if you're watching a Hart episode or not, the key is to hear the voice; Moore's is so characteristic that it is an inexhaustible gift. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to taste some of the color episodes of the final season, you're ready for a surprise. The interpretations I've seen on VHS are absolutely stunning, although I don't know if commercial prints are available. Most black and white episodes have been repacked by any number of distributors in different configurations, so getting your hands on those shouldn't be a problem. Obviously, the must must be the three-part origin, and if you look no further, this gives you all the flavor and excitement you need to capture the imagination of one of the most famous Western heroes. Hi-Yo Silver, Awaaaay!
