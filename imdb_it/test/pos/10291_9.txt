Apartmente'L is one of the most interesting films I've ever seen. I was extremely frustrated watching this movie while I was shooting for the two clues to get together. In the end it never happened, which disappointed me until the end. But the ending gives an even more cynical touch to a generally cynical film. It is not a film that people are able to observe, but a watch itself will have a profound impact on people. As of now, I haven't seen the film again and I don't think I will. <br /> <br /> The story follows the experiences of a man, Max, who is engaged to Muriel. Remember his old girlfriend Lisa (he considers him the love of his life) while listening, by chance, to Lisa talking on the phone. So try to find Lisa. Here begins his extremely frustrating search for Lisa. There are many levels in this film. There are subterranean currents of jealousy, tourism, and so on. There is also another character named Alice who is involved in all the confusion. The film then moves through a series of twists and eventually leads to an ending that could be interpreted in many ways. It is fascinating how this film has only four main characters, but intelligent writing makes it interesting and unique. What I love about it is that a movie about obsession, jealousy is done so lightly. It has a very fast pace which is probably why it can attract a large audience. The main character, Max, has shades of gray and I felt that the ending was perfect. I don't think he should be a clean character considering he is looking for his long lost love while he's engaged and also has an adventure with Alice. <br /> <br /> The character of Alice is even worse. His manipulation and his compulsive lie can really irritate viewers (that's the point, I guess). The scene in which he breaks in front of Lucien really shows another aspect of his character. He shows a side of her that wants to be accepted and that is tired of all the lies and games and wants to lead a normal life. In the end, he understands that she needs to get away from it all. The finish gives a cynical touch. Because it seems that Max's love for Alice is temporary and false. It is like saying that love in general is a temporary emotion and it is better to choose the safe option (ie Muriel) rather than pursuing something that is so fleeting (ie Lisa or Alice). In many ways this is not a romantic film but a satire on romance (in a sense). <br /> <br /> The shows deserve praise. Vincent Cassel in the role of Max gives a great performance. It perfectly portrays the confusion of a man who is not really sure of his engagement. His brilliant looks are a further advantage as it fits perfectly with the character. But the real star of the film is Romane Bohringer in the role of Alice. Her nuanced portrait of a woman who is jealous of Alice and is in love with Max. The scene in which she screams "I'm too crazy" really shows her despair and her desire to live a normal life with a man who loves her . <br /> <br /> Btw I also thought that lesbianism is another interpretation that can be taken from this film. Alice's actions can be explained in many ways. And his unreasonable obsession with Lisa can also be explained as a manifestation of a lesbian desire. It could be far-fetched considering she encourages Lisa to forgive her current boyfriend. But I felt like a lesbian for a long time. Also avoid Lisa's questions about a boyfriend. He spends a lot of time with Lisa and she is happy at the time. This could lead many to question their sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would give a 9/10. I think you deserve it but I stole one because of the rewind factor. I think it's a perfect movie otherwise.
