Perhaps one of the first slasher movies released after Halloween (though made by Irwin Yabalans on Halloween), I have to say that I honestly found "Tourist Trap" scarier and more fun. "Tourist Trap" is one of those amazing delicacies that you find from time to time, and is left with the most pleasant feeling of surprise. It was fate that I told you, but one night I was at the local Blockbuster (one or two months before it stopped working) and I had nothing to get. Then I come across this movie, I think it looks like a ridiculous B-Movie, I rented it and brought it home, boy was I in for a good scare. "Tourist Trap" looks like a bad movie, it certainly has moments of bad mood, but in the end you're having a great time doing it really well. <br /> <br /> The things that impressed me the most, and the things that made this movie one of the scariest I've seen, is the number one in the set. A horror film without a good setting is not very funny, not here. I love love, I love the place, we seem to be able to relate, it almost seems like we've been there before. Which makes it more disturbing. Then there are the characters, they are not really stereotyped and they all have real personalities. For example, they are not drug addicts, alcoholics or sex obsessed, they feel normal young adults. They also look quite realistic, and then theirs is Chuck Connors. Who gives a great interpretation like Mr. Slausen, that we all immediately take a liking to each other because again it is so real, it feels like that nice character that we love grandpa. The last, and probably the most important thing that makes this movie scary is the way they make us (the audience) jump in half our seats and turn on the rights, for the right reasons. For example, most of the time in horror movies we jump mainly due to a sudden change in the music field, but in "Tourist Trap" you prepare yourself, it's not like that. With its perfect use of lighting, mannequins and oddities you feel completely insinuated. Besides, I like it because even if they could go a little too far with some things, it still seems like this can happen. Which is exactly what a horror film that takes such a premise should do, and this is making us (the audience) feel insecure and terrified. <br /> <br /> Overall, as far as the main problems are concerned, I don't have any, only that sometimes the strangeness can get a little strange. However in the end "Tourist Trap" holds a place near and dear to my heart, to be one of the few horror films to make me turn on the lights and feel insecure about traveling.
