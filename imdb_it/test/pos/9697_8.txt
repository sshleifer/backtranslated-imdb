This movie was fun! Occasionally it has gone too far, but isn't that what we expect from them? The theater roared with laughter and fireworks at all the incredibly crazy stunts. He is rude, crude and sometimes frighteningly intense. The whole band is back and even more crazy, which in turn offers great fun. I don't want to give anything, but the small fragments of clips that run around the net are nothing compared to what comes next. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie to watch with friends. Try to see it with a large crowd. You will not be disappointed. Don't go with anyone who can't take it (see above). It will not go well, you can be sure. But this is quite obvious in the first place. If you liked the first one, you will love this one.
