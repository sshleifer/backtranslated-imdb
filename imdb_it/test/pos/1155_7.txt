Discovered by a real diplomatic incident "The wind and the lion" is a very beautiful adventure film set in the deserts of Africa. <br /> <br /> El Raisuli (Sean Connery) head of an Arab tribe kidnaps an American woman (Candice Bergen) and her two sons obtained some concessions for her country from US President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith). Out of this simple plot, John Milius gets a very complete and fun movie in the genre. <br /> <br /> Outdoor dessert settings, an extraordinary color photograph, well-managed action sequences and perfect settings transform the image into a sort of epic with an undeniable sense of greatness. The soundtrack is also remarkable and adapts accordingly. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is very good as an Arab leader and shows he can handle almost any kind of role. Thus is Candice Bergen as the woman who shows strength in dangerous circumstances, but deep down she is frightened and has her weaknesses; she manages to admire Connery and even understand his complete attention to life resulting from their completely different cultures. Brian Keith plays one of his best roles ever of US President Teddy Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> The most fun and very good film sample of the genre. Give it a chance, you won't regret it.
