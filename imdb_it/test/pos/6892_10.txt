I loved this series and it was very sad to see it go. Yes, it is based on Christians, and traditionally pure. It's about some difficult problems, as the other reviewer points out, but I suppose it depends on your point of view on these topics, and as a teenager growing up and being a mother myself, I was so happy to see a TV series that was clean and Well, frankly, wonderful! I, unlike the other reviewer, was heartened to see how they dealt with the condom deal. Instead of hearing the typical faded lavender on condoms, they showed that the son was actually working to be chaste and apply it to his subsequent relationships, which were pure and divine for this, and much more secure for that (100%!). <br /> <br /> After watching this whole series, you become extremely attached to all the characters in the family and out of the family (once they settle in permanently), and the moral values ​​they teach in each episode are simply priceless . I found Touched by an Angel (produced by the same producer) to be messed up here and there (although I liked it overall), but this series, in my opinion, was much better and performed better and was even more interesting. It was great for the whole family and it was interesting for the whole family, which was a great advantage. The family was not great, they had their faults, but in the end they did what was right and you saw them grow, change and fight like a real family. It was my favorite show at the time and I will always be near the top of my list, I hope it is released on DVD!
