This film is a piece of the time it was made ..... Realistic. The films were not covered with candy during the late 1960s and early 1970s. The producers have not tried to create a happy ending that did not exist. The lack of a happy ending would create agitation in the public that would hopefully push them to take action. At least that's how it seemed at the time. In the world of cinema today this film probably would not have been made. There would certainly not be this ending, however realistic. The sad fact is that the film described a situation that could not be improved without the intervention of improving the relationship between traditional white southern thought and the progressive movements of that time.
