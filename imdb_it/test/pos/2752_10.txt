I saw Riverdance - The New Show and I loved it from the first moment! It is an energetic tribute to Irish dancing full of brilliant dances, music and choreography! The protagonists, Jean Butler and Colin Dunne fascinated me with their exquisite dance! May they always continue to shine and continue dancing. Their chemistry on stage was incredible, and the unity between them on stage was obvious. They seem made for dancing with one another! This show is my absolute favorite, and probably always will be. Long Live Riverdance!
