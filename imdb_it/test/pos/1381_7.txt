The "7" rating is not necessarily a blur - this film was made on a low budget - but done well within its limits. <br /> <br /> A usual plot of boiler pots - The ship carrying a prisoner is destroyed in space, people and prisoners flee in pods, land on an unknown planet where their presence awakens something. Chaos occurs, many ammunition is depleted. <br /> <br /> The special effects have been backed up and done correctly, emphasizing the technology of the future with displays and holographic controls instead of relying on plastic objects with a voluminous and economical appearance. Furthermore, the rhythm of the story has moved without letting the spectator fall into boredom, where they begin to collect things. <br /> <br /> I entered it as a lite Saturday afternoon. You can get up and hit the fridge without stopping it and it will still be nice. Even better, your girlfriend can talk to you all the way without ruining your fun ... and she will be happy: after all, she got to talk to you! IT'S THAT kind of movie. <br /> <br /> However, the current plot has few holes after they hit the planet, but hey, this is an action movie Guns 'n' Ammo. The lines of cohesive stories are not necessarily necessary as long as you have beer and chips at your fingertips. So don't end up in a brain cramp for the ending.
