The hawk and the snowman is the true story of two rich children of the university age of L.A., who become spies for the Soviet Union. One, played by Penn, is already a drug dealer up until his eyes in trouble. The other, played by Hutton, gets a position in an aerospace company where his job is to run a top-secret cable facility. There he learns some of the dirty tricks used by the CIA on foreigners that America does not love. Don't forget that the film is set in the early 1970s, the time of Vietnam and Watergate. Horrified by what he learned, the character of Hutton decides to betray his country and convinces his friend to join him. None of them has a long history of brains, it doesn't take long before they have the upper hand over their heads with no way out. <br /> <br /> This is not a thriller, and it's rather slow. If this is not a problem for you, then it is worth the rental.
