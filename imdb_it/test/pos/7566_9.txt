Someone definitely has it for The Wind and I can't believe that what I saw on the screen has a lot to do with it. This is a better and more solid film than most of the independents I watch all year. The cinematography shows a genuine love and mastery of the trade and the casting went well. I'd like to see more of these people, particularly Zeke Rippy. <br /> <br /> As for the story and the script, I'm not so sure that the negative comments preceding this post were written with the intent of informing someone else about the film. The long stinging appointments that must have taken hours to compose and are the only comments left for each film on this site by the reviewer are obvious slanders directed at the film's producers. I don't know the internal story, but it would probably be a good movie. What I know about this biz is that productions that try to make everyone happy usually end up being horrible and when the director has the courage, guidance and common sense to "kill children", someone always ends up with feelings wounded . This is also part of the biz and one of the best learning tools available to those who are truly dedicated to doing so in the world of cinema. Of course, failures have nothing better to do than sit at home and write false reviews on the internet as a form of revenge against those who have snubbed them (read: they were honest and sincere with them). And this is my best guess to explain the unpleasant and bad reviews. To the extent that there is a grain of truth behind it all, there is a point to be made, but these exaggerations of the grains are so above the lines that they obviously become fictitious. <br /> <br /> It is not a bloodbath slasher if that is what you are looking for, it is more the psychological suspense thriller, which is generally not appreciated by the minimal common denominators out there. The best way to see this movie is to try to erase the pre-conceived notions, insert them and leave them open - seriously, the characters are defined by their actions and words and when you see what these people do and what they say, I don't think I can conclude with the conclusion that these characters were underdeveloped. Maybe it happens badly. <br /> <br /> Overall, I agree that it is a well-made and compelling film. Maybe I wouldn't have given a 9 under normal circumstances, but the severe negative comments actually attracted me to the image (I have a secret love for really bad cinema). For me, classifications under 5 should be reserved for shlock movies, inept, badly performed and stupidly written. None of this applies here - it's a quality film production with some real talent. I gave him the nine to tip the scale in the right direction. Watch the movie and tell me I'm wrong.
