I have been waiting for years to comment on this program, and I felt it was time to do justice. This is one of Christie's darkest, most sinister and engaging works, not just someone who is killed for money, this is a dark and engaging story of mystery, intrigue, love and murder, made even better by the changes made by the adapter. The level of acting is absolutely superb, Joan Hickson is sublime in the part, as always! The rest of the cast, including Liz Fraser, Anna Cropper and Helen Cherry perform beautifully, but it is my opinion that the show was stolen by Margaret Tyzack, the final scene between her and Joan Hickson is simply magical, acting is good as becomes, chilling, moving and totally brilliant. <br /> <br /> Please let me know if you agree with my words. I look forward to the remake to see how beautiful the Geraldine McEwan version is. Look and have fun.
