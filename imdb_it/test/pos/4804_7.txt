The only thing that can be said about RUNNING OUT OF TIME is that it is an immensely intelligent film. It is interesting to note that the film's writers are French, which could explain the film's "out of the norm" atmosphere, as it does not perfectly fit what is commonly called "Hong Kong Cinema". <br /> <br /> The film is about a thief who plans revenge on certain types of criminals using the assistance of an equally intelligent policeman. But first he has to convince the policeman to join his personal crusade, and so he starts a series of games in which the thief maneuvers the policeman into his plan. <br /> <br /> A pretty smart movie. <br /> <br /> 7 on 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this film or complete reviews of other foreign films)
