I was amazed by the quality of this film, in particular after seeing the photos of the newly adult director - all 140 (?) Pounds of him! Really, a boy who directs a film about a boy. I can't wait to see more Luke Eberl films. <br /> <br /> I thought this was a little too long. There was too much time spent showing Connor that he was able (and unwanted) to make a move on Owen. Caleb has not tried enough. Owen, being so young, could easily have approached Caleb and later decided that it was not his preference. And Owen would still have learned the "valuable lesson" on corruption and politics. Instead, he was not given a good chance of knowing his sexuality. And poor Caleb? Owen could have had a good influence. <br /> <br /> Although the film intends to show Owen as a hero who overcomes perverse corruption, I felt sad for Owen. He was offered the opportunity to have some fun as a boy with Caleb, who was extraordinarily handsome. Owen did not have to get along with the political perversion offered. But he could have tried to have fun with Caleb, and he still left when he wanted to. It was clear that Owen was in charge: no one forced him to do something he didn't want to do. But he could have had more fun, and with a very exciting guy, in this one. <br /> <br /> I hope that Luke will make more films where the captivating young characters have more fun.
