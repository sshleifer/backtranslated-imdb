Typically, I'm a comedy guy. I rented it at the video store under the comedy and thought "Albert Brooks! Awesome!" and rented it. It looked like the romantic comedy, and I remembered that I hated those, and I had all the mentality to hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> While this is a romantic comedy, it is played by a magnificent cast of actors and actors (Brooks, Hunter, Cusack and Nicholson), and everything works well inside. The script seems real and not forced, as might happen in the news station you are watching at night. It takes your emotions and makes you enjoy Hunter and Brooks and you hate Hurt, which makes the ending a little pleasant and fruitless, but shows how you don't need a happy ending to finish a movie, you just need a true ending , is what everyone has everyone's life does not end well and is seen in Broadcast News. Maybe people don't like the ending because it's not the typical happy ending associated with romantic comedies ... but it works, it's real and it's brilliant. Broadcast News is a classic in its time, and a love movie up there with "Casablanca". Well, maybe not so high, but it's the only other love story that I can think of what I like. <br /> <br /> News from the broadcast: 9/10.
