I am continually amazed by the US networks. What is the problem with them? Yet another very promising series has been cut after only 15 episodes and we are not aware of what the hell happens to everyone. I really enjoyed this show and I'm so annoyed that we'll never find out what happens to the characters and the "monsters" from the depths. This show had it all. Humor, suspense, action. What more could you want. Why should I ever pull the plug on this? It does not make sense. Buffy went on for 7 series like Charmed and however pleasant, Surface, Invasion and Dead Like Me were even better. Just because a show doesn't get too high scores doesn't mean it's junk and if they give it a little longer probably more people would catch it and end up with great success in their hands. One season simply doesn't give him enough time to move forward and the nets are very anxious to pull the plug. They should learn that, like fine wines and cheeses, they need time to mature. <br /> <br /> Bring Surface and Invasion back - P L E A S E !!!!!!!
