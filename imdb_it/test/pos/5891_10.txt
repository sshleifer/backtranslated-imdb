Best Years of Our Lives perfectly captures the age of my youth and the feelings of that time. The cast was uniformly wonderful. It was probably the best role of his career at Dana Andrews and he should also have been nominated for an Academy Award. There are so many wonderful scenes in this film that it's almost impossible to list them all. Cinematography is among the best in each film. This film is a time capsule of what it was like in the 1940s. A movie to watch for all fans of real movies. Some critics have said that this film has aged. I do not agree. The theme of human desires is timeless. And the obstacles faced by veterans returning from the war will always be with us. This is just a great movie - one that can be seen over and over again.
