Some aspects of Punishment Park are far from perfect, especially those of acting. However, I think this is probably the most important film of the "war on terror" era. I grew up hating hippies and in some ways I still do it. Only when the United States was launched along the path of a useless and deceptive war in Iraq did I begin to see the world through their eyes. I can hear what they must have heard. Even if the film is a little dated, looking at it brings those unpleasant emotions directly onto the surface of our current situation. It is quite clear at the beginning of the film that Punishment Park is designed to be a concentration camp and death for all the "unpatriotic" elements of American society. This is certainly an exaggerated and extreme vision of our polarized society, but it is CREDIBLE. Sometimes I find myself believing that the United States could easily slip into fascism. As I watched this film, I could only think of how I feel similar feelings from people on both sides of the political spectrum almost every day. This film is a raw and concentrated distillate of the current American political scene. I am both impressed and saddened by the fact that something relevant (and yes, accurate) was filmed over 30 years ago. If you have a more moderate view of the film and choose to believe that this could not happen here, take a closer look at Guantanamo Bay, some of our "enemy combatants", the alleged secret CIA prisons and the many incidents similar to that in Greensboro, NC in 1979 (8 full years after the making of this film).
