Karim Hussain's art / guru masterpiece: this cat is certainly a talent not to be missed. We have in this several longer vignettes interspersed with some shorter sequences. This is all in all a very powerful film that is based on its intense graphic images and symbolism and is not for all viewers. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a short title OVARIAN EYEBALL. Very short segment that has a naked woman resting on a bare table. An invisible woman's hand covers the woman's face supine with a red cloth and makes an incision in the abdomen from which an eyeball stem is extracted. I have nothing too much to comment on this because of its brevity. <br /> <br /> HUMAN LARVAE is one of the lynching films and is a totally inflexible portrait of a perverse act committed by a disturbed man who has an incestuous love for his pregnant sister. This is one of those things like "must be seen to be believed". I will say that this film has some of the best effects I've seen in an independent horror film, but the topic will make this experience undeniably unpleasant for most (but not me - I live for it!). <Br /> <br /> REBIRTH could have been cut off from this movie all together. This is the weakest segment of the film and has a lot of naked people who do bloody holes in a field and so on. Very short, but this kind of shots pushes the momentum of the film. <br /> <br /> RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM is one of the most profane representations of religious images that I have ever seen and totally kicks my ass. Think of "P iss Christ" or of the menstrual blood paintings of the Virgin Mary. In this piece, very harsh sexual / sexually violent / bloody images are presented and it is certainly not for anyone who will be offended by the sacrilege. <br /> <br /> The subconscious Cruelty is one of the best films I've seen under banner of extreme horror it will be a very divisive film between horror fans and the cinema audience in general. Some will call it garbage, some will call it brilliant. I don't see much in between. I thought this film was damn original and I will recommend it to anyone who is adventurous enough to try it. 9/10.
