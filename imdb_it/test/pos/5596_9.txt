Race Against Fear must be one of the most moving TV movies I've seen in a long time. All the performances of the main actors were exceptional, in particular those of Ariana Richards (Mickey Carlyle), William Bullimer (Coach Kurt Ansom) and Susan Blakely (Margaret Carlyle). In particular, Ariana offers an extremely emotional performance, with facial expressions to match. She interpreted the emotions that Mickey felt perfectly, and one could easily believe that she had really been raped, so realistic was her performance. <br /> <br /> RAF is an incredibly realistic film, due to the moving performances by the die-cast. Bullimer came across an incredibly good rapist, and you hated him more and more as the movie progressed. Blakely also did an emotional performance like the mother of the raped girl (Mickey Carlyle), and you felt more and more sorry for the Carlyle family because no one believed them on the rape. <br /> <br /> All in all, RAF is a great film. It is both moving and full of suspense, since we are not sure if Ansom would be tried for rape, due to the lack of witnesses, evidence and belief in the complaint. I highly recommend seeing this movie.
