I remember running home from school almost every day to catch KTLA movies on channel 5 monsters, but I never ran home faster than when this movie was scheduled. Somehow, the idea of ​​being a boy and having a giant robot like a friend fascinated me in a very unique way. Of course, I pretended to be Spiderman, Batman and other superheroes, but I really wanted to be Johnny Sakko on some of them. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen this movie in 30 years and I can still remember it vividly. Who can forget the way Giant Robot fired missiles from his fingers! Or what about the way Ghuillotene threw his nails to make explosions! Damn, I can still whistle the theme music that plays at the end, which is so tragic that I remember crying falling asleep a few times! <br /> <br /> Only another film has the kind of magic that this film is in my mind and this is the Wizard of Oz. But I've seen that movie many times since I was a child. Of course, the Wizard of Oz is a true classic, while Voyage Into Space is an economic contradiction. These two films should not even be mentioned in the same sentence, but for a boy they are not high production or continuity values ​​that capture your heart, its flying monkeys and giant robots! <br /> <br /> P.S. My cousin used to make a very precise impression of Giant Robot (he pronounced it "Giant Robutt".) If you remember, Giant Robot had a special way of shooting his missiles and my cousin was cold. I made him repeat the routine endlessly for my personal enjoyment.
