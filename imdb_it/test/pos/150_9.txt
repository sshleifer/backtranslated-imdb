The beauty of Thirst, the last Chanwook Park movie, is that it is the anti-Twilight. Some of you may take it as a negative sign, but in reality it is a great advantage. Park takes the method of vampirism seriously and also the torrid love story between Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo. We see the conflicts of both characters - Sang-hyeon is a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that, unbeknownst to him, turns him into a sickly but true-blue vampire, and Tae-Joo with his mother and brother "idiot", quest the last one is killed by Sang- as in a very strong melodrama. There is nothing terribly whining or insipid with the story and the characters at any time, and the implications emerged from religion in the beginning (Sang, for example, is seen as a healer since he is resurrected due to his vampirism, too if it cannot be that and knows it) on top of those of good against evil, it pushes it to another cinematic level. <br /> <br /> Even that thirst rises to the extraordinary artistic level that Park has shown with Oldboy, Lady Vengeance and the underrated I am a cyborg but that's okay, it should be taken as a fact. Thirst is a film with a juicy narrative and bizarre suburban characters, and is shot and edited with an eye for a mood that is partly satirical, partly romantic / erotic, partly dramatic and finally fantastic. And he doesn't always consider the vampirim as something of a simple horror film set (although in a horror film Park has more than his share of scary scenes). It is more like the Near Dark movie that never mentions the word vampire but lets you know that it was, and treated it with sincerity and a sort of clear attention span, and that the disease itself and its effect on the existence of a person is perhaps scarier than killing or bloodshed. Once you see a vampire jump up or heal his wounds, you've seen it all. <br /> <br /> Thirst also has an evil sense of humor, very similar to Oldboy, only here with a bite (intended) intended to emphasize bizarre physical states of being. An example of this can be found with the Priest's predilection of sucking blood from comatose people by taking their blood tube and sucking on it on the floor. Or the way Tae-Joo holds a human waste by keeping his mother alive, even though he had something like a stroke and can only blink and touch a finger as a means of reacting to the bloodsuckers I brought pain and horror at his house. But these moments are like a cherry on the cake to make it a complete experience. What makes Thirst last in the mind is how the elements come together, of drama and existential pain, of a Catholic-surreal sense of Catholicism (I particularly loved the dynamic between Sang-hyeon and the other priest who gives him the arm to suck blood but really wants to be a vampire too), and of the erotic: the scenes in which the priest finally surrenders to Tae-Joo are incredible in their rhythm and in the length of the shots and how real it is. Not in a pornographic way, but in the sense of the release and escape of these characters, which does not last long on the purpose of the plot. <br /> <br /> If it's not as good as Oldboy, it's not something for carp. Not all films directed by Chanwook Park will reach the stature of his masterpiece (and, at least, he will always be known as the man who directed that film). But Thrist is an excellent addition to his work and the vampire film series in general. The making of the film is sharp, exciting and even dangerous (and in which white room of "daylight" the characters live!), The humor is dark and hilarious, the acting is intense and moody - especially with the thin features of Song Kang-ho and Kim OK-vin's bizarre and surprisingly vulnerable vulnerability, and the ending, when it finally arrives, is one of those really superb vampire movie endings you'll be talking about for years, in a good way. In a battle between Thirst and Twilight, Thirst takes the knock-out in the first round. Between Let the Right One or Near Dark, it's more difficult to call. 9.5 / 10
