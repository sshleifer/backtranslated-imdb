When I saw this movie, it reminded me of all the biggest dreams I've had (mostly filled with robots) <br /> <br /> I can relate to Eledore's problems and I have a resemblance to Shiro, and this is a great movie to watch (if you are a Goth who is bitter and eccentric like me!). All in all, watch it before it's sold out!
