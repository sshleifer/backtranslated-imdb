This film was better than I expected. I don't think he deserved an R rating, though. I saw the PG-13 movies with worse language and violence. I found this movie funny and liked it. If you are a person who dissects everything, you may find it very wrong with this, but if you take it for its face value, I think you'll find it funny.
