I've just finished watching Marigold today and I'll start by saying that I found this DVD on Blockbuster's shelves. While I was walking in search of something new and beautiful to look at, the photo of Ali Larter caught my eye. <br /> <br /> After drooling over Ali Larter, I took the cover and kept looking around the cover. From the looks, I thought the costumes were a bit exaggerated. And then I saw the other Indians on the cover and thought it was kind of a parody or something. <br /> <br /> When I turned the synopsis part and saw Salman Khan, I took a double take. Salman Khan in an American movie with Ali Larter on a Blockbuster DVD? Since Salman Khan is for Bollywood films like Mel Gibson is for Hollywood movies, I had very high expectations for this movie: it had to be good! I am very happy to say that Marigold is a phenomenal film! It far exceeded all my personal expectations! I suppose a film like this is what happens when you have a decent script, a talented, experienced, expert and goal-oriented director, two incredible actors who play the main roles and only a very challenging cast and support crew! Khan and Larter seem to have a great chemistry together and both shine on the big screen: they look really good together. The musical numbers were not bad at all, which was surprising considering how long and musical films of Indian films are. And you will be happy to know that Indian costumes are far from being as gaudy as you will have. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the film was quite slow, the medium was really good, the scenes leading up to the climax were quite dramatic, but the ending was simply fantastic! However, I have some complaints and complaints on the DVD. While I loved the widescreen proportions of the DVD, I didn't like the fact that many other things had been left out of the DVD. For beginners, there are no subtitles. Now English is my first language, it's not a problem. However, when some of the Indian actors and actresses spoke, it was (sometimes) difficult to understand what they were saying; subtitles would help. <br /> <br /> Another thing I would have appreciated on the DVD would have been a cockroach coil or some sort of collection of outtakes. And finally, how about a menu function that would allow us to jump directly to musical numbers? Friend, some of those songs were really good! On the flip side, I really enjoyed seeing Marigold's creation. <br /> <br /> I still have many things to say about the beauty of this film and how much I liked it, but I don't have time or I want to keep writing because I liked it so much. I hope that Salman Khan will make more British films in addition to his Hindi films and I hope this Hindi film is not Ali Larter's latest Bollywood film. And I encourage the director to continue creating the Bollywood film hybrids with Salman Khan, Ali Larter and other great actors - make sure the scripts are original and good. <br /> <br /> 10/10 - this is just a great love movie that your whole family can enjoy!
