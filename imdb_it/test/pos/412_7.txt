Look, this film is dark, bright and a classic that should be searched by any means necessary. I suppose the powers have decided that it will forever be relegated to the bargain; however, we could only pray for the chance to see this on DVD. I would say that even the great Phatasm beats. If you like a dark movie, with lots of ghostly images, look for this and see what a horror movie should look like in the 80s.
