There is only one racist joke in this short Daffy Duck, which is basically, when Daffy rides Black Beauty, she is a black woman. I can understand in part why this joke was included, because at the moment few people knew how rude it was to be racist and it was not even illegal to discriminate against blacks. <br /> <br /> Apart from this point, "A Coy Decoy" is basically a fun and interesting short where Daffy meets characters in books and does things in books. I really enjoyed this short (despite other reviewers here). The way in which Daffy is so in love with the duck of a watch is vaguely disturbing, but at the same time very funny. Porky is a beautiful edition of the episode, although it was not vital for him to be there. The wolf is an example of how people thought of wolves even in those days, bloodthirsty and terrible animals, which of course they never really were (unless they are very hungry). I also liked the animation style used - and the theme of the episode. <br /> <br /> For people who are totally inside Daffy Duck and for people who don't care about the occasional racist joke in cartoons, enjoy "A Coy Esca"! <br /> <br /> Available on YouTube.
