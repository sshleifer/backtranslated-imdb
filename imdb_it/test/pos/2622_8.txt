I've watched this episode a lot of times because I didn't understand how Prue died. This is what happened. Prue, Piper and Phoebe try to save their innocent doctor, because Shax wants to kill him. Phoebe goes upstairs to look in the Book of Shadows while Prue and Piper are protecting their innocents. Shax appears while Phoebe is still upstairs, so Shax throws a ball of energy at the doctor but Prue pushes him away and Prue is hit in the chest with it and collides with the wall, the same with Piper. So Phoebe goes downstairs and says the spell, since only Phoebe said it and the power of the three Shax was not hurt. Phoebes calls Leo to heal Piper and Prue. So Leo heals them. Phoebe went to the Underworld to find Cole, while Prue and Piper were looking for Shax in the streets. Piper and Prue see Shax and Piper using his power to blow up Shax, meanwhile a new reporter got it all on tape. So it's all new on the three powerful Halliwell sisters, meanwhile Phoebe knows nothing because she's still in the Underworld. There are Repoters and people throughout Halliwell's home. Then a maniac enters the house and says "Can I be part of your coven?" and Prue says "No, this is our home that comes out of here!" and Prue uses her powers to throw her out. While the maniac comes out of the house crying saying "There Mean Witches". The maniac becomes so crazy that he shoots Piper through his stomach. Prue gets into the car and trays to go to the hospital, but people don't let it pass, so Prue uses her powers to move people astray, forcing people to want to kill her more. They arrived at the hospital but Piper didn't make it. Meanwhile Phoebe is in the Underworld. Phoebe discovers that he was exposed, so Phoebe asks Cole to ask the source if he can reverse the weather. The source says that the weather will change only if Phoebe promises to stay here in the Underworld, so Cole told Phoebe what the source had told him. Phoebe says "What would make him think I'd make such a deal?" and then Cole says "So you can save one of your sister lives". Leo goes to the hospital to find out that Piper is really dead, so he tells Phoebe it's true. Then Phoebe agrees to stay alone if Cole returns to warn Piper and Prue of Piper's exposure and death. Back at the hospital, SWAT talks about the filming of Prue, but the second before they make time is rewound when they were at the manor with the doctor, but this time Phoebe wasn't there to call Leo to heal Prue and Piper, then the doctor also throw the wall. The doctor is dead and so is Prue. But that's what I didn't get, if Piper had been thrown against the wall, how come only Prue is dead? Why didn't they show Leo to come and heal Piper and Leo trying to heal Prue? If you know the answer please email me at angelpuss924@yahoo.com PS. I miss Prue, but I also like Paige and I'm glad the show continues
