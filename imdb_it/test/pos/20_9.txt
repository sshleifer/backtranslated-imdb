The many other comments on the film say it all, adding that we showed it last week at around 30 at our community cinema, and got an overall average score of 8.6. We would recommend it 100%, therefore, to today's public, especially if they can see it on a real movie screen, and we can talk about it with others later, as our audience did. <br /> <br /> the power of the entire crew's acting was incredible and quite fascinating. Of course, Finney and Courtenay were indeed the stars. but all were well expressed. For our afternoon audience, most of whom are "elderly", the fact that the plot could be followed so easily due to the clarity of the word and the wonderful non-technical use of the camera and sound had a great influence < br /> <br /> How nice, many have said, to see a truly fantastic film that is English: not yet dated twenty years later: not full of blood and guts: it's not confused because of the bob-on-the place camera shots, and back and forth across time history lines: not squalid sexual scenes. These opinions were also pronounced by some who were younger.
