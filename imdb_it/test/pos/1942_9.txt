The way of acting of Crispin Glovers (and not only his) is tremendous. You really want to believe him because his body language and show fit the person perfectly. It gives Layne this extraordinary touch of personality that makes this film a cult. In addition to Feck, the role is played very well by Dennis Hopper. It's about choosing the right or wrong side, without thinking logically about the scene. Friendship is more important, and that's exactly what I think is what makes choices so difficult. Rivers Edge lets you experience it with serious and familiar tones. I really enjoyed watching it. I saw it a month ago for the first time, but if you like a nice 80's feeling, this is what you need to see. They are something I didn't know before.
