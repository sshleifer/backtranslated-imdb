Forget Easy Rider - Head is THE movie in the 60s. <br /> <br /> Almost laughing: while the Monkees reduce their entire career to a one-minute dandruff TV commercial! See: the 50-foot Victor Mature tries to figure out what the hell he's doing in this movie! Listen: Frank Zappa (with his cow on a leash) tells Davey Jones "Your music is terribly white"! Experience: the only live performance of the Monkees as a real rock band plays the real and only punk-rock song (Circle Sky)! Listen: how Davey Jones sings a Harry Nielsen song about having a transsexual father! Be confused: be very confused, as confused as Terri Garr when Mickey Dolenz makes his sexual allusions about her in her film debut! Witness: unnecessary protests against the Vietnam war jump out of nowhere and just as quickly disappear! Watch: Mike Nesmith spits for Christmas while wearing a Victorian steaming Victorian jacket on a gothic spider web of horror movies! Let yourself drift: in karmic bliss inspired by a comic version of Indian mysticism pronounced by a white-black actor-actor, while Peter Tork pretends to know how to play a guitar! Discover: the first feature film by Oscar-winning director Bob Rafelson, as written by actor-winning actor Jack Nicholson! Pretend it doesn't happen: when the Monkees commit suicide, jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge! Take drugs: take lots of drugs: take all the drugs that the cast and crew evidently made during the making of this movie! <br /> <br /> With Head, the Monkees turned out to be the most intriguing and streamlined entertainers in Hollywood history, without exception. It is disconcerting to find that they have blamed the failure of this film in bad publicity. To be sure, the promotion was practically non-existent; but have not recognized how angry he is down below, how self-destructive this film is? I mean, this film is a journey - with bad acid - in the suicide ward of a psychiatric hospital. The only film I know so depressing is Terry Gilliam's Brazil; and like Brazil, this film reveals why life in the late twentieth century was almost unbearable - if one had been lucky. It is not simply that Western culture suffered from a severe information overload, but the information itself was just bad, bad, more evil and depressing. In fact, it was the overload effect that kept people going, as this allowed people to distract themselves with a crisis or the other - if the news from Vietnam became too much to bear, they could turn the channel and watch a documentary on the rising unemployment rate. <br /> <br /> The "positive" response to the reality revealed in Head was Woodstock: three days of peace and love and nudity and mud and insects and bad food and dirty drinks and poop and pee and bad acid and Peter Townsend almost kills Abbie Hoffman. Everything takes place behind a steel fence, under the lovingly watchful eyes of a true army of New York State soldiers - which means that the "freedom" of Woodstock Nation was as illusory as the song that John Sebastion thought he would sing while he was so close to his heart that he could barely speak. "500,000 assholes too stupid to get out of the rain" was a critic's judgment on Woodstock (I think it was Andy Warhol). <br /> <br /> The only good thing that happened was the Star Spangled Banner by Jimi Hendrix. Two years earlier, the Jimi Hendrix Experience had participated in their first national tour in America, like the heating band for the Monkees. <br /> <br /> See, it's all connected in some way. <br /> <br /> You owe it to yourself - indeed, you owe it to your unborn child - to see the real 60s, only to be found on film in this bizarre, miraculous and absolutely absurd tribute to a of the most interesting capitalist scams of the late 20th century.
