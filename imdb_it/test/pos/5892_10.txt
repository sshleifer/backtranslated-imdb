Best Years of Our Lives is a film that has slipped under my radar for years - I had heard of it, but I never had the opportunity to see it. Thanks to TCM On Demand, I was able to see it free and without ads. <br /> <br /> What surprised me about this film was how quickly it was made after the war. The film speaks frankly about people who have been injured in war, both physically and mentally. It handles almost all varieties of the war experience neatly into three characters. <br /> <br /> We have the Air Force officer, who was a veteran of the first European bombing campaign. Due to the terrible dropout rate among the bombing crews, the Air Force at that time had the reputation of churning out officers who quickly rose up in ranks. This has been the case of this type that has gone from a low jerk of civilian life to a captain and bomber of his B-17. He also suffers from PTSD, called "battle fatigue" at that time. <br /> <br /> We have the non-com army that served in the Pacific, and suffered through the horrors of that campaign. His story is opposite to that of the Air Force in that it passes from a prestigious job as a banker to a low grunt in the army and rises to the rank of sergeant. From the stripes on the sleeve it is clear that it is the highest level of sergeant, yet it is still at the forefront. <br /> <br /> Finally we have the Navy Seaman, which is part of the faceless support staff, commonly referred to as REMF (Rear Echelon MFers) by the fellows of the line. Ironically, he suffers the worst physical injuries when working as an under-deck mechanic on a Navy ship, his ship being hit, presumably by a suicide bomber and sunk with the loss of 400 lives. He is pulled out of the water but his severely burned hands are amputated and replaced with prosthetic hooks. <br /> <br /> BYOOL tells the story of how these three meet on a transport plane that they boarded for home, and how they readjust to civil society. <br /> <br /> What struck me most about this film is that, despite the obvious problems faced by the three protagonists, it never falls into melodrama. The Navy boy, played by a true amputee, is placed in situations where we might feel sorry for him, yet the script never makes us feel that emotion. The army sergeant is clearly an alcoholic, and the story highlights it, but he never dwells on it. The air force captain struggles with the loss of status when he is forced to return to the drug store where he drank soda (now bought from a large chain) and take on a demeaning job to support his ungrateful and unfair wife. <br /> <br /> The script offers many opportunities for all of these characters to arrive at a dramatic climax regarding their problems, but avoids it carefully. But for the excessively dramatic soundtrack, the director turns to exploit the obvious. <br /> <br /> In a scene that represents the entire film well, the army sergeant's daughter (Frederic March) is discussing with her father and mother regarding the air force captain. Despite her marriage, they fell in love, and are determined to break the marriage that is obviously upset. Now we have seen thousands of typical scenes of this in which the father twitches angrily and the daughter ends up escaping to her room in tears, slamming the door and falling on the bed. Later, mother shows up, comforts her daughter and offers words of maternal wisdom, and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> In BYOOL, this scene takes place completely differently than the cliché I described above. Certainly the conversation overheats, but all the parts are reasonable, and there is a serious and timeless discussion on the nature of relationships that has some of the best dialogues I've seen. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, BYOOL is a great satisfying film, with honest performances of the entire cast. Technically, the editing and cinematography frame is well shot, but it will never obscure the compelling storyline. Despite the score, which is cliché and dramatic, I give this film the highest score it clearly deserves
