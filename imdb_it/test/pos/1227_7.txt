Good, boring or bad? All right. Is it worth your money? If you can save it for a ticket, sure. Does the trailer look better? Yes, strangely. <br /> <br /> Not much to do in the script - Guards working in an armored truck company move huge amounts of money. The guards see the opportunity to retreat as millionaires, one of them is too honest to get on with everything, and a good plan goes to hell. <br /> <br /> This may have been a repudiation of poorly executed Reservoir Dog, but the cast's ability and the director's ability to do almost anything tense, get him out of that realm and put him on a solid foundation .
