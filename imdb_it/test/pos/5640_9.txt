This representation of the sad Japanese forces in the Philippines is a tour de force in the absolute lack of meaning of war. It is an effective representation of Japanese pacifist views after the Second World War. In the film, Japanese soldiers were left to themselves in the jungle of the Philippines. In the face of impending hunger, they resort to cannibalism and gradually lose the little humanity they have left. To call this film depressing would be an understatement. The spectator is left with an absolutely derogatory sense of the lost value of life in modern combat. The final scene is almost too nihilistic, but the film is still noteworthy. Highly recommended.
