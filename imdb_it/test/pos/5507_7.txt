This off-beat horror film seems to get nothing but bad reviews. My question is; why? I think this movie is pretty good. Dee Snider did very well for his first (and only) directing. The antagonist, Captain Howdy (Carelton Hendriks) also plays. This film seems to have a vision of the future. Although it came out in 1998, it seems to be about modern issues. Internet predators seem to be the underlying plot here. Even if taken to another level, this is a problem that we still face today. I must admit that the story has failed, but that doesn't make it a bad movie at all. Robert Englund is also in this film, which makes it automatically better. The acting wasn't bad, even the characters were pretty good. Hendriks was a good antagonist, I think. I give this off-beat horror to 7/10. Recommend for Saw enthusiasts.
