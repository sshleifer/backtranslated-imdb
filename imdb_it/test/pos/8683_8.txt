All I can say is that, I was expecting a science fiction movie and "Blurred" surprised me on the positive way. Very cute teen movie. All these types of situations are normal in school life, so all I can say is that all this reminded me of my school days and sometimes it's nice to watch this kind of film, because we entertain ourselves and travel again in those years. gold when we were young. Also, lead us to think better in the way we understand our children, because in the past we were just like they want to be in the present time. Try this movie and you will be very happy. At the same time, you will have the guarantee that your time does not was wasted.
