My father worked with top secret information in the DIA before and he is the one who mentioned this film for me. When I was a child I always asked him what would happen if he revealed secrets and recommended this movie. <br /> <br /> In the film it really puts 2 FRIENDS, almost completely different! in a tangle they never really knew what the result would be. The snowman, Daulton really destroyed me because the film portrayed him as a simple drug dealer who didn't know what he was discussing, and in the movie it looked like he got the worst of everything. The hawk, Chris, is just a guy who wanted to express his feelings about the US government in a very radical vision. <br /> <br /> For movie lovers this is a must see !!!
