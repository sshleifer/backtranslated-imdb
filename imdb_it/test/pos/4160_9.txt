This is Christmas! A nativity in terms of rebirth, or at least that's what one can hope for in Italian cinema. It was something like 30-40 years that Italian cinema did not create a piece of art of this size. This is an absolute contemporary film that can also be considered at the same level of quality as Italian masterpieces of the past, it is useless to mention any name. And finally this is also a great production by the Italian standards of the time. In this film there is a rare balance of different elements, all understandable and enjoyable at different levels of use. True poetry, true humor, true tenderness, true drama, true beauty. No rhetoric, no easy surreal shortcuts, no typical tourist-like representation to Tornatore, no excessive acting, no director's self-referentialism. There is also an interesting use of two poignant songs by Nina Simone, whose music, in my opinion, was never used appropriately for a soundtrack. So, if this is not a real revival for Italian cinema, it is an extraordinary evolution for Emanuele Crialese after his "Respiro" another beautiful film. "Nuovomondo" is not to be missed, it is that kind of "medical film" useful for enjoying movies, watching movies, useful for enjoying and understanding life. Francesco Cabras
