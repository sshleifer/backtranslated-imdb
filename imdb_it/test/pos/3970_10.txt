Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I've seen in a long time. He has an original script, a talented cast and offers an hour and a half of pure fun. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a Bartleby "B" Gains (Justin Long) diplomat who is not accepted in any of the collages he addressed, so to avoid his parents' disappointment he creates an imaginary collage. In an attempt to completely fool his parents, he creates a fake website and turns an old psychiatric hospital into a school. Everything goes smoothly until many other "accepted" students show up at his door. Now he and his friend must understand that collage not only for themselves but also for others. <br /> <br /> Justin Long as protagonist is absolutely brilliant, his character is as natural as can be and the supporting acts are exceptional: Jonah Hill as Sherman Schrader, Columbus Short as Hands, Maria Thayer as Rory, Adam Herschman like Glen and Lewis Black as Uncle Ben. <br /> <br /> Humor is fresh, simple and above all fun, right from the start, after the end credits. The plot develops so easily that when you stop laughing at the last joke you start giggling at each other. Along with all the fun the film brings a very common topic to our attention, for example collage education. If the students of the film are usually united against the school government, in this case they are united by the mutual desire to go to school and learn. <br /> <br /> However, the film does not mark all other schools as wrong, it just shows that there is another way. What do you say "If there is a will there is a way. And sometimes children know better what their parents need. <br /> <br /> This film is a little story not to be missed about the great opportunities in life in the best possible format.
