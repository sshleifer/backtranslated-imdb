Normally I don't like romantic movies, but I love this movie a lot. The story is really moving and the ending is very appropriate. I feel that I really care about many characters in this movie. I feel that I can feel their feelings. While the most romantic films always make me feel detached and bored, this makes me feel completely involved, starting with the Capshaw scene that runs along the beach with Scott to the final scene. I want to evaluate this film 11 out of 10, because I want to give one more point for the final. The acting part is very strong. Kate Capshaw has a good opportunity to showcase her talent. Although I'm not impressed with Scott in "Dead Man on Campus", this film completely changes my point of view towards him. He is so irresistibly charming here. Geraldine McEwan is fantastic as always. <br /> <br /> This film may not be as good, complex, profound or credible as other films that treat the same kind of relationship, like "L" ecole de la chair 'or' Post coitum, animal triste , 'but' The Love Letter 'can still be proud of itself as it sheds a rare and different light on that kind of relationship. And this difference makes this film extremely enjoyable. Being little ambitious and relying on the great charm of small stars, Dreamworks, this time really realize my dream.
