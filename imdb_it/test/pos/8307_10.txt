This film was the second film I saw in the cinema as a child. It scared the hell out of me. So much so that I asked my father if we could leave halfway. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, the only people who come out halfway are those who have good taste in movies. <br /> <br /> However, I still have fond memories of this imperfect masterpiece of horror. Doug McClure and Peter Cushing in the same movie! Great! Monsters made of polypropylene substitute. Scary stuff. A rubber monster is, when you think about it, it's even scarier than a real monster. <br /> <br /> The amazing thing about this movie is how good the score is. Really exciting stuff. <br /> <br /> There is also a lot of prehistoric titles on display. Beautiful.
