Uzumaki is a visually stunning film, and I don't think anyone will be able to discuss it. But, unfortunately, the story is rather flat. <br /> <br /> The film is still a lot of fun. Use his wild style to tell a somewhat non-existent story. The film works almost, based only on characters and style, but in my opinion leaves something to be desired.
