It has been said that Batman Begins in Batman's first film "Okay", but I think it's a horrible exaggeration, because I think the new Batman movie, even bigger than Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, is in contrast with the Tim Burton classics, this is the best of the five. The darkness is wonderful, as is the music and the landscape, creating a Gotham City shrouded in mystery, unlike Batman Begins, where Gotham City is a normal-looking city. The bad guys are fantastic in this movie. You can't literally look away from the penguin and the cat woman. I congratulate Tim Burton for being original with his use of the penguin as a monster, rather than a normal criminal or a clone of the old Batman television show. In Batman Begins we have the scarecrow, whose appearance is not as demanding on the screen as the penguin or the cat woman. The film does not need to focus only on Batman, because we already know its history, and it is the villains we are exploring and trying to understand, and it is they who create the plot, with the penguin running for the mayor and looking for revenge for the desertion of his parents by killing the eldest children of Gotham, a task that fails. Danny Devito offers the best performance ever from a bad superhero in any movie, surpassing even Nicholson's joker. The final scene in which the penguins drag the penguin's dead body into the water is touching and powerful. It is a tragedy that Tim Burton was not allowed to complete his trilogy, since Warner Bros., interesting in marketing appeal, wanted to "lighten" Batman's films. And they got their wish ... unfortunately. Tim Burton was planning to direct the third film, using the Riddler as the villain, without Two-Face and Robin to ruin it, and I'm sure Michael Keaton would have signed. So this is the last great Batman movie. Batman Begins is dark, but boring, boring, ordinary, full of lackluster villains, and a playboy Bruce Wayne. A decent Batman movie, but the best Batman movie ever? Never. Batman Returns holds that crown.
