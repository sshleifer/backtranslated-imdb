Tipping the Velvet came out in the UK only three weeks ago and I already look at the countless letters that invade national newspapers and TV guides, claiming it has a subtle storyline, weak performance and an even weaker script. <br /> <br /> You find me incensed. This is a heresy. <br /> <br /> I would really like to dispel any doubts by congratulating Andrew Davies for allowing Geoffrey Sax to create this wonderful drama of the Sarah Waters novel by amortizing it with such a fantastic script. Congratulations. But I'm afraid I have to change my attitude. <br /> <br /> I saw one of the best TV guides here in the UK (which will remain unnamed) that relentlessly describes Tipping the Velvet as a "lesbian love story". If they are, and I assume they are, trying to promote interest in the film, then this is completely the wrong way to do it (apart from the phrase which is a disappointing and inaccurate description). By saying such a thing, I am or a) dismissing those who would be instinctively rejected by "that" argument or b) attracting a class of people who will only watch to see "a serious girl-on-girl action". Buy a video! Through this demonstration of serious inconsistency, this and other journals are weakening what is a brilliant adaptation of one of the greatest works of recent literature. Tipping the Velvet is a story of love, passion, movement, loss and heartbreak. It's not a lesbian love story. No siree. <br /> <br /> The end result is an elegant affair, with excellent all-round performances (in particular from Stirling, Hawes, Chancellor and May). From a management point of view, it's heady and engaging - sometimes, fast, sometimes not - but it never ceases to be anything less than compelling. Overall, it's polished and well distributed, sex is undertaken with tenderness and delicacy - and although many won't classify it as a true "film", it will remain among my favorites for some time to come.
