Sadness and nostalgia permeate Late Chrysanthemums, a 1954 film by the Japanese author Mikio Naruse, which is now going through a retrospective of his very long films not available thanks to James Quandt of Cinematheque Ontario and The Japan Foundation. Based on three stories by Fumiko Hayashi, Late Chrysanthemums tells the story of four retired middle-aged geisha whose lives have become full of disappointment and regret. The performances are uniformly exceptional, in particular that of Haruko Sugimura, who starred in the films of Ozu, Late Spring, Floating Weeds and Tokyo Story, among others. Sugimura plays Kin, a former Geisha who has no children and lives alone with her young maid who can't speak. <br /> <br /> She became cynical about men and turned her attention to money, especially real estate speculation and lending money to her friends, Nobu (Sadako Sawamura), Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Tomi (Yuko Mochizuki), all ex geisha. Kin's friends live in miserable circumstances and complain about how Kin became greedy and Tomi spends a lot of time playing to try to make ends meet. Both Tomi and Tamae are losing their children. Tamae's son is going to work in the coal mines in Hokkaido, and Tomi's daughter has decided to accept a marriage proposal from an older man. Both resist the change in their circumstances but come to accept it as inevitable. <br /> <br /> Two male friends visit Kin, Seki, a former lover with whom he had contemplated a double suicide, and Tabe (Ken Uehara), another lover who can't wait to see her again after many years. His mood is optimistic, but soon turns into resentment when he finds out that the two men are only interested in borrowing money. Naruse cuts between two extended sequences without interruption while Kin confronts Tabe and Tomi and Tamae console each other for the loss of their children. The dialogue is extremely natural and the characters are women of strength who, although their future does not seem brilliant, refuse to see themselves simply as victims. Late chrysanthemums have the simplicity, humor and stoic acceptance of life in Ozu's films and it is a bitter-sweet reminder of the slow passing of time and the comfort that memory and company can bring along the way.
