Clint Eastwood plays a wounded Union soldier found by a girl from a Confederate college and is greeted and hospitalized in health rather than handed over to Confederate soldiers. It seems that folk women in this place have ulterior motives. Geraldine Paige, the director, justifies the fact of not turning him into the Confederacy and even sells him as his cousin. Obviously when the man manages to feel better he becomes rather the man of the lady and is practically making the round, but when he is caught he is really caught, in fact so much his leg is severed, but it is for his own good, obviously, not for punishment. Things go a little further, even if some women don't get what they want. I haven't seen it for years and it still has some chills that in today's standards it's still pretty strange. Not typical Eastwood. If you haven't seen it, it's worth seeing. 8 out of 10.
