The director and author Jean-Pierre Rappenau was 8 years old during the spring of 1940 when the Third French Republic disintegrated within a few weeks. It was a time, he says, when "all the adults were a little crazy". He and the production staff carefully and meticulously recreated that world in a film in which all the characters are essentially fictitious. The structure, a classic farce, is ideal for the period as more weft lines close and intersect only to come together in a logical satisfactory conclusion. The peg for this plot is Frederic, played by the brilliant newcomer Gregory Derangere, who is fully capable of acting alongside Adjani, Depardieu and Ledoyen. The real strength of the film is in its supporting performances. M. Rappeneau interpreted the film exquisitely with actors who offered ideas for action and dialogue and who know and demonstrate that it is possible to fully realize a character with only two short sentences of dialogue. Although not as influential as Renoir's "Rules of the Game", "Bon Voyage" certainly deserves to be a complement to that classic. Even if it requires a lot of the public, it gives much back. One of his requests is tolerance for a certain shyness and deviation from the exact genre we are looking at: a criminal melodrama, no, a spy thriller, ah, a romantic comedy. I recommend it to friends cinemaphile. Just be sure to let them discover for themselves that this is a romantic comedy.
