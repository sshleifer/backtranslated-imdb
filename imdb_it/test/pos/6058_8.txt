THE D.I. (4 outta 5 stars) Wow, I certainly didn't expect to enjoy this movie as much as I did. I had never heard of it until I saw him sitting in the discount video one day. I imagined that Jack Webb who played an army instructor could be a good awakening, but I thought the drama would have paled in comparison to the recent movie D.I.s, played in "Full Metal Jacket" or "An Officer and a Gentleman". Boy, I was wrong. This is probably the best work Webb has ever done ... far better than his one-note "Dragnet" performances. The delivery of his tough dialogue is simply brilliant ... made with his monotonous patented deadpan and yet you * know * that the boy means every word of it. The story might seem a bit disgusting compared to the more gritty military films that followed, but I still found the film fascinating and compelling. Even a completely useless musical interlude in a military disco made me mad. Does anyone know where I can get a copy of that amazing Ray Coniff song "If'n You Do Not, Somebody Else Will"? Webb plays the toughest drill instructor ever ... and he is under pressure to give the go-ahead for the private Owen outrage, but, wow, see a man buried somewhere in that sissyboy and kick him out and scream ! Big things!
