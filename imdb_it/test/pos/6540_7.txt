Whenever this film is mentioned, the discussion usually starts and ends with the wonderful collection of cars and drag-and-drop scenes, the sometimes eclectic characters that populate the film around the three central characters are often overlooked <br /> <br / > A character that stands out is Rebel played by the great veteran Australian actor Max Cullen. Rebel is a blind drag racer, who touches the hero and his group in the middle of the night because he doesn't use any lighthouse. <br /> <br /> In the back story we find out that Rebel is the foreman of the road racing cars, and he and his wife seem stuck in a 50s time warp. Rebel continues to play a small but fundamental role in Mike's teaching, played by Terry Serio, the almost spiritual truth about street drag racing. It's not the speed, the reaction times that make a great runner. It's the one that feels the best car that will become the biggest <br /> <br /> This is the best example that Rebel explains to Mike after a test drive "You've had all the agony, just the style missing" <br / > <br /> Graham Bond, is another well-credited actor who lends his talent as a corrupt cop trying to get into some financial action generated by road racing. The clash between Bond and Fox played by Richard Moir adds tension to the story. Bond not only expects results, but also Fox to cash in on the racing business <br /> <br /> For most of the film Fox shows a manipulative and evil side, but in the climax he presents a sense of honor that transforms the last minutes in an extremely tense and memorable ending. It's almost as if the film was refocusing its true intentions, to show us the culture of road racing rather than people's daily activities <br /> <br /> One of the film's main complaints is the script. Although it's nothing exciting, I think the complete lack of chemistry between Mikes's girlfriend played by Deborah Conway and her mechanic played by Vangelis Mourikis has more to do with the problem. Every scene in which these two interact should have been cut off. Finally, as for the actors, Kristoffer Greaves, who plays a deaf and paralyzed member of Fox's smallest circle, is played by a truly exceptional performance. His past history has never been explored, he was injured in a race, born that way, what is it that Fox considers useful to keep it around <br /> <br /> The reality of the film is simple, yes it's about street racing and the culture behind it. When the cars fly and the action sequences are in motion, it's the only time that director John Clark and his writer Barry Tomblin seem really comfortable with what they're doing. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for an in-depth exploration of human relationships, moments of life that define drama, then this film is not for you. If your pulse throbs at the thought of a blown Chevr 57 or the iconic GTO Phase 3 exploding in the streets of Sydney, then you won't find much better than this movie
