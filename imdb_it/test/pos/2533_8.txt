When it was released in the early 1980s, Pixote brought the problems of young delinquents and the impact of this on Brazilian society into Brazilian society. I can't watch the movie right now, because I was too young, but now I had a chance and watched it a few days ago. It is a very brutal film, but everything is absolutely true and sad. pixote is the name of a 12-year-old boy who lives in the streets and survives on minor crimes; he stays for a while in a detention house, and when he leaves, he continues to plan robberies with other sandwiches and a prostitute, played by Marilia Pera. the boy is still a marijuana addict and sniffs the glue with other teenagers, to forget his sad reality. image quality is not the best, but the film is totally realistic about Brazilian problems and must be seen and admired.
