"Nuovomondo" was a great experience. Many filmmakers tell their stories largely through dialogue. Emanuele Crialese directs his very visually guided film. For everything he wants to say, he finds powerful images that can stand on their own. Therefore, he understands the film as a medium that mainly tells his stories about the images on the screen. In particular, European cinema is often very much driven by dialogue (and many of the young American-American directors are strongly influenced by it). The opposite attitude of Crialese was really the point that made this film special for me. It also has a very interesting topic enclosed in a rather unusual story and told with humor. Vincenzo Amato is exceptional as head of the Salvatore family, as is the extraordinary Charlotte Gainsbourg, which I like to watch in each of his films. There are many great sequences in this film. Just to choose one: when the ship leaves Italy and people just watch in silence. This scene is great, especially considering the pop cultural references that accompany it (Titanic!).
