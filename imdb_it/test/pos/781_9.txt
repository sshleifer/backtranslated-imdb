I saw him tonight with moderate expectations - if Tartan's films have picked up and are releasing, that's generally a good sign, but I'm usually not a fan of Julie Walters, who generally doesn't like his comic roles ( I'm sorry for the fans, but it's personal - I just don't find it funny in the comedy). <br /> <br /> However it was great - a great performance by everyone, but Grint and Walters are great! A lot of laughs, lots of pathos, great timing and a wonderfully stimulated film - such a film would not normally be something I would expect to appreciate so much, but I can't recommend it enough - and watch Rupert Grint as mature in a fine actor well.
