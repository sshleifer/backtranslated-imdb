RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR STEALER, in my opinion, is an excellent masterpiece. I felt hot and irritated when Rainbow Brite (Bettina's voice) and Krys (the voice of David Mendenhall) left to take revenge on the princess (Rhonad Aldrich's voice). If you ask me, the princess was absolutely bitchy and diabolical. For me, he deserved to have Rainbow Brite and Krys looking for revenge on him. However, I liked his castle, as well as the rest of the context. Also, I thought that Lurky (voiec of Pat Fraley) and Murky (voiec of Peter Cullen) were diabolical. Before concluding, I would like to say that everyone was perfectly expressed, the management was impeccable and Disney was very successful. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent masterpiece to all those who have not seen it, especially the hardcore TV series fans. I guarantee you will like it.
