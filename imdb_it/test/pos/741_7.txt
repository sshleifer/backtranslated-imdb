The dott. Stephens (Michael Harvey), head of a serious institution of insufficient staff for the mad, undertakes a 'progressive' approach towards the treatment of his patients, allowing even his mad to complete the freedom of the building, day and night; he pays the price for his forward thinking, however, when he rather stupidly prescribes to cut the wood with an ax as therapy for one of his patients and consequently he exchanges the neck for a trunk (he just needs it to not suggest the basket weaving). /> <br /> Shortly after this tragic accident, Nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the hospital to assume the position of assistant of the doctor and discovers that the structure is now managed by the much more severe Dr. Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick). Although he is not aware of his late predecessor's decision to hire Ms Beale and is not particularly keen on hiring new staff, Dr. Masters agrees to let the beautiful nurse begin work, but after several excruciating hospital experiences, Charlotte starts to wonder if it could have been better if she was rejected. <br /> <br /> It doesn't take a genius to figure out what's really going on in the hospital, the fact that the "crazy took the place of the madhouse" is a premise that should be familiar to the most experienced horror fans, but SF Brownrigg's Do not Look In The Basement still proves to be a fun piece of fun thanks to its well-defined collection of nutters: lobotomised, pop sucks popsicles (Bill McGhee); Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross), who continually mumbles sentences in the classroom; old Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams), who recites the creepy poetry of William Allingham The Fairies and warns Charlotte of imminent fate; the cackling Danny (Jessie Kirby), who enjoys teasing other patients; Harriet (Camilla Carr), who thinks her doll is a real child; Army Nut Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin); and above all, Allyson King (Betty Chandler), whose rejection by a series of men left her with a lust for love (that is, she tries to skip any man who approaches her). <br /> <br /> This series of convincingly crazy characters, plus a bit of blood and nudity, a reasonable direction from Brownrigg (who also gave us the impressive white horror of the Scum of the Earth garbage) , and a breakthrough from the Playboy covergirl Holotik, everyone goes to run otherwise quite predictable, cheap piece of exploitation in a very observable psycho shocker.
