This seemed to me a lackluster film that betrays a limited budget with bad cinematography and not much of an editing job. It may be interesting for those who know something about submarines during the World War II era, but I recommend that everyone else pay attention. Many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak. The story of the men who were called back into service during a brief leave seems quite realistic, but there is no real rhythm or tension in history. I also had a hard time figuring out what the actors were saying, partly because of some strong English accents and perhaps some due to less sound recording work. I give this a 55/100. Most people will want to "steer" clear.
