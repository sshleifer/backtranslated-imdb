No, it's not Citizen Kane. But would you expect it to be with a name like "Meatballs"? It is the best film of the summer camp of all the films of the summer camp. Does anyone quote "Little Darlings" line by line? Or "Whitewater Summer"? <br /> <br /> This is just one of those films that came to mind when I was in junior high and I stayed with me for all these years. Every time I feel like a geek, I mumble "Space Spat. Spacing Space" Or when we're hiking in the woods, I tell my husband, "I'm Wudy from Wabbit". (He does not understand). "It just doesn't matter, it just doesn't matter." I mean, this stuff is classic! <br /> <br /> Disappointed from the DVD, though. I wish there were special features, maybe a comment or a making-of. But the film itself is a perfect snapshot of a teenager's life in the late 1970s. Maybe not my life ... You can't help but want to run in the woods with short shorts and high socks to feathered hair every time you see this movie.
