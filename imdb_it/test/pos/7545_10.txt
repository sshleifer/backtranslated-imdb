This brilliant hilarious British comedy about the antics of school girls is a neglected gem. The significant question is where is the public? The film is rated 10 by most voters, but how many voters are they? They no longer make comedies like this because the films are not distributed or seen. I would never miss the chance to see this old classical art house again. But where are the art houses?
