I am fortunate to have a good quality copy of my VHS on DVD, so now I can watch it over and over again. The characters are so well played that I can't find any defects in any aspect of the casting. OK, so there are some differences from the book, but the old cliche of love that wins everything is so strongly interpreted that it makes no difference. The reality of living in the rural countryside of the beginning of the 19th century in England is magnificently contrasted by the change of the seasons, from the biting winter to the glorious summer days and this is reflected in the different characters, from the overbearing father of Prue to the all-embracing love of Kester . A story that changed my life.
