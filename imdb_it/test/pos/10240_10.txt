It is interesting to see what people think of this film, since it is, in fact, quite unique (although it bears some of Clive Barker's trademarks). Although it might seem a bit cynical to say, the film is intricate enough to divert those who need standard and layered Hollywood hooks, so that if you expect food, you'll see a normal monster with a lot of monsters and a plot disconnected. <br /> <br /> Those who need a linear, specific and inattentive plot will hate this film, because the story lies, as in the novella, partially between the lines, or in this case, partially off screen, in the comments and in the imagination. <br /> <br /> Another possible hang-up is the ending, which I can say, without ruining it, that is not entirely good and not entirely bad. In fact, it is not at all completely defined, which sends some people to a tantrum for not having known what happened, but for me and for many others, I'm sure, it adds another dimension to the plot - the size of the speculation, and, moreover, the point where the great perturbation has a tendency to cause ripples that extend far enough. <br /> <br /> There is certainly a moral here, but rather different than the standard in-your-face-at-the-end-of-the-movie Hollywood standard. Summing up that morality up is simple, even if it is not exactly what is simply shown; prejudice and the human tendency to hate the different. <br /> <br /> I love this film, although, as many reviewers have noted, the expressions of the actors (except David Cronenberg, who looks wonderful) are rather tacky. I'm not sure they are to blame for their ramshackle appearance and lack of depth, however, as these are common problems in converting literature into a script. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is a great movie, as long as you don't expect it to be a standard horror movie.
