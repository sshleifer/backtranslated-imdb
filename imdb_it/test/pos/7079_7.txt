I loved this movie. To be very honest, the film starts very slowly, and none of the characters is terribly understanding. This continues for half the film. <br /> <br /> But, if you are patient, you will be greatly rewarded. What in the first half of the film lacks development and / or understanding of the character is adequately compensated in the second half. It's a bit like riding a roller coaster: a slow, uphill climb, to be tackled, and then speed, twists and some surprises. <br /> <br /> As usual, Meryl Streep is wonderful. She is the best actress of our time. William Hurt is good, even if he has some wood in points. Renee Zellweger does a great job proving that her performance in Jerry McGuire was not a fluke.
