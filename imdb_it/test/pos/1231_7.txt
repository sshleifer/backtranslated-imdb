Travis (James Franco) is a young man who is driving a train for work (we assume) that leaves his beloved phone behind. He is captured by a prostitute, Terri (Rachel Miner), and when he goes to his city to pick it up, there are a series of events that will surely remain with him forever. <br /> <br /> Both characters have barriers they have put in place to defend themselves from communication. But despite their facades, it is obvious that both are anxious to reject them. In total there are about 30 spoken lines, but from the way James Franco and Rachel Miner use their faces you could even turn off the volume, words are not necessary. A scene to watch is Terri looking at herself in the mirror. You can simply feel his despair permeating the room. <br /> <br /> But the film is not perfect. It's mostly filmed using hand-held cameras, which is a bit of a distraction. Mainly due to the acting of Franco and Miner and photography, the defects of the script do not stand out so much. However, sometimes it seems that history does not really know where it wants to go. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is the kind of movie that really stays with you for a long time after watching it. An hour after seeing it, you're still "what-if" you like on behalf of certain characters. It's not flawless, but it leaves you even more, wanting at least 4 times more.
