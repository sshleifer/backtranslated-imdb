Indeed safer. Hitchcock is the pervert of all time in cinema; however, we all know that his perversions are ours too, so we forgive him. And we not only forgive him, but we applaud his clever way of inviting us for an unforgettable train journey. I saw Hitch's 1953, I Confess, a week before this, and I put them both in the same category as part of its brands. These marks resided in his genius by questioning and palpating his artistic veins that shed psychological drops of blood on the viewer without leaving spots of guilt, instead the very subtle awareness of trying ashame. <br /> <br /> The pen is always more powerful than the Sword and Hitch wrote firmly the most questionable questions with his wrist, and holding his hands firmly, he kept cameras that always reflect people's thirst for blood (most part of the humans), otherwise the comedy would not be mostly tragic, and people laugh would not be so complex. <br /> <br /> Mixing all the dark elements of "high society", with a rich psychopath Bruno, and an ambitious tennis player you want to be a politician, Guy, the story is one of the very well built and led by Hitch, inspiring many directors, not only with his plot, but with deceptive images that cause dark smiles and happy nightmares. <br /> <br /> Barely perfect!
