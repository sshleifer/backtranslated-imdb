The Aristorcats is a hilarious movie that not many people have seen. Clearly not many, because it has only 6.8. There is nothing wrong with this. It is my favorite of the Disney classics, who have already made tons of fantastic movies. Like Beauty and the Beast, Snow White and Peter Pan. The reason why The Aristorcats is so high on my list is because of how fun the movie is. I hate to say this, but I don't blame Edgar for what he does. I would probably have taken them too. I would be devastated by an old bag with which I had worked for so many years that he decided to give his will to cats. I would have killed them too. I don't even like cats, so I don't care. I think The Aristorcats is so fun and cute. There are many hilarious characters, like Edgar. The Aristorcats is my favorite of the Disney classics, and this is definitive. The Cat's out of the bag. <br /> <br /> The Aristorcats: **** / ****
