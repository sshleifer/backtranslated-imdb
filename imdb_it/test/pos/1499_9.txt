Most of Chaplin's most famous films are his feature films. And, I assume most people have seen at most only a few clips of him from his pre-feature films when he starred in dozens and dozens of comic short films. This is really a pity, as some wonderful short films are waiting to be discovered by the world in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> If anyone watches this movie they have an excellent opportunity to see some of Chaplin's best short films because Chaplin himself chose these three short films and put them together with a little narrative to make this 1959. This is fantastic for several reasons. First, in Chaplin's early films from 1914 to 1915, his character from Little Tramp is still in his early incarnations or is completely absent. Moreover, even when he is there, he was often petty and self-centered, something very foreign to the Little Tramp we learned to love. Second, because the short films chosen were in excellent condition, if you watch this film you will not have to worry about watching scratchy movies with gaps and lousy musical accompaniment that does not fit the action (a common problem). /> <br /> So, to take a look at Chaplin's shorts at their best, give this film a chance. He is sure to provide you with excellent laughs.
