The second in the trilogy by Cohen's director of the Second World War comedies (the others are: "Be part of death and part" and "Adolf Hitler - My part in his downfall") is a film version of the long series (and much beloved) of the BBC comedy. Like most television program transfers, this film suffers from an absence of plot and is more a collection of sketches. Some of which work better than others, such as the scene where a senior army officer floats along a river is a memorable and surreal moment. <br /> <br /> The joy of this film is the representation of a past that probably never existed and an England that is defined by the picturesque countryside and the possibility it offers to see veterans of scene-stealers like John Le Mesurier who they have their most important film roles. Arthur Lowe is superb as Captain Mainwaring, a bungler who, when the chips are down, shows great courage and saves the day (the highlight is probably the best moment of the character). <br /> <br /> Episodes of the television series are obviously more fun but as an introduction to a British legend, you can't find anything better.
