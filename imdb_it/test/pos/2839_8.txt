Nurse Betty was certainly one of the most creative films that has been published recently. It was fun, but it also had many moving moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear and the rest of the cast have made their characters incredibly weird seem real. History has had such a turning point that it has made it incredibly enjoyable to watch. If you're sick of the recent formula films, see Nurse Betty for something completely different. Go see this movie in the theater or at least rent it when it comes out!
