H.O.T.S. is the proof that once, the film industry said "F-OFF" to censorship, and made films with whatever they wanted! In today's world, this film would be too "exaggerated" and "extreme" for it to be found anywhere but behind a velvet curtain. Although, BestBuy had several copies on their $ 5.99 rack (in case anyone wanted to get a copy)! The film has been brilliant in its own way, as it has mixed humor in a T & A laden Playboy Playmates movie! Unlike most skin films, it had a plot. This, however, is not exactly the reason why you look at H.O.T.S. <br /> <br /> H.O.T.S. is a university film that reminds me of the films of The revenge of the nerds, in the sense that it takes a group of "normal people" and puts them against the rich preppy that most people can't stand! The only difference is that the "Nerds" in this movie have a much better shot to fuck! I've noticed that there are some people who would vote this movie down, and to me it's ignorant! Obviously this is not intended to win Oscars or break the barriers in the film. If you are looking for this, then look at what critics choose for you! You have to appreciate the fact that this movie actually has a funny plot, decent acting (mostly given to the genre), and a lot of girls getting naked! H.O.T.S. is one of those movies that you watch to distract you from today's problems and everyday stress, and instead you laugh and have fun! If you are looking for a fun university-based movie that has enough skin to turn a pink Miata scale, then you should really take a look at H.O.T.S.
