I first saw this movie by accident when I was visiting my uncle in Arizona about 3 1/2 years ago. VHS printing was a bit faded, but I was very obsessed with what I had seen. Does it all make sense? Well, honestly, no, it wasn't like that. However, this is a film that requires more than a vision to understand all its aspects. The beautifully tragic soundtrack haunted me and the bizarre images have left an imprint. <br /> <br /> Well, when I found out that Anchor Bay had posted this weirdness on DVD, I immediately picked it up. I really enjoyed the transfer, even though I felt the extras rather lacking. Although the film is about the characters of "O" and Sir Stephen, it has nothing to do with Pauline Reage's original novel or the 1974 movie The Story of O. However, the film pays attention to artistic details and symbolism of an almost mystical type. "O" decides to prostitute himself for Sir Stephen in the violent twenties of Hong Kong. His mission is to demonstrate his infinite devotion and love for his master by giving his body to other men. Of course, Sir Stephen enjoys looking at her during her unpleasant sexual escapades and also finds herself a lover. However, the tables are turned when "O" actually finds a kind of love with a young male admirer. Suddenly, Sir Stephen feels the threat ... <br /> <br /> I feel that the deep meaning of the film (including the soundtrack and art direction) really makes this film a classic. The viewer was introduced not only to the lives and past of the brothel companions of "O", but also the tumult of the Hong Kong twenties was explored. As in the political context, all prostitutes need to belong. No one is happy in the film, even if they believe they are. (However, "O" finds a sense of happiness with his young admirer). A prostitute remembers in tears how her father behaved like a dog when she was drunk, naturally leading to a fetish for her clients to behave like a dog. Another older prostitute is obsessed with her acting history. He can't let that vision go. He treats his clients as co-stars and even swears to hear a piano in the river. <br /> <br /> As for "O", he has a flashback on his father who leaves her in a circle of chalk. When he leaves, he feels a sense of abandonment. Of course, in that same flashback Kinski suddenly becomes his father. I was very, very disturbed by this image. I really tried for "O" at this point in the movie. He almost never smiles and this scene really explains why. His fear of abandonment is so great that he sees Sir Stephen as his father and satisfies his every obscene request in the hope of experiencing his love. <br /> <br /> Another curious aspect of the film is the child (who eventually ages) who sells good luck in a box. He is a very casual character, but somehow he adds to the sense of loss and emptiness in the film. At one point, the director even uses painted cardboard figures to represent people. Now, if this is not symbolism for you! (Laugh) <br /> <br /> All in all, I love this movie. I feel it is a very deep and moving experience. It has erotic scenes, but the scenes are not meant to awaken. Like the lives of the characters, the sexual acts are empty. They are movements, but lack sensitivity and tenderness. (Once again, the only tender scene is between "O" and the young). "O" believes he is in love and that lowering is an honor, but in the end he finds he has choices. She too can be her own person and pursuing her happiness, however, she also has the chance to remain in that circle that her father designed. The director leaves many questions unanswered, but some things do not need answers. The viewer will make the judgment that works for them. <br /> <br /> I must say that I would like a special edition of this DVD to come out with a comment to the director. I think it would be fascinating to hear your opinion on the film and its message years later. It is a pity that the soundtrack was never published. This film has a really scary and heartbreaking score. There is something in the persistent voice that makes me shudder. I can really feel the sense of loneliness in the film simply by listening to the music.
