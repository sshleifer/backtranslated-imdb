The disturbing demons "The Gentlemen" capture the voice of the people of Sunnydale, to steal human hearts without screaming. Giles finds that, according to legend, if a lady screams, the creatures will be destroyed, but Buffy and her friends, including Riley, must fight wordless monsters. <br /> <br /> "Silence" is certainly the best episode of Buffy's fourth season so far. Having a lot of humor and funny situations, I loved it. Spike is hilarious, the love story between Xander and Anya is fantastic, but in the end I loved the "intense" dialogue between Buffy and Riley. The Gothic scenery of the final battle against "The Gentlemen" recalls the environment of "Dark City". My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "SilÃªncio" ("Silence")
