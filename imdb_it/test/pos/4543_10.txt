For Chris Farley fans, this is probably his best film. David Spade plays the perfect cynical and sarcastic yin with Farley's "Baby Huey" yang. Farley gets traits of comic genius in his monologues, like "Let's say you're driving down the road with your family ..." a little, the "Jo-Jo the Idiot Circus Boy with a rather new pet, (his possible sale) "speech, or the sale of brake pads" Glue-sniffing Guarantee fairy ". The sloppy moments in the film contrast sharply with the imitations of Farley and Spade. Even after many visions, it's still fun to see Farley pouring everything he has into the role. "Richard, what is happening to me?!?!"
