My main criticism is simply that it is not long enough or detailed enough. I would have liked to see more of everything: the construction of the ship, the engineering, the training, the first elevator in orbit, the preparations for the departure, the injection of Venus Orbital, everything. I would have liked to see more of the first stage, Venus to Earth, instead of compressing it like a 10th company bus. In fact, I would have liked to see a series on the Earth Story scale made of this, with a whole hour dedicated to each planet and maybe another one to the ring around the Sun. As it was, I was hungry. On the other hand, I understand the budgets and attention of the spectators. <br /> <br /> Re science: we are honest about the speed of light time-lag: they mentioned at the beginning that it was a delay in conversations, but they let this evaporate once they reached the outer planets. A sort of conversation had to be presented to the spectators, and we must assume that the delay was modified to make it palatable; so we can't complain. But zero for noisy spaceships. The only movie in which the spaceships make no noise was Kubrick's 2001, and even then it popped up using the sound of the crew breathing in their helmets - which * was * quite effective. I wish the creators of Space Odyssey had realized how dismal the sight of huge rocket engines exploding in absolute silence was, but alas, Pegasus emits the same rumble as any other cardboard spaceship in any SciFi cartoon. <Br /> <br /> But the rest of the science was excellent. No complaints, in fact praise for highlighting radiation problems. I only hope that having made this film does not discourage the BBC from making a really detailed version, but I suppose it's not for next week or next year ...
