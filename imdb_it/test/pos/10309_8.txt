I saw Bandit Queen in 2005, over a decade after it was debated in India. The language, the harsh treatment and the natural acting (of a relatively unknown cast at the time) may have been even more shocking at that time for an Indian population that is more familiar with fantasy cinema. The film, the cast and Shekhar Kapoor deserve recognition for the revolutionary effort. <br /> <br /> The plot is not very different from a typical revenge drama done in various forms in India. In reality, there have been several fictitious accounts of this particular story. The reason this emerges is that it is supposed to be a first-person account of someone who actually went through all of this, and much more that has no place on the screen, and survived to tell the story. Survived long enough to see his story turned into a movie, at least. Phoolan Devi did not live long after he was released from prison in 1994. <br /> <br /> The film marks several points. Cinematography is brilliant. The music is suitable. The cast, many of which have become more familiar names later, is very good. But the script is irregular. Things move too quickly and jerkily sometimes. It's understandable, though, because there are too many wires that need to be tied together to make everything cohesive. Or maybe I heard it because I read Mala Sen's book, which is a more detailed and better book, although obviously not as shocking as the visual story of Phoolan Devi's travails, and which is supposed to be a major source of the film . <br /> <br /> There are also some factual ambiguities. According to Phoolan Devi, she was not present when the Behmai massacre occurred, and although she claimed to be the account dictated by Phoolan herself, she is shown to participate, and in fact to start, in the massacre. Then the final scene in which Phoolan surrenders proves that he touched the Prime Minister's feet, while in reality he had surrendered to a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi. Only symbolic value, but it shows that Phoolan did not want to show servitude to a living and ordinary person. It would have been nice to show the Prime Minister that he had some resemblance to Arjun Singh, which many remember was the CM of Madhya Pradesh. <br /> <br /> But these are minor flaws in this eminently well-made film, a rare gem to emerge from the traditional Indian film industry, made by a man who was previously best known for the last Masala film of the years 80 - Mr India.
