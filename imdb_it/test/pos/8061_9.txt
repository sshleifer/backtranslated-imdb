I read "Anne Frank: A Girl's Diary" when I was in high school, and found myself completely absorbed in her story, and also in the Broadway drama of her life in the Secret Annex. <br /> <However, I am a bit perplexed about how people perceived her diary and about her as a person, seeing her as a little saint or having a message of hope for the world. I don't think it was the original intention of his diary. He wrote it mostly for himself, even though he did some rigorous rewrites before the occupants of the Secret Annexe were betrayed, intending to publish it someday. <br /> <br /> But I never saw her as a saint or as a messenger of hope ... but as a very talented writer who could express her thoughts very well and in a very funny way in a diary . No doubt she was a very engaging writer and possessed an extraordinary talent in expressing herself fully with words. You knew her really well through her diary. But the importance of his diary lies in the fact that it is a testament and an important historical document of the proof that the Holocaust happened. <br /> <br /> He also brought the tragedy of the Holocaust closer to home, to lose someone to whom we could put a familiar face and personality, at such a young age ... having literally ripped off his young life from her and the other occupants who were killed in the Holocaust. It is a fierce accusation of the systematic murder of the Nazis of over 6 million Jews, and this should not be forgotten. <br /> <br /> But it is sad for me that his diary is so misinterpreted as something more. When I look for hope, I have the Bible ... the first most widely read non-fiction book in the world. God's words in the Bible are eternal ... but Anne's diary is a diary of a girl in extraordinary circumstances, and that's it. He is not a person to worship or idolize, because he was a normal girl with many faults, who possessed an incredible talent as a writer and who died 15 years after rooting in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. She was a victim of the Holocaust and, as this excellent documentary so vividly documented, was Hitler's most famous victim. <br /> <br /> In addition to the story of Anne Frank ... the stories of her family and friends and Holocaust survivors were compelling, vivid and powerful. I particularly liked the testimony of Miep Gies and I am surprised that she is still strong and alive today. The testimony of Hannah Goslar was also very interesting. And I also enjoyed listening to Otto Frank. But I also agree that the moving image of the girl with dark hair and big, familiar eyes eventually was particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> Another thing about the Holocaust that I don't agree with the documentary ... is that I don't think it was just a matter of discrimination ... but rather something deeper and deeper, and that was just an act of pure evil. Pure wickedness. Nothing but pure evil. <br /> <br /> Excellent documentary of Anne Frank and the Holocaust that should be seen.
