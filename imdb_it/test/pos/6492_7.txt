In August Days / Dies d'agost Marc Recha gave us a road movie in a Catalan documentary style, full of sun, which is mostly a tortuous impromptu meditation on brotherhood and the claim of the dead. The beautiful at times on a large scale, 35 mm full of atmosphere. the images of the landscape, the beautiful soundtrack and the narration in the Catalan language are enchanting as a mood mood, if you are satisfied with a trajectory that does not have much momentum and does not lead anywhere in particular. Director Marc Recha and his non-identical twin David are the stars and the story is voiced by his younger sister. Marc had studied the life of Ramon Barnils (1940-2001), a socialist publisher who had been a family friend. He felt he was saturated with information and had to take a break. The break turned into this film, which tries to capture the atmosphere of interviews with Barnil's associates, thoughts about the Spanish civil war, the season of drought they were experiencing, the harsh landscape, the mutual affection of the Recha brothers , swim and tanned nakedness and any character or story they encountered while camping out of their van. This leads to the search for a giant catfish and the temporary disappearance of one of the brothers. Eventually David has to go back to Barcelona to be with his daughter and Marc has to go back to his project, and it ends there. I found it fascinating to listen to an extended narrative in the Catalan language with its mixture of Spanish and French words (perhaps related to Provencal?). This is not an important film but it requires attention and makes sense as a choice of the film festival with its clean visual and auditory beauty and its way of playing with genres and of merging autobiography with fiction and documentary in a new and stimulating way. <br /> <br /> An official selection of the 2006 New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center.
