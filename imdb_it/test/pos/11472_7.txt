You can't watch this movie for a history lesson. This was the first I had heard of the Ma Barker saga, but I knew almost immediately that the facts were far away. And with a little Internet research I realized that I was obviously right. But Barker is definitely not the sexy, calculating woman that the film portrays about her, and apparently has not orchestrated all the bank robbery schemes, kiddnappings and murders committed by his criminal boys. <br /> <br /> But don't expect a brilliant criminal drama. The script and the acting are adequate, the shootings are excessive and mostly unrealistic, and there is a very laughable slow-motion death scene. So why did I give a 7 out of 10? <br /> <br /> Because it was damn funny. Firefights are fun to watch, but some deeper themes emerge between them. The film has a strong sense of intimidation of the ego among the cast of alpha males, each of which has its own program. And I appreciate the minimal use of swear words for the period. The screenplays are fantastic, reproducing a convincing era of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> So watch this movie as if you were a cult movie, and take excessive bloody and ruthlessness in tune with the bad and serious comments of the FBI who want to break down the Barkers at any cost. In other words, don't take it too seriously, have fun with it. And if you like it, you'll love Serial Mom.
