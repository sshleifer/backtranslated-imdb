I've never seen a show with so much history, mystery, suspense and strong excitement. Orzo I watch TV more but I own every season of this show and it's incredible. each episode is extremely well played, written and traced. towards the end of the show I felt that the stories were getting too far-fetched to be in a prison, but the actors took it away. The soprano sucks huge compared to OZ. in fact, any show that is on a cable network, HBO or not just can't keep a candle to OZ. I wish he would come back for another season. if that happened, they'd probably kill all the characters on the show, but hey, we all have to go sooner or later. as for the characters, I'd say that O'Reily and Alverez were my favorites. both were hardley in a scene together, but their individual stories I thought were the strongest of all, except Beechers, of course, but still ... anyway, best show ever, best network ever, some of the best actors ever, PERIOD!
