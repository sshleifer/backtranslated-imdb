Closet Land is a fantastic and terrifying film. It contains only two actors in a single set, but it never loses your attention. The scenography is imaginative and disturbing, the staging of the scenes keeps your attention, at the same time adding your sense of confusion and terror. The acting is exceptional, with Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe having the task of bringing every scene. <br /> <br /> I saw this film for the first time in 1991, immediately after it was released on video. He didn't play in the theaters where I lived; not surprising, given its political content. It should be seen, though. It is characterized by a brilliant staging of torture and interrogation techniques used by repressive societies to instill fear and obedience in its citizens. The country is never mentioned, which makes it even more surprising. It could be anywhere; East, West, 3rd World, 1st World. Illustrates what happens when a small group of people decide what is best for everyone; when the government becomes the head of the citizens, rather than the servant. <br /> <br /> Madeleine Stowe is an author of children who was dragged out of her bed during the night and subjected to terror and torture. He finds himself in a room with Alan Rickman, a seemingly pleasant official. At first it seems a horrible mistake and she is free to go; but fear keeps it and terror intensifies. It is increasingly subjected to physical and mental torture. The interrogator uses sensory deprivation, temporal manipulation, confusion, auditory manipulation, role play and distorted logic to bring down the author. She is humiliated and angry, forced to endure strenuous body positions, deprived of food and water. <br /> <br /> Through all this, she refuses to give up; do what the interrogator asks. She is told that everything will end if she only signs a confession. A simple little act. She refuses. Through all this, it employs defense mechanisms that have developed since childhood. It is slowly revealed that she was a victim of sexual abuse in childhood. To survive, he developed fantastic worlds and characters that took her away from the abuse. These mechanisms allow her to transcend her torture and overturn the tables on her interrogator. He begins to attack his own convictions and profession, forcing him to examine his life and his motivations. In the end, she is free because she maintains freedom of thought. The interrogator is the one trapped by the state. <br /> <br /> This film was made during the apogee of the cold war, apartheid, and at a time when the crimes of many governments around the world made headlines every day. It is even more appropriate in a world where "enemy combatants" are held and questioned in secret prisons, denied legal rights or advice; where "ethnic cleansing" lays waste on entire societies and humanitarian aid is denied. It shows that the individual can oppose the state or other oppressors by refusing to give in to fear and terror.
