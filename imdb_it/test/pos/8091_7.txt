Great comedy by Charlie Chaplin. I've seen Chaplin's 4 main films (Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times and The Great Dictator), and I think it's easily the most fun of the four. This film made me laugh more than anyone else I've ever seen. From the opening disclaimer ("Any resemblance between the Great Dictator and the barber shop owner is purely coincidental") the film is a laugh at the minute with a mixture of wonderful prank and verbal humor. And at the same time, Chaplin manages to portray the evils of totalitarian persecution. Perhaps a little short on the ending and on the lasting durability of the theme, but easily a 9 out of 10 for me.
