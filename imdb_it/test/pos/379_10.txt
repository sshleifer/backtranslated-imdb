This is one of the best films of Alfred Hitchcock and one of his most undervalued. I think it surely goes beyond a "Psycho" or "The Birds" for artistic technique and brilliance. It is a macabre, tense, darkly humorous product that will leave you speechless for a long time. <br /> <br /> Robert Walker creates one of Hitchcock's most memorable villains as his father-hate, fixed by his mother (but isn't Most Hitchcock villains are mum's boys?) Bruno. It is a disturbing and stunning performance that illuminates the entire film. His character is obsessive, apparently homosexual (look at those deliberately effeminate ties and listen to how he is described as "European"), strangely fascinating and dangerous to cross. Farley Granger certainly knows this as he gets caught up in Bruno's sordid network after the two meet on a train. Bruno, knowing some internal information on Guy's business, proposes the two "exchange" murders for the benefit of others. Walker will kill Granger's slutty and conniving wife who is inhibiting her marriage to the beautiful Anne, while Granger will kill Bruno's father, whom he hates so intensely. Everyone is happy, right? A victory, as Bruno says? Mistaken. Granger forgets the indecent proposal, but a haunted Walker does not. He commits his murder and is determined to persecute Granger until he also completes his part of the pact. 'Strangers' becomes a compelling and compelling game of cat and mouse in Hitch's capable hands. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock was absolutely amazing at creating intriguing secondary characters and building scenes. We have whore Miriam, the estranged wife of Granger pregnant with another man. Leaving behind a phallic ice cream cone while eating Bruno's eyes openly. Barbara Morton, sister of Anne, is a deceptively sweet but intelligent and cunning girl who comes up with the crudest remarks you will hear from a bespectacled girl in the photos of the 50s. Senator Morton is authoritative and self-absorbed. This is one of the most daring films that Hitchcock has ever made, and is typical of a Hitch film, subtly sexual in detail. <br /> <br /> This fits into the film-noir category with its focus on murders, lies and deception and obscure cinematography. Walker's fool is one for the ages and Granger is a convincing tormented protagonist. Roman is perhaps weaker than the other two and I never believed in his relationship with Granger. However, the overwhelming positive aspects cancel out the slight negatives and one can safely say that this is one of the BEST American films ever made. <br /> <br /> Just look at what Hitch does here: originality, technical skill. We see the murder of Miriam reflected in her shattered glasses. A tennis match turns into one of the most exciting and intense scenes you've ever seen. An innocent fair turns into a place of murders and obscene events. A young boy's balloon jumped out of Walker (Hitch obviously liked what he saw in "The Third Man!"). The joy of children in driving the carousel turns into a screaming and frantic terror. Hitch overturns normal and everyday events like no other. <br /> <br /> Camera work here is among the best ever seen in a Hitchcock film, and the premise is to die for. It's slippery, exudes sophistication and diabolical charm. The cross-cut between the characters of Walker and Granger is magnificent: Granger's do-or-die tennis match is just as vital as the rescue by a thug Walker of an incriminating trial lost. Hitch again builds his bad guy in an ugly, repellent but funny and strangely charming (Does anyone else find him strangely attractive, much more than Granger?) Piece of work - we're just as tense as Walker in our hope that he can get the lighter out from the drain. We need him to do it, anyway. It holds the key to history. <br /> <br /> You will never see an approach from a stranger in the same way again after watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Incredible. <br /> <br /> 10/10.
