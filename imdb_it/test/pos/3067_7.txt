Mel Brooks is a great writer, director and actor, but once in a while he can also have a clinker. The beginning of this begins almost fundamentally only by meeting one character after another. You have Cary Elwes who is charming and talented but can't do comedy. His expressions in the camera show that he too cannot believe the inanity of the script. Richard Lewis looks bored and distracted without much to do and Amy Yasbeck is stuck in school acting mode. Dave Chapelle shows a great series of comedies that attack and entertain for the camera and Mark Blankfield is mostly suffocated in the role of the blind, but then still manages to show great comedies. Eric Allen Kramer doesn't have much to do, but the few scenes he has are binding. The best roles are those of Roger Rees, Tracy Ullman, Megan Cavanaugh and Brooks for when it appears. Dom DeLuise has a fun twist as a Mafia Don with a Clint Eastwood look-alike, but on the negative side, some of the jokes aren't very funny while some of the really fun ones seem stolen from Mel's other movies.
