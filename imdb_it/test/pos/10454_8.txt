When I was in my tenth year, my friend and I were late at his house and we went around the cable and started watching this movie. We looked at it because it seemed funny and because it had tits. But then the ending came and we sat there completely speechless. I think that after a minute of watching the credits he just moaned "Oh, friend ....." He goes from the 80's 80's teenage comedy to nihilistic realism so quickly that he takes you by surprise I have been trying to rent this film for years and have not been able to find it - and no one has ever seen it except me and my friend - so it seems. But now it's available! I strongly advise you to rent and prepare.
