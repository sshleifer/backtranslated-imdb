I'm not a big fan of movie musicals. "Annie" was a theater show I loved but the film was a flop. The "Phantom Of The Opera" films (and I believe there were three) failed to match the Weber scene. But I loved it. The DVD will take pride of place among my "keepers". Although it is a film adaptation, it somehow captures the taste and atmosphere of live theater. Bette Midler, always a pleasure, is exceptional in this role. There is fantastic music, lots of laughter and even a tear or two. I saw most of the great musicals of the eighties and nineties. Somehow I lost this, so there's no comparison to make. But if he comes back to life I will be the first in line for tickets! But this film is so beautiful, I will be in the strange position to ask myself if the stage production will be up to the film.
