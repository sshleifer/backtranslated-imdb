A wonderful film in the best magic eldritch Scandinavian tradition, with a farsighted analysis of most of the big questions we are just beginning to face. <br /> <br /> It should be a mandatory vision for all politicians. <br /> Make your choice between privacy, nuclear sustainability, global climate change, quality of life. <br /> <br /> Remember the Thoreaus Walden, but with a modern touch and a remarkable humor. <br /> <br /> I'm not Finnish, even though I traveled there and have good Finnish friends, but I found it totally accessible and also culturally informative.
