At Cold Mountain, in northern Colorado, near the time of the American Civil War, Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) arrives in the small town with his daughter, the shy Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), for health reasons. Ada also meets the timid Inman (Jude Law) and they fall in love with each other. With the start of the war, Inman becomes a soldier, and his great support for staying alive is the desire to see Ada again in Cold Mountain. Meanwhile, Ada meets Ruby Thewes (Ren√©e Zellweger), a war survivor who helps her on the farm and becomes her best friend. The plot alternates past and present situations, revealing a beautiful love story. I really enjoyed this movie. Having names like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman and Giovanni Ribisi in the supporting cast, a magnificent director by Anthony Minghella and seven directions for the Oscar, this film does not disappoint. My observation is that there are some very important scenes eliminated in the story and presented in the DVD. At least one of them, showing what happens to Sara, her baby and the three corpses on her farm, should not be erased as it was. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Cold Mountain'
