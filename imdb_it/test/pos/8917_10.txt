Don't be fooled: this is not yet another tired example of the Girls From Outer Space that pretends to be the team of French skiers come to Earth to collect as much sperm as possible genus, even if the synopsis might suggest otherwise. This film is a gem, an absolute jewel that has enriched my life from the moment I saw it. Exhilarating, exhilarating, action-packed and incredibly erotic, "Ach jodel mir noch einen" is a Euro-Madcap Tour-De-Force, a very underrated Bavarian classic. <br /> <br /> Stop whatever you're doing and run out of rent, or better yet, BUY this movie immediately.
