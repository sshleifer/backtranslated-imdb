Since Jason and his retinue took the place of horror films around 1980, most of all horror films involved a group of teenagers with hormonal charges that are torn to pieces with an emphasis on cutting and not suspense. <br /> <br /> This little movie is different. Made in the early 1980s, it does what any good horror movie should do: bring your worst fears to life while you sit around knowing that these horrors are just around the corner. So let those horrors collapse, but don't turn it into a lesson in slaughter biology. <br /> <br /> The story presents Meg Tilly just before having a short-lived breakthrough with the fame that begins with "The Big Chill" and then slipped back into darkness in the early 90s. Meg plays an abandoned teenager who is dying to get into the good graces of some classic bad girls. They tell her she can be part of their small group if she spends the night in a crypt. The bad girls intend to frighten her and make her leave the crypt giving them a double reward - further tormenting the marginalized girl and having an excuse to reject her. <br /> <br /> The famous occultist Karl Rhamarevich died a bizarre death shortly after claiming to have discovered a way to return from the grave and on his return command great magical powers. At first his daughter does not believe it, but listens to a video on her father's experiments that included her lucky animation of dead small animals and her plans to emerge from the grave with the power to animate a bigger game and draw more energy from these animations. He also learns that he may have inherited his father's power and may be the only person who can stop him if he resurrects. I think you know where this story is headed, so I'll stop here. Did I mention that the magician was buried in the same crypt where Meg Tilly's character is spending the night? <br /> <br /> I will mention that the commercial DVD containing this film looks a bit degraded compared to what you'd expect from a movie that has been released so recently. I saw it on TV in the mid-80s and I remember it looked better than this. The problem is that the original negative of the film was never localized, so the DVD had to be created from a print. This means that it is complete with dirt and scratches. <br /> <br /> All horror fans are worth a look. It was a film made independently and an example of the kind of unusual things that could be commonly found on TV late at night until the infomercial transformed that time slot into a vast area abandoned around 1986. Only TCM Underground transmits this kind of film .
