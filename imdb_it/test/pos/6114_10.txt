Well, I can safely say that I'm human, Wong. And I didn't throw up. I laughed. And he laughed. If this movie made you vomit, there's something wrong with you. But this movie is incredible. I bought it four days ago and I've seen it five times already. Cruelty to animals gives me the heart, but not enough to be guilty. The film is shocking, disgusting and vulgar. The acting is horrible. What else do you want from a movie? I'm a crazy maniac of cult movies. Pink Flamingos is fantastic. Makes Rocky Horror, as someone said, looks like teletubbies.
