OK, many of us agree that this is a weak attempt at a remake, but at the same time it is also a different film in its own right. Don't get me wrong, "American Werewolf In London" is a superior film, but "American Remake In Paris" is also a decent film. <br /> <br /> First of all, the only real similarities are the TITLE, 2 American BACKPACKERS and WEREWOLVES. In addition to these 3 things, 'American Remake In Paris' stands out quite well on its own with its special blend of humor, action / adventure and horror. Most of the people who say that this film is better than the original are the young generation of today who think that any film made before 1990 is a total crap. While those of us who grew up in the 80s can appreciate the older films and what they added to today's horror movies. What many people fail to understand is that without the old classic films, including those in black and white, the horror would not be what it is today. Now I'm getting a little out of hand ... <br /> <br /> An American werewolf in Paris is a good attempt to recreate a classic, but it will never go beyond the original, ever. That being said, this is still a very fun movie to watch and I recommend it. I'm giving a 7 out of 10. Maybe it's a little generous, but I've seen much worse attempts in trying to recreate a classic.
