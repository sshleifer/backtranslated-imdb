This story has had a special place in my heart for the last thirty-one years. As a boy, I liked the stories of mountain men and wild nature. Books like "Call of the Wild", "White Fang", "The Frontiersman" and "My Side Of the Mountain" have influenced me a lot. I wanted so much to live like a mountain man, but nothing inspired me to do it anymore, compared to when I saw this film on television in 1975. I wanted to be just like "Trapper". However, when I got older, I discovered that I was too tame to live that way. Nevertheless, I still feel romantic about living that kind of life. I agree with some other reviews of this film that the plot has the simplicity that is quite common in "Disney" type films, but if you can look beyond the mechanisms in which it was made and see the heart of the story, the real themes, so I think you find yourself pleasantly touched. I make a point to watch this movie once a year. After thirty-one years, I still feel a chill when I see a torrent of snow run down the side of the mountain and hear the echoing and haunting laughter of the Trapper. <br /> <br /> - Good old luck and stay free - <br /> <br /> PS If you want to learn more about the true story, I found this link on Mad Trapper of Rat River: <br /> < br /> http: //www.mysteriesofcanada .com / NWT / madtrapper.htm
