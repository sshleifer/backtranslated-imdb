I saw this title again on Shemaroo. I also asked my nephew who was 17 to look the same with me. I am 35 years old and he is 17 years old. He liked it and I did it too. It's still fun, a little childish at times but still very clean. Satish Shah is hilarious in multiple roles. This sitcom would go even better than many of the last TV serials. But obviously some people obviously love the worldly rates that come out today. It would have been nice that Shafi Inamdar would continue for all seasons. Today it is no longer alive. I wish someone could list all the episodes here. <br /> <br /> Who can forget the lines "Yeh Kya Ho Raha HAi" "What a relief" "Kaat Daalu Boss" "Vyavhaar hai Vyavhaar" "30 years Ka Experience hai" <br /> <br /> and the title track Yeh Jo hai Zindagi, teaching us to live life as it is and enjoying its enjoyment. The life of ordinary people. <br /> <br /> I still like this sitcom. sometimes it might not seem funny, but some episodes are still hilarious.
