Since the superb "Prime Suspect" series reaches the fourth part, there is no loss of momentum, this is in itself a considerable achievement. "Prime Suspect IV: The Lost Child" has the solid supporting cast we take for granted in these British dramas, but of course the beautiful Helen Mirren dominates easily, our eyes never leave her while she is on screen. <br /> < br /> The search for the missing son of the title brings the CID team of superintendent Jane Tennison to a prime suspect who turns out to be a convicted pedophile who now lives with a single mother and her two young daughters. given in the functioning of his mind is one of the emotional highlights of this mini-series, but it may be too strong for many stomachs. <br /> <br /> Action sequences are handled brilliantly held the car photo pushing us in the middle of excitement and there is tension during the siege. <br /> <br /> Altogether this is another magnificent procedural police drama.
