This is the forty-minute film that introduces us to the character of the Butcher, which will later be examined in more detail in the film Seul Contre Tous. In this film, he follows the first period of his life from 1965 to 1979, but focuses on the end of the seventies. The first images are of a massacre of a horse, then the birth of a child, the daughter of the Butcher, which we see rapidly growing every year. The Butcher (played by Philippe Nahon in both films) is a bitter man with the world. He hates many things. His anger comes to the head when a man assaults his autistic daughter. The Butcher, therefore, makes himself the wrong man and finds himself in prison. <br /> <br /> This film follows the life of the butcher immediately after his release from prison, so Seoul Contre Tous takes over from there. I saw the movies the wrong way, before Seoul Contre Tous. Try watching this little movie first if you can.
