I'm a passionate fan of Julie Andrews and saw it for the first time on DVD - the version of Director's Cut. I was very surprised that he was classified as G. How did they get bedroom scenes, a plot of seduction, two acts of strip tease and war / shooting / blood in a G vote? Strange. I would classify it as PG-13. <br /> <br /> Besides this, I really enjoyed the film. It was a beautiful showcase of Andrew's voice and talent. The acting was great. The plot was a bit weak, leaving gaps that could have been filled with good dialogue. There were too many scenes of "not talking, just walking" for me ... I would have liked to see the relationship between Julie and Rock blossom, so that intense love would be more believable.
