In some scenes of Rain People, the forerunner of Francis Ford Coppola of his glory period of the seventies, there is the mark of a situation similar to that of Easy Rider of 1969, but not exactly in the same frame of reference. Here we have a drama about people disconnected from society, somehow alienated from the choices or limits imposed by one medium or another. It is one of those rare original dramas in which some scenes are isolated as total knockouts. Even with such a low budget and a very free attitude, so to speak, of the filming of the film, Coppola is able to capture everything that must be said through these clearly defined characters and the curved and unexpected degrees of a character with respect to the film . impotence of another, or vice versa, or both. And, as you might be inclined to see how we talk about the splits of the suburban life of the 60s, it has that evasion of the film mentioned above, but of a more concrete quality, almost timeless with the drama and the underlying issues. In a sense, if Bergman were on the road as a quasi-guerrilla filmmaker 20-something to get the strange truths of everyday strangers, this could be it. <br /> <br /> But along with all the very direct and sometimes self-conscious photography (although with a more documentary approach, sometimes with its indeterminable characters), the actors all fit in their place. Shirley Knight, an actress with whom I am not very familiar, has a complex and divergent role as a pregnant wife who escapes in a sort of existentialist enigma of what life is there to have. There are moments of an awesome acting from her, and one of my favorites (if not my favorite) is when she's on the phone calling her husband the first time. A scene so tense on both ends, and in every little gesture and inflection of a word so much about her is spoken with so little. It is extraordinary in ways that mirror others in Coppola's films. Then comes the "killer" character played by James Caan. This is also a dangerous character to assume, as it is a mixture of childish confusion and fun with scarred memories. Think of Forrest Gump if he failed to overcome football and spirit. It's one of his best, actually, being the most minimalist - for a guy who usually plays in difficult films, here's one that is part of the core of the story and the character of Knight. Very good also in a supporting role is Robert Duvall as a policeman with a rough side and rather chess; kind of a first champion of other defected characters that he would play later in his career. <br /> <br /> So the characters and what Coppola is likely to have a discomfort in them, are really what makes up the film, like any story there is, it definitely isn't solved in the usual way you might think or expect . The last ten minutes are like the others in Coppola's work, where the specific tragedies on all sides are undercut by the emotional and psychological implications that this will leave on the principles, amplified to the sublime and the sad. This is, for the moment, courageous on the part of what it is trying to be represented (both in freedom and defects and ambiguities) in the subject. And the style of the image adds a kind of fragmented view to all this with rapid graphic and autonomous flashbacks in contrast to the longer shots in some crucial scenes. It's a road movie of his time, but he also had a lot more work than he would have done with another director, with less chance of taking on the nature of these marginalized characters. One of the best films of 1969.
