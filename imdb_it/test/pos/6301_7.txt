I saw this interesting film with the Chinese / French film "2046" at the recent Dubai film festival. Both were intelligent works created the same year (2004/2005). Both had the main characters who lived in a "hotel". In both films, the hotel is more a metaphor for exile than a place. Both have to do with the love between a man and a woman. Both had wonderful music and compelling performances. What a coincidence, and yet how the two films differ in the treatment of the subject! Somewhere at the beginning of the film, a man walking on a sidewalk turns to look at a woman and in doing so hits a lamppost. The audience explodes in a volcano of innocent laughter. But isn't that short film the synopsis of the film, which entertains you for 2 hours? While the film is a wonderful blend of black comedy (for example, using a stethoscope to listen to the neighbor's conversation), the film is based on what Buster Keaton and Jacques Tati had previously introduced to the cinema - stoic faces that lead to comedy in stark contrast to the equally intelligent world of Robin Williams or Danny Kaye moving. A sudden frenzy of activity transforms an otherwise stoic character as he moves money from the hotel to the bank remembers Tati's works. <br /> <br /> But the film is not just a comedy. The anti-automation declaration (count of cash and the reaction of bank staff to the declarations relating to it, the mannequin that acts as an ineffective warning to the lady who accelerates, the reference to "Moulimix" as the fictitious "company" with which she works, etc.) are several ideas that the director is offering a comedy loaded to the viewer. Laugh, yes, but think about it and enjoy it further .. <br /> <br /> The strength of the film lies in a short script (by director Paul Sorrentino) that offers a comedy that mixes with philosophy ("La truth is boring "Dad died, but no one told him" "Bad luck does not exist - it is the invention of the losers and the poor". Then the director continues to provide you with a fascinating lesson from the main character in insomniacs. You will not sleep during this conference Sorrentino offers entertainment related to the topic that Italians know best: the mafia is an existential mafia film. <br /> <br /> From the "The truth is boring", the director proposes a dessert as part of the good superb acting meal (Toni Servillo), good music, skillful camera (Luca Bigazzi), a beautiful and enigmatic actress (Magnani, grandson of the great Anna) and powerful script. The dessert is for the spectator to understand if what preceded in the film it was the truth be boring, I was, right?
