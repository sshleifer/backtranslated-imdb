I have just seen this DVD three times - Once the "normal" mode, once with scenes in consecutive order (in this film noir doozy, the beginning, middle and end of the story intertwine), and a once with the comment of the director in execution. Quite surprising. A nude fairy tale, told with more inspiration, energy and substance than most of the exaggerated big-budget features released today. <br /> <br /> I think this is an even more accomplished film than the next Memento, which turned me into Nolan in the first place. I can't wait to see what he does with a bigger budget (and the biggest box office stars) in his next film, Insomnia.
