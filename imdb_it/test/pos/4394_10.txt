The first time I saw this movie, it didn't seem to go anywhere. When I looked at it a second time, it made much more sense. Give it a chance, look at it more than once, there are many key elements that shape the story that might have escaped the first and second time by looking at it. The Cohen brothers brilliantly weave the real events of the early twentieth century into this story to create a credible scenario and plot. The combination of Clooney's main role goes well with the supporting acts of Turturro and Nelson. John Goodman's appearance in the film is hilarious. Even the soundtrack is fantastic. This film has become a favorite of my family. 10/10, for sure.
