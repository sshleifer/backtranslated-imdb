Bill, Jeremy Theobald, is an inspiring writer who has yet to publish anything. Bill also has a strange and strange habit, he likes to follow people. <br /> <br /> Bill chooses a stranger in the streets or on the subway, on the subway, and follows them as if it were their shadow. Perhaps Bill does it to help him inspire himself to write the great novel he has always dreamed of or to have his article published in an important magazine? Maybe it's because he fills Bill's solitary life with a purpose and even makes the person of his curiosity a face in the crowd with meaning and substance from his attention to him or her? Or maybe he gives Bill someone to take care of him and be responsible besides himself? Bill has a simple rule that he follows religiously when he follows someone: after following him at home or at work, you stop. <br /> <br /> One day Bill follows Cobb, Alex Haw, home and instead of following his rule of stopping he continues to follow Cobb. Bill will soon realize how right he was with the rule he set in following people and at the same time how wrong he was by breaking it. <br /> <br /> Extraordinarily beautiful low-cost film made by Christopher Noland in 1998, before coming to big in Hollywood with his revolutionary and original film "Momento", two years later, which has already become one of the biggest cult film. <br /> <br /> "Following" is actually a much better movie than "Moment" because it is a conventional and easy to follow story. Compared to "Momento's" which was confused at the beginning and then when you realize what the movie is telling you about in the backward plot it's very complicated. What makes "Seguendo" much better is simply that it is simple, but at the same time intelligent in its effect on those who watch it. The film is much more direct and devastating and you don't have to see it again and again to get what it was trying to tell them as "Momento" did. "Seguendo" is a story within a story within a story with one of the most surprising and simply manipulated endings, if you look at the movie again and notice the clues you will ever see. <br /> <br /> Made with an incredibly small budget of $ 6,000.00, this is less than what most Hollywood movies have in store for coffee breaks, with an unnamed black and white cast and just over an hour, 71 minutes, long. Hollywood and the film industry outside of Hollywood can learn a lot from Chris Noland in the way that someone with more than talent and imagination can get what millions of dollars in most cases can't; make a clever movie and at the same time penetrating with almost nothing in cash and no big name stars.
