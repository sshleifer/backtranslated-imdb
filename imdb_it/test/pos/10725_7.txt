The child actor certainly deserves a lot of credit. It was a pretty weak field for the best film that year. I think "Apocalypse Now" should have taken it, but probably the Academy was too violent and strange, and Vietnam was still too recent. Meryl Streep was tremendous, as always, playing a very unpredictable character. I don't usually compliment the directors, but I liked them a little with the elevator doors. Degree: B
