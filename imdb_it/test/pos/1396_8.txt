When a group of escaped prisoners manage to escape to a remote island, they soon discover that their new home is inhabited by a strangely threatening doctor (Richard Johnson of "Zombi 2" fame), a mad scientist (Joseph Cotten), his beautiful daughter (Barbara Bach) and a horde of superstitious natives. The men of the tribe say that the doctor created semi-human grotesque creatures and half fish for evil and secret purposes. And even if at first the prisoners do not believe that, while they disappear, one by one, they begin to change their mind. "Screamers" is a very fun mix of "Mysterious Island" and "Humanoids from the Deep". There is a lot of cold blood with a really cool beheading scene and the throat tears to increase. so, but the film is fast and fun. Take a look.8 out of 10.
