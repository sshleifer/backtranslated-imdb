Personally, I don't like many black and white films, but there's something magical about this film. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck). "Liz" writes a column in a magazine about how it is the "Martha Stewart" of Connecticut. Sure, he's lying. This becomes a problem when her editor, Mr. Yardley, asks her to host a sailor from MARINA at Christmas. Furthermore, Mr. Yardley, who will be only for Christmas, will be invited to the farm for the Christmas party. From there, things go crazy. <br /> <br /> As the film is set on a New England farm, the film has a warm holiday feeling. Furthermore, the characters are hilarious. Mr. Yardley is always shouting orders, and Liz's friend Felix is ​​always shouting "Catastroph!" when things go wrong. Finally, the film ends as a Christmas movie should end; a fat and cheerful man laughs and shouts "What a Christmas!" <br /> <br /> In short, no matter what age you are, you will love this movie.
