A couple of cowpokes help a group of Mormons to cross a harsh country to reach a new settlement. This low-key model is unusual for Ford as it lacks big stars. Johnson gets top billing, but his is basically a supportive role, even though he and Carey work well together. Dru is given little to do but provide love interest. The best performance is given by Bond's favorite Ford, which plays the leader of the Mormons. In fact, this role helped him get a leading role in the long Western television series "Wagon Train" before his premature death at the age of 57. With a beautiful photograph, Ford considers it one of his favorite movies.
