The scientist Carl Lehman (well played by David McIlwraith) detonates something terrible in a deliberate chemical explosion. His brain is transplanted into the body of an almost indestructible metal cyborg suit by his evil colleagues led by the evil fellow obsessive scientist Alex Whyte (a perfectly hateful portrait of Richard Cox). Lehman embarks on a veritable murderous madness. It is up to the evil mercenary hunter (a wonderfully repulsive turn from the divine Pam Grier) to stop him. The director Jean-Claude Lord, who previously directed the thriller psycho thriller "Visiting the hours", staged abundant action scenes with considerable verve and maintained a fast pace, thus ensuring that this film turned into a ski -fi funny and scruffy / horror action. The plump character of Maury Chaykin easily faces acting honors as the disgusting and fat asshole Burt, who in the film's most tasteless sequence has a brutal fistfight with Lehman Lauren's pregnant wife (a winning performance of the beautiful Teri Austin). Stan Winston's eye-catching f / x and Paul Zaza's exciting score further add to the fun general imbalance.
