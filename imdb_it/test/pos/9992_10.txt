I will divide my review into the following 5 categories each with a maximum of 100% (if perfect) ________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> Visual pleasure: [100%] This is visually an extremely pleasant film. I had a great time watching it. The golf scenes are very well filmed and the dramatic effects on the green were quite surprising. I also enjoyed seeing the old wooden golf clubs and the bag. <br /> <br /> The director's work: [70%] Bill Paxton is more associated with acting, but this film shows he has talent. He did a decent job. <br /> <br /> Acting: [90%] Shia LeBeouf was very good in his role as Francis Ouimet (this guy can play well). The rest of the cast was also good. <br /> <br /> Entertainment value: [100%] I loved every minute. Script: [91%] Based on a true story and therefore makes the film much more special. It was intriguing from the beginning and I loved every scene until the end. <br /> <br /> __________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> My advice: Definitely a MUST for all sports lovers, especially Golf (you all will love it). Anyone looking for a good movie that doesn't like sport can watch it. <br /> <br /> _____ <br /> <br /> 10/10
