I saw this show on Showtime some years ago, in the comfort of my own home and when the final note was played, I wanted to jump off the couch and give the production a standing ovation. Actually, I shed a tear that was such a series of fantastic shows and songs. For my birthday, my kids bought me the VHS version and the game CD with Len Cariou as Sweeny Todd. <br /> <br /> I shared the game with many ... some finding the subject a bit sick, but nobody had anything but praise for the songs. <br /> <br /> I've always loved interaction in songs with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn, as well as Hearn and Edmund Lyndeck as Judge Turpin. <br /> <br /> I need to own the DVD.
