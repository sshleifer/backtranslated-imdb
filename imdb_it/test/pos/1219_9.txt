True Love, I loved it and really enjoyed this movie. It was fun, fun and challenging. I just saw it on DVD. How lost I am this is a winner! I mean Flex was "that guy". I wanted to marry him. This was my first time seeing him as a real protagonist and he takes it out. I thought Tangi Miller was the best ever and I was also a Felicity boss. A fearless woman who only fears her Nana. Thank you for giving women a range of colors in your work and she is beautiful! Tasha Smith was an explosion! Aloma Wright was as priceless as Nana. This nice romantic comedy is "A Must See". Oh, and newcomer Marcus Patrick is worth the surprise of women ... True Love. karen
