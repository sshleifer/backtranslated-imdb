This film was a pleasant surprise for me. In all honesty, the previews looked horrible, to the point where Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman appeared. So I rented it with the reservation, but I really enjoyed this movie. He had fantastic acting, some good twists and, of course, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman. It is certainly worth a try.
