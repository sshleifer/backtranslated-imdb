When I watched this film when I was a child I didn't understand the premise of Hitchcock's movies and dark comedy. Now that I'm in my mid-twenties it makes a lot more sense. I think the reason I like it so much is that the comic duo of Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito both for some interesting comedy, both slapstick (the pan and the car scenes) and verbal (the arguments / conversations about murder and writing) . <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Larry Donner (Crystal), a struggling writer who stole his masterpiece from his wife Margaret (played by a surprisingly radiant Kate Mulgrew, aka Capt. Janeway of Star Trek : Voyager). <br /> <br /> As he moves between the writer's block and teaches creative writing lessons, he meets student Owen Lifts (DeVito), an aspiring writer and an overgrown boy who unfortunately behaves like a child. Do you have train tracks, do I have to add anything else? Think of Failure Launch, only Matt McConaughey is short, fat and bald. <br /> <br /> Owen is stuck in his own life, with a demanding evil mother (Anne Ramsey) who can't stand. Look for Larry's advice on how to get out, and when he says he goes to see a Hitchcock movie, Owen has the misconception that if he kills Larry's wife, he will return the favor and kill his mother for him. The hilarity follows while the two try to face the problem of the other. Owen goes to extremes to kill Margaret while Larry, who refuses to agree to make his "part of the plan", is maddened by Owen's mother. <br /> <br /> Over the course of the film, Larry and Owen slowly but surely form a bond of friendship that is rare in the dark comedy today. A part of the movie that I really loved is where Owen shows Larry his coin collection, and lets just say that it's more like a sentimental collection than anything else. <br /> <br /> The two main stars apart, the missing Anne Ramsey is as exhilarating as Mama, and deadly with that her rod. She is much more comical, verbally and physically, in contrast to the role of Mama Brothers of The Goonies. So he curses like a sailor and belittles his son around every corner, but that's what makes his character so vivid. It makes his character the kind of person you love to hate. <br /> <br /> Another gift of this film is the music of the great jazz Brandford Marsalis, who plays the neighbor and friend of Larry, Lester. There is a big moment in the film where he plays jazz for Larry, who is depressed and needs some songs to ease the pain. Jazz can do it. <br /> <br /> In closing, I would like Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito to make another good film together, but their genre is getting too old for the game that I'm sad to say. This is one of those rare films in which both stars shine in their subtlest ways. DeVito's childhood comedy and Crystal's keen spirit made this film for me. 5-star comedy.
