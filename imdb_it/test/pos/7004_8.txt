I have to say that I didn't expect much sitting watching "Pitch Black", but I went back a lot, in terms of excitement and pure fun. It's the kind of movie where you can just relax, relax and have fun. This is not a profound film in any way. Everything it offers is recycled or robbed by other films like "Alien", "Predator" or similar. But when I watch a rip-off, I want it to be good, and this rip-off is great. <br /> <br /> It opens with a galaxy of stars. Some of the greatest films of all time open with this type of scene: "2001", "Star Wars", "Alien", "Predator". A ship is sailing in space when the entire cryogenically frozen team is awakened. The ship has been hit by something. They crash to the ground on an ugly little planet with three suns. Everyone leaves the ship when they discover that their transport of prisoners, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel), has escaped delivery. They search the desert planet for his research and eventually find it, but have no way to make their ship fly again. They look for water and civilization on the planet but it seems that all of them have suddenly disappeared from the planet not long ago. <br /> <br /> Then they discover that every 22 years the planets line up in a solar eclipse and the whole planet turns black. There are also hordes of aliens that thrive in the darkness that lives on the planet - what are the possibilities? They are on the planet just as the eclipse happens: what are the possibilities? And Riddick has a rare talent - he can see in the dark - again, what are the possibilities? <br /> <br /> There seems to be a lot of coincidence in this film, but a film like this has not come out to get Oscars for originality or credibility. He's there to entertain the public - he does it with ease. Vin Diesel is a great gorilla of a man without acting talent. But I have to say if there is someone who can adapt to the role of a criminal, a murderous criminal, he is Diesel. Listen to him, murmuring: "He didn't know who he was having fun with." Big things. <br /> <br /> The aliens in this film are a mix of hammerhead sharks, those of "Alien" and Predators. They have long, horizontal heads like a hammer, the quick agility of aliens and the stealth of a Predator. I assume that David Twohy (director and screenwriter of the film) did not expect the public to believe that his creatures were really something never seen before. At least I hope not. <br /> <br /> "Aliens Redux" could be a better name for this film, but then again, it's better than the second and third "Alien" movie put together. At a time when seemingly finished series are coming back to life - "Terminator 3", "Alien 5", "Predator 3", "Alien vs. Predator" - "Pitch Black" stands out as a new series. Two other sequels are planned. We just hope they don't let themselves get carried away. I can only imagine it in twenty-five years: "Aliens vs. Predator vs. Pitch Black Aliens: * The Fight of the Year." <br /> <br /> * The Fight of the Year title can be shared with upcoming movies "Freddy vs. Jason vs. Michael vs. Leatherface vs. Norman Bates vs. Alien vs. Predator vs. Terminator vs. James Cameron vs. Barny the Dinosaur." <br /> <br /> 4/5.
