"Labyrinth of Passion" - with the possible exception of "Matador" - is Almodovar's best film. It shows its unique personality at its best and least censored, before it started to become more mainstream. Almodovar is almost the only modern director able to approach the wonderful madness of Preston Sturges. It is useless to try to explain what the film is about, the real point is Almodovar's willingness and ability to bring his situations to the extreme limits of sanity, and sometimes even of plausibility and taste.
