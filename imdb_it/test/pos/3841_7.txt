I saw this movie only once, several years ago. But I remember that I liked it a lot. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ahead ** An old famous opera singer is retired and decides to give all the money he has to his cats. His butler hears him and plots to get rid of the cats so he can get lucky. It puts the drops directly in their milk. When they wake up, they find themselves miles away. They have to go home before it's too late. With the help of an independent cat and other animal accomplices, escaping the butler and foiling his plan. <br /> <br /> It could have been better, but it could have been much worse. <br /> <br /> My score: 7/10.
