The answer ..... No, unfortunately not. Although the miller and the sweep should be hailed as an extravagant film treatment. The drama, the suspense, the romance and the unidentified crowd eventually add to the plot a complex film that must have been too much for the 1898 public. An illuminating experience, one for the whole family!
