This is a horror movie from the early 1980s, in which a girl (Meg Tilly) plans to cast her "goody two shoes" image and becomes part of a gang called The Sisters. Their initiation is for her to spend the night in a mausoleum. Too bad the mausoleum is the "final" resting place of some Russian psychics and is not yet dead. It looks like this guy was found in his apartment with a lot of stuff stuck into the walls by his telekinetic practice, plus a bunch of dead young girls found in the closet. All the evidence that hitching can be dangerous, so listen to the girls. This man's daughter (Reymar) is rather upset by the death of his father and is confronted by a man who said he knew Reymar and gave a tape to listen to him too. His hubby (Adam West, of Batman fame) is there to laugh and mock, and not much else. But it seems that perhaps Reymar's daughter might also have skills she doesn't understand. However, after having deposited their unfortunate commitment to the mausoleum, the rest of The Sisters left to fetch stuff (like masks, sheets, etc.) to go back and scare her away from her, but little suspect what's going on and get more shit scared of them. Also for the death Reymar is a busy guy and is reviving many corpses for entertainment. And it would also seem to have something for the prison bait. Overall this is an acceptable horror, nothing too intense but not terrible either. The Media Blasters DVD also contains another version of the film that is a rough cut, I guess, I just looked at it a bit, so I don't know how different it is from the theatrical version, but from what I've seen I think it's a "wart and all "presentation. 7 out of 10.
