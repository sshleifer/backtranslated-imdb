I am a sociologist / anthropologist specialized in the field of symbolic interactionism, and I must say that this film has a high quality in the symbolic context of the whole film. To anyone who has not yet seen this, I advise you to read also "Research of man for the definitive meaning" of Victor E. Frankl. I think you will be able to draw some surprising correlations. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I would like to say that, despite the fact that the main characters are gay, this is not a story about being gay. This is a story about how to look for and find meaning in life, despite the difficulties and challenges, the pain and the terror that stand in your way. This is a story of research and the search for balance, wholeness and happiness.
