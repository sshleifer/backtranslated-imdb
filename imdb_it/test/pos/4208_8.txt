Young John Garfield starred in a beautiful performance in 1939 "They Made Me a Criminal". Celebrating a ring win in a jammed locker room, boxer Johnnie Bradfield expresses his love for his mother, the rejection of alcohol and the clean lifestyle for fans, including the cops, who eat it. Later in the evening, he is plowed and poised with his girlfriend, while his manager, in the office, shares the evening. And the whiskey. <br /> <br /> A problem develops when another couple arrives. The boy is a journalist and says he will expose Bradfield's fake life on the front page. The manager kills the journalist and he and the floozy leave. The murder was discovered, the policemen, later, are looking for the now sleepy boxer whose car is run by the manager with his new girlfriend, Johnny's ex. A police hunt ends with a fiery car accident. Manager and girl are dead and unrecognizable. <br /> <br /> Johnny discovers he should be a murderer. But he is also presumed dead. Seeking the advice of a lawyer, he entrusts the consultant with the key to a safe deposit box with his only savings, $ 10,000. The lawyer later gives Johnny $ 250 and tells him that the compensation is his fee for giving him professional advice: get out of the city, fast, and go far. (I will never charge a client more than $ 5,000 for such a concise, concise and wise course.) Johnny, now a tramp jumping on the train, ends up comfortably on a ranch in Arizona where he is nursed back to health by the beautiful Goldie West , Ann Sheridan, a beautiful actress whose career was on the rise. Taking Jack Dorney as his nickname, the boxer loses some of his rough sides as he falls in love with Goldie. Become a mentor and friend of - The Dead End Kids. Familiar screen characters for pre-war viewers. <br /> <br /> A chance to make money arises when a performance boxer presents himself challenging all the windswept to last several rounds in the ring with him. It's a natural temptation for Bradfield / Dorney, but there is only one flaw. Who should present himself if not Detective Monty Phelan of New York, the laughing stock of the department? He was in the morgue for years due to a small mistake at the beginning of his career that sent an innocent man to Old Sparky (we all make mistakes, right?). Phelan recognized Bradfield from a news photo and he is there to watch the fight and pinch. Claude Rains is the cop who has endured sneaky and wrong from his fellow officers for years. <br /> <br /> What follows is predictable, but is well acted. I hope this was a main feature when it was released, it's too good to classify it as a second "B" on a marquee. <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley, better known as an outstanding choreographer, directed "They did me to Criminal" and Max Steiner, one of Hollywood's most prolific composers, wrote pleasant but not extraordinary music for the film. <br /> <br /> Now available on DVD from Alpha Video, the movie returned me a mere $ 4.99 and gave me a real pleasure. I will display it again. <br /> <br /> 8/10
