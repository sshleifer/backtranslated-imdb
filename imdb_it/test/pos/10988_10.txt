What a great cast for this film. The timing was excellent and there were many smart lines: several times I was still laughing just a few minutes after delivery. I found Manna From Heaven to have surprising moments and while there were things I thought would happen, the way they joined was anything but predictable. This film is about hope and right about wrong. I left the theater feeling inspired to do the right thing. Good for the five sisters.
