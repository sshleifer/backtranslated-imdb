The episode begins with the scenes of a wet dead woman bathed on the shore, an abandoned Jim walking along the beach lost in reverie and a nocturnal ride home that ends in murder and mystery. Yes, this is a small atmospheric number with a super touch at the end. Jim is right to unravel what is, in principle, an inexplicable case of a woman who disappears 20 seconds after entering her home. To tell the truth, the eventual explanation is a bit far-fetched. Because, for example, going all the way to replace a woman halfway through a car trip, when simply rubbing her and her companions, it would have been easier and left less of a trail. However, apart from these problems, it is a memorable episode of the TRF full of inventions, although STILL Jim is put in the frame by an always suspicious police department. I mean, having the ungrateful of those who ever sat down and counted how many of the THEIR files were solved by dear old Jimbo?
