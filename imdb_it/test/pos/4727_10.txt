Chris Noth plays a maniac who wrote a book for children as a young man, posing as a doctor threatening a community to push his sister's son into the genius position of his school. The only man who can stop him is a policeman who plays by his own rules and is forced to hide with the help of his dumb father who communicates via the oji board. Will Rick Springfield find out what happens? Or someone will sabotage his recording studio! Does the mentally retarded boy who runs the mobile book have any clues? Look to find out! I'm not making this up!
