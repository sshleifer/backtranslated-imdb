I don't think I'm alone when I say that 2005 was not particularly kind to the horror genre. While "Maledetto", "Nascondino", "L'anello Due" and "L'orrore di Amityville" all showed glimpses of interest and potential, there were more mistakes than successes. For proof, see: "White Noise", "Boogeyman", "The Jacket", "Mindhunters" and "Alone in the Dark". Imagine my surprise when "House of Wax", written strictly by the brothers Chad and Carey Hayes, turned out to be ... well, a surprise. <br /> <br /> Carly Jones (Elisha Cuthbert) is a young woman traveling with her problematic brother, Nick (Chad Michael Murray) and her boyfriend, Wade (Jared Padalecki). They are, along with Paige (Paris Hilton), Blake (Robert Ri'chard) and Dalton (Jon Abrahams), hoping to get tickets for the football game of the season. Along the way, they run into some trouble with the car, and are forced to enter a desolate city where nothing is what it seems to be. <br /> <br /> Having heard this, a remake of the classic Vincent Price B- film, I looked up at the sky. I didn't even want to think about what disaster the director Jaume Serra had prepared for his audience. At a time when most high-profile horror films are disappointing, latent with bad writing, static direction and amateur acting, I consider myself fortunate that Serra and the Hayes brothers took the trouble to make a good old-fashioned party. Unlike the delusions I mentioned earlier, this film does not punch, and uses every cinematic trick in the book to give everyone exactly what they came for. <br /> <br /> I am happy that the Hayes has actually taken the time and effort to create cute and believable characters, thus making the events much more urgent. It also gives young actors the task of portraying them. As she did in "The Girl Next Door", Elisha Cuthbert shows the public what a good actress she really is. In the 2003 remake of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", Jessica Biel silenced opponents by offering a raw and exciting performance, one that put the viewer right there with her. Here, Cuthbert does the same. Chad Michael Murray ("A Cinderella Story"), in one of his earliest mature roles, is not as sloppy as Nick. Murray exudes charisma and a hard edge, plus an impressive athleticism on it. Murray and Cuthbert jelly to perfection, and have a familiar and tangible chemistry. <br /> <br /> More than anything else, the press and the American public made a field day on the debut as principal actor of Paris Hilton. As expected, Hilton is not embarrassed. In fact, she's as good as everyone else in the movie (do it with what you want). Like Cuthbert and Murray, Hilton has a screen presence. She is sexy and playful. I can't think of one of the reasons why he got the worst of the film's strict reception, apart from the fact that they're just making fun of it. Jared Padalecki ("Gilmore Girls" on TV) memorably overcomes his starring role. Robert Ri'chard (TV 'Cousin Skeeter') and Jon Abrahams ("Meet the Parents") do not have much to work with, but to get the job done. With just one scene, Damon Herriman ("Soar") makes an unforgettable impression, and his presence hangs over the rest of the film. Finally, Brian Van Holt ("Basic") is superb and threatening in a dual role. <br /> <br /> Once again, compliments must go to the writers to avoid clich√©s whenever possible. Despite popular opinion, "House of Wax" is rather unpredictable for most of the execution time. Take this for example: it looks like the killer is down for the count and Carly bends over to retrieve something from her pockets. What do you expect to happen? Watch the movie and you will understand what I mean. It is also refreshing to see a horror film in which the characters also show a minimum of common sense. <br /> <br /> Unlike most horror films, the exhilarating work of John Ottman never distracts. However, as in the other versions of Dark Castle, the visual aspects of "Wax" are worthy of reward and raise the film above its genre ornaments. The talents of cinematographer Stephen F. Windon, production designer Graham Walker, art director Nicholas McCallum and publisher Joel Negron highlight the macabre images. Speaking of images, I believe the bloodhounds will be thrilled with the many makeup effects and tricks here. Every scene of death is more agitated than the stomach. Considering his past in music videos and commercials, it is obvious that Jaume Serra has a great eye for style. His "in-your-face" approach is a great resource for the success of this film. Just when you think the camera will move, it is not so. He is also particularly good at building thick layers of terror and atmosphere. An extraordinary blow is our introduction to the killer, as he slowly emerges from a trap door. <br /> <br /> In a case like this, I usually admit when I'm in the minority (shut up, ok? liked "House of 1000 Corpses"!). In this case, I firmly believe that the detractors have made a mistake. I'm not sure why people are so difficult with this movie, considering it's much better than the recent genre rumors. Maybe they're afraid to admit that a horror movie with Paris Hilton might be worth watching ... Who knows? This is a horror movie, and it is commendably elegant and effective. As a lifelong horror fan, all I can say is that I really enjoyed "House of Wax" in all its lurid and sadistic glory. I certainly consider it a great success in modern horror, as well as (along with "Sin City") the first completely satisfying release in 2005.
