An assassin thriller in the style of Day of the Jackal, In The Line Of Fire has the added bonus that Eastwood's veteran bodyguard, Frank Horrigan, is tormented by previous failures at work. The pursuit becomes personal while Leary, the reptilian murderer of John Malkovich, taunts him for this neurosis - with the rather awkward exception of the love of a good woman (Lilly Raines of Russo) will absolutely not rest Frank's mind that don't take Leary personally. <Br /> <br /> Malkovich is a volatile presence - not simply fuel on the screen but often also a changing actor. This is one of his good films, focusing on director Petersen's game. Eastwood is too old but a) the public does not care, because he is and b) his age is written in the script, not only in fiction but also as a recurring joke. Practically as you would expect, but well managed. 7/10
