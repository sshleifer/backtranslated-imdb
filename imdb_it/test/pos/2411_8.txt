OK, so this is a complete rip-off of the first Karate Kid. However, I think there can never be too many films like the first Karate Kid. There is something in this kind of story that seems to appeal to people like me. You have the general feeling of being able to overcome adversity by discovering new things about yourself. In this film, Hillary Swank is a special gem like Next Karate Kid. You can really say that he has a bright future ahead of her. <br /> <br /> Do not say that this film is not without its problems. Unlike the first, Mr. Miyagi seems to be a little eager to convince Julie to learn martial arts and get her involved in the fight. It almost seems that he forgot what his values ​​were from the first film. Moreover, when one examines the monks one must have a suspended unbelief. The film makes the monks seem too simplistic a view of life, and in reality does not explain why they do what they do in the plot. The bad guys are also a bit questionable, even if the really unbeatable bad guys. I also have a suspicion about martial arts movies that end up in the night of the dance. <br /> <br /> So maybe this is not a perfect movie. So maybe this wouldn't be the best movie to rent on Friday night. However, in more ways than one, it is a guilty pleasure. Hillary Swank is so adorable and the story, although not original, works. In a genre of film that seems based only on action and violence, this is a breath of fresh air. Unlike all those Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van-Damme, this is a film about the spirit and the heart. There are some people who need movies like this, and we'll take whatever we can get. My vote: 8/10
