I suspect there is some revisionist history going on here, but one certainly comes up with the feeling that Patrice Lumumba was a source of problems that incited his people to violence from the moment the Congo declared independence. The inability to control his people and his decision to bring Soviet aid to rebuild his military was obviously what involved the United States and led to his assassination. However, replacing it with Mobutu, the United States has not solved anything. They made the situation just as bad. Well interpreted with excellent cinematography and a marked score. It's really worth seeing.
