This game is not exactly the best N64 game ever. Of course, that's fine, but only when there are 4 players. Without 4 players, the only fun thing to do is take remote mines and see how many people you can kill. But half of this game are levels where you have to save Natalya, so you'll have to limit your use of remote mines in those levels, and this gets quite boring. The graphics don't reach exactly the level of Super Mario 64 or even Mario Kart 64. And if you're talking about a great multiplayer in a first person shooter, you have to go with Perfect Dark. At least you can play "multiplayer" alone.
