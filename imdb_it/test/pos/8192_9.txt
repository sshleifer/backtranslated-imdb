May contain spoilers <br /> <br /> This historical film was so refreshing. Although it may be exaggerated compared to actual events, it shows the heartless nature of the emperor here, of which he was later infamous. And there was not a single computer-generated person in it. I think it's great that China has produced such an epic film. The costumes and settings were beautiful, even the performances were excellent. Dignity against death is an important theme in this film and I think it reflects Chinese history and culture. I also liked a little allusion to the terracotta warriors, a sculpted 3d map of the conquest of China with individual soldiers. Emperor Here, of course, after being buried with his life-size terracotta warriors. I also liked the scene with the dwarf, he was a very interesting character, even if he only had a small scene. <Br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
