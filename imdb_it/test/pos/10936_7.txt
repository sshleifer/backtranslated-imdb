There must have been some interesting conversations on the set of the Eagle's Wing, with Martin Sheen immediately after Apocalypse Now co-starring with the actor who replaced Coppola's film, Harvey Keitel. A real unloved child of a film, dating back to the last major western series in 1979-80, was much insulted at the time for being made by a British studio and director (conveniently ignoring the fact that many of the classics American westerns were headed by European immigrants), which seems a bit of an overreaction. <br /> <br /> The plot is simplicity itself, since Martin Sheen's inexperienced trapper finds himself fighting with Sam Waterston's nonsyllabic Kiowa warrior for owning a beautiful white horse, the Eagle's Wing, through a harsh and primitive landscape in a time "before the legends began". Apart from Caroline Langrishe's Irish housekeeper prisoner, the supporting cast has little to do (Stephane Audran never gets to open his mouth) and is a bit slow, but Anthony Harvey's film boasts a fantastic photo of Scope by Billy Williams and a good score from Marc Wilkinson.
