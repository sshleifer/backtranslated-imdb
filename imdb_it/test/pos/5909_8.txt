Billy Wilder has created a somewhat conventional biopic on the Charles Lindberg flight. He structures the film widely using flashbacks to tell the story of Lindberg leading to the famous flight across the Atlantic, which occurs in the present time in the film. Flying a plane for hours and hours is not the reason for the excitement, and Wilder has no intention of deviating from his theme of Lindberg as a hero of the common man, so things are predictable. However, James Stewart is well cast and quite credible as Lindberg, and the many obstacles he has to overcome just to have his plane in the air, keep looking at him. <br /> <br /> The film is played most successfully while Wilder weaves parts of the story in a way that creates tension, relief and tension. Cinematography is pretty good, Franz Waxman's soundtrack improves the scenes and Stewart really does seem to bring Lindberg to life, making him believe that it could be Lindberg. There is a bit of religious schmaltz from the 50s to the end, but overall the direction, acting and high production values ​​exceed the predictability of the story (someone should REALLY see this photo and DOES NOT know that Lindberg has crossed 'Atlantico?) To make a funny movie that has aged better than most of the films of that time. Billy Wilder has made films of a wide variety of types, and this is one of the most representative of his artisan talent.
