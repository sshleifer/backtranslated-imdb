In my opinion, the direction, editing, lighting and acting (minus Franco) were very good. I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed by this movie. I did not expect much in terms of shots, sounds, etc., but in these areas the film was not bad at all. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, I felt frustrated with both characters because I wanted so much that these two characters approached each other. And I felt like the character of Travis (Franco) wasn't really influenced or changed in the end, after Terri committed suicide. Although, this is probably due to the lack or inability of James Franco to express emotions (of any kind) very well in this film. I've seen some of Franco's other films, and for me he can't make it when a scene requires real emotions or facial expressions. The only positive that leads to the film is the possibility of more people watching this film. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Terri's portrayal of Rachel Miner was well done, and she seems to have a bright future ahead. I could really see and feel the sadness and emptiness in her character, and this made me feel for her. I just hope I could see more in Terri's life before the movie ended. <br /> <br /> For a short film, this film was good, but it leaves you more at the end. I just hoped it could have been just a little longer, to see the characters develop a little more. Despite this, I hope to see more films by the director and the crew in the future :)
