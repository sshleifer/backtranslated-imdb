Following a friend's advice, I took this movie. I am very fond of computers in general, so why a 1995 film on Internet identity theft cannot be left unnoticed. I had some negative echoes, but in the end I wasn't so disappointed: the story, although classic, is quite interesting and must have been really new in the days when it was distributed in theaters. I was happily surprised when I realized that, contrary to what we usually see, computer actions are somewhat realistic, since they use normal Windows 3.x and computers. Storytelling is median and does not disturb the viewer. The end is typically American. The actors' performance is overall OK, Sandra Bullock usually annoys me with her "oh my god why me" way, but this time she seems to have checked herself. I would recommend that movie.
