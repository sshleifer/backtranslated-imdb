I consider this film a complete masterpiece - in fact I consider it the best work by Fernando Fragata and undoubtedly the best of all Portuguese films. I don't think you can come across a film as "zero-budget" as impressive and surprising as this. <br /> <br /> The direction is made with perfection at an incredible pace and the music also composed by Fragata is largely excellent. The story is gruesome and fun at the same time, and it is certainly an advanced study of the old saying "Misery loves company", a type of situations intertwined with a shocking mystery. A recipe more than perfect to glue the eyes of the spectators to the screen from frame one to the last. <br /> <br /> It's called Neo-Hitchcock and I agree. Just like the best Hitchcocks, it made me guess during the whole movie and most of my assumptions were far behind for what ends up being intelligently revealed.
