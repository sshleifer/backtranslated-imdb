This is a great comedy, which highlights how it was to live alongside the racist bigot. But it also shows that both main characters are actually as bad as each other. Based on the successful ITV comedy, this is very politically incorrect. And even better, comedy is fun after all. The only downside is that there is not much of a plot. However the cast is fantastic as usual. Jack Smethurst and Rudolph Walker form an indomitable team, playing with each other in a unique way. Many years have passed since I saw this movie and last week I finally managed to buy it on DVD. The fact that the film still contains authentic moments of laughter means that I can recommend this film, just like in the early 1970s.
