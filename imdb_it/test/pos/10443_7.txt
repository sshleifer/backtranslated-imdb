This film was released when I was 15 and I could easily relate to the themes of the film. <br /> <br /> It was more than 24 years ago and I haven't seen the movie since. This time I worried about acting but I still enjoyed the film for what it is. <br /> <br /> Life is not always right and good guys don't always win, in fact I think the film went well to reflect on the fact that, especially as a teenager, bites always did better with lots of girls. Also, no matter how good you are, you can't make someone like you. Girls / boys like those they like, no matter how hard they try differently. Sometimes you just have to let it go and say later. <br /> <br /> Gary does a good job showing the intensity of his feelings for Karen. This is so true for teenagers when they stare at someone. <br /> <br /> I remember sitting around with my friends laughing out loud in some of the antics. The acting is not at all there compared to Fast Times at Ridgemount High, but he takes the piss on this movie simply because FTARH has a lame friendly spectator ending where this film has a realistic ending. The cute guy finishes last!! Gary comes across a worthy, rather lousy material, but we all know guys like this who are very sensitive. We all know David, a funny guy who makes you laugh. <br /> <br /> Some people here end the finale but hello the ending is exactly what can happen in real life. Some chicks come back more, no matter how bad it is, especially at that age. I experienced that first hand. <br /> <br /> Great soundtrack too !! U2 "I will follow" - Is Jesus so old?
