A surprisingly good and witty adventure that includes Kelsey Grammer (presumably in his first starring role in a feature film) as an unconventional Navy sub-commander who wants to run his own nuclear submarine, however; he earned it by competing against the US Navy in a series of war games with a crew of untested, questionable and amiable men (and even a woman). <br /> <br /> Director David S. Ward ("Major League") and his writers have put together a hysterically intelligent and optimistic comedy that tries to make the film easy to understand, which they do quite well. Secondly, in addition to the Grammer character, most of the crew provides a bit or a lot of the film's humor, which is treated as a double-edged sword. Three members of the supporting cast - Harland Williams, Toby Huss and Rob Schneider provide the funniest scenes, which include strange gestures, imitations and, well, their personalities. <br /> <br /> "Down Periscope" is more than a navy version of "Police Academy" or "The Dirty Dozen". What the film does is get the job done right and I liked it.
