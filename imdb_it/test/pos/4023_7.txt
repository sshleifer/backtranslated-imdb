Somehow, this film has carved its way into the weak point of my heart. Don't ask me how it happened, but I suppose the film stars Ed "I'll Sponsor Anything" McMahon as a puzzle flogger had a bit to do with it. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I was disappointed with the first Slaughter release in 1972. Nothing but a quick rebound match to follow Shaft-mania. How does the sequel move away from this? Big Jim Brown looks stronger than Slaughter here than in the first. Perhaps this is due to the fact that a year later he had something to work on, instead of his simple "Be like Shaft" motivation. <br /> <br /> The most important part of the film is the soundtrack provided by pimp-dad number one, James Brown. Almost every scene is embellished with a touch of funk from the Godfather. An excellent period film, for music, wardrobe, vehicles, jargon and hair. I must also point out that this film is also an excellent period film to represent a moment in film history when Jim Brown and Ed McMahon could actually shave their hair. <br /> <br /> Double the chicks, double the shot, triple the body count and factor into Ed McMahon and James Brown. You will be involved in an action movie from the late 1970s, one that overshadows its predecessor. For my money, Slaughter's Big Rip-Off can play ball with any Blaxploitation film ever made. Even tree. You may not agree, but Slaughter's Big Rip-Off has its own distinct touch. Something original was missing.
