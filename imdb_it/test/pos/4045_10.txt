People who compare this film to big hits like The Lord of the Rings or Matrix will inevitably be disappointed by the way this movie was shot. Although it is missing in the large special effects department and there are no battles with hundreds of extras, there is still a masterful fusion of two old folk tales here. The acting talent, although not A-list, is still exceptional and the interaction between the characters is perhaps more sincere than in a larger film with an A-list cast. My favorite in this film is Bridget Fonda, whose interpretation as the Snow Queen itself was quite moving, greatly assisted by a wonderful wardrobe and make-up. He injected humanity and a sense of pathos into the character of the fallen season, corrupted by the evil magic of the devil. Apart from acting it wasn't what was expected of Hollywood, which I think is a good thing since Hollywood seems to have run out of ideas on how to train its acting talent to play roles and so CGI and others have become stale and confident special effects to take us away from the actors who all use the same tricks on us. Instead, it shows new ideas with a real way of thinking on the part of actors about how they can find new variations on the old themes of love and danger.
