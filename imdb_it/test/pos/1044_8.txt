I love this movie about a columnist (Barbara Stanwyck) for a major homemaking magazine that delivers a welcome article every month that includes details of her fantastic life at home as a wife and mother in a beautiful Connecticut home. The problem occurs when the owner of his monthly publication asks to have him and a hero of the Second World War as guests during the Christmas holidays. Why are you worried? Because she lives in a small apartment in New York, she's not married, she doesn't have a baby and she can't cook at all! Hilarity (and romance) occurs when she tries to put up a credible act in an attempt to save face / avoid being fired by the magazine's owner (played by Sydney Greenstreet). This is a delightful comedy; one that I highly recommend to lovers of classic cinema !!!!
