I love military comedies (Sergeant Bilko, Stripes, In The Army Now, Major Payne) and Down Periscope is hilarious, but it also has a heart. <br /> <br /> The Stingray SS-161 (The USS Pampanito) was gorgeous. Absolutely beautiful, a work of art comes to life. So it was a diesel engine, then? I learned that the USS Ranger carrier (which represented The Enterprise in Star Trek IV), a huge ship, was "conventionally powered", which could mean that the Ranger was also a diesel. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene: Pascal: Jesus, Buckman, this may have been about stingray from Korea! This may have expired in 1966! Buckman: (Takes the full finger and tastes it) What's the matter, sir? It still has the taste of cornflour. <br /> <br /> Pascal: (screaming) Except it's PROSCIUTTO DEVILED !! Buckman: It would be a problem. <br /> <br /> It's a story, maybe a little forced, it seemed plausible. Winslow respected Dodge and seemed to worry about him, so he wanted to give Dodge a chance. He gave him an abused but still navigable Balao-class submarine, and assigned him the task of using the diesel submarine to escape the Nuclear Navy and "attack" the port of Charlston and Norfolk. The 2-star Admiral Graham (looking at his third star, and a grudge against Dodge) assigned him the crew, hoping that they would be ruined so Dodge would lose. Can Tom Dodge get the crew up to speed and work as a team, and can he take an old and obsolete submarine and beat the best of the Navy?
