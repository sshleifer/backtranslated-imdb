Reaches the minds and feelings of everyone by guiding them deep into the black desert. A brutal but beautiful world that is explored through memories and cutting layers of sound and score. The landscape develops its personality, parallel to the inner geography of all three characters as their stories develop. The stark emptiness of lost love, the fear of the unknown, and then the transcendence of emptiness through the opening of this desolation. Three misguided souls struggling to find something absolute and positive in all this negative space. The drama is compelling. James Franco and his co-stars offer skilled performances. Naive schoolboy, suicidal blonde, embittered car thief - everything converges with unexpected twists. Together they create an explosive portrait of fractured love - one that involuntarily conspires to repair between the most difficult forms of adversity and illusions - the blindness of human emotions.
