In the end I discovered what I thought I remembered as a four-year-old. After seeing the 1960 color version on VHS, I kept repeating that I had seen it black and white twice before. Now the IMDb helped me to know the truth, which was transmitted twice (2 productions) in black and white in 2 successful years, 1955 and 56. These are the ones I remember best when I was four. I didn't realize that the transmission of the 56 was not the same as the 55. In 1960, I was 9 and the production of the colors didn't do it for me. The black and white version was as wonderful with so much wonder and wonder as today's high-tech movies, even without computerized effects. You must have been there! Please comment if you have a similar reaction to the b & w version.
