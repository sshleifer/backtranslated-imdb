As you may know, Norway is the most developed country in the world (with regard to HDI, Human Development Index). This film cleverly reveals our future for us. Our future would be that of Norway as we are all rowing to get the best and offer the minimum. The life that was shown was perhaps an exaggeration, but comparing today's concerns with those of our ancestors is not a reasoning far from reality. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie free from all our pre-hypotheses, we can find both of our faces; the one who is laughing at Andreas' brilliant scene downloading his girlfriend and the one looking through the magazines for hours and hours to choose a stupid chair among the stupid collections. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the hole with the hope of lightness was another wonderful idea of ​​the film. The slight glory; yet the only one, and the effort that was made to achieve it, makes us feel closer to Andreas. Despite being attracted above all by the idea and the production of the film, Trond Fausa Aurvaag played quite well and the atmosphere of the film was quite matchable.
