Why take a perfect original drama, based on a perfectly good novel, and remake it as a quasi-musical? And throw it with actors who have no talent for singing or dancing? Quite similar to "Showgirls" or the two most recent "Star Wars" films, "Lost Horizon" is full of involuntary laughter. Who can forget Sir John Gielgud who smiles uncomfortably in his Dali Lhama outfit, overseeing an interpretive dance at the Republican party ("Family")? Or does Sally Kellerman warble lovingly with George Kennedy, making her best impression of Cher as she jumps from rock to rock ("Every Little Thing You Do")? And my favorite, Bobby Van, embodying the strength of the American education system ("Question Me An Answer")? I look forward to the release of the DVD, with the hope that it will contain comments from Liv Ullmann, who will eventually explain what she was thinking when she agreed to make this movie!
