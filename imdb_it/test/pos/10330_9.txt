I loved this show. I never understood why it was called Bug Juice though. I was about 13 years old when it came out. I remember that they had performed it during the summer holidays on channel 4, between the re-runs of Pugwalls summer and Saved by the bell or something like that. I remember sitting there and wanting to be at the summer camp too - ha ha. It seemed like all the kids were having so much fun, it was about "finding out who you are" and "growing". The first kisses and all that stuff. I remember that there was a really nice guy, I think it was the main reason why I woke up in the morning on that particular summer. Should they have more teen docu-soaps like this, I thought it was great!
