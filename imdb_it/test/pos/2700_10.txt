I saw King of Queens from the beginning, and I felt that he was overlooked in the awards. This show has the best humor, you can identify yourself with the characters, we talk a lot about it at work, because I work in a company very similar to IPS, (DHL) and we love the thorns Teamster !! Carrie is my hero, she is the best, she simply puts her out, regardless of the subject. Arthur well what can you say? He just made you collapse and really gave things a spin. Doug, well, it's so adorable and fun, the three characters, in addition to all the friends, complete the show. This is the best comedy on TV !! I'd say up there with Seinfeld, and hi, there's nothing wrong with that .... Excellent !! as Doug would say.
