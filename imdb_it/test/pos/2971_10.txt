when I heard about this film, I noticed that it was one of the most controversial films of the 70s. I noticed that the music was from Elton John, so I thought I had nothing to lose, so I understood. What a surprise!!! The film was fantastic. It was true love is everything. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money and sometimes no food, they were still happy. I recommended this film to all my friends, but everyone criticized my taste, and they even called me, because the film contained two naked minors. I think it made the movie more realistic. The cinematography was great and only showed the great skills of director Lewis Gilbert
