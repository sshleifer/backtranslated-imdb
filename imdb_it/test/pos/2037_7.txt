Surprisingly well-starred and well-written film about the decent young rock-hard guy who gets the long-awaited ticket for the celebrity: his favorite heavy metal band wants to replace their singer. Not unlikely, the film tries to keep things in perspective and not to exaggerate; certainly makes you think twice about those lingering teenage fantasies about being in the music world. But the script, despite a solid dialogue, follows a tried and tested scheme, and gets bogged down by its own clich√©s in the final act. I liked it more than the soft "Almost Famous" raspberry. It has a nice bitter side to go with its heavy metal decadence, but a stronger finish could have made it more memorable. ** 1/2 from ****
