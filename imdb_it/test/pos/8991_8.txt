The film forever strong will never be nominated for an Oscar, it will never be nominated for the best performance, for the best film. But this film has things that other films don't have. In a nation with so much scandal, so many problems, films are spilled with little attention to the morality of society, at least this film promotes well. What's wrong with something that promotes happiness? We should support films that tell our American kids that there is more to life than sexual drugs and alcohol. As for this debate on Haka, as previously stated, Hakka is not exclusive to New Zealand All Blacks, several teams and colleges of Utah high schools perform this ritual before the games. Including Hawaii, BYU, etc.
