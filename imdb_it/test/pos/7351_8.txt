This, without any doubt, is the biggest spin off for Jackass that has ever been done, hell, it even blows Jackass out of the water. <br /> <br /> Picture this: You have a bunch of guys who just didn't want to grow, throw a lot of money, and some really interesting tricks, and you have Viva La Bam. <br /> <br /> This show is so familiar, and it's not just "the band" running racing in full jerks (as in Jackass). For example: Bam's parents, April and Phil, are present in every episode, with the appearances of the obese uncle of Bam, Don Vito at the boot! The reason why the Margera family makes us laugh is simple: some of our family can identify themselves. April: The woman who wants to live life according to the book and follow the tradition. Phil: The guy who tries to be a good father and, finally, Bam: that son who never grew up in high school. <br /> <br /> Jokes and jokes in each episode will give you a safe laugh, and buying DVDs is definitely recommended! Another thing that is surprising to see, is the way in which Margera is casual. In the interviews he said that for most of the episodes, he does not act, and is simply behaving from instinct. <br /> <br /> What I liked most about the whole thing, however, is the amount of influence Margera has over MTV. He wanted Slayer to play in his backyard, MTV did. He wanted to be with Dani Filth for a day and do a Cradle Of Filth concert in his backyard, it happened. <br /> <br /> Add to this his passion for the love-metal band (and discussed as emo). and his brother CKY's garage group, and there's a lot of head shots going on. <br /> <br /> If you liked Jackass, you'll love this one. I borrowed Season 1 from a friend last year and gave up my legs to meet Viva La Bam Crew. You will not be disappointed, and I can promise that you will be fine by the end of it all!
