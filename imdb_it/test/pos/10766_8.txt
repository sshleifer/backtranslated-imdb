I thought it was a great movie. Someone said he was "sick", so they couldn't watch him. I think if you realize its nominal R then you will be prepared for nudity and drug use. It's a beautiful story and the acting is incredible. Only it cannot be a prude to appreciate it! It's basically a mother who uses drugs and wants to be clean, so she calls a very rich old friend and transfers them to her estate and crazy things happen. I guess it's a drama. I'm so sick of people who don't like movies because of curses or nudity. This is the world we live in. Obviously you're not comfortable with yourself if you can't see things like this movie. And he's rated R. So, this should tell you right from the start that they're not all happy rainbows. I liked it. I think you will too!
