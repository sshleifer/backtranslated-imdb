After three exceptional BBC television series and a Christmas special, the bizarre and grotesque (and perversely adorable) characters of the desolate imaginary city of Royston Vasey make the leap to celluloid, along with their creators: The League of Gentlemen. <br /> <br /> Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith are the three most familiar quarters of the quartet, with the central roles shared between the trio. In a further touch, the last team member, Jeremy Dyson, is played by actor Michael Sheen. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Dyson (Sheen) is in conversation with his writing cohorts, when - a horror of horrors - he is visited by two of his most gray characters. Both Tubbs (Pemberton) and Edward Tattsyrup (Shearsmith) are unhappy with the League's decision to kill the inhabitants of Vasey. "You're not real!" screams Dyson in vain, as local shopkeepers from hell demand their revenge. Chaos begins, while reality and Vasey converge with the vast array of characters entering our world to save them. <br /> confused? Sarai, like the field, subjected to the Teutonic, Herr Lipp (Pemberton) is forced to take the daily appearance of Pemberton (Pemberton), while Pemberton (Pemberton) is kidnapped by the cannibalist butcher Hillary Briss (Gatiss) and Geoff Tipps (Shearsmith). <br /> <br /> With the shadows of a Misery even more demented, Briss tries to force Pemberton to rewrite the film - thus continuing his life - but leaving Geoff in charge is never a good idea. The former comedian finds himself involved in The League's latest post-vascular adventure - The King's Evil - which enters a typically twisted 17th-century England, complete with cameos by Victoria Wood, Peter Kay and David Warner. Known as George of Asda (thanks to his selected clothing line), Geoff saves the day and is treated like a hero, but for the film's epilogue, he joins old and new characters in the Church of Royston Vasey to meet with the their maker. <br /> <br /> For the fans of the series, the film is not to be missed. And yes, Pope Lazarou is also present (albeit a little fleetingly). Pauline, Mickey, Barbara and the damn veterinarian Matthew Chinnery are some of the other favorites on display, and even the portrait of The League (besides Sheen's as Dyson) is a fascinating insight. <br /> <br /> The League of Gentlemen are the Radioheads of British comedy: they are ambitious, revolutionary (they testify to the excellent series Three) and are not happy to rest on their laurels. They also divide opinion accordingly. <br /> <br /> Certainly, their macabre sense of humor is not for all palates, and while it is not written exclusively for "fans", an understanding of the plot would benefit those they have seen before the series. However, Apocalypse is a film in its own right and The League, without a doubt, will succeed in attracting a new generation of fans, besides satisfying and liking the existing ones.
