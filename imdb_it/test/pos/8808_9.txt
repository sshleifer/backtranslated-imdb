I remember a time when there was only one thing in which clubs, drugs, pubs and parties. This film came out a couple of years after I started going to the disco. If I had never discovered the worst side of things, this movie might not make sense to me. That night, when I looked at it for the first time, with some friends, I was completely blown away. I had never seen a movie that hit so close to the reality of where I was in my life at the time. Almost everything I could relate to in any way. There was never a character in which I could relate fully, but more a combination of all of them in one way or another. My companions where it is not different and I remember that we all say that they where we or we where they. We've all been out together that weekend doing exactly what the crew is doing in HT. We, when we went down as we watched and when the film "came down", I remember that I actually came a little further. actually it was rather depressing in our room during those "low points". Here's what's so good about human traffic. really touches the whole situation. <br /> <br /> is a unique film in the way it is not driven by the plot, but it is not completely character-driven, although the characters are important. always seemed to be based on situations. Situations as a group and as individuals. Each character is lost in life, for his own reasons. yet each of them responds to the loss in the same way. I work any job to make money to pay for the weekend and escape everything. for them it is their vacation. But the reality is that you can't really run away. Another situation that everyone has to face. <br /> <br /> Me and my companions are no different from these guys. We all had our things going. Human trafficking helped explain to us what we don't understand about ourselves. He does it in a way that doesn't speak to you. It made us feel like we were the only ones out there like us and the lessons learned from where many others from all over the world had passed. it wasn't until my lifestyle changed from a party popper to a career that I fully understood this film. These days I watch HT, every now and then (as I just did), and it recalls the old days. No other film can do it. I was popper, I was jip travolta, I went to never land with my chosen family. I have $ 200 in my rear burner and I'm looking for the bag! No problem!
