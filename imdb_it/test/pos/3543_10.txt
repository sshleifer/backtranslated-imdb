When I read the synopsis of "Messiah" in the TV guide, I was not prepared for what was in store. The story follows DCI Metcalfe who tries to solve a case of gruesome murders that is carried around London. Soon he realizes a scheme, there is a serial killer in freedom, he kills people with names and jobs similar to those of the 12 Apostles and their killings are identical to their corresponding Apostle. The two-part series kept me right on the edge of my seat, with Metcalfe closely following the killer, but he always missed it in a couple of seconds and finding the gruesome mess he left behind his unlucky victim. "Messiah" is sure to cause much controversy, but it is the biggest piece of drama that the BBC has shown for a long time.
