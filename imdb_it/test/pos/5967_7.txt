I missed the beginning of the movie. I entered when the partisans were in the farmhouse. I can honestly say that it was terrifying. The moral ramifications are staggering. <br /> <br /> My fear of pain and torture leaves me unable to see myself as a coward. I see the ability of Christ that was represented by the brave patriot, and I can only pray that I could or will have moral turpitude to follow his example. <br /> <br /> I see that the main theme of the film is to show the weakness / strength of the tortured, but what a sad decision to face. All because the soul of man can be distorted in such a way that the pain and suffering that they carry on another human being is somehow satisfying. Be mental or physical. <br /> <br /> I found the film very inspiring.
