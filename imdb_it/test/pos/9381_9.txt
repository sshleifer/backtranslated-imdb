"Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" by George Barry is, at its root, a dark fairy tale told through a horror film. It is, in my opinion, one of the best films of the 70s and it is decidedly criminal that the film was stolen and distributed without Barry's knowledge (those responsible for this theft should be brought to bed ASAP). If you are looking for a gore or angry action, "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is not the film for you. "Death Bed" is a sweeter, stranger image; sounds like an absolutely strange dream, half remembered. I would recommend reading the Stephen Thrower quote from "Death Bed" in Thrower's FAB Press book, "Nightmare USA" (it perfectly describes the atmosphere of the film). Whether intentional or not, I noticed the nuances of "Death Bed" in all the films, from the "Ghosts" movies to "The Cemetery Man" by Michele Soavi to the narrative of magical / slipstream realism of authors like Kelly Link. Barry is an original world and in a fair, I'm sure he would follow "Death Bed" with a series of fantastically bizarre movies.
