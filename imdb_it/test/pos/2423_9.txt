*** SPOILERS *** Feeling lonely and in need of companionship and love Frances Austen, Sandy Dennis, keeps all these emotions inside as she walks through life like a young single woman who has many high class friends. But for reasons of her profound insecurity she keeps them with open arms. As for Frances's male friends, they are not close to his age, so he will have no reason to have a romantic involvement with them. <br /> <br /> Early one evening, while Frances was entertaining some of her friends, she sees out of the apartment window a young man, Michael Burns, sitting alone in the chilly rain. Feeling homeless and only after his friends have left, Frances goes out to the park and offers the young man's shelter at his house until the rain subsides and even to stay for the night in a guest room that she has. You can immediately see that Frances is more interested in making sure the young man is sheltered from cold and rain, so she wants to have him as a lover of friends or even play toys all for herself and as the movie progresses you see that you were right. <br /> <br /> A truly amazing performance by Sandy Dennis that in a way resembles that of Kathy Bates in the "Misery" movie that was made in 1990 about twenty years later. Frances thinks the young man is alone and homeless and, later, when he meets him, he sees the perfect person for her as a true friend. She is in no way equal to or better than her like her friends, doctors, lawyers, Indian chiefs, and therefore she is totally dependent on her. Later it turns out that the young man is not the solitary and homeless person that Frances thought he was. It is when he slowly discovers that he does not really need her and that he manipulates her, but vice versa, he starts something in Frances's mind that turns out to be a compulsion of homicidal proportions. <br /> <br /> A truly bizarre film by director Robert Altman that penetrates deep into the solitude and depression of the human mind. Actress Sandy Dennis is as perfect as the personality of Dr. Jekyll and Miss. Hyde in his interpretation of the solitary but at the same time dangerous of Frances Austen and it is a pity that not only did he not get an Oscar for his role in the film but he was not even nominated for it. <br /> <br /> Like many of Robert Altman's films there seems to be a lot of improvisation between the actors of the film and the dialogue at libellus, especially between the sister of young Nina, Susanne Benton and her boyfriend Nick, David Garfield. The only thing in the film that I found confusing is when we see Frances going to a clinic in the city to have a complete gynecological exam and she tells the doctor she expects to get married very soon. Was your husband the young man in your apartment? But beyond that the film sticks quite well to the story and the ending is a real shock for the audience as well as for the young man. When he finally realizes that Frances is not just a little off-the-wall but deadly mad.
