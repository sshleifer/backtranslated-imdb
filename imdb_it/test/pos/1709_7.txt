I have been a fan of the Larry King show for a while, I think he did a great job overall and I don't think he ever pretends to be, as so many people seem to believe. It's a subtle Scorpio, it puts in the zig when it needs it, just like it did last night with Paris Hilton, during its first post-jail television interview. <br /> <br /> The thing about this whole case that really surprised me is that Hilton is apparently still unaware of why Judge Sauer gave her what she believes was too harsh a sentence (and moreover , actually MADE to serve it). In all the time she was in prison, apparently alone 23 hours a day in her cell, she never, once in her mind, rewound the events that brought her the sentence that Judge Sauer thought it appropriate to impose on her. She never realized that she could have unleashed an important red flag when she (1) showed up late for the original audition and (2) continued to inform him, when he asked her not to know that her license had been suspended, did not receive the documents by mail, that "I have people who read this kind of thing for me". <br /> <br /> As long as she was in her cell, she never realized that this action (shown until late) and that statement - and above all, the attitude - of the knight's total disregard for the court system and the law in general and its driving privileges, in particular, that showed - could have made it so that Judge Sauer (excuse the pun) gets angry with her. <br /> <br /> Last night, during King's show, after speaking in words about how she was forever changed by her traumatic experience, how she "learned" her lesson, she answered her question , "Do you think I have a raw deal?" With a resounding yes. And during the conversation (if you can call her that), she said more than once that she didn't feel she deserved what had happened to her. King asked, kindly, more than once, if he does not feel that he creates the situations of his life in which he "finds" himself, to which she practically stares without understanding. Basically, therefore, he supports the conscious belief that he was a victim of this situation; he does not understand how he himself caused her, that day in court, from his contemptuous attitude to the judge. I feel this is very sad - tragic, even, considering that a huge Hilton "model" is for some people, and makes whatever it said last night about its so-called rehabilitated state in the realms of complete and total incapacity, contradiction and hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> Throughout the interview, Hilton alluded to spending a lot of time in her cell reading the Bible. At the end of the interview, King obtained important points asking her what was her favorite biblical passage. She answered, feeling perplexed her pathetic notes (completely superficial non-intuitions, which she had read on the air as if it were Nelson Mandella or something like that) and finally grunting: "I don't have a favorite passage". <br /> <br /> Judge Sauer, in my book, is a hero, and after last night, that's Larry King, for subtly exposing Hilton to what he really is.
