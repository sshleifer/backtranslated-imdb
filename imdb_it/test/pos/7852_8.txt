This is a good movie, I won't go into details because the other comments from users do a good job of taking care of them. However, I disagree with the statement that this is Eastwood's best work. This is not a very defensible position based on the volume of strong films that he directed and performed. I would like to note that I find it interesting that two of the actresses who starred in this film, Pattye Mattick and Peggy Drier, have never appeared again in another film or TV show, despite good performances. My curiosity asked me what happened to these two actresses?
