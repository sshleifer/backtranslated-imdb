Easily one of the best Indian films of all time. Sure, it's not saying much (I made this conclusion after a huge 15 minutes of watching). But I can really say that Fire is also one of the really beautiful and brilliant films I've seen. <br /> <br /> Nice for his images. The best example I can give is the parallelism between the two female protagonists (Radha and Sita) and the characters of the same name in Hindu mythology. Sita, for example, is the wife of the revered Lord Ram. As legend has it, Ram subjugates his wife by making her walk through a fire to demonstrate his "purity". Sita, in response, cries and abandons him, rejoining her mother (the Earth). This story has all kinds of crazy connections to the stories of the 2 Indian women (Nandita Das and Shabana Azmi). The word "Fire" suddenly has many meanings: marriage, tradition, religion, motherhood and probably some others that I have not captured. <br /> <br /> Brilliant because of its social implications. Many of those who have been offended by the premise for this film should actually be the first to see the fire (for example, my mother, who really loved it). Why? Because although Fire is an attack on tradition, it is also an attack on tradition. In other words, this is his strength, NOT his weakness. Traditional conservative social customs (Indian or Canadian or American or similar) are useless if they enslave you. Gender roles and self-denial can both do this. <br /> <br /> These are the things I brought with me after seeing Fire. Hats off to Deepa Mehta ??
