A very different film by Jerry Lewis, not like all the most famous movies that everyone knows. Lewis addresses the difficult task of the Second World War and of National Socialism in Germany in a rather unconventional way. But even more interesting and important, it does so in a very little American way. And as with so many things in the world and especially in the film industry, an American means more sophisticated, thinner, smarter or simply better. This is why the film was not successful in the United States, but a huge success in Europe. <br /> <br /> All in all, Jerry Lewis has shown from this film that he is able to do much simpler slapstick comedy.
