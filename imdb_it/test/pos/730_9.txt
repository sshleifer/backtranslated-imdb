Nemesis Game is a film that rips the mind full of puzzles, death, mystery and philosophy. In its simplest sense, the film is about finding answers and what happens when you've finally found them all. The search for answers brings Sarah Novak on a path that becomes more obscure as it becomes more engaging. The final answer seems more dangerous than it is, yet Sarah is so close to understanding it. What would you do if you were offered the chance to finally make sense of the chaos of life? <br /> <br /> The film was written and directed by Jesse Warn. While this was Warn's first feature film, the film does not reflect this at all, but instead shows a polished appearance and an artistic approach in telling the story. Carly Pope was powerful in the title role and showed a depth of complexity that was fascinating to watch. I would certainly like to see more of his work. <br /> <br /> Being based on riddles, this is a very cerebral film. This is your thing, since it is mine, so I absolutely recommend seeing Nemesis Game. Score: 4.5 / 5
