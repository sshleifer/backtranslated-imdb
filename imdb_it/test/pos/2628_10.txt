Roy Thinnes and Joan Hackett are exceptional in this 1970s melodrama. The lush settings, eerie music and plot weaves make it a really interesting movie. I saw it when it first came out on TV. Once again it aired when I had a VCR, but I didn't have the chance to record it. I'd like it on VHS if someone has a copy. Apart from the suspense (which worked wonderfully), I feel that the story is unique, and is practically faithful to the book, MRS. BUSINESS FROM THE MAITLAND by Margaret Lynn. I would say that it was one of the most neglected films of the 70s outside TV movies. I gave the film a vote number 10, because it is made with so much originality. There is a real pathos and a romantic air that has the viewer sympathizing with the culprit.
