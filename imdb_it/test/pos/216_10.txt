The inspiration for the films "Naked Gun" projects Leslie Nielsen - who had recently started making the comedy * - like the incompetent but heroic Frank Drebin, always having to solve an absurd case. Like "Plane!" and the films based on the series, humor is based on Mel Brooks-style spot gags and silly comments (ie "yes, it's" observations), along with the fact that Nielsen remains very serious despite the absurdities surrounding him. And, of course, the final frame, in which something keeps moving. <br /> <br /> Too bad the show only had six episodes. At least he made the movies. You can't go wrong with Leslie Nielsen in this kind of role. I suspect everyone has enjoyed filming it. Really fun. <br /> <br /> * Before "Airplane!", Leslie Nielsen had starred in films such as "Forbidden Planet", "Harlow" and "The Poseidon Adventure". Still in 1987 he starred in "Nuts" with Barbra Streisand and Richard Dreyfuss. But from the first movie "Naked Gun" has always been a whole comedy.
