Until you don't mind paying a little more attention than you could normally do for other films, this is one of the best "thrillers" you've ever seen. The film portrays an episode that could occur in real life; nothing in it seems at all fictitious, indeed. It also describes how people could react in real life. <br /> <br /> In fact, it portrays them so well that it looks real. Combine this with the lack of a soundtrack, and you've almost got the best news movie you've ever seen. Jane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are particularly good at this masterpiece of the late seventies, arousing concern for its end and an authentic tragic pity for its end. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves thrillers.
