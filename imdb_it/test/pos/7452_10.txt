I don't have much to say that this is a great ending to the story. Most people have said that there is not enough plot and its only eye candy. But think about it, everything has been explained in FFVII that no more plot can be added to such a big story that it would ruin it. They did the best they could do and I think this should be taken more like a final FMV .. the last fight. <br /> <br /> Graphics - 10/10, absolutely amazing <br /> <br /> History 8.5 / 10 - I don't think they could expand it even more. And the things they could put there were smart enough, I thought. <br /> <br /> Characters 9/10 - Well, most of them have already been explained during the game, but have not yet managed to contain everything in 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Sound - 10/10, since I'm a metal fan, I loved fighting music .. and the piano comes right in there ... It's a great ST and I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br /> Tilt / Replay 10/10 - Fun every time. <br /> <br /> Overall- 9/10 (FF Fan View 10/10) <br /> <br /> Personally I think this is what was needed, a struggle to put an end to everything ... the plot was already in place. The action was as necessary as people complained. I loved every second of this movie. It was a pleasure to visit the world of FFVII only one last time. <br /> <br /> Just remember that ... most of the movies that have been made from a game have been directed by the directors, I think this is nice enough for a team of game directors .. I don't think I have saw a better movie for the movie .. <br /> <br /> Thankyou Square, I think you did well!
