Realistic masterpiece. Thirty years later, the images may seem a little old, but in reality, the film's "punch to face" effect is only accurate. I've never seen a movie like this in my life. The first time I saw it, I didn't know if it was a fiction ... And it didn't seem ... That film is a masterpiece that every single person in the world must see. It is the best film of the company ever. The definitive film that shows that the system does not work. And the system hasn't changed much in thirty years. I think this film should be seen as a piece of education.
