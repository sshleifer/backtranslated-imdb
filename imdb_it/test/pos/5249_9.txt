This is an extraordinary film musically. It made me feel horrible that Rodrigues died in 1999, before I had the chance to see it live. To know that he played a wonderful Lincoln Ctr. concert in 1991 and that I may have been there but it is not it is painful beyond words. <br /> <br /> I just purchased my first Amalia recording. While the musical recording is fantastic, being able, in this film, to SEE his face and his tremendous expressiveness and passion while singing these songs of terrible sadness is wonderful. A bit like seeing the face of Mary as she cradles Jesus in her arms in the Piet√†. Watching her in a film reminded me of having witnessed an extraordinary concert performance similar to that of Mercedes Sosa in the mid-90s at Lincoln Ctr. As I sat listening to Mercedes sing, I felt I was in the presence of a tremendous spiritual and musical force that contained an extraordinary primordial power. Some of the musical segments of "The Art of Amalia" are moving, like Caetano Veloso who pays tribute to Amalia and sings one of his solo songs in front of a concert hall. The musical segments also convey the incredible international reach of her musical repertoire and the ties she has created. fans all over the world. There is a segment in which she claims to have played in every single city in Italy that has a stage! <br /> <br /> In another section, Amalia talks about her meeting with her. mouth cancer and how she came to New York to commit suicide in a hotel. Yet, watching Fred Astaire's videos, he gradually persuaded himself that life was worth living and he walked away from killing himself. Amazing! Later in the film, he bravely enough and directly admits to the interviewer that although he could musically conquer the world, his private life was of pure sadness. She admits she was never happy. This is unbearably sad to hear, but perfectly in keeping w. a singer immersed in fado (which translates as "bad luck" or "bad luck") tradition. Also, you want to know more about her personal life: what was inside that made her so sad? what were his disappointments? <br /> <br /> "The art of Amalia" is a bit disappointing in other important areas. My quibbles: show 20-30 complete songs in the film, but providing only an English translation for the last seems a waste (unless the film was only intended for a Portuguese-speaking audience, which I can't imagine) . Seeing the deep pain on his face as he sings and doesn't understand the text is a disappointment. As for the other negative aspects: there is almost no biographical material on the family background of Amalia. There is a 20 sec. snippet w. she sings w. his mother (it's absolutely great). There is a brief reference to his parents who move fr. the campaign in Lisbon. I would have liked to see the shooting of the village from which it came. The interviews as they are are almost exclusively w. Amalia herself (and some close friends). She is a good but not exceptional subject. There are no interview subjects who are experts in fado or Portuguese culture and society, so we don't fully understand its musical roots. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a wonderful film that everyone interested in Amalia should see. But it is not a perfect or definitive work on the subject.
