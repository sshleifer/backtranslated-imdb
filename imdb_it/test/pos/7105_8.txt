The last of the sequels, not to mention Abbott and Costello, meet Frankenstein, who was more or less a parody. This Dracula (John Carridine) is at the center of the stage looking for a cure for his vampirism by a kind doctor (Onslow Stevens). Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr) also presents himself looking for a cure. The good doctor manages to heal Larry's werewolf, but Dracula deceives the doctor and ends up contaminating his blood and makes the good doctor a crazy fool. waiting for its electricity, so it can ruin a little. It was a kind of short film, about 70 minutes and some changes, but the action is there, and there are also the great actors. he introduces himself as a police inspector, here are some curiosities, Lionel appeared in Frankenstein's son, the ghost of Frankenstein, Frankenstein meets the wolf man and the house of Frankenstein. and then this. If there was another one in the series, they might have added the creature from the black lagoon to the line, I'm giving Dracula's house 8 out of 10.
