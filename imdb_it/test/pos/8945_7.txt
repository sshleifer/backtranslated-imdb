A humorous journey in the normal funeral business. It's easy to look at and also offers Blethyn & Molina who steals a scene from an old Fred & Ginger movie. Walken is over the top as a zealous Molina competitor in business, trying to bring a new style to an old Welsh town. Let's see a couple of very funny examples of the "new style". The plot thickens with Pugh having an affair with Watts, and she suggests letting Blethyn in. Meanwhile Molina has rekindled her long romantic suffering for Blethyn, and convinces her to pretend his death so she can escape to the South Seas, and dance their days together. During the "fake" funeral Blethyn discovers the husbands' infidelities and plots his revenge. Watch it to see what funerals should be - a celebration of life!
