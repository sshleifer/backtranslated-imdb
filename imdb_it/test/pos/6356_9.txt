This film is an excellent example of what an independent film can be. The director does a great job on the line between emotional violence and physical violence. But in the end, remember what so many indie films forget - tell a good story. While watching this film, I was reminded of how the most expensive Hollywood movies have become shy and banal. <br /> <br /> Particularly noteworthy, it is an exceptionally strong performance of the protagonist of the film - Jorge Cordova. Like a criminal thug (on his way to the top of the crime pile) Cordova plays a S.O.B. conniving, brutal, presumptuous, sneaky and shabby, but it's so nice that it keeps you entertained all the time. I read somewhere that these guys were part of the New Wave of Latino Filmmakers in Los Angeles, called La Nueva Obra, or something like that. However, this film makes you look forward to seeing more of their work. <br /> <br />
