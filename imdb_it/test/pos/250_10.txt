"Cover Girl" is the best musical ever made by Rita Hayworth. Ms. Hayworth will always be remembered for "Guild", however, the next film would be "Cover Girl". The story is great. It's about a dancer who wants to be a cover girl and makes him great in show business. He does it without the help of his talented dancer / director boyfriend (Gene Kelly). Mr. Kelly has the ability to choreograph musical numbers. The dances are spectacular. It's fun to see Phil Silvers, a comedian, making musical numbers with Mrs. Hayworth and Mr. Kelly. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is perfect. Lee Bowman is given the chance to be an interesting third wheel, the other boyfriend.
