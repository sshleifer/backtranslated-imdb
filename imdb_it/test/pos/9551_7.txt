Friend, I liked it a lot, if only for Fred Willard's comment on the dog show. There are some dead spots and some gags that don't work, but overall the movie works very well. When I was younger, my parents raised dogs and the people I met in those shows weren't significantly less bizarre than the freaks on this show, I can assure you. <br /> <br /> I liked this film because of its artistry and its comments on how we tend to take frivolous things too seriously ... I liked acting for its accuracy (most accents were impeccable) and its subtlety (I loved the way each person walked with their dogs) ... <br /> <br /> Rent this movie if you have any appreciation for the strangeness of human existence.
