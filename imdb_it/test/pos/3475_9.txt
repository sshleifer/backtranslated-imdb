Inside I'm Dancing (Rory O'Shea Was Here) is the story of two young disabled people, Rory O'Shea, who is almost completely immobilized and confined to a wheelchair, and Michael Connelly who is debilitated by MS and confined to a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> Set in Ireland, the film opens with Rory arriving at an assisted living center. Eventually he becomes friends with Michael, but only after a few tense scenes in which Rory rebels against the staff and other patients in the usual "cinematic way" that plays loud metal music, using vulgar words and a general offense. His budding friendship with Michael is cemented by the fact that Rory seems to be the only one to understand Michael, or at least he is willing to try. <br /> <br /> In the end, through some trial and tribulation, the couple's petition, and they are granted, the right to live in their own specially adapted apartment. The apartment is paid for by Michael's father who had basically given up his disability. The two also hire an attractive assistant named Siobhan (played by Romola Garai) to help them in their daily lives. This is essentially the point where the crux of the film develops as they both develop feelings for her. Michael is particularly hard hit. Unfortunately, for both, but especially for Michael, Siobhan doesn't feel the same and it follows that he has to leave. As Michael temporarily regresses and wants to return to the Ast. Living Center, Rory convinces him to continue living alone. The film ends with a sad note, which many viewers may have seen coming, but in the end, we feel that Michael has become truly independent and the future is his, as Rory pointed out towards the end of the film. > <br /> You know, I can't say I saw a lot of "disabled movies" and I don't know if they could be considered a specific genre. But there is a kind of formula for them. A person is not willing to live beyond his illness until some liberating force forces him to do so and Inside I'm Dancing is really different. What works, however, is probably thinner than the peaks and valleys crossed by the two men and what you might expect. There are no intentionally free moments and no "get up and rejoice" manipulations. The sad parts are sad and the fun parts are fun. Some viewers might portray a bit the fact that Rory is the punk type with spiky hair with the earring on his nose as the perfect "rebel" clich√©, but the actor, James McAvoy, somehow makes it real. The same can be said for Steven Robertson, who plays Michael. When Michael's heart is broken he doesn't seem to be invoked by a poor script that tries to make the public work, but rather a young man genuinely worried about unrequited love. The kind of pain that many can relate to regardless of their physical condition. Again, these are the kinds of things that make the movie work and make it moving without being intrusive and fun on many levels. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
