My brother made me fall in love with Carlin in the 1970s. I have always loved his observational humor. That is, looking at things every day and finding humor in it, as if I were asking the question "Have you ever tried to throw away an old waste basket? You can't do it! They keep bringing you back in you!" And by asking questions like why the word kills is more acceptable than the word "F", while giving a prefect meaning to the discussion. <br /> <br /> However, during the 1990s his stuff was less funny and more angry. What he seemed to do was hold a mirror on the face of the company and say "take a look!" At this point, his shows were less than a comedy show, and more than a complaint session. But in all honesty he always gave a tremendous sense. It really made you think. <br /> <br /> Here is old and new Carlin. Start the fun that can be had aging and then beating the state of the world. Once again it makes perfect sense. <br /> <br /> This was his best from "Jammin 'in New York", and how he turned out to be his last. <br /> <br /> I think what was "The Shootist" to John Wayne, or "A Prairie Home Companion" by Robert Altman, "It's Bad For Ya" is for George Carlin. An affectionate farewell to a true great icon. Love it or hate it, I think it will be remembered.
