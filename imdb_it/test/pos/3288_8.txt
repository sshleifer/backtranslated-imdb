The electronic fugitive Brian Foster (a pleasant performance by Wesley Eure of "Land of the Lost") creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for Canine Home Protection System) for his boss Mr. Ralph Norton (played by Conrad Baain), whose home security business is problematic. A rival company hires a couple of inept criminals to get their greasy hands on C.H.O.M.P.S.; said task turns out to be easier said than done. The director Don Chaffey tells the captivating story with a steady and lively rhythm, he maintains a pleasantly stupid and carefree tone, and stages the clumsy antics with a remarkable touch. In addition, the cast of the game annoys him with infectious ease: the lovely Valerie Bertinelli as Brian Casey Norton's sweet boyfriend, Chuck McCann as Klutzy Crook Brooks, Red Buttons as McCack, the equally sociable unbeaten Bracken, Jim Backus In the role of the evil CEO Mr. Gibbs, Hermoine Baddeley as the beautiful and bizarre Mrs Foster, and the exploitation of the AIP in the 1960s, he regularly performs in Larry Bishop as Duply, a thin and deceptive dress. Best of all, the dog owner is a cuddle delight: C.H.O.M.P.S. jumps through fences, walls and windows with incredible agility, performs acts of exceptional strength, runs faster than a deer and even does some martial arts moves. A subplot of a mammoth neighborhood hound named Monster provides some extra belly laughs (Monster is voiced by an unaccredited boy with an appropriately deep and growing voice). The solid animated sequence of the opening titles, the glossy cinematography of Charles F. Wheeler and the funky and pulsating soundtrack by Hoyt Curtin are equally solid. A cute little movie for kids.
