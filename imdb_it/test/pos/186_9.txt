This is a magnificent film and in many ways impressive. I saw it on TV when I was little, with my throat almost strangled by tears, and still on the beautifully restored DVD Criterion. <br /> <br /> Cranes is the very essence of the War Weepie. Imagine Cherbourg Umbrellas without music and without color, or Waterloo Bridge without class consciousness. <br /> <br /> Tatiana Samoilova, a cross between Vivien Leigh and Bjork, is profoundly influencing like a beautiful girl whose boyfriend enlists and does not write or return. <br /> <br /> The fiance, Boris, dies on the front, and his death scene is indescribably romantic. Very bold, because so close to "over the top". But that scene will stay with you. <br /> <br /> Although the Soviets were so defined by the Second World War, the film is rather harsh and more powerful. The pre-war and post-war scenes have a lot of atmosphere since 1957. There is no attempt to detail the period. The entire film becomes more and more stylized, up to the Siberian scenes, which feel like a set of modern works (which is a compliment). The final cathartic scene is milked to its last drop - again, comparable to Cherbourg. The production seems like a big budget (those scale scenes must have cost a nice hat). <br /> <br /> Go and do it. Don't expect a bitter socialist pill (although it's obviously very sad). The Cranes are Flying is an impressive slice of world cinema, quite advanced considering where and when it was made.
