I rented this dark Aussie relic a few years ago to show it in place of a friend and it was an immediate success. The classic tale of the wizard of oz with a decidedly horny 70s Australian touch. The acting is not exactly shakespeare stuff for the company here, but later, the "Mad max" star Bruce Spence is a wonderfully underrated surfie / scarecrow and there are some wonderful comedy rides by Gary Wadell and Robin Ramsay as a delightful godmother of fairy godmother of the 70s / father. the musical contribution of former Daddy Cool frontman Ross Wilson in the title song. In a vein similar to today's Australian comedies like "Priscilla queen of the desert". Have fun.
