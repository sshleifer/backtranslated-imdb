Once again, Almenábar provided us with a high-quality film. This director is fantastic and has proven to be equally talented and effective when he crosses genres. <br /> <br /> The excellent development of the film's character, through dialogue and personality quirks, but also with more subtle details (the look of Ramon's father), allows the public to identify with the very protagonists closely, making the importance and emotional impact of events that take place even more profoundly. The images are sometimes simple, sometimes stunning (the dream of the beach), and I think that the films of Almenábar really benefit from the fact that he also composes the music - he perfectly matched the various moods of the film. <br /> <br /> More than an euthanasia film, which is an important issue in itself, this film deals with the duality of a man who sometimes seems to really enjoy life (albeit in a rather limited way), and yet one who is firmly in his desire to die. The overwhelming sadness of the film is punctuated by well-synchronized lines of humor, all of which seem more amusing because they provide a pleasant relief from the melancholy that you will surely feel. <br /> <br /> While clearly in favor of euthanasia, this film does a great job representing the myriad of views of Ramon's friends and family. The most moving was Ramon's father, when he said, dejected, "There is only one thing worse than the loss of a child, that the child wants to die." <br /> <br /> Excellent writing, acting, directing, cinematography, music - 10/10.
