My introduction to a love for all of Shakespeare's life. My brother was 5 years old and I wasn't 7 when WTTW Chicago broadcast An Age of Kings. It has become a family ritual to watch, including replicas. Like an autumn series, my father bought us a rarity for the Midwest - pomegranates; and my mother made popcorn on the stove. Wonderful acting of actors whose names meant nothing to me (though I will never forget the painfully young Sean Connery as Hotspur), but do it now! And they published the scripts in paperback so that they could follow and understand the language. I managed to memorize most of Richard III on that. So happy to see it come out on DVD! Highly recommended for all ages and any level of familiarity with Shakespeare or English history.
