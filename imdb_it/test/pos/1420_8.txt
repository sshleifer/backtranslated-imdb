A brief history of time is not just a documentary about the beginning and the end of the universal and of reality as we know it, this is a story about man and the genius known as Stephen Hawking. It is his story that reflects the history of time and changes through the history of the universal. The style of documentary / interview editing begins and ends with a quick fade to black. Almost like blinking between segments and interviews, the documentary gives you a strange feeling that this is Stephen Hawking's point of view and not the camera's eye. Running time is just a little longer than an hour. It's a short story, so again, we can talk about topics for days and days. An interesting and proud story.
