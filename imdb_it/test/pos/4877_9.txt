I saw SEA OF DUST as part of a New York screening audience several years ago. I liked the movie at the time, so I was a little confused by some of the amendments that had been made since then. Maybe it's my memory, but there seem to be missing exhibits in the version shown at the Rhode Island Film Festival. I'm not really sure which version I prefer, but I can honestly say that I found something to appreciate both. <br /> <br /> I would like to start by warning everyone that this is not a popcorn movie. Although he was promoted as a tribute to Hammer Films, people who expect a showdown between Van Helsing and Dracula will be painfully disappointed. There are some necklines, but no nudity (a base of the subsequent films of the British production company). And while SEA OF DUST is full of wonderful eyes for the eyes (it's really filmed as a movie of the sixties), and starring the Hammer star Ingrid Pitt, it's not like any of the company's images by tone or execution. This film is very dark, very confusing and (at times) very funny. I don't remember the previous version being just as nutty as this one, but it's not a bad thing (especially the Black Forest showdown that sounds like a Three Stooges short). And some of Mrs. Pitt's jokes are pretty funny. It is as if someone had hurt her and left her free. <br /> <br /> However, the uniqueness of this film does not lie in the borrowed details. It is in ideas. As an occasional viewer of the Sci Fi Channel, I regularly used the network for its variations of a note on a theme (the CGI monster kills and then gets destroyed). SEA OF DUST is so full of ideas that you start stumbling over them after a while. <br /> <br /> But don't get me wrong. I'm not complaining. If nothing else, I applaud these guys for making such a cheap and low-budget portrait and for having the courage to make it up with so many concepts. It won't be a picnic for people who hate to think about cinema (you know who you are). But for the rest of us, those of us who are tired of the formula of modern horror movies, predictability, lack of respect for the public, this could just be your ticket.
