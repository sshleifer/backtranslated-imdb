It is difficult for me to explain this show to my grown friends. I have a group of Shasta Daisy in the back yard that lovingly call my "Chuckle Patch". My friends laugh at me and look at me as if I had 2 heads. It would be nice to see this DVD series for us people who remember it fondly with our other childhood memories, or to show our friends that there really was a laugh! Where today children's television is made up of violent vignettes, characters that do magic, or a talking sponge that lives in a pineapple under the sea, The Magic Garden was true in the respect that good values ​​taught us. <br /> <br /> I will keep fond memories of Carole and Paula and Chuckle Patch.
