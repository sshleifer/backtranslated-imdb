After the atomic bomb hits Hiroshima, the charred bodies lie around, the deformed victims try to communicate with relatives who can't even recognize them, and one person after another dies from radiation sickness. This black and white film, however sad and scary, is not without humor. The story revolves around a young Yasuko woman, struck by black rain after the explosion. She's trying to get married, but everyone keeps dying and people are worried that it will happen anyway. After finding a suitable mate (who is losing his mind after being in the war for too long), he ends up showing signs of radiation sickness. This film is a great portrait of atomic attacks on Japan, it will scare you and maybe it will make you cry. The acting is good, not too dramatic like many other ww2 films made.
