Since 1981, Nintendo has made great video games like Super Mario and Zelda. Most ideas would become a bit boring after 20 years. Nintendo games never seem boring because they always add something new. He switched from arcade games to the Wii and heard that there is a new version of Wii scheduled for 2011. The thing that makes Wii games so different is the fact that you are actually doing something instead of sitting on the couch by pressing the buttons . <br /> <br /> And I have other good news. Super Mario Galaxy 2 will be released in 2010.
