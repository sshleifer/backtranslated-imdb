This comedy Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle is remembered for her film debut with a young Buster Keaton, fresh from smashing with her family's rough Vaudeville act. Buster has a substantial part in this film and is quite fun overall. "The Butcher Boy" has a lot of laughs and is an example of pure old fashioned slapstick done well, although it would seem to come from the short era of two-roll comedies when filmmakers still imagined segments in a reel as a matter of course. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film takes place in a department store, with Arbuckle as the title butcher. It's an excuse to put together the many possibilities of a quick physical humor provided by a department store, and Arbuckle really shows that he is a 300-pound acrobat, demonstrating subtlety, skill and grace in performing what could have been a slapstick routine insignificant that you raise them to a different level. A running gag makes him spin a big butcher's knife randomly so that he turns accurately into his right position embedded in the cutting board, and I'm still stunned that Arbuckle really does seem to do it every time. There is also a nice gag that sees him leaning against his ladder and confused as to why his cuts of meat weigh so much. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton is a guy who comes to buy some molasses and performs skillfully in a walking routine that follows. Apart from the strange and almost disturbing half-smile, his idiosyncratic attitude and body language make him immediately recognizable as the Buster we know. He even has his trademark flattened hat - destroyed here for the first time when filled, of course, with molasses. <br /> <br /> The second part of the film moves into a more situation-based comedy and Arbuckle and his rival Al St. John drag to infiltrate Fatty's girl boarding school. A lot of humor also derives from the generally surreal and mysteriously quarrelsome view of these two odd companions who wear resistance and try to "be girls". Buster is also in this segment, but mostly he is there in the occasional shoulder, helping St. John. <br /> <br /> The finale of "The Butcher Boy" gets a bit hectic, but overall and beyond historical curiosity interest, it's a well-made comedy that only gets surprise laughs.
