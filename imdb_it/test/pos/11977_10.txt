This film is without doubt the best I've seen in my whole life. The stellar cast is just another advantage compared to the incredible special effects, the deep story and the sublime choreography. The film is about an ancient love story that turns into the modern world. Two lovers of paradise incur the wrath of a great sage and are cursed. Later the woman is born again on earth. While in college, she is raped and commits suicide. The rest of the film focuses essentially on the hunt for people associated with rape, from his lover who possesses superhuman strength and mastery of several languages. Sonu Nigam offers a very mature and profound performance in this film, and all the other actors do it almost as well. The action scenes with Akshay Kumar are amazing and not to be missed. You simply have to watch this movie !!!
