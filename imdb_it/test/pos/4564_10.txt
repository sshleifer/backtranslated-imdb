Face it, people: "DK3" is more inspiring, innovative and intelligent than its predecessor. Challenging ... his levels are ridiculously difficult for a considerable amount of time. A particularly difficult level is called "Lightning Lookout", where you could be struck by lightning at any time. Innovative - it has opened many doors. Too bad the SNES died shortly after this title. And clever: the level names range from the play-on-words mark ("Lake Orangatanga") to the witty references that the targeted audience of the game won't get for many years to come ("Bleak's House"). <br /> <br /> What bothers me about the criticism of most people about this game is based mainly on two words: Kiddy Kong. He is a worthy successor "little friend" of Diddy Kong, and he certainly does not deserve to be called "that retarded monkey". "DK3" will remain a classic until the end of time.
