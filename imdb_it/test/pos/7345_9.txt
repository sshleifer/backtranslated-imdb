This film deals with the themes of loss, personal struggle and transformation in a way so intelligent, astute, sensitive and visually surprising that I have been completely transported. It is a rare gem of a film in the way it honors beauty and women. You'll have to see for yourself. Dreya Weber (Jane) masterfully portrays the subtleties of a remarkable personality if not in some way broken, in a way that every woman will relate to. I found the honesty of the emotional interactions between the characters to be very refreshing and deeply engaging. There was nothing in this film that told me "low budget" regarding quality. Anything. The fact that it is a low-budget film is a tribute to the creators of the film. Even the final sequence during the credits will make you lose your socks. It's a brilliant celebration of Jane's choice. Unexpected and stimulating.
