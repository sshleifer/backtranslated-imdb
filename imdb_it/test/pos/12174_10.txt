These two main characters, Erkan and Stefan, are a monastic comedy. I was wondering if this is one of those typical slapstick movies where the story is not important or just doesn't exist. But when I saw this movie I was very happy that there was a good story and that the main characters really fit us. <br /> <br /> All in all a very funny and uncommon German film.
