Jamie Foxx is absolutely IS Ray Charles. His performance is simply brilliant. He is the owner of the film, just as Spacek owned "Coal Miner's Daughter" and Quaid owned "Great Balls of Fire". Indeed, it is difficult to remember that the part of Ray Charles is interpreted and not interpreted by man himself. Ray Charles is legendary. He is a well-established musician and the music is deep, complex and innovative, even more innovative than I thought before watching this film. The film should make new fans of a young audience that could get into it knowing little about its music. The life of Ray Charles has provided an excellent biographical material for the film, which goes far beyond the simple film about a musician. I confess that I knew very little about man's life until I saw this movie. I was struck by the courage, strength and innovation of Ray Charles as a man and musician.
