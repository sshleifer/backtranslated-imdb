The 70s were a great time for horror movies. The Brotherhood of Satan is another neglected gem. It is filled to the brim with large surreal and disturbing scenes. It's also nice to see Stother Martin and L.Q. Jones (who also produced) in decent roles. <br /> <br /> Some of these are a little dated and shoddy, but The Brotherhood of Satan kicks off Race the Devil and many other Satanism films of the 70s.
