Writers and directors, due to the nature of their profession, draw back from a frame to action in their work to show insights on characters and situations. Here, Huston and Joyce have taken a step back on a larger structure to show us the ultimate vision of what it means to be human. Until the end, the film seems to have little, the kind of typical circumstances that fill everyday life. It is not until the end of the last scene that we realize that it is actually everything. <br /> <br /> It is not possible to watch this final scene without simultaneously feeling pity, and even deep affection, for oneself and the rest of the companions.
