Another one of the endless amount of "Kickboxers Fight to the Death for the fun of Wealthy Scumbags", an endless series of films that there were so many in the 90s ... You know, those created by taking the words "Death", ' Blood 'and' Steel 'and the words' Ring', 'Fight', 'Match' and 'Cage' and put them in a random generator! That being said, Death Match is a good entry in the over-used genre, thanks to its exciting fighting scenes and the surprisingly good acting of its kickboxer cast. <br /> <br /> The story is about two friends - ex-Kickboxing world champion John Larson (played by Ian Jacklin, pug-faced middleweight Kickboxing champion, probably previously known for his horrible performance as a the main villain in Ring of Fire 2) and Nick Wallace (Nick Hill, a nice guy probably better known as Sergio's street fighter in Bloodsport 2) who works on the LA docks to load the crates on the ships. A discovery of a box of guns and a short fight later, our two heroes are out of work and are supporting a bar of L.A. Sensitive John Larson decides to go north and look for a job; capricious Nick Wallace has heard of a guy who pays money for fighters to fight in private kickboxing games. "Why should things change?" says John, "If you need me, I'll be there." Predictably, it is not long before Nick has disappeared and his good friend is fighting in the deadly "fuse of death" trying to find a clue for his missing friend. <br /> <br /> Sure enough, there is no prize for originality here, but as I said before, the strength of this film lies in its action, in its cast of real life fighters and in the discrete performance that manages to tear from them. In particular, Ian Jacklin surprised me. Previously I had just seen him as the villain in Ring of Fire 2 and in bit parts on tripe like The Steel Ring, and I've always been very amused by how bad an actor (good fighter!) Is. But in Death Match, it's pretty good! With a decent script and a haircut, he proves to be rather the charismatic leader! And his friendship with Nick is very well represented. Jacklin and Hill have a beautiful chemistry and you really believe that these two characters take care of each other. One of them is enough to lose a job, travel halfway across the country and risk death to save the other - I wish I had a friend like that! <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Matthias Hues as an evil henchman with a little more depth than what we are used to seeing from his numerous roles as "evil villain". However do not be fooled into thinking that it is the only star because it is on the cover of the video (with, it seems, his head stuck in the body of Michael Bernardo from the cover of Shootfighter) - he is good while on the screen, but he is not much .. <br /> <br /> On the negative side, the film is rather slow when there are no fights going on, with a lot of useless scenes (what is the useless story of the gangster Jimmie Fiorello on his grandfather ??) , and the final fight is disappointingly short, but overall I enjoyed it! A lot of fights, many of them good. Isn't that all we really need? And of course eye-candy, here in the beautiful shape of the beautiful Renee Ammann. All in all, a rather fun kickboxing film.
