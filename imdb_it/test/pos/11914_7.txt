Toy Soldiers is an action movie ok, but what stands out is the amount of effort that writers and directors have put into accurately representing US counter-terrorism forces. Just check the credits - there are more than a dozen US military officers and officers listed. The film accurately portrays the FBI as having control of the hostage situation, but overturns it on the US Army Delta Force (which in the film is not yet named while the Pentagon still denied its existence at that time) once the president renounced the Posse Commitatus Act of the United States Code. The forces of the American army at the end are carefully dressed and armed for the time. And even the use of an Apache AH-64 for air support - which might seem a bit exaggerated, isn't terribly unrealistic. The much more expensive and frankly better films have portrayed US counter-terrorism forces with far less accuracy.
