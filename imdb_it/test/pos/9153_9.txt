And nothing wrong with that! I warmly congratulate Boblipton and Snow Leopard's comments. <br /> <br /> I am thrilled to discover that this film is available on US DVDs - I only saw it once - I convinced the Goethe Institute here in London to show it in their Conrad Veidt season a few years ago - and a long time to see it again. <br /> <br /> Barrymore is resplendent when engaged, as in this film, perhaps due to the sting of having a famous German actor as a sheet. And Veidt is a wonderful thief of scenes (doesn't he take the nose at some point?) This is one of the fundamental films to connect 'Dr Jekyll' with '20th Century', 'Grand Hotel' or 'Midnight'; and 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari' or 'The Student of Prague' with 'The Spy in Bladk', 'Contraband' and 'Casablanca'. <br /> <br /> Watch it!
