It's my favorite movie because there are so many things you don't see at the beginning and so many things that make you wonder "Did Kieslowski say this or is it in my head?" For example - does the judge want to be God or a supreme being? <br /> <br /> Also Irene Jacob as in The Double Life Of Veronique is exceptional, there may be some superficially more beautiful actresses but none that manages to convey beauty of the spirit with physical beauty like her. <br /> <br /> Tritingnant is also magnificent without saying much and the things he says are excellent as is his response to Valentine. . . "To be".
