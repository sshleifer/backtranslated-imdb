"What Alice Found" is the biggest movie anyone has ever heard of! I underestimated him when I heard about it, and I thought it would be all sex, no plot and just really stupid, but in reality it was really good. They say that all independent films suck, but this, and "Napoleon Dynamite" did not suck. I asked my friend, who had seen him before me, and she said that Alice has all these three ways, and you see all this nakedness, but no, there is nothing to three that I remember and little nudity. The film had a point and taught me never to trust hitchhikers. In the end I liked it, they gave Alice a small dolphin, eventually, headed for Flordia. I absolutely recommend seeing this movie.
