Ok, so I don't understand why people are feeling so irritated about this movie. So I thought it would be the usual Amanda Bynes movie, but it wasn't. It was great. <br /> <br /> Okay, okay, so the acting wasn't the best, but I thought the performances were still great. Also, you could say that the actors had fun doing this movie. In other films, which have surprisingly won prizes, in which the actors did not like working on the film, one could say. All the actors had chemistry, and even that showed. <br /> <br /> A lot of people rip off the actors' soccer skills. Yah, so they're not perfect ... get over it! They are actors, not footballers. I've played soccer all my life and trust me, it's hard to learn, so stop tearing up the level of skills they have. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie would be stupid, but it was really fun. The way Amanda Bynes and Channing Tatum can make a situation fun without even saying anything is fun. I found myself laughing a lot in this film. <br /> <br /> Overall .. I LOVE IT!
