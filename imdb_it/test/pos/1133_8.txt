I recently came across this show when the ABC family had a marathon everyday before the first season. I remember seeing previews for the show in 2007, and I thought it would be short lived, and not very well written, because it was on ABC Family. <br /> <br /> Never doubt an ABC family show! This show surprised me as best as possible. Not only is the show well written, the plots are realistic, fun and entertaining. I was expecting a lot of talk about reports, something like "this guy went out with that girl who dumped me for that guy ... etc." But this show is anything but! The characters are attractive and you really feel a connection between them. There is a lot of confusion among the actors, and they can really make you feel like something is happening right before your eyes. <br /> <br /> Don't doubt this show, it's really fun to watch .. and stay hooked;)
