The director "The Moon Is Blue" Otto Preminger addressed even more taboo subjects in his controversial 1955 publication "The Man with the Golden Arm". While he had exasperated the Motion Picture Association of America with his use of the words "virgin" and "lover" in his mild 1953 comedy "The Moon Is Blue", Preminger went far beyond what any film had attempted with "The Man with the Golden Arm "since Dick Powell made his law and orders epic" To the Ends of the Earth "(1946) to counter international narcotics trafficking. Based on the novel by Nelson Algren who won the 1950 National Book Award, this 119-minute black and white dark & ​​uncompromising melodrama is about heroin addiction. Initially, when Preminger's film was released, the Motion Picture Association of America would not release its seal of approval because the filmmakers represented narcotics addiction. This revolutionary film has qualified as the first major film to manage narcotics from the drug addict's point of view and actually showed the paraphernalia that drug addicts have wielded to shoot heroin. The Production Code stated that directors should refrain from showing characters who use illicit drugs. However, United Artists has released this unique image of Frank Sinatra and grossed over $ 4 million dollars. <br /> <br /> The critical and commercial success of "The Man with the Golden Arm" has examined the production code. As a result, the MPAA amended the Code so that the directors could investigate other taboo topics, such as drug abuse, abduction, abortion and prostitution. The film received three Oscar nominations. The Oscar nominations went to Sinatra for best acting, Joseph C. Wright and Darrell Silvera for the best art set, the black and white and Elmer Bernstein for the best music, the recording of a drama or comedy . Indeed, Elmer Bernstein has made a name for himself with his jazz score. The producers had thought of founding Marlon Brando in the lead role, but Sinatra beat Brando at the punch. Eleanor Parker, Kim Novak, Arnold Stang, Darren McGavin and Robert Strauss acted together with Ole Blue Eyes. McGavin was particularly memorable as a ruthless heroine trafficker, while Eleanor Parker played the protagonist's wife with a deep and dark secret of his own that was really a shock. <br /> <br /> "The Man with the Golden Arm" refers to the ability of the main character Frankie Machine to manipulate a deck of cards. Frankie distributes cards for Zero Schwiefka (Robert Strauss of "Stalag 17"), but has been out of Chicago for the past six months in a federal narcotics hospital that is recovering from heroin addiction. Frankie not only licked the habit, but also learned to play drums and plans to embark on a musical career. As optimistic as Frank talks about his future, he finds himself facing his past again when he returns to his old grounds. Schwiefka wants him to take care of him again, and Nifty Louie Fomorowski ("Counter-Attack" Darren McGavin) tries to get him to resume his use of heroin. Meanwhile, Frankie returns home to his disabled wife in a wheelchair, Zosh (Eleanor Parker of "Escape from Fort Bravo"), who manipulates him with feelings of guilt. Frankie was drunk when he had a car accident and Zosh ended up in a wheelchair. Frankie shows himself with great hopes and a battery, but Zosh sees no future for him as a musician and urges him to return to work for Schwiefka. Frankie plans to visit a music promotion and one of his friends, Sparrow (Arnold Stang of "My Sister Eileen"), buys a suit from a department store for Frankie. After Frankie refuses to work for Schwiefka because he will see music agent Harry Lane (Will Wright of "The Wild One"), Schwiefka turns Frank and Sparrow into the police. Meanwhile, Schwiefka gets the Brach department stores to eliminate shoplifting charges. The seed was worth $ 37.00. Frankie agrees to resume negotiations for Schweifka and the dealer urges him. Not long after, despite his resolution to avoid the use of heroin, Frankie breaks down and pays Louie $ 2.00 for a correction. <br /> <br /> In the end, Frankie meets Harry Lane and Lane warns him that Frankie finds he has nothing to do with him. What poor Frankie doesn't know is that Zosh has regained his ability to walk, but he uses his sense of guilt about the accident to keep him close. Zosh is also jealous of his neighbor, Molly Novotny (Kim Novak of "Picnic"), Frankie's ex-boyfriend who pretends to have a drink at a nearby strip bar called the Safari Club. When Zosh complains about headaches he Frankie has them practice on his drum set, Frankie pushes them downstairs to Molly's apartment. Schwiefka and Louie are organizing a great poker game with Sam Markette (George E. Stone of "Guys and Dolls") and Williams (George Mathews of "Gunfight at the OK Corral"), two gamblers who have heard of Frank and his legendary "golden arm". Schwiefka and Louie persuade a reluctant Frankie to negotiate $ 250. After a series of initial victories, Frankie starts to lose and fails to reverse his bad luck. In fact, Frankie spends two days negotiating. Exhausted, his nerves shot and desperate for a correction, he falls to pieces on the second day and Markette and Williams tease him. Louie refuses to give Frankie a solution, so Frankie knocks him out and ransacks his apartment for heroin. <br /> <br /> Preminger does not punch in "The Man with the Golden Arm" and the film is rather disappointing. None of the characters here is in the least sympathetic. Essentially, they are either crazy or doomed. Sinatra offers another dynamite performance like McGavin and Parker do. To tell the truth, "The Man with the Golden Arm" has lost much of its impact over the last 50 or more years, but is still considered a reference film.
