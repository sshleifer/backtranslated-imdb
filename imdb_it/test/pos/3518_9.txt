for a movie like this little hidden gem in the 1980s, it's unsettling how not many people know. <br /> <br /> this film is definitely worth a visit. has all the things you need for a horror movie. especially the beautiful old shivers. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but I couldn't remember the name, so I came to IMDb some years ago to ask for help on how to find the title. In the end I took the name of the title and bought the film. I still love him as much as I did all those years ago. <br /> <br /> buy this movie !!
