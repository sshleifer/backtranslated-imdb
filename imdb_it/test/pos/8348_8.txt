I loved this movie almost as much as the original version! Which teenager does NOT go through what passes Scamp, wants to find independence by moving further away from your family? The songs were beautiful and the character design was fantastic. Lady and Tramp look almost identical to the original feature. They did a good job even with the voices of those two, also considering the fact that the original voice actors probably died. However, I think they should have given more lines for Lady, Annette, Colette and Daniel. Oh well, at least they had the good sense to keep the same scenario from the original film.
