Our family (and the entire sold out preview) appreciated "The Guardian". Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher have convincingly portrayed the imaginary swimmer helicopter character Ben and Jake. After watching this movie, you can't help but imagine how difficult it must be to graduate from the USCG helicopter swimming school and one day take part in real rescues. <br /> <br /> Although this is a fiction film, it has produced rather convincing virtues of team spirit, dedication and courage exhibited by all members of the current US coast guard. <br /> <br /> The special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible. In reality you felt like you were participating in a real rescue. I think the film could have been made without the "Hollywood" bar scene (when you see the movie, you might agree) since the real Coast Guard doesn't condone this behavior. <br /> <br /> Very fun, very action-packed, definitely worth seeing. Thank you, the United States Coast Guard and the real helicopter rescue swimmers, "So Others May Live". I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
