Two actors play rival gangsters in three films, whose final is a science fiction film, which strangely nods to William S. Burroughs, Philip K. Dick and souls all together. Robots are actually called "replicants", a reference to Dicks Blade Runner (you can also find many visual allusions to the film) and the villain is a psychotic gay mayor obsessed with limiting procreation through the use of a mandatory drug for " heterosexual "love is fleeting, and homosexual love is eternal" .... the struggles of martial arts spring from it, a novelty for dead or alive films. The hilarious climax involves the two protagonists who turn into a robot winged with a gigantic phallus for a head, which personifies the "destruction", which was the path of both characters up to that moment, their individual minds and subsequent heads that function as something like testicles.The film ends with the mayor f * and his free jazz boy's lackey while the robot seems to break down a wall around them, the last words of the mayor "Oh f * &%", followed by a rapid fade to black. cheated, part of me confused, but mostly I was just laughing. Much of the film is rather boring, but the best scenes are those that close the film while the rest is too slow. Takashi Miike has always undermined sexual motives under male violence in action films, and this film, with the exception of "Gozu", reinforces this theme more than any other. Sex and violence are two rather basic themes, but like Cronerberg (which jazz interludes could be a tribute to Naked Lunch wing) Miike is able to show where the two connect, to an exhilarating, somewhat cohesive effect.
