During the civil war a wounded Union soldier hides in an isolated Confederate school; where the hostess and school teacher decide to take care of him and keep him around, until the problems start to mix between lonely and sexually frustrated girls and women. The soldier decides to take advantage of this situation, but in the end everything has a price. <br /> <br /> "Dirty Harry (1971)" (which was made around the same time as "The Beguiled") could be my favorite collaboration between Eastwood and Siegel, but after seeing this, I tend to think of this to be the best work of couples together. A very atypical, wise and elegant vehicle for Eastwood is always in the sign with the well-controlled direction of Don Siegel and a ghostly music by Lalo Schifrin. Distinguishing forcefully is its solitary, dark and bleak nature, which is intrusively embedded in the psychological makeup of the film and in the manipulative close of sexual depravity. It is assiduously played and makes the blood darker and bleeding when those random jolts and impertinent intentions take on compelling tension. The way in which Siegel illustrates John B Sherry and the seductive slow bold script of Grimes Grice (based on the novel by Thomas Cullinan) is effectively realized through the strong emotions and the tight and lyrical context of the script. Siegel's strong direction captures the idyllic Victorian setting of the south with a photograph so powerfully trimmed and creates strangely penetrating images with great clarity and sobriety. <br /> <br /> While the performances are truly commendable and of high quality. Clint Eastwood is the soldier of the chameleonic union, sweetly sweet and sweet, very impressionable and delightfully assured. A deeply rooted Geraldine page steals the picture as a hardened mistress and the elegant Elizabeth Hartman adds a delicate sincerity to her innocent character. Mae Mercer is strongly tailored as the black maid and Jo Ann Harris is the choice of the crop by the young pupils with her seductive and cunning personality. <br /> <br /> Honestly, while the charismatic Eastwood character plays the field for his own selfish needs, there are still mixed intentions that the player being played (where the rivalry between women creeps in) turns out to be better of their host at the end. In all there is a perversely dark sense of humor and an ironic touch that creeps into the material. What is shown here is simply more than your shocking basic, but one that is densely layered with intrigue and a sense of realism that is hard to shake. This also applies to the extremely lugubrious title and the closing song. <br /> <br /> An effective object, chilling and low-key, hard not to be tempted by its fluctuating hospitality.
