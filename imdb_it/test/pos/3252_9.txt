Brilliant movie! I'm sorry to say that it looks a bit like Pulp F. but that's how it is with the post-pulp era. Many images are automatically compared to it to be just a gangster movie. But this is well written, funny coincidences, common gangsters who are family men, look like something from Tarantino, which is a good resemblance! <br /> <br /> However, the film is about a boy in Australia who is mixing with a band of hardened criminals, and ends up in debt and in depth. For his help he is the deceased brother (does anyone remember Val Kilmer in True R.?) To pay his debt and escape from the gangsters who are on his trail. Gangsters are cool, but take the time to play chess and concentrate on raising their children! They also receive tea from their grandmother while planning a bank robbery and have problems with what to do with their children during the robbery. So a humorous gangster flies with Heath Ledger in good shape (even if I'm not a fan), and Bryan Brown in great action as a gang leader.
