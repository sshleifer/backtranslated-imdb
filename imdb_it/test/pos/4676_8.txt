One of the advantages of my job is that when things are slow, I can watch the film in our downstairs theater (working in a small two-screen cinema) in the crying room and keep an eye on the concession stand. I've seen Italian work probably 20 times, and I'm still not tired of it. The atmosphere reminds me of Ocean's Eleven, even if the acting is not good. Mark Wahlberg is fine, Charlize Theron appeals to the guys, but Seth Green is FANTASTIC in this movie. I thought Edward Norton did a great job playing dirtbag, although many people disagree. I also liked Mos Def as an explosives expert who is afraid of dogs. I highly recommend this movie and will continue to watch it whenever I can!
