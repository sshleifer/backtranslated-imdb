Mr. Bean of Rowan Atkinson is placed right there with Laurel & Hardy, Buster Keaton, the Marx brothers and other great comedies. I've never seen people laugh so loudly and literally fall out of their chairs like when I introduced them to Mr. Bean through my videos and now DVDs. I will never forget the first time my brother saw him. He had ended up visiting and I asked him if he had ever seen Mr. Bean? "Who?" He said. So I pulled out my video and showed him what Mr. Bean is in church and starts nodding. My brother laughed so hard that he fell off his chair and was holding his stomach from laughing so hard. He became an instant Mr. Bean fan. We all know how hilarious these episodes are, but the fun is in sharing them with others. I've seen so many people laugh until it hurts! The favorite episodes are: the visit of the Queen, the hotel room, the delay of the dentist's appointment, the Christmas episode (a classic ... the more children love it!) And the New Year's party. Rowan Atkinson is a comic genius!
