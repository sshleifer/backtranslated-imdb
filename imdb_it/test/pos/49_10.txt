Lackawanna Blues is a very moving film that depicts an era full of emotions and different characters seen through the eyes of a boy. The film clearly states "it takes a village to raise a child" and recalls an important moment in the history and culture of black. I gained incredible respect for Macy Gray as an actress. His character was a little crazy, yet lovable; clearly we all met someone like Macy's character. S. Epatha Merkerson is absolutely fantastic as Tata. I never realized that Epatha was such a great actress. Law & Order has never shown the depth of Epatha's acting skills like Lackawanna Blues. I was pleasantly surprised and amazed! The music and the characters reminded me of my childhood ... it was a sweet nostalgic walk in the memory. I really enjoyed the film and look forward to the DVD release to add to my collection.
