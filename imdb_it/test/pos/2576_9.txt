I was surprised how the great Black Snake Moan turned out. Being a fan of Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson, my id figure has been proven. Well, when it's all over, I was amazed at how fantastic this movie was. I mean that everything was perfect and very accurate for that. This film shows how the great director and screenwriter Craig Brewer (who has made Hustle & Flow another great film) can only take something that seems ludacra and turn it into Well, I like how it's just a good time, how is a film that makes it right there in a good way. I also love that he doesn't show great southern steroids and how he was portrayed in things as the most repugnant place, but not this film makes him very precise and therefore very reconcilable. The mating in this was simply phenomenal especially from Christina Ricci (who deserves an Oscar for this role), the ever great Samuel L. Jackson, and even Justin Timberlake did a great job. Overall alm However everything is fantastic for this, and even if it is not for all types of films, it is certainly worth being seen by anyone who can have fun. Three Cheers For Black Snake Moan !!!! <br /> <br /> 9.3 out of 10 stars
