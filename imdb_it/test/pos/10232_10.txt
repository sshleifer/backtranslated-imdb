Why don't critics like this movie ?? I don't understand. This is easily my favorite effort of Clive Barker. "Hellraiser" is a bit too rough (the film never leaves that stupid house) and, let's face it, "Lord of Illusions" doesn't move at all !!! I loved Barker's writings for years, especially his "Blood Books". Really fun. He has a vicious side to him that is totally different from a Stephen King. It mixes freely in its homosexuality and in strange religious and occult elements. I love love I love it. I also realize, however, that Barker is as much a dark fantasy writer as a horror writer. And fantasy is not my bag. It makes me sleep well. He always thinks that Barker also works better with stories. His novels tend to wander a little. This was my experience when I tried to read "The Damnation Game". It started well. Then 100 pages in I thought "where are you going?" because it wasn't going EVERYWHERE. <br /> <br /> I read "Cabal" (the book Nightbreed was based on) and I thought it was good. I especially like the elaboration on the character of Decker. The way the mask spoke to him and controlled him. I like the way Barker simply presents it. Black and white. There he is. It gives it a simplicity that is attractive and credible. When asked why Decker kills, he says (simply) "Why I like it". Probably something that Jeffrey Dahmer said at one point. <br /> <br /> But actually I liked the movie Nightbreed better than Cabal. I love the visual attention to the details that Barker gives to his films. I LOVE IT. I think it's simply beautiful. Lord of Illusions also had this. Some of the drawings at the beginning, during the Nightbreed credit sequence. It's like a whole vocabulary that Barker invented only for the Nightbreed world. I'd be curious to know how much his design was. I know he is an INCREDIBLE artist who has his style and his artist language. <br /> <br /> Nightbreed is also (I think) the most entertaining BArker movie. It moves very fast. Well cared for. Don't drag as Lord of Illusions does a little. Very fast. Everything in it is simply perfect. It also works like a fantastic and scary movie. Things with the killer at the beginning kill the family and then torment the old man in the shop are really scary things. That mask is scary. I'd be curious if Barker designed that too. It is not just a Jason or "Scream" type mask. Something about it is really disturbing. <br /> <br /> However, this is a great movie. Definitely check if you haven't seen it. Highly recommended. One of my favorite horror movies of all time. In my opinion, the best of Clive BArker. It's scary and violent, be warned
