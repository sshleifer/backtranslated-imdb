This film took me by surprise. I saw it for the first time over 10 years ago and it still stays with me. He has only boring points and I personally would have solved it differently, this did not discourage me from looking at him repeatedly and recommending him to others. The acting is _fantastic_. The cast and director do a fantastic job with the script, and anyone who loves "different" movies, who has the patience to sit down and say "What the hell is this?", And getting involved should give this film a chance. If you just want Alan Rickman to become silly or see things explode, this is not the right movie for you.
