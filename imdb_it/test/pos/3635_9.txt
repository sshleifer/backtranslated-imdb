In Nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco, Antônio (Gustavo Falcão) is the youngest son of his mother, who cried continuously for five years. When he is a young man, he falls in love with Karina (Mariana Ximenes), a seventeen-year-old teenager who dreams of seeing the world and becomes an actress. Antônio promises Karina to take the world to Nordestina, and once in Rio de Janeiro, he takes part in a sensational TV show and promises to travel for the next fifty years in the future or die for love with a deadly machine he had invented. Fifty years later, Antônio (Paulo Autran) tries to fix what went wrong on his journey. <br /> <br /> "A Máquina" is one of the best Brazilian films I've seen recently. The original and refreshing story is a poetic and magical fable of love that will surely thrill the viewer more skeptical and hard, in a unique love story. The management is excellent; the script is fantastic; cinematography and colors are magnificent; the cast led by Gustavo Falcão, the icon Paulo Autran and Mariana Ximenes is fantastic, with wonderful lines; the soundtrack contains some beautiful Brazilian songs that highlight Geraldo Azevedo and "Dia Branco" by Rento Rocha. If this film is distributed abroad, please commit me, rent it or buy the DVD because I bet you will love the story that will make you cry. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Máquina ?? O Combustível é o Amor" ("The Machine ?? The Fuel is Love")
