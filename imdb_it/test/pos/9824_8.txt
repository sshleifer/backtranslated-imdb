I don't know how I'd feel if I lived in the United States. I would watch some preview scenes, advertisements, I would like to know, Sidney Pollack directed, Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas protagonists. I would watch this movie as soon as possible without reading any negative reviews. Would I be disappointed? <br /> <br /> I read a lot of reviews that say how bad this movie has been: this is boring, long movie without passionate emotions and it's not interesting. Harrison is wood, cold. The sublists should be cut. Too serious, particularly for Harrison Ford. I'm interested in the subject and I like Harrison Ford in films that are not actions. I also like Sidney Pollack and Kristin Scott Thomas. So reading the reviews on the IMDB site then on other sites then in February in the Hungarian movie magazines I marveled and wondered what the movie was. However there are films, directors, star what / I want to see, despite the reviews. <br /> <br /> I can understand who thinks this film is boring and cold and has no passion, but I feel different. It is true that I liked Sliding Doors, The Forbidden Woman (this is a French film, I don't know what the title is in English or French). The basis of these films is the development of a love. <br /> <br /> I think Random Heart is a beautiful and interesting film in its own way. <br /> <br /> It may be true that the election of the congress and the investigation of the policeman after a corrupt policeman - are not well written, are not elaborated in detail but add something to the main character of the woman and of the man .After his wife's death and the excitement of betrayal, angry at the Dutchman comes to the surface during his work. His best friend (even the woman) will be suspicious and almost lost. The film shows two ways to survive the tragedy: the death and deception of our wife / husband. One of these is that of women: this is a tragedy, but life continues. You don't want to cry forever. What she wants to know - her husband's lover - the cop's wife - thought of her that she would never learn. She is forced to behave this way. The elections have arrived and anything about her husband could become a scandal. He wants his daughter not to be disappointed by her father. The man is a policeman. He suffers from the fact that he lived in lies. He wants to know - maybe all men would like to know in this situation - when his wife started cheating him. How long have you had your lover? She needs the woman's help but she doesn't want to, but the boy is stubborn and constant / persistent. The woman cannot stand it because she always enters her life and cannot forget. Their relationship is tense at the beginning, then slowly a kind of silent understanding develops that prefers an alliance against the outside world, the tragedy. (I said it even though they made love in bed) However, the policeman can't stop investigating, he can't stop nearby and he can't allow the woman next to him but he starts "love", and the woman wants the their relationship continues. But he can't. The woman realizes it. The end is a little sad, but logical, and at the same time pretty. <br /> <br /> It was nice for me to see Peter Coyote again, I like the face of this man, Sidney Pollack. I barely knew Bonnie Hunt, but she was good. <br /> <br /> I think Harrison Ford has done a good job. His ears are unusual, but in the beginning I finally believed that the woman liked being in his company despite his temper. It was a pity he had no joke. But Ford has a good sense of humor. One reviewer noted (in Hungary): "Ford is charismatic against his haircut and ears and we are waiting for his presence and would like him to smile at us and give an ironic warning, but Dr. Jones does not smile at us". But he smiles at the end and is really good. With the rest I agree. I really like this role. He's good at acting this way a little harsh, but somewhere in his smart cop soul. Kristin Scott's character Thomas is a determined woman, self-confident, but she's locked in an ivory tower and she gets keeps away from her emotions. But she really is a woman who becomes indecisive and finds support in the policewoman. The two fresh and reserved people are with one another. <br /> <br /> Maybe the script is not good. It is full of common and trivial phrases, but there are some humorous phrases of women and movement in particular from men. It's a good movie, but not for everyone, not for the general public. I watched women under 18 and men over 45 appreciated this film better. Regarding the latter, maybe Sidney Pollack made this film for his age group that doesn't go to multiplex. Anyway, I recommend it to those who love energetic plots with action scenes, who only like Ford's action movie.
