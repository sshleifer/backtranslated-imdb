"Sir" played Lear more than 200 times, but he can't remember his opening lines tonight. Sitting in the mirror, his eyes reflect the folly of the king. His apprentice pushes him gently, putting the words into his mouth. There is an air of desperation for both of these men. The great actor knows that his powers are slipping away, his valet and his great domo-cum conscience and his surrogate wife - aware of his boss's decline in madness and knowing that he is powerless to do more than facilitate his death . "The Dresser" is really a love story between the two. Over the years they have become mutually dependent on each other to the extent that neither can conceive of a future without the other. Set during the Second World War, it concerns the fate of a Shakespearean society on a frank second-rate tour composed of an equal number of aspirants and aspirants headed by "Sir", a theatrical knight of what could be kindly called "The old school "Whichever part he is playing, he grabs the stage and leans over the limelight, making the audience oppress in applause. But, somewhere inside of him, buried most of the time deep beneath the regularly drawing ham, there still remains an occasional glint of his primitive grandeur. It is to glimpse what his audience ardently hopes for. Mr. A. Finney focuses very skillfully on ham, often up to the caricature, and, just when you're ready to dismiss his performance as mere hyperbole and bravado, he will produce a moment of refined subtlety and vulnerability that will make you understand that the great actor plays a great actor. The same applies to T.Courtenay. It is easy to erase his portrait of Norman as an exercise in stereotyping. Here we have a middle-aged womanish rather than a theatrical field dresser who sashaying his way through life, enjoying the company of "The Girls" and loving Insider's evil gossip in "The Theater". There were - and I still suspect they are - many men like Norman in The Profession. Ultimately gentle and patient, knowing more about the play of many of the actors, they run backstage with wisdom and affection. I think the vast majority of them would have screamed with laughter approvative at the portrait of Mr Courtenay. I saw "The Dresser" on the London stage where, against Courageay's perceived wisdom, "Norman" was rather more subdued than in the film. "Sir" was played by the great Freddie Jones with great success by the public. it was a memorable performance that overshadowed Mr Courtenay, rather reducing him to a "corrupt" as opposed to an actor at the billing level. The idea that "Sir" and "Norman" could be almost incomplete without one and the other came out of the window. "Norman" was reduced to being his puppet, which I am not sure was what Ronald Harwood meant, but made for a breathtaking theater. Messrs. Finney and Courtenay restore balance in the film, restoring equality with the relationship. Both men have come a long way since their first appearances in the images of the British "New Wave" when they became the darlings of the vaguely sinister "middle class and shameful" movement. When British cinema practically committed Hari-kiri in the Seventies they quietly concentrated on the theater, apart from a few roles to keep the wolf out of the door. With the rebirth of more substantial films, they reappeared, blinking in the unusual bright light. <br /> <br /> "The Dresser" marked their return, still full of energy and talent, shouting to the world at large "We are still here". It's not a great movie, but it's definitely a great movie.
