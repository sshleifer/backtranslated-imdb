Having seen this without knowing all the bustle surrounding the protagonist, indeed without even knowing that it was based on real life events, I must say that I am impressed. "Murder in Greenwich" is an above average production for a film made for TV - the acting is uniformly exceptional, in particular Christopher Meloni who performs a performance and young actors excel in difficult roles. The idea of ​​the dead girl who tells the film is a stroke of genius that elevates the film from simple to excellent. The script is exemplary for what is essentially the fodder of the film of the week and the cinematography is beautiful.
