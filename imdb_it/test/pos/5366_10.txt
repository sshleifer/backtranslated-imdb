A wonderfully thoughtful and engaging film that leaves an imprint far beyond its initial take-off. Based on a true story, one of the many "small" stories before the Second World War, which provides an understanding to the mind of most common human cultures, influenced by others perceived as former enemies and perhaps future enemies, with darkening of war clouds on the horizon. Seen at the Stony Brook Film Festival, the film was received with enthusiasm. Well written and chastely expert. The characters were the most credible and attracted one to experience their trials and tribulations.
