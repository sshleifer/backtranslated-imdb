I honestly don't know what words IMDB will allow me to use in this review, therefore, I am having difficulty describing these short films. Let's just say that there is a good amount of gay sex, some necrophilia, some incest, a good dose of masturbation and several artificial members ... And I loved every minute of it. <br /> <br /> Not that EVERYTHING is rude humor. It is not. They mostly move away from fart gags, with the exception of a sketch entitled "Pizza" in which they use one very well. "They" are the 3/11 of the short-lived sketching comic group broadcast on MTV called The State, namely David Wain, Michael Showalter and Michael Ian Black. <br /> <br /> The trio continues the adventures, usually playing and meeting strange and unusual people, people who are actually actually more normal than them. The supporting cast is also fantastic. Paul Rudd, Julie Bowen, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis and Sam Rockwell make their appearances in various sketches. They are also joined by other The State alums like Joe Lo Truglio and Todd Holoubek. Even the musical selections are very well positioned. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed these sketches over and over again, but they are not suitable for everyone because they are rather vulgar most of the time. If you like intelligent humor that is not afraid to push the limits of good taste, then I highly recommend it. If you enjoyed Wet Hot American Summer (Directed and written by Wain and Showalter) or The State, then you should enjoy this. <br /> <br /> I think it can currently only be ordered online. Check out their website and view a couple of sketches to get an idea if you really want this, and then find out how to buy the DVD.
