Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure is a fantastic film with which many children today can really relate. It's a well-presented story about a child who wants the freedom to do things his way, and the way he proceeds to get this freedom is only part of what makes this movie interesting. Just forget the naive disappointments, like the fact that there were only adults in this film based on a puppy's point of view, because this is only 0.5% or less of the wonderful effect of the film on the viewer. Great music, lively acting, talented animation and direction and a powerful storyline tell the difference between freedom on the streets of New England and a welcoming home with your family. And no matter how bad things look, your family and friends are "always there" to help you at all times. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to get the soundtrack!
