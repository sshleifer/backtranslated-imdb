The BBC 3-hour adaptation of the Sarah Waters novel ... "Fingersmith". Life is hard without money, especially in Dickensian London. Dark actions lead to despicable dilemmas. Is love really just a luxury for the rich and free ?? Elaine Cassidy in the role of "Maud Lilly" and Sally Hawkins in the role of "Sue Trinder" give fantastic performances as the protagonists who ask this question ... OF EVERYTHING ... while Rupert Evans shines like the delicious "Gentleman" with the great support of "Mrs Sucksby" by Imelda Staunton, "Ibbs" by David Troughton and "Uncle" by Charles Dance. The plot twists and I wasn't sure I could be led to worry about characters able to hurt and use each other like this ... but somehow ... I care ... and this it's because of the quality of the shows ... love feels like love .. i hate feels like hatred ... betrayal .. confusion .. well hopefully you have the idea and i hope you can get the DVD and enjoy. (Elaine Cassidy is simply fantastic in this ... wonderful indeed ... I must declare that I am in her fan club ... Hi Elaine :)
