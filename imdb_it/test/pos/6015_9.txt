and I first think it's a good thing. I was never a fan of Rosalind Russell even though the original was my favorite RR movie. But I love Bette and I was thrilled to hear he was doing this. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the production, I think it was slightly inferior to the original film. One of my favorite minor characters in the original was Mazeppa with the scratchy nail on the blackboard shouting "HEY! It takes much more than a talent to be a strippah!" and although I missed it, I was glad to see that the producers had the courage not to make a carbon copy. I also liked the fact that there are great parts of this film that were shot as if you were watching a stage, it gives the feeling of being in the theater, not just in the cinema. <br /> <br /> I think the other thing I liked about this production is that there seems to be a little less repetition of the song "Let me entertain you", which becomes completely annoying after about the fifth time that you hear it.
