I'm not sure if discussing television series is exactly where the comments should be drawn, but it's on television that The Lone Ranger has really made a name for itself. I wasn't even referring to the original radio broadcasts of this masked pilot from the plains, but Iam was referring to a point where I had to see the movie "The Lone Ranger" in a boy of about 9 or 10 and I didn't never forgotten. I can remember that I was on a line or we were going to the Paramount Theater - the theater was in the theater district, if I remember correctly. It was directly opposite, going from east to west from the building that has the ball falling on New Year's - This is obviously if someone I don't know, New York City. There was a time above the street on the roofs and perhaps even today huge billboards would have advertised what was being shown and so on. It was at that moment that I looked up and had never been more impressed than I was when I looked at that billboard and The Lone Ranger on the roofs - It was great - It made an impression and was never forgotten. The day we went to see The Lone Ranger - It was the story of how Lone Ranger was born - The terrible ambush that the Texas rangers rode and the subsequent rebirth of one of his fallen heroes. It was in this film that we learn that The Lone Ranger will not shoot to kill but to hurt in order to let the law be the judge. That kind of thinking is so useful that we could be good at learning something from history. It is here that we learn that Tonto discovers the fallen Ranger and after seeing the symbol of childhood friendship that The Lone Ranger established years before when he, as a young man, presented himself to an aide to a young man wounded in Tonto - For the given helper, Tonto gave his faithful friend a symbol of his thanks which was now part of a series that Tonto recognized. Tonto said, "you are Kemosabe". The Lone Ranger said: "Kemo -abe, this is familiar? Then Tonto tells the story of this" rusty t scout "(the meaning of Kemosabe) I think the Lone Ranger is one of the true heroes of the big screen and one of the great heroes It must also be said that these highly respected people Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels sought to live there lives according to the legend of The Lone Ranger. It may be that there is an inspiring story in the history of the Lone Ranger and his faithful companion Tonto. I myself was so happy with the possibility of finding and buying DVDs, that I stayed up all Saturday morning and watched the numerous episodes now available Long Live The Lone Ranger and his faithful companion Tonto-Hi-Ho Silver
