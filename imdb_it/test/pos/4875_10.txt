I saw SEA OF DUST at the Rhode Island Horror Film Festival in Providence. It was the film in the foreground of the Festival and won the award for best film, I think I made a couple of hundred. The director and some of the stars answered questions after the screening. One star, Suzy Lorraine, was even sexier in person than in the movie, and in the film it was a real attraction. <br /> <br /> This film is independent, but has many cinematic touches that make it a quality sensation. He also has a musical score in the original classical style. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of Savini and he is the villain of the star here, in a black cloak, he is more an evil force than a real person, I think. He is sucking people's souls and using them as soldiers in a distorted attempt to establish his version of God's Kingdom on Earth. From his point of view, Christ was all centered on suffering and Savini intends to make everyone suffer. <br /> <br /> The main plot that interests you is a young doctor, Stefan, who is sent to investigate the strange events Savini is causing in an isolated city. He proposes to an aristocratic chick, but SOB's father tells him to get lost. Then he meets a strangely possessed but seductive country girl. I think he falls in love with him, but he also tries to kill him, like many hot women do in the film. <br /> <br /> I found the scenes shot in the woods to be the most disturbing and the most captivating, with strange people along the way (the twin evil villains scared me to death). <br /> <br /> The film has a lot, too much to list. There is a lot of blood, torture and blood. Hot chicks licking blood from boys' fingers. A terrified girl's head explodes. It was unexpected. The gorges split Some brutal stabbings. <br /> <br /> Then sometimes they play laughing, having a little fun of all the evil of the black forest genre. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the films of Hammer and Ingrid Pitt, it is fascinating to see her in this film. She lowers one of the heads by dipping a cross in her skull. Excellent. The guy who played "Multiple Miggs" in Silence of the Lambs is fantastic in an ax battle. <br /> <br /> The film is surreal and with the ending, I'm not sure if the events happened or if they were in Stefan's head because of his rejection by his would-be girlfriend. Return to revenge and that scene is brutal. <br /> <br /> The director also talked about the issue of religion that is improperly used to support wars and killings. I see it for sure, the vision of Savini's religion was appalling. <br /> <br /> This was a strangely exceptional film with some stars like Savini and Pitt, a nice supporting cast including sexy girls, big blood scenes, action, and all the time you're wondering what the hell is going on and what will happen next. <br /> <br /> This deserves ten stars because it is an excellent independent film, I don't think it was a low budget, but it had to be much less than a studio budget, yet they managed to create something really attractive, unique and inspiring .
