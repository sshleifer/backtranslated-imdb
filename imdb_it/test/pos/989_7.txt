I can't classify it very well, because I can't say I liked it. But it's the story that bothered me, not the making of the film. The acting, the direction, the atmosphere, the music were all good. It's just that after seeing a lot of people doing things you can't really relate to, the movie ends. It is educational in the way it shows the horrors of war seen from home and the way feelings do not need any meaning and is still strong, but that is all. <br /> <br /> plot covers a period of several years in which the poet Dylan Thomas is taken under the roof of a former ex-girlfriend. He is married, takes his wife and later the child, while the ex (Knightley) marries another boy. But the tension is there, Dylan is a fool obsessed with himself and the new husband comes home from the war with a slight case of PTSD. Add pretty characters and have your hands full. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: you must be "in the mood" to appreciate this movie. The difficult part is defining this state of mind. I don't think I've ever been there. Never. So it's probably best looked at by adults with a grip on strange complex human behaviors and perhaps a curiosity about Dylan Thomas.
