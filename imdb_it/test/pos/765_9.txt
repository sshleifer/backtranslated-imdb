I had heard of this film, but I didn't see it until my daughter, who saw it on a flight to Australia, told me it was a great movie. I was interested to see if Rupert Grint, away from Harry Potter, was showing the promise you see in Potter's movies. I was not disappointed. He became a good actor, showing a range in Driving Lessons from a shy boy who is knocked down by an obsessive mother who takes him around, to a young man who finds himself worthy of his own and the esteem of others. Going beyond the lines of games and poems with his elderly employer, it is obvious that he is ready to take on much more complex roles in films and on stage. But the jewel of this film was Julie Walters. I had seen it before in the movies of Potter, Billy Elliott and Calendar Girls, and I loved it. In Driving Lessons, while reciting from poetry and Shakespeare, I was struck by his timing, mastery of the language and body language. I hope it is makeup / costumes, while portraying an elderly woman with osteoporosis, even if there is no mention of the film - as a nurse, I can say that she did it perfectly, playing a woman in the brink of old age clinging to the glittering past he enjoyed. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and I wish I had seen it before at the theater ... but I doubt he ever played anywhere here in Albuquerque. We are missing so many of these types of films here.
