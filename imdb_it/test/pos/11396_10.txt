The splendor of this story offers at least one cleverly created message to every viewer of the audience. This story is about success, it's about failure. It's about the choices you make in life and the choices others make for you. The story is about self-realization and determination on such a large scale that no camera angle could cover. Within the understanding of each scene lies an element marked for representation in your imagination. Keep it in mind while watching the movie; it is more than a pleasure for the eyes. Sexually allusive, rarely explicit scenes only serve to distract and amuse you during the tedious character development process.
