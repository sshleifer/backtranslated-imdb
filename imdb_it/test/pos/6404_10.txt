Right now I'm watching "The Big Chill" on DVD. One of her actors is Meg Tilly. I searched on IMDb which led me to read Meg's biography that mentioned and reminded me of Meg's sister, Jennifer Tilly, whose filmography included "Key West", one of my wife's favorite programs and my favorites. Then I read this whole review thread. <br /> <br /> Wow, I loved the show and I agree with all the feelings about the eccentricity and uniqueness of the characters and situations. <br /> <br /> Like many others, I wish it was on DVD or otherwise available. <br /> <br /> The last reviewer says he looks at it in replies so I would like to know that network, channel, day, hours is on. <br /> <br /> So, if anyone knows how we can watch "Key West" episodes, let us know.
