I saw this portrait emotionally very painful and it was fascinating. The conflict between Williams' public and private faces and the pressures he was subjected to is illuminated in such a way that even those who knew something about him would be surprised. The cast performed superbly, but Michael Sheen was exceptional. I just realized it was him when I saw the previous comment. He looks completely different physically in this role, from any other role in which I saw him or as himself. Williams' autobiography differs greatly from his diaries, as represented in this film. The film is sometimes distressing to watch, due to the emotional anguish shown. However, it is a useful experience and a film that can be highly recommended.
