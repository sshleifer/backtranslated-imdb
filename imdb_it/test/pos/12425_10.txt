I saw it for the first time on request. Or on TV. I'm not really sure. But this must be my favorite movie of all time! I mean, this movie has blood, cold blood, laughter and chills during the movie. I recently ordered "Monster Man" from Amazon and saw "Monster Man" since I got it. Trust me, you'll love this movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. The comment on the DVD is a lot of fun. They also said something about "Monster Man 2" during the comment. We hope they make "Monster Man 2"! If you have the chance, rent the movie or buy it. You will absolutely love it! This is the best film released in 2003. <br /> <br /> 10/10
