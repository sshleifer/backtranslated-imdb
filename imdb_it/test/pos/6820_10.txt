The Youth In Us is a perfect gem for pitch. I saw this wonderful short film at this year's Sundance Festival 2005. The story took me on a deeply transforming journey. The direction of Joshua Leonard, the acting of Kelli Garner and Lukas Haas, the artistic direction, the cinematography, the soundtrack - every element was true to the bone. One can only hope that this exquisite and heartbreaking movie preludes to a great work by this gifted director. Just as a short film is shown before a film at Sundance, commercial cinemas used a similar format in the past. It would be wonderful if miniature masterpieces like The Youth In Us could reach a wider audience in this way.
