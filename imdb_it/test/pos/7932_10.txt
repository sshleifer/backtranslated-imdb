I learned a lot from the previous reactions of the spectators. Is there one that does not mention "propaganda"? Too silly. 'Perception depends on the concept'. I love Fred Astaire's musicals, the great, great songs, and Fred's unparalleled grace. But comrades, if you see idle, brainless parasites, rich people dancing on the oppressed and unemployed, this is a valid criticism of "capitalist propaganda". Is each film immersed in the values ​​of its time and place, not to mention those who finance it? the bagpipe players who call the melody. Great art transcends everything, as well as "Nevsky", as well as "All Quiet on the Western front". I confess. I've seen it for the last 40 years. But the images are burned in my brain. It's the biggest battle scene ever filmed. And it makes you horrified to be electrified. Did someone say 'plastic ice'? This is the real death you're looking at. The real extras died making this. The "real appearance" is now defined by special effects. Likewise "too long" - for an era of restricted attention? Did Mozart have "too many notes"? Propaganda, defamed Catholic Church? The Vatican was STILL when they invoked ancient favors to obtain the German Christian Democratic government. recognize Croatia in the 90s ?? do you remember the chaos and the genocides? Forget the props, has the lighting of the Nevsky painted the medieval world ?? like a Breughel. There's one in Hampton Court Palace that shows a massacre. Perhaps the raw Dutch nationalist propaganda, but tears to the heart. Stylized acting? So what is Henry V (Olivier's film)? Naturalism? Does anyone believe that the English medieval knight-knights spoke that way? As mentioned, Prokofiev's music is magnificent. Only Ken Russell & Eisenstein had the balls and the genius to combine sound and image at this 100 octane level. OK, you want the snaffle and bit. I risk every time my nerves are tormented. Eisenstein did not copy the Wehrmacht helmets, rather, his model seems to have been those buckets worn by the 'Teutonic knights' in the Nazi commemorations of the 1930s. Eisenstein was a genius, but unlike Hollywood directors, he had almost unlimited (non-commercial) time and funding. Modern Russian filmmakers are free from political constraints, but they have no money. Even Kurasawa had to make a (big) movie late in communist Russia. He was revered but not financed in his own country (very similar to Russell). How much propaganda is in the eye of the beholder? Imagine sensible people from another peace-loving world. How would they react to Nevsky? Does battle, or pain for the dead, dominate their knowledge? If we were not aware of the gas chambers and the SS, what about 'Triumph of the will'? Where can I find a Nevsky DVD, cheap?
