When I was a child, I loved "Tiny Toons". I particularly appreciated "Tiny Toons: how I spent my summer vacation". I thought it was fun to laugh on the floor. A few years later, my friend got the video. And I thought I'd watch it for the good old days. I was still on the floor laughing. My opinion, the scene from Plucky and Hampton is the best. They decide to go to "Happy World Land". And they end up having a crazy adventure to get there. All the skits are fun. I'm still looking for the video. So if anyone has any advice. Please write to me. <br /> <br /> This is one of the funniest comics I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 10/10
