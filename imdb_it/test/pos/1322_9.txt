It took several visualizations to fully appreciate this film. Initially, I was struck by the stylized sets, but I found the rest slow and boring. I thought that such a sensational subject needed Ken Russell's treatment to go further. Now I find that the restriction imposed (placed on production by Mishima's widow) is an advantage. Some of the darker aspects of Mishima's life are reiterated and dramatized by corresponding themes of his novels. I think it is helpful to be familiar with the novels - this is what ultimately made the difference for me. I still feel that the film as a whole could be a little tighter and warmer, but it's really unique and deserves serious attention. I love the fact that Japanese characters speak Japanese, not English. The Philip Glass score is fascinating.
