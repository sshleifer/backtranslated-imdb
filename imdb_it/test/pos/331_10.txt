You don't have to be a tamilian to appreciate this jewel of a movie. I don't know a word of Tamil and I saw this film just because a friend had recommended it to me. Understanding a film without knowing the language is rather difficult but I could understand the story because the main actors (and the actresses) have emulated very well. And the little girl was really pretty (she wasn't as irritating as child actors in most Hindi movies). The story is really moving Mr. Ratnam for trying something different. The relationship between parents and their children is shown quite realistically. (I could identify myself with the characters in the film). It was all a movie that will remain in my heart forever and I would not hesitate to recommend it to my friends. Even the songs have just come out of this world! They have been beautifully and meaningfully photographed. If only you could understand the right meaning of the texts :(
