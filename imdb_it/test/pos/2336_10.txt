I liked this movie since I first saw it in the theater. Some films have a cast of characters and a script that come together in perfect synergy, and this is one of them. The characters illustrate some truths about how to get the best out of people, work together harmoniously, build a team and achieve goals, without ever preaching morality. The situations are well done and consistent with the premise of opening the film. The tension develops well and the humor is clean and consistent all the time. The film manages to pull me in to cheer on the characters, and to laugh pretty well all the way through. This is a good movie as good as them. <br /> <br /> What amazes me is that a film that looks so simple can be entertainable in the long term. Music is a perfect copy of music in the typical films of the post-war navy, which helps to create humor and emphasizes that greatness is in the eye of the beholder. The scenes in the credits are an excellent music video of "In the Navy", which deserves its special full-screen function. The scenes and cuts are done well, and casting and acting are right in their place. <br /> <br /> This film is a classic as big as ever, unpretentious. In fact, the lack of pretensions is what makes it so fun to watch. I love these boys and girls. <br /> <br /> The other day I thought about the movie and wondered if it was available on DVD. Luck came to us, and the DVD came out in May 2004. I headed to the store and took a copy. Then my wife and I enjoyed another hilarious night in front of the big screen. I voted this film as a 10 because it meets on all levels, much better than many high-budget films and Oscar winners. This is entertainment. <br /> <br /> Listen to Fox home video: you have a great movie in your vaults, and it's a shame to find a cheap DVD with degraded and degraded colors just 8 years after publication. So why not restore the colors and present the film as it should have been seen? I would be happy to pay you a few dollars more to get the right photo. I am grateful to have my copy. Now give us the eye candy that the film deserves and how to recreate the credit sequence as a special full screen music video function.
