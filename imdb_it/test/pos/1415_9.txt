Stephen Hawking has one of the greatest minds, or if it is too simplistic to coin for him one of the most curious and daring, who is also trapped in a body paralyzed by a disease that leaves him in a wheelchair and a computer to communicate. Maybe I didn't know enough about Hawking (I always knew him as "that guy who talks like a computer who knows a lot about how, the universe and stuff, you know") who is English, who was rather a normal guy and maybe the thing more extraordinary, the illness that could have left him dead at age 21 put him in a position to focus his life. <br /> <br /> According to Errol Morris he is equally curious and coldly, visually portrayed dazzling in A Brief History of Time, Hawking was already brilliant, jerky (when the other Oxford students had to face awful algebraic equations, he replied more than three times the amount in an hour), but faced with challenges, mostly from other theories of other scientists, it bounced off with its own. Under some of the complex scientific discourses - and if you have less than a B- in astronomy, like me, you will need to keep your ears especially raised in explanations about the possible infinite of time or the peculiarities of the black hole - there is a human being who he just wants to enjoy his goose on his birthday. <br /> <br /> Morris captures Hawking right for those who can't get enough of his theories about how particles can get in and out of a black hole, or if there's even a creator or not depending on how much take into account Einstein and the weather. But it also captures the background on the man and his condition, which makes it much more interesting than if Morris had done one or the other. Too much talk about the cosmos would hurt the head, and too many things about his personal life, and one might wonder what the problem with this guy whose film title was on the bestseller lists for over five years. <br /> <br /> Almost despite his appearance, Hawking defines what a conscious entity must be in a universe that, he notes, will not be separated if and when the universe goes on for another 10 billion years. Through all this, in A Brief History of Time, we see a genius and his humility (not to mention his colleagues and the ten cents of the family here and there) through an unfathomably hypothetical and mathematical thought process of the universe.
