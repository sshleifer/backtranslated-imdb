Some people are born with mourning souls with their singer singed singularly until they encounter another tortured and / or bitterly sweetly beautiful soul like theirs and unusual magic. YOU ARE ALONE is a brutally honest look at two tortured souls that intertwine for a moment of understanding and uniqueness only to be torn apart by the differences in the unity between their pain. Death is explored in a figurative and literal sense. It is what happens when the soul is dead or at the same time too alive, too awake for reality. It is the life NOT that you imagined behind the eyes of passers-by. This film explores the painful pain in all of us, the frown under the cheerful facade, the pain below. The animalistic and ugly and instinctive thoughts and acts become honest and are made in fact and then Bechard sprays a bit of unexpected innocence and beauty in the mix knowing that both linger in all of us. Bechard, the writer, is an expert observer of the human condition and, due to his non-judgmental attitude, presents life in a light that we often shield our eyes but we wish to see and understand. He, as a director, focuses on the nuances of the spirit of the actors that emerge from the character they are interpreting for the personal familiarity of the actors with the emotions aroused by each situation. This is the portrait of the most accurately written and directed character of the experience of a man and a woman whom I have already met, even if the two characters met probably are not the "normal" encounter. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack encapsulates in each text of the songs what the characters would have let their hearts pour out, if they were strong enough and capable. It is the true voice of every character sung through the beauty, pain, talent and emotional intelligence of emerging indie artists ready to explode on the alternative music market. The perfect soundtrack for those of us with problems - those of us who admit to having problems and those of us who hide it. <br /> <br /> I always like to explore the darker sides of life with Mr. Bechard both fascinated by the creative and realistic vision of life and the characters that revolve within it.
