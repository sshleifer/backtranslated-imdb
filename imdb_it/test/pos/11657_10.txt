The biggest effort plus the most beautiful cast ever assembled in a film by director Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn in the front row. Someone said that this film is good because it is directed and written by Tim Robbins, but I convince you that Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon gave me a really superb performance that made me cry. Their acting is so real! There is no doubt that this film is rated 4 and 3/4 out of 5!
