This is a must-see movie. You will laugh, cry and when it is over you will want more. Well written and compelling, this film attracts you and holds you tight. The casting was perfect, the characters determined and the performances outstanding. "The nanny" is the standard that all women should follow: strong, indulgent, protective and never judgmental. "Nanny", for me, is the epitome of what a Christian mother and woman should be: a true pillar of the community. If I were half of the "Nanny" woman, I could consider myself okay. I would have been devastated if "Nanny" died at some point in the film, but since she didn't, I will definitely buy it when it comes out on DVD. I can only hope that the story continues and that Ruben returns to Lackawanna to try to rebuild the city, piece by piece and person by person.
