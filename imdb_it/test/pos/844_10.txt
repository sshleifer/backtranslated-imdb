I loved this show. I think the first time I tried rock street ice cream was due to this show. Wasn't the shop right on the beach or something? I actually wrote back and forth with Marci for several years. I lost contact and I wish I could reconnect now as adults. Does anyone know where he is now? I would like them to publish it on DVD. I seriously doubt that since I think there are maybe five or six people who remember the show being broadcast in the first place. They just don't do shows like this anymore, do they? I wonder if it could still hold up in this day and age. Guys, do you know anyone who could burn the DVDs of the show they recorded on VHS? I would be willing to pay (within reasonable limits).
