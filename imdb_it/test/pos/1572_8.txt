This is a small budget jewel and well acted. Alice, a teenager from Massachusetts, tired of her existence, takes the road to escape her mother who spins the burgers and her work as a check in a supermarket. He leaves for Florida and stays with his richest high school friend who is a freshman in Miami. After her car breaks down suspiciously on the highway and she loses all her money, she ends up with a retired couple in a camper van who finds herself traveling to Florida. excessively hospitable and, it turns out, a prostitute and her pimp. Slowly, Alice is lured into the prostitution of a truck, while the camper approaches the Florida headquarters. Through intermittent flashbacks, we learn a little more about Alice and her desire to leave little Milford. We also see the couple in a new light and their life and the choices made by the couple and Alice seem quite credible. An excellent and well-made film that you will think about when it is finished.
