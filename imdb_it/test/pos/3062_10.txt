I can't believe there are people who don't like this movie! I thought it was the funniest movie I'd ever seen. I was my biggest fan of Mel Brooks ... I know almost all the words and I am very discouraged when they censor them, when they are played on a familiar channel. :) this is one of my favorite movies, so I don't know why nobody would disagree! thanks Kristina
