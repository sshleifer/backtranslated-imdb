I have a small hobby of finding really interesting photos out there that are practically unknown - and then letting people know about them. This is at the top of my list to get the word out this summer. This independent film (and I really mean Indie - not Miramax, Fox Searchlight indie) might be easy to overlook in the big celluloid maze, but if you want something completely different - you have to check it out. <br /> <br /> Basically, I thought it was absolutely fantastic. I should have known from the front cover of the DVD, front and back, that this would have been something completely different, but EVERYONE said their stuff was different to hook. Well, this is really totally different. It's in your face: beautiful and scary and shameless to tell you to wake up. War, peace, 9/11, poetry, even a kind of disturbing music video set on a "patriotic" song of ancient times and a strange boy in a camper. Do I have to say anything else? Just see it.
