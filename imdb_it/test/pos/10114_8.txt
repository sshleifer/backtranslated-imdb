Call it a maniac manipulator if you want, but I'm in love with it. Of course, there could have been more character development. Yes, there could have been better cinematography and less a constant "movie of the week", but Ed Harris was impeccable, Cuba Gooding adorable and moving, and let's tell people, in real life, how many of us really come to know the motivation of others . Not many. We had a little look at the coach's motivation (a very challenging dialogue in my opinion, not to be soon forgotten) so, in my opinion, this was an adorable tribute to a human being who came out of his "comfort zone" to reach out to another human being, and meanwhile, touched hundreds of other lives. A lesson that we all need to remember. Why is that the right thing to do is often the hardest thing to do? I recommend this beautiful little film to anyone with a heart. You will not be disappointed. And bring your Kleenex. 8/10
