When the film started, I thought it was a cheese. The first ten minutes were really boring. After the slow start and some of the antics of the soap opera, I started to like him. The plot was unlike anything I'd ever seen. Now, was it a horror? Not exactly. It should not have been classified as a horror film or the producers should have put more money into the film to make it scary. As it was, the creatures were only there for a short time. I can only assume it was for money reasons. <br /> <br /> The positive side was that the film was a lot of fun. It interested me (after leaving) and made me think about creatures of another dimension. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that it was a film for the first time for the director, but there were a couple of highlights. In the end, I was hooked. Too bad Hollywood hasn't put more money behind it.
