I looked at it because a friend told me it was pretty damn good, and I saw a video about it, so I was really interested in watching it. I looked at it and, damn it, the fight scenes are REALLY good. If the boys can't fight like that in real life, they definitely made fun of me. There isn't as much fighting as I would like, I have to say, but the fights in the film are quite spectacular. They don't show much, but you can say it's violent and cool. But there is also the plot, which surrounds a love triangle between the main characters, even if it is a little distorted. Tae-sung is a carefree guy who seems to love getting into trouble, as well as fighting. He is the head of his school, and is the rival of Hea-won, who is the head of his school - a little playboy, a hot head and a rich boy. Then there's Han-kyung, a girl who doesn't have much to do for her - her father just died and came back with her mother, the guy she liked is dating her old friend -, and then meets Hea- won, who goes to her school, and Tae-sung, who calls her "nuna" (older sister). In the end, he discovers that Tae-sung is his brother, the result of one of his father's affairs, and that he loves her despite their blood relationship. Meanwhile, Hea-won falls for her, and takes her as her boyfriend. But she is torn between her boyfriend and her little brother, who confesses her love. Overall, it's a wonderful movie, but if I was really depressed after the end, and I couldn't help but think, dammit, are they all Korean movies that I watch on fighting / death / depressing stuff / incest ?? Because it was the case of Old Boy and Temptation of Wolves. It is a very beautiful film, but in the end people have to be ready to cry.
