SHOWTIME is a disaster, but it's a funny mess. The plot is forgettable, the satire is light and the action sequences, even if well staged, are not so exciting. But I laughed. A lot. The credit goes to the passionate coupling of De Niro and Murphy. They have great chemistry. Murphy offers the jokes, De Niro makes us drool with a look or a grimace. This film will have a reception similar to RUSH HOUR by critics. Do not listen to them. If you are a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you will like this movie.
