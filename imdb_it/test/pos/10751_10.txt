I really enjoyed this old black and white talkie. At first I didn't recognize Harold Lloyd as Mr. Cobb, a missionary in China who came home to find a wife. There were many twists and turns in Mr. Cobb's attempts to clean up the town hall. His methods of making punishment suitable for crime would probably be illegal, but this is not a reality-based film. This would be a perfect movie for children, except for the fact that there is a female close to nudity (messes only on Grace Bradley)! The old phones are lovely. The only flaw is a typical problem of the day - Caucasians are used to represent Chinese men. This is offset by the positive way in which the Chinese are represented. They are wise, good and friendly boys. Curiosity: a Bekins truck appears in the film when the police have sold out Black Marias.
