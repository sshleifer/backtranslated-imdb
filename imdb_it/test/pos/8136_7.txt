No, this is not an Ed Wood movie. "Angora Love" is the latest silent film by Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. The end of an era! In the 1920s Laurel & Hardy left their mark on the silent film with films that are still popular and watched and broadcast regularly today. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this film is not among their best. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film sounds good and is good. The boys join a goat this time, which naturally gets them in trouble and for us some hilarious situations to watch. However, at the same time it is extremely silly and absolutely incredible to see the boys do comical things with a goat. Most of the jokes in the film still work well, but the film, however, is never really hilarious or memorable. Comedy and history sometimes seem really lacking and are mostly too simple and predictable. <br /> <br /> Obviously still quite good and fun to watch for fans, but still a little disappointing Laurel & Hardy's last entry. <br /> 7/10
