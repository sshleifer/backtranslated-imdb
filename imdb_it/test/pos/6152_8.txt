It looks like it's a Czech version of Pearl Harbor. He has the same story, both boys fall in love with the same woman. And to add to the twist, the woman is actually a married woman whose husband has been missing for a year. I don't think the plot is too strong. The younger guy is pretty fluffy, he's cute. It kept me looking because of emotional music and pleasant scenes one after the other. It also has some strong visual special effects. Best of all, love stories are perfectly integrated with the story. <br /> <br /> I think if it were in English, it would be a big hit in all states. Too bad that not many people are open to foreign films.
