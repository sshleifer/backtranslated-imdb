This is one of the best courts in Stooges. He was the only one of their short films to be nominated for an Oscar. In this short the Stooges play doctors, which cause some trouble as usual. This short has gags, jokes and non-stop bars. The part at the end, where the Stooges are breaking up the car. This is definitely a classic. I highly recommend this Three Stooges short.
