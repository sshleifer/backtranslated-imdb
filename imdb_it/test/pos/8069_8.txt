La Antena, a daring film by Argentine director Esteban Sapir, succeeds both as a reinvention of the silent film genre and a compelling tale of warnings. The setting is a city enslaved by senseless television, its people deprived of the power of language except a solitary and mysterious presence on the screen known simply as The Voice. In an attempt to consolidate his grip on power, the wonderfully evil duo of TV tycoon Mr. TV and mad scientist Dr. Y has decided to kidnap The Voice and turn his unique talent into his cowards. It is up to a young family and the unnamed child of The Voice to stop this evil scheme. The result is a rollercoaster of a story that, at times, is disconcerting but no less compelling. <br /> <br /> This is a silent film that wears many of its influences on the sleeve; explicit references to silent film greats like George Melies and Fritz Lang will be readily apparent to anyone with a familiar familiarity with their work. But more subtle references and symbols lie behind these tributes. I particularly like the fact that Mr. TV and his henchman revolve around the typical gangster cars of the 1930s, attracted by the decade in which the era of silent cinema became extinct and a very different sector began to emerge. <br /> <br /> La Antena extracts the clich√© plot devices and the excessive theatrical acting common to many silent films, even if in a very conscious and humorous way. It is the astonishing visual style of La Antena that really sets it apart from the films it pays homage to. From the hypnotic logo of TV to the threatening hillside broadcast station, does this film abound with imaginative visual inventiveness that is the rival of an animation by Studio Ghibli ?? and all this using real actors and handmade sets. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, although the style is often intentionally banal and theatrical, this is still a disturbing, provocative and emotional picture. The use of religious symbolism throughout La Antena lends further resonance to the struggle between the television empire and the waning power of words. At the same time, many of the most powerful images are original, including the hypnotic swirl of televisions and the TV nightmare factory. <br /> <br /> I hate to finish this review on a harsh note, but I feel that the English-language release of La Antena is disappointed with the subtitles. The original Spanish subtitles are used to great effect, with much play on the words on the screen. However, the English subtitles that accompany the original dialogue are frustratingly incomplete, with omissions and errors sometimes leaving the viewer to put things together by themselves. La Antena is still a surprising piece of cinema; a visually breathtaking experience that shows great energy and humor while telling a powerful story of warnings.
