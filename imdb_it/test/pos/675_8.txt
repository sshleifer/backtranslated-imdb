Beware My Lovely was born from a play written by Mel Dinelli who apparently loved to write about frightened women. His first and best effort was the screenplay for The Spiral Staircase. He also did a Loretta Young thriller, Cause for the Alarm, a couple of years ago. Dinelli's play was originally called The Man and ran for 92 shows on Broadway during the 1950 season. It was Dinelli's only effort on Broadway and starred with Dorothy Gish and Richard Boone. <br /> <br /> The roles played by Gish and Boone are played by Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan. For whatever reason RKO thought of eliminating the age difference. The same Dinelli rewrote his work for the screen, so I'm wondering what he thought of it. Surely the delicate issue has been completely eliminated from history. <br /> <br /> It wasn't the only thing that was eliminated. People wear vintage clothes from the First World War, but there is no reference to the time when this story takes place. I thought it was weird and later, when the phone company repairer came to Ida Lupino's house, I noticed that his truck was a vintage of the same era. <br /> <br /> The film is set almost entirely in the home of Ida Lupino, where he hired a traveling stranger in Robert Ryan as a handyman. The film is a great lesson in objects in not hiring strangers without reference. It turns out that Ryan is a schizophrenic who imprisons Lupine in his home for about a day. <br /> <br /> Both leads do excellent jobs even with the changes made. Movies like Beware My Lovely are the things that a small studio like RKO has done better. If this had been done at MGM or Paramount, the bright traps would have overwhelmed a solid story.
