Kramer vs. Kramer is an almost encouraging drama about the shocking, drastic increases in the two subjects of a failed married couple. Meryl Streep, in her delicate maternal sensitivity, plays an unhappy housewife who feels confined to that role and leaves her inattentive husband in a fantastic performance by Dustin Hoffman in the first five minutes of the movie to find another role for itself. Hoffman is stunned, having absolutely no idea what to do with himself, having so taken for granted that he doesn't know the first thing about how to bring his son to school at school. <br /> <br /> Hoffman perfectly characterizes this husband is such a juicy load of setbacks. It is restless, relentless and impatient, but even if the positive side of these three adjectives should include exactly the opposite, it is incessantly fixed on whatever turns its head. He focused on his career in advertising, and when his son Billy is left to grow up all by himself, chaos starts immediately. He is the one who throws the tantrums and quits anger halfway through the activity. After a while, while making friends with his neighbor and former friend of Joanna, played by the sexy Jane Alexander, Hoffman cools his jets to the point of understanding why his wife left. Meanwhile, his boundless energy is headed for Billy's rise and he loses his job. <br /> <br /> The battle for custody of the title is a brilliantly gray circumstance. Even if the ending is a bit unmotivated, subjectivized by the public, the last line and the last shot still have that witty touch of writing on the screen that seemed to diminish after the magical 70s.
