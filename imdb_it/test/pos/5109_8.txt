If you only see an Ernest movie in your life, do it! This is by far the best in the series, with its non-stop laughter and intelligent humor suitable for all ages. The other "Ernest" films were also good, but most people tend to get tired of him quickly (not ME, anyway.) <br /> <br /> In this film, Ernest P. Whorrel is awarded the task of juror for a murder case. The killer, Nash, looks EXACTLY like our clumsy hero Ernest. Mr. Nash believes this is a good opportunity to escape from prison, throwing him out to change his identity with him, and so we can see how Ernest reacts in slammer. <br /> <br /> A great movie! If you haven't already seen it, look at it!
