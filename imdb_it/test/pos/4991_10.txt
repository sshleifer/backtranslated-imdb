I am very impressed with the acting in Comanche Moon. Before I started watching this, I didn't expect it to be as good as Lonesome Dove. I could not believe how the actors were chosen to represent all the characters. It occurred to me how well they played each role! This in my opinion is almost as good as Lonesome Dove. It is difficult to compare any film with Lonesome Dove. If you don't make this comparison, I'd give you a thumbs up. It was very funny! He didn't post many comments on this site, but I felt I had to get my opinion out there. Amazing! I don't want to name all the actors that were brilliant, because I probably should list them all. My favorite was Steve Zahn. He hit the nail on the head playing Captain Gus. His manners were perfect.
