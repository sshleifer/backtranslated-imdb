From the first to the last scene of the film, the director Visconti excels in his art, to the extent that the film is assured to remain a cultural treasure for God knows how much. It is perfection - like a film, that is, but the story has some minor gaps. <br /> <br /> The Thomas Mann novel is also a perfect work of art, so obviously it's impossible to take it to another media. Visconti follows the story more or less, and it is only when he is allowed to deviate slightly that the transition falters. And no matter how wonderful the scenery, the tension in the air between the characters, the hundreds of subtle signals and allegories, the almost unbearably increased service of Mahler's music - yet, the slightest anomalies in the plot disturb me. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm just a victim of man's desire to crack the impeccable. However, I will offer an example, which I consider fundamental. <br /> <br /> WARNING: SPOILERS <br /> <br /> In Mann's story, Aschenbach eats strawberries that probably contain the disease that will kill him, having given up his frustrated chase of the boy Tadzio in Venice. Unable to capture a delight, he settles for another - which poisons him. It's very thin in the book, but it's there. The forbidden fruit, more, but more a sign of him that surrenders to life itself. <br /> <br /> In Visconti's film, he also eats strawberries, but in a rather insignificant scene near the beach. The pursuit in Venice ends in a much more melodramatic way. It also works, but it lacks some subtlety, indeed, and even the multi-layered symbolism, giving food for thought. <br /> <br /> But it is all forgiven, when the film allows us to feast on splendid scenery, faces and constellations, and certainly like many other symbols that we can possibly digest - Tadzio's last gesture, standing in the water, it is the same sublime and mysterious ending.
