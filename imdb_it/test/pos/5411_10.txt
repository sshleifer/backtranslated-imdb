Imaginary Heroes is clearly the best film of the year. It was a complete and total joy to watch. I was nailed. The entire audience at Sunset Five was pinned, when the film ended no one moved, spoke, nothing. I think this film is a perfect example of the power that drama has. Especially as it gives an example of the quality of the drama / work of this young generation. <br /> <br /> There have been moments in your film, many, like at least seven, in which I was struck by such an amount of beauty, emotional beauty, that I really couldn't breathe for a while. And for a catharsis addict like me, this is the best censorship experience I could ask for. It is the result of a powerful and masterful narrative and direction. Like heavy stuff, like Burtolucci and those guys. <br /> <br /> Each element of the film fits perfectly. There were no missteps. The cast was fantastic. I have been a big fan of Emile and Ryan for a long time and thought they were never better. I was / am / will be constantly stunned by this movie. And I promise I'll drag every person I know to see it. It should be seen. He should win prizes.
