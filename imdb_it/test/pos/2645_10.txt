This was a great movie. It was made with such a beautiful design, a similar symmetry. I love the way classical music is linked to the classical art of the earth, of space and beyond. It was such a smooth and stimulating masterpiece. I loved the way the monoliths never changed, even though primates, earth and space did. I loved how it was a question of "Do you need me / us now"? The film expresses desire, peace, love, curiosity, delicacy, kindness, courage and innocence. What more can you ask from a simple movie? Perhaps a complementary film. Any admirer of 2001: A Space Odyssey will find that the 2010 film is the complementary film of 2001. 2010 is more history-oriented than in 2001.
