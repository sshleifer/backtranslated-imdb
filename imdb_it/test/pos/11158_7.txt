Jacques Audiard's directorial debut See How They Fall alias Regarde les Hommes Tomber is our old friend, the film with two different stories that gradually converge and reveal themselves after all the same story, told simply by different parts. It's a messy dog ​​story, with Matthieu Kassovitz's beggar following the unfortunate moron of the Jean Louis Trintignant cards with a mutt-like devotion that even tries to kill him when asked to repay gambling debts in kind. Meanwhile, in a slightly different time frame, Jean Yanne's traveling salesman becomes increasingly obsessed with finding the hit man who put his friend a cop in a brain coma, his life, his income and his relationships gradually torn away closer to its prey. Yet, while it can offer the perfect setup for a neo noir of our day, the film is often more surprisingly playful, more interested in oddity of character and a slightly distorted sense of humor (rightly served by occasional ironic captions and the emotional of Alexandre Desplat) cheeky score, half discordant) compared to the traditional pieces of the thriller and the mechanics of the plot. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the film is badly served by one of the worst DVD Region 1 released in recent years: the image quality on Synkronized's disc is so poor sometimes you continue to expect to see the heads of the audience in front to the photo like a pirate record.
