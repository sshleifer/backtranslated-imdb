I had only written a review on IMDb before this, because I consider most of the games unworthy of time and effort ... Curse of Monkey Island is different. <br /> <br /> Having played and impressed with Monkey 1 and 2, I had high expectations for the third version ... and I was not disappointed. The first thing that struck me was the substantially improved graphics. Don't get me wrong, for the games made in 1990 and 1991 respectively, Monkey 1 and 2 were revolutionary and provided the products well, but CMI comes forward and offers a superb cartoon-style game that is both fun and satisfying. All the scenes and settings have been made with care and well studied, and are perfectly suited to this type of game. Animation / CGI is a mixture of realism and exaggeration; a fantastic combination in this case. <br /> <br /> For me, the script was fundamental to the success of the previous two games. The CMI script is intelligent, appropriate and, above all, absolutely fun. Added to this, the script is now audio unlike the previous two where the speech is displayed in text format at the bottom of the screen. Dominic Armato's voice is perfect for Guybrush: witty, clear and slightly naive. All other vocal talents fit their characters perfectly, especially Earl Boen who is the voice behind LeChuck. I loved every single character in the course of the game: not only their personality and intelligence, but the way in which each character is animated in a superb and distinctive way. While talking about audio effects, the soundtrack deserves a mention. The soundtracks for Monkey 1 and 2 were both monotonous, and yet they were very effective in giving atmosphere and representing a change of mood. The CMI soundtrack is, once again, a step forward. Each scene is completed by a catchy, subtle, playful and pirated melody (if it is a word). With a change in setting or mood, the music also fits, adding to the entertainment and fun that the game offers. <br /> <br /> The idea behind Monkey Island is to solve puzzles and problems to progress. This may seem easy, but in reality it is diabolically difficult in many places. Some may be discouraged by the level of logic and the amount of thought that comes to Monkey Island, but in reality this makes the game even more fun and entertaining, and also adds to the replay value. The "The Curse of Monkey Island" or "The Curse of Monkey Island: Mega-Monkey" option (which involves bulkier and more abundant puzzles) adapts to players of all abilities and also gives good reasons to play at least twice . Whatever level of difficulty you choose, you will be guaranteed a different game every time you replay, with numerous speech options and other puzzles to solve that do not affect the outcome of the game, but are just for fun. The funniest section of the game is Ship Combat, and the "fight" sword that follows. These were particularly well thought out and make the game absolutely useful. Add to this a wonderful non-violent story suitable for all ages that will keep you hooked and want more until the end. <br /> <br /> Finally, in the end, a special special mention must go to the designers of this game. The way each puzzle is complex and the problem is thought of is simply amazing. While collecting objects and objects during the game, you cannot see how each one will help you progress, but with a little reflection and perseverance solutions are presented, and for this reason the designers of CMI must be praised. <br /> <br /> 10/10 for the best game I've ever played (not exaggerated)
