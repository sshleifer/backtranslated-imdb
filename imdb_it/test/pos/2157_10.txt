Hard Justice is an excellent action movie! The whole movie is nothing but shooting and fighting but has a very good vampire plot! For people who say they are not shooting and fighting films as they are used to doing. Well, this is really hard-core! Don 'The Dragon' Wilson is excellent and his character is really nice in the film. Nicholas Guest was very good and probably steals the show! It really performs like a fantastic villain! Melanie Smith was also good. I think this beautiful looking actress is underestimated. Michael Cavanaugh was good. It was really good to see Vince Murdocco in this movie! As for the action, it's really cool with all the gun fights and super cool fighting scenes. The fights in this photo are really among the biggest I've seen! There is so much that happens in the 86 minutes of execution. For action fans you will be captivated by all the power of fire and the superb fights that this film has to offer! Night Hunter is a film that is not easy to locate and if you are in a video store and you see it for sale buy it because this film is a great caretaker and the box is fantastic! There is a lot of action that must be seen to be believed! See and see if you can find some good deals on Ebay, Half.com, Amazon.com's Z-Shops and Market Place Sellers! According to My Night Hunter is one of the greatest fighting films I've ever seen and the characters are so clean. If you like Don 'The Dragon' Wilson and want to see Nicholas Guest in a great performance, I strongly recommend any action movie fan who likes to shoot, fight movies and vampire movies and was disappointed by other movies that have gaze of a real non-stop action movie, but can't deliver it to get and buy Night Hunter today!
