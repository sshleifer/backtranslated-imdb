Closet Land. The title itself evokes thoughts of secrets. And this is really what is at the center of this Amnesty International film. Government secrets, personal secrets, both are integral parts of this story. <br /> <br /> By far the greatest acting for too long, both Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe were phenomenal in their portrayal of a Government Interrogator and Victim, respectively. With only the two actors in this unusual standard film, it is immediately clear that both actors were talented and talented enough to push the viewer into this little world bubble and shut the door. <br /> <br /> A WORD OF ATTENTION ... <br /> <br /> What is not mentioned in the description of this film is that there is a subplot concerning child sexual abuse. Although there are no graphic details on the abuse, its nature may be difficult to observe for some viewers, especially given the intensity of the film in its entirety. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Amnesty International films, but this film attracted me because the acting was great and I can't help but make this movie one of my favorites.
