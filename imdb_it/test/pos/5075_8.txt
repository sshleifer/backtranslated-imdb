Most of this political thriller presented itself as a film mostly with a slightly better development than many of the main characters, which was highly appreciated, up to the big breakthrough and the powerful climax that recalled the twists and turns tested in "Silence of the Lambs". or "The Sixth Sense". Reese Witherspoon as the distraught wife of her missing Egyptian husband and Yigal Naor while the interrogator with strong arms offers strong performances. Jake Gyllenhaal unfortunately has a more two-dimensional character and has to struggle with a stereotypical presentation of the emotionally ripped CIA analyst that has been featured many times in other films. At the beginning there is the pleasant scene with an explosion that resembles a scene at the end of "Saving Private Ryan", the silent scene that has been used so effectively to reflect a consequence of violence. The script also provides a little more vision of the "enemy", but does not yet allow the public to understand much, allowing the public again to bask in a stereotyped characterization. Also the cinematography and the photography are a bit disappointing because unlike "Jarhead" or "Blackhawk Down" the crisp and raw visceral presentation that does not allow the public to be really present in the film is missing, there is a certain distance that keeps the public from becoming aware of the intensity of emotions that occur on the screen. However, overall, the film redeems itself by the end, offering the public a measured look at the complexity of the use of renditions by the United States and the possible complications and consequences that could occur during its use. Eight stars out of ten.
