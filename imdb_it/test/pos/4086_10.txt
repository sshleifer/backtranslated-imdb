Every year, TV produces dozens of real crime films. You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday for life, and Court TV can be invoked for a few every weekend. So I started looking at The Morrison Murders thinking that I knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent reconfirmation of a murder in the family. What I got was a subtle and wonderfully performed drama that absorbed me from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Both brothers were totally convincing and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in Luke's challenging role. The look and feel of Georgia was in almost every frame. If I had any complaints, it was Gordon Clapp as the sheriff. It simply does not appear nor behave like a small southern lawyer named Byron Calhoun. It looks and Medavoy, and Medavoy is not suitable for this part. <br /> <br /> But this is a small quirk: it's worth watching the Morrison Murders, and not just on a rainy Saturday afternoon. If you're leaving, register it. You will not regret.
