Typically Spanish production - slow motion, but with great sensuality and sexuality that exude from the main actress Paz Vega. (See it in "Spanglish"). Big sets, lots of colors - you get to see Cordoba, Seville, Spanish mountains and countryside. The plot tends to meander here and there, but if you follow it closely (I managed to do it, even if the film is in Spanish), you will get the juice. <br /> <br /> It is about how one very much. The very sensual young gypsy, Carmen, uses her feminine wiles to seduce men to do her bidding. Carmen is taken to prison after attacking a cigarette colleague at the cigar factory where he works. He convinces Jose, the soldier charged with taking her to prison, to let her escape. Jose gives in to his charm because he speaks Basque (he is from Navarre and speaks the same language). Jose is punished with a month in prison and demoted to foot soldier. Later he meets Carmen at a party and ends up becoming lovers. But Carmen refuses to engage with him, and continues her lascivious and flirtatious lifestyle. In a jealous rage, Jose kills another soldier who has been with Carmen. They must therefore leave the city. Life on the run turns Jose into a bandit. Carmen, meanwhile, remains the same, a wildly promiscuous woman. In the end, Jose loses his head and ends up killing Carmen. <br /> <br /> The story is told by Jose in prison, waiting to be executed. The person to whom he tells the story is Prospero Merrime, a French writer and anthropologist, whose fantasy clock (which plays Beethoven's Beethoven) was stolen by Carmen or Jose. <br /> <br /> It is worth looking at the sets and the delicious Paz Vega.
