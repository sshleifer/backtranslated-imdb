The first time I saw this movie, I wanted to like it for many reasons, but I just didn't do it. It seemed a little boring. But there was a little question I had about something I saw near the beginning of the film, so I looked at it again ?? and then finally clicked for me. I watched the film for the first time knowing the "surprise ending", and although I certainly don't feel like recommending the spoiled ending for you, I still enjoyed most of the film and discovered the many seemingly insignificant events that all unravel to indicate a very sinister pattern. <br /> <br /> I don't think everyone will love this movie, or even appreciate it. If you like actors, you'll like this movie because the acting is strong enough and everyone gets a lot of time on the screen. If you like mysteries (or Hitchcock) you'll like this movie. If you like independent or psychological films, you will like this movie. It really worked for me on all these levels. If you don't like actors, mysterious plots or psychological elements, you might not like this movie. But this is your loss. Personally, the only thing that bothered me a little was the accents. Nice attempt, Alan Rickman, on the American dialect, but it hasn't been much improved by the scene in Die Hard. (The wonderful voice, however, makes up for the bizarre accent.) The mixture of accents in the film was a bit strange, but he was not so distracted as to become difficult or particularly irritating. Furthermore, the camera changed from one scene to another was evident and could annoy some people, but actually I think it was added to the scenes (or scene? I can only remember a scene where the change was very different, but it worked) . <br /> <br /> When you see this movie, watch it at least twice. The second time you see it, I hope you realize how tangled the plot really is. Every time I watch this movie (it's less than an hour and a half then multiple views are not difficult) I seem to notice something else about it and I find myself wondering, "Why did it just happen?" or "Was it intentional?" I like movies that make me think. This does. So just see it. Twice.
