Alfred Hitchcock has produced many brilliant thrillers and many of them have been hailed as some of the greatest films of all time. A film that tends to get lost a little under Vertigo and Psycho is this film; Strangers on a Train, the most compelling film that Hitchcock has ever made. The story follows Guy Haines, a tennis player and a man who will soon marry the senator's daughter if he can get a divorce from his current wife. One day, on the way to see his wife, he meets the mentally unstable Bruno Anthony on a train and is soon dragged into a plot for murder that he can neither stop nor stop; and one that ultimately cost him his life. <br /> <br /> The conversation aboard the train between Bruno and Guy is one of the most intriguing and stimulating of all time cinema. What would happen if two people "exchanged" murders, thereby solving any suspicion of the crime and making their motives irrelevant? Could this really be the perfect murder? What makes this film even more terrifying is that the events Guy is led to can happen to any normal person every day. Everyone has someone he'd like to get rid of, so if you meet a fool on a train that does your murder for you and then forces you to do his? The chances of this happening are unlikely, but it is the idea that anyone could be a murderer who is central to Strangers on a Train's message; and in this situation, anyone could. <br /> <br /> Is there any actor on earth who can play the character of Bruno Anthony better than Robert Walker? Man was born simply for the part. He manages to capture the right mood for his character and absolutely commands every scene in which he finds himself. Bruno's character is a fool, but he's not crazy; he is a calculating and conniving human being and Robert Walker makes the character credible. His performance is extremely malevolent, yet discreet enough to keep the character firmly within the realms of reality. Unfortunately, Robert Walker died only a year after the release of Strangers on a Train, and I think it's a big loss to the cinema. No one in the cast shines as much as Walker, but it's worth mentioning his co-star Farley Granger. Granger never impresses so much, but his performance is quite good and holds his against Walker. His interpretation is also remarkable: he interprets his character as a very normal person; and this is how it should be. Ruth Roman is Guy's wife. It is not really in the film enough to give a lasting impression, but it does the best from what it has. Alfred Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia, plays the final role of the four central roles as Barbara, Guy's boyfriend's sister. She is adequately adorable in this role, and tends to steal many scenes where she is. <br /> <br /> The direction of Alfred Hitchcock is always sublime, and is very important in this film. There is one particular shot, which sees the murder of the film committed in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses. This is an absolutely brilliant shot and one that creates a great atmosphere for the scene. Hitchcock's direction is moody, and he respects the film's noir style. The apex of the film is both spectacular and exciting, and I don't think anyone other than Hitchcock could have brought it to the big effect that was shown in this film. It's really exaggerated and out of the rest of the film; but it works. There is a reason why Hitchcock is often cited as the greatest director of all time, and the reason is that he not only uses the script to tell the story of the film, but also uses the camera to do it. Strangers on a Train is one of the greatest thrillers ever made. Her story is both intriguing and stimulating, and she is sure to delight every movie fan. A masterpiece.
