Certainly this film is not for everyone, but for anyone who has a sense of humor and love for vintage films, buy this immediately! Where else can you get a run down 70s fashion, a primer of period vocabulary, karate-trained prostitutes, crime, a sinking of the Titanic, shootings and a co-star named Queen Bee ( watch out for his moving weeping scene at the beginning in the guardians' office!) With a cinematic style that is a cross between a porn movie / Dawn of the Dead / and Car Wash, you can't go wrong. This is one to watch over and over after putting the children to bed.
