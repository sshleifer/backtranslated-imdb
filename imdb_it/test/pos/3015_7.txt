I went directly to the big screen to see this kicker. This is the only film I know that Tarsem Singh directed but the boy was intense. This film was a total stimulant of the mind and one of the best special effects of this kind. <br /> <br /> The characters were vibrant and, to say the least, creatures created in your mind or in a nightmare. This film is scary and interesting and totally bombards the senses with fear and euphoria. This film is comparable to any other I've ever seen except for the level of being wonderfully strange. In this respect it is a fairly large step above "A Clockwork Orange". Definitely watch this movie on the big screen and not wait for it to come out on tape. It won't be half good on the tape. <br /> <br /> This movie is not at all easily out of my mind. It will ruin your mind and leave you with images that take some time to forget. But for those who like to be out of mind ..... GOOD!
