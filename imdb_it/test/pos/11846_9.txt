I loved this movie. There are many laughs. The acting is good and the writing is really sharp. I prefer to see a hundred films like this that TRE SIGNORE DEGLI ANELLI repeats and repeats. <br /> <br /> It's a low budget affair and seems to be shot on DV but looks good and Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson are great together. I'm not a critic, just a patron. <br /> <br /> I doubt very much that Quentin Tarantino can write such a funny photo without filling it with gratuitous and masturbatory violence. This film should be seen on more screens than one. I laughed from beginning to end. >
