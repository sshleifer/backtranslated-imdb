Once again, there are cowardly government agencies that stop at nothing to prevent public knowledge of some important events. In this case, the discovery of a new underwater species that could threaten the ecology of the planet. Although the creature is not E.T. Does he seem to make friends with a boy, who protects him at all costs, without realizing that he is only a child of the species and is about to become much larger? and worse This 2005 series had a lot to do. It's a family drama, a science fiction, a thriller with more than a few comic moments. The characters are credible, well recited and well photographed. The show attracts attention. Of course, as in any science fiction show, the suspension of disbelief must be achieved. And I think it's here. Alas, the series crashed after the first season, so we never have a resolution. Infuriante .. There is a general comment that I think is worth doing here. Many television networks and / or film distribution companies, quite arbitrarily, cancel seemingly excellent television series ?? particularly intelligent sci-fi. Now there may be good reasons for this, even if the public is treated with extreme contempt and rarely is the reason explained. This in itself is annoying. What really makes my goat is that, after erasing the series, they release the thing as far as it came, on DVD, in an obvious attempt to milk the cow to be milked as far as possible. For the previous viewers of the series it's okay, they know what they are for, but ?? many of these unfinished series end on a cliffhanger. Two that immediately come to mind are "Surface" and "Odyssey 5". If you've heard good things in the series and haven't seen it, go and buy the devastated DVD and end up with an unresolved plot problem ?? it makes me very angry !! I liked immensely "Surface" and I had not realized that the poor characters would end up in a situation that seemed absolutely unbearable ?? and we'll never know what happened next. I believe there should be a noticeable warning about all these DVD problems, in the sense that the story is not over. Today I check TV series purchases (IMDB is an obvious excellent starting point) to find out if a 'complete' series is really complete or not. Buyer be careful.
