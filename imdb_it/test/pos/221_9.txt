Police team! (1982) it was a fun show that ended too soon. But I imagine it was managed before it became too repetitive and not as fun as so many American TV shows. The geniuses behind this fun show were the team of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker. Since he starred in the comedy AIRPLANE !, Leslie Nielsen has found a new career as a comedian. In this short lived t.v. series had the chance to play the straight man in an extravagant comedy once again. The bizarre titles of each episode gave away the ending. But Lieutenant Drebrin (Leslie Nielsen) has come across so many strange cases that must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> Too bad they never published it on D.V.D. If a show needs to be re-released, this should be it. An entire new generation is waiting to see this show! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended!
