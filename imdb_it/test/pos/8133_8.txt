OK, I have no illusions that this is the typical gay love life but since when are romance novels in real life as they are on screen? This film is well balanced with comedy and drama and I enjoyed it a lot. It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' homes for his encounters with the flamboyant Darren (Tom Hollander). And after seeing him in Priscilla, the Queen of the Desert only the day before, he is probably one of the safest actors in their masculinity. :) Anyway, the plot ran smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a blast. Thumb up! 8/10
