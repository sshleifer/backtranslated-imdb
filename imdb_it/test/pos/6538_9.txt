I don't understand why everyone hates this movie, apart from the fact that they are simply jealous and their musical careers have never taken off like the mega Popstar Aaron Carter. Like it or not Aaron has seen more success in his young life than most people can ever dream of having, so it seemed natural for him to make a movie. Lou Pearlman and the company have been known for exploiting their pop protections out of proportion, do you remember Justin Timberlake's foray into the TV model Behavioral? Guaranteed that this film is not large and impressive, but it should not be. He's not trying to impress people or being an Emmy winner, he was released directly on DVD. It's just a nice movie about an awkward teenager who has the dream of being with her favorite Popstar; I know many of you out there have had that dream at one time or another about your favorite singer, don't deny it. He is gentle and kind and I applaud him for not entering the realm of sex, violence and vulgar language that seem to be increasingly present in our films. Where is the decency? Where is the line? Teen dramas reach dozens these days because teenagers are a big market for companies, at least this is more tolerable for me than Bratz (aka Slutz) with all the fake girls running around "Oh Mah Gawd!" in tank tops and miniskirts and is more robust than those festive films like Saw. I feel for the protagonist girl, because I was an exasperated high school girl who loved Aaron Carter and NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys and other pop music and still does it; and how Aaron's character would have crushed "testophobia", especially in mathematics. If you judge this film solely on the grounds that you don't like it or are jealous of Aaron Carter and his fame, then of course you will hate him and not talk in the comments. The only reason Britney Spears' Crossroads dribble scored higher is because she has boobs. Accept this film for what it is, not for what you want it to be. I think this happy formidable teen movie ends on a high note and makes you want to sing.
