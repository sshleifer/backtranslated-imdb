EIGHTEEN as written and directed by Richard Bell could have too many stories to tell at the same time for a 102-minute movie to fully succeed, but there is such a sense of commitment on the part of all the cast and crew that the viewer ends up wanting the movie worked - and so it is. Yes, the aspects could have been refined if the producers had more money to spend on the final cut, but as a small independent film from Canada this is a tender story, delicately humorous and very touching on vulnerability, communication and commitment. Works on many levels. <br /> <br /> In a very well choreographed opening we are voyeurs in a family dinner where obviously something went wrong and translates into a father and two children who get into the car and have an accident where one of the children gets killed. With such an introduction, the mood is set for Pip's 18-year-old survivor (Paul Anthony - who seems too old for his credibility as a teenager) to leave his family and live on the streets. He meets Clark (Clarence Sponagle), a prostitute who gives food and shelter to Pip, Jenny (Carly's dearest father) who saves him from an attack by his partner Derek (Ryan McDonell) and becomes romantically entangled with Pip, and father Chris ( Alan Cumming) in a nice and refined role as a priest. It is Pip's eighteenth birthday and his father (Serge Houde) trace Pip to give him a present from his deceased grandfather with instructions that the gift should be opened for Pip's eighteenth birthday. <br /> <br /> Pip, even if he drinks too much and is full of rage, he tracks the car but keeps the tape and starts listening to the words of his grandfather Jason (voice of Ian McKellen) who tells his eighteenth birthday in the second world war in France where (now the very sensitive actor Brendan Fletcher) has an experience with a wounded doctor named Macauley (also Mark Hildreth) and reflects on his one-night wedding with a cabaret singer Hannah (Thea Gill of fame "Queer as Folk" and a beautiful singer and actress here), just for something to survive during the war: Jason offers assistance to Macauley as he dies, with a fine scene of redemption for him two men at the end. The parallels of Pip and grandfather Jason intertwine every time Pip listens to the Pip videocassette and guide to ultimately modify his vision of life and love. Subplot includes the isolated existence of Clark as a braggart altered by Jeff (David Beazely - in a surprising cinematic debut) who simply wants to be loved; from an unexpected pregnancy between Jenny and Pip; from the trust that father Chris instills both Pip and Clark in a good pastor: and with a flashback to the car accident in which Pip could have saved his brother Daniel (Paul Dzenkiw) from an abusive act by his father, shortly before the incident, but failed to do so, opening his deep guilt and the resulting misplaced anger, reflected by his grandfather's recorded experiences. Each of these subplots unites at the end, creating a sense of closure for each of the people involved. <br /> <br /> There are aspects of this film that make it seem like a big budget production: Bramwell Tovey's soundtrack is played by members of the Vancouver Symphony, Kevin Van Niekerk's film is rightly suggestive, and the The general quality of this Canadian cast's acting is excellent. Although Paul Anthony manages his role well, the casting of a very young teenager in the main key role would have made the story much more interesting, and Richard Bell, with just another "Two Brothers" movie in his resume, promises a young talent to watch. Despite the shortcomings, EIGHTEEN is a worthy film and deserves attention. Grady Harp
