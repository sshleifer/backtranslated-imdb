I thought this movie was really cool! One of Drew's best. I'm also a fan of Michael Vartan, so I thought he was so hot in this movie. Because all the negative reviews. I would like to see this movie over and over again if I could. I also loved the ending. This film clearly showed a smile on my face! He also surprised me that there were James Franco and Jessica Alba. I love them both, so I also highlighted this film. In the end, when Drew makes the huge comment about the truth, he really told the truth about what sometimes happens in high school. Once again, the film was fantastic. Defiantly at 10/10. I hope this comment was very useful for IMDb readers.
