No one said that in "The Big Trail" and I thought it would be natural. However, this was one of the best westerns I've seen and I'm a big fan of horse and pistol movies. The scope and feel of this image is simply disconcerting and, as someone mentioned in their commentary, has the feeling of the 3-camera triptych of "Napoleon" (1927). Nowadays the cost of production and, above all, the cast of thousands, would be prohibitive, but Raoul Walsh did it. <br /> <br /> The cast was excellent, although John Wayne was better when he had no lines and just wide open. In particular, Tyrone Power, Sr. was a perfect villain - I had never seen him before and this was his only talking image. Ian Keith was a snake, but El Brendel is an acquired taste like comic relief. It can be fun or annoying, but above all the second - and it occurs in the most inappropriate moments. <br /> <br /> It's a little too long and it took a while before the Indians showed up, but this is the closest to a documentary on Manifest Destiny and true to life as you will see and a must for movie fans, regardless of gender preferences. When the settlers arrived in California I was exhausted.
