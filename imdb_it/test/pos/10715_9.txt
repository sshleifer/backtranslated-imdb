Inexplicably, I watched this movie for the first time only a couple of days ago, and I knew right away what it was. This film caught my attention from beginning to end, and made me go through the whole range of emotions (and perhaps helped me discover some that I never knew). Dustin Hoffman absolutely shines like Ted Kramer. He is absolutely convincing as a man who has to juggle at least three different challenges in life: an abandoned husband, a workaholic advertising operator and a loving father. Meryl Streep in the role of Joanna Kramer was less central in the film simply because Joanna was absent for much of it, but when she was on screen she gave Hoffman a run for her money. The real standout, though (in my opinion) was to be the young Justin Henry in the role of Billy Kramer. Children are always the innocent victim in a marital crisis, and Justin seemed absolutely natural and completely credible in this role while dealing with the mixed emotions around his mother and his adaptation to life with dad, only then to have confusion about why should I leave his dad when his mother went out with him. Young Justin didn't seem to miss a shot in this very difficult role. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is an excellent film, worthy of an Oscar whose only weak point was what I thought was really disappointing the decision to go for the light and the happy ending, which was totally unrealistic considering the destructive custody battle that Ted and Joanna had gone through. But there's not much else to complain about here. <br /> <br /> 9/10
