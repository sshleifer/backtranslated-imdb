This is screaming funny (well, except when Bruce is in the hospital scene, which is a little sad). <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi and Stacy Keach are both excellent and deserving to be watched. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not a big budget-controlled blockbuster, but it's all it promises to be and more - and BTW - women are wonderful in their parts, even if I don't know them from other movies , I would be glad to see them again. <br /> <br /> The two-brained scene is inspired and certainly a showcase for Bruce's extraordinary physical comedy, he is a delightful guy! <br /> <br /> Thanks Bruce, for your brain, this is your baby!
