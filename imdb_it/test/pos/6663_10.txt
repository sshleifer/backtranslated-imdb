This film moved me more than I expected, and I was completely ready to cry. The acting mainly brought this film, with superb performances by Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger, in addition to the supporting cast. These actors played so intensely human characters that they waited for the rest of the night with me, and I had trouble shaking up this war drama. Even the costumes and the cinematography were magical, but they did not allow themselves to be carried away. They didn't focus, but added the whole effect. Cold Mountain could never become my favorite movie, since that title will always belong to The English Patient, but it's in the top five. The story itself was well developed and remained rather unpredictable. I didn't find myself guessing which line would come later. A harrowing story about humanity and war. In fact, this film was so strongly real that it was barely noticeable in the 19th century. It seemed to apply to all times.
