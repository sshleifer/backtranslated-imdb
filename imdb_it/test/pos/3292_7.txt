This was in a strange movie. I liked the adventure even though it seems destined for children. (SPOILER AHEAD) Ironically, the main character kills a federal official. Then he is a fugitive on the run. Later they blow up his house and then eventually commit suicide. It seems they should have made a film for a more mature audience or made it more family-friendly. <br /> <br /> This was in a strange film.
