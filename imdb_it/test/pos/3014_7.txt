THE CELL fascinated me at first sight. I was a little surprised by this, because the story of that film is absolutely boring. If it didn't have a story, the film would have been better. Bunuels "Un chien andalou" comes to mind: a film without history, but also with fascinating and sometimes disturbing images. But THE CELL is at first a Hollywood movie and just a second piece of art. I am very interested in Tarsem's next project. Hamlet on Indian could be very interesting, especially when it looks the same as THE CELL. <br /> <br /> For film music fans: the Howard Shore soundtrack for THE CELL is absolutely wonderful, but a difficult listening experience, thanks to its very modernist style.
