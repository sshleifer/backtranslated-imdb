A very interesting addition to the Scandinavian surrealist collection. Recommended view for those who love complicated films. My interpretation of the "weird" ending would be that Andreas' journey ends up in hell. He does not like the bland emptiness of consumer-led purgatory; a sort of "living" but not progressing, that is not getting anywhere - even the city's subway trains do not stop at stations. It has a subway system, like you should be able to travel, freedom, escape, but you can never embark on those trains. He is unable to reach the fragrant and sensorial paradise and finds himself continuing his journey by bus to his final destination. The old Norwegian version of hell (Hades, NOT Hell the terrestrial city) is not burning like the English version, its cold, freezing, the land of Niflheim (land of cold and fog). This seems to be the place where Andreas ends up, having just missed access to Paradise through that tunnel.
