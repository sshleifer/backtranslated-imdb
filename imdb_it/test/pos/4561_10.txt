The joke and the fun rescue scene help make this one of my favorites in the 14-movie series. Wonderful acting, great cast. And this film contains one of the few known facts about Sean Bean's career. The part where he and Alice Krige fall off their horses in the water was not written but was left in them both immediately went to acting after it happened. <br /> <br /> This is a good result for the intense end of Sharpe's enemy.
