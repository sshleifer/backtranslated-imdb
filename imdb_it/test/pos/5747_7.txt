This is a very "right on case" film that offers you everything that comes to mind. I am a Christian and I liked the film in a way. He had average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you can clearly see. It may be a bit verbose, but the film has some nice cars that save it from a lower rating. As a Christian film it was pretty good, but maybe a little fair in the message. The film works best on a big screen. * SPOILERS * The fight scene with the two brothers can remind you of the two brothers fighting scene in the Christian thriller "Mercy Streets" starring Eric Roberts. * End of Spoiler * I give him a 7/10.
