For years I remembered a song "ONLY A COUPLE IN A CASTLE" ("No. twenty squares of moon ray, just a couple in the castle in the air"). I couldn't find the song, but I remembered that it had to do with cartoon bugs. I found a reference to the film on the web. I had seen the film when I was only 9 years old at the Ligonier PA Theater. I was pleased to discover that Kenny Gardner was the singer with Guy Lombaro (I'm a fan of Lombardo). And then to see that it was produced by Fleisher Bros. who made another feature film of "Gullivar's Travels" (also remembered fondly). The songs were also associated with Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser who are among the best. No wonder I remembered the film, the song and the colorful animation. As a well-rounded musical, this is a film that should be remembered as one of the best musicals of the first duration. Now that I remember it, the plot may not have shaken the earth, but it was presented very well and makes the film pleasant and visionary.
