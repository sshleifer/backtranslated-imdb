I like money! Last week I stumbled upon this fantastic movie at a local video store. I didn't know what to expect. I brought it home, I founded the player and then my journey to stupidity started. The first vision made me laugh a lot, I didn't laugh very hard. It wasn't until the second viewing of the film really started taking on me and the humor was a lot more fun. It reminded me of Austin Powers, the first vision went well, then the real fun started telling people, just talking about each scene and the set up. I'm showing all my friends this movie, everyone I know. This film could very well be one of the most accurate "Future" films ever made. This film is more than 84 minutes of entertainment, it is a warning to the future of our civilization. Mike Judge, the fantastic mind that Office Space brought us brought us a vision of life in the automated future. Luke Wilson's pot-bellied humor as "Average" Joe improved the film a lot more. Watch this movie, then once you're done, read more! WRITE more! Think more! For the future, if not yours!
