I was lucky enough to record this wonderful drama, both sides, when it was originally broadcast on Masterpiece Theater. I loved it but I lost it. Then one day, while passing through old tapes, I found it again. I recorded it on DVD and watched and --- WOW! I still love him! The contacts are excellent and my only complaint is that we wanted to see more Kester! What a man! And Prue. It is so strong and wonderful ... that it lives in an age in which its affliction and the way it deals with it is seen as unfortunate and evil. Even his own brother tells Prue in the face that he doubts that a man could ever have her. * sigh * Unfortunately, my copy is not the biggest, with wear over the years, and I would absolutely like to own it on a professional DVD, if it ever happens.
