It was this! I never expected the ending if I hadn't already known things behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> The only thing I hated was why Shannon was started and not Alyssa. I hate her, I prefer her character to die than Shannon's. what was funny was that in the scene where the piper is dying on the hospital bed and Prue was crying by his side I started to cry too lol. by the time this was airing, I was about 10 years old and my favorite character was Piper from the beginning, so I was telling myself if she died, then I won't see the show again! lol <br /> <br /> so all going back in time was shocking and really good. I also blame Pheobe for the death of Prue because instead of being with her sisters she had to be a bi slut and be good with her for a demon boyfriend. <br /> <br /> but I think this episode will be now and forever one of my favorites and a CHRMED classic. <br /> <br /> FOREVER CHARMED! Blessed be you!
