I saw it on TV in 1989 and I regretted not having recorded it. I was very intriguing and full of suspense. It's incredible when events take place and this man's past reaches him. <br /> <br /> Acting is top notch and the story is exactly what the title reads ... "twist of fate" ... but no one could escape from a life that this man had to beginning of the film.
