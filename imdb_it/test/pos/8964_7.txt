Great movie, a worthy 7/10. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks was at his usual best, the heavy drinking deputy who saved Afghanistan from its communist oppressors! Based on a true story tells us how the West throws money and weapons at a problem and expects it to go away. Well, it's gone, even if temporarily. Look who we (the British, among others) are fighting the same people who gave weapons, training and money in the United States in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> This film has always stirred political thoughts to people who look at it, but they portray a very beautiful story. However, once the main objective is reached, namely to free the communists from Afghanistan, we can see how quickly people are forgotten. <br /> <br /> This movie was good, it was a well deserved 7/10. He told the story of the communist invasion of Afghanistan and the subsequent secret operation of the United States for some details and was dramatized well. Although it is a good film, I will recommend it to people, but someone will not particularly like it is a serious film about good (US) v evil (Russia) is not your passion!
