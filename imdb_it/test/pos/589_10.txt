I saw the beginning of the film Muppet, but only half. Because I only saw him in the house of Mrs Kelly's friends. The tracks were the best and the muppets were so funny. They learn that if they believe in the end of the rainbow, anyone can do it, no matter how small, no matter how green (which was included in the trailer). <br /> <br /> Kermit is my favorite character (which means he describes the main character) and so are the other muppets. Mel Brooks was incredible when he played Professor Max Krassman. The scene where Miss Piggy saves Kermit by doing Kung Fu on those guys. It was so beautiful. <br /> <br /> The film Muppet is the best Jim Henson film with the funniest characters and people will love his hit movie.
