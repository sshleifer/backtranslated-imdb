People criticize NSNA because it's a low point in Bond's career Sean Connery, and because it's not official. *** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS * First of all, this film is better than any other bond film with any other actor then Connery, all would-be sub for my book. Sean Connery is the only real Bond, nobody even comes close to his hardness, beauty and sex appeal. Yes, this film is a low point in Connery's Bond's career, but it's still the best hit movie of the 1980s. Sean Connery is the only Bond actor who is good in old age. he didn't become a big mess like Moore, but he kept his beauty and his tenacity, but he acquired some gray hair. So? it is still the only real 007, and it is as strong and hard as ever. Sean Connery is the one and only 007. And this movie is definitely worth seeing, regardless of what someone says. No barrel opening, but you can't have everything, right? great musical theme, though.
