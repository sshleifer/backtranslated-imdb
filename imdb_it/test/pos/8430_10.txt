"The China Syndrome" could not have been released at a better time: twelve days after its release, the infamous Three Mile Island bankruptcy occurred. But even if this (and / or Chernobyl) had never happened, this film remains an important look at what could happen through the mismanagement of nuclear structures. Jack Lemmon performs in a five-star performance as the supervisor tries to expose a cover-up to his nuclear power plant, with Jane Fonda playing the reporter who tries to investigate, and Michael Douglas plays his cameraman. <br /> <br /> I don't know if the current threat of a terrorist attack makes the "China Syndrome" more disturbing, but in any case, it's definitely a movie that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> I hope that those people who for years spent pushing nuclear power have seen this film just to know that their views and ideals are completely dead.
