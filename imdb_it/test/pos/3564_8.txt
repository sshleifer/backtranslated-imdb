"When I die, someone will bury me, and if they don't, what's the difference. Who cares, eh?" Thus the philosophy of life (or lack of) is summed up once and for all in this no less classic but amusing spin-off of the "Trilogy of dollars" by Sergio Leone. In the opening scene, three armed men, obviously evil, run into a western city and, with threatening glare, intimidate all the pathetic normal people hiding in their homes. The observer observer will notice that each of these three bears bears a striking resemblance to the characters of Per a few dollars more than Leone. There is a guy in Eastwood's poncho, one in the black suit by Lee Van Cleef and one who seems to act as Indio by Gian Marie Volonte. But this film is not about these guys. As soon as they enter the city when they are killed by someone even more cool than themselves, a mysterious bounty hunter known simply as the stranger. <br /> <br /> this is a completely different story. <br /> <br /> In an obvious copy of Leone, the good, the bad and the ugly, three armed men are again competing for a hidden treasure. Once again there is the bounty hunter and the Mexican bandit. The Stranger (George Hilton) is a supercool bounty hunter with a soft spot to shoot people dressed as priests. It is after the reward for the bandit Monetero (Gilbert Roland). But when the band of Monetero steals three hundred thousand in gold coins, the Stranger is diverted from his normal line of work. <br /> <br /> To complete the trio is Edd Byrne's corrupt bank manager, Clayton. He also wants money for himself. But after the money was hidden, the only man who knows where he is shot. Now the only clue to the hiding place is a medallion showing a family crest. The game is also finding the treasure before anyone else. And any weapon can play. <br /> <br /> With many firefights, punches and double crosses, the action brings these three to the maximum of showdown, a three-draw for the hidden treasure wing The Good, the Bad, and the ugly - but with a turning point. <br /> <br /> This film is not as good as Leone's films, of course, but in the end who cares, eh? This film is fun - 1960s nihilism, spaghetti western style. There are no rules, no lasting loyalty and no right or wrong - only the treasure and all it takes to get it. And, even if the film is not classic, surely the ending is. Hey, maybe we can all get along, a hundred thousand a piece. <br /> <br /> If you like spaghetti westerns, take a look at this. He is fast, furious and worth a look. My name is Evren Buyruk from Crestline California
