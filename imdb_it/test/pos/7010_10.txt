I've seen this movie at least 30 times, maybe more, and every time I look at it I am attracted to the film and 1963! The film takes me on a nostalgic vacation every time I look at it. <br /> <br /> I think the important thing to say here is that I was 15 in 1963 and I remember "before President Kennedy was shot and before the Beetles came." I can hear you say something like, "I brought a watermelon." and then realize how stupid he was! Jennifer Gray plays Frances "Baby" Houseman in Dirty Dancing. Baby is about to start college in the fall. Go to Kellerman for the holidays with his family (mom, dad and sister Lisa). <br /> <br /> One of the staff dancers, Penny (played by Cynthia Rhodes) becomes pregnant by another person in the staff (one of the boys' universities played by Max Cantor) and has the option to have an abortion but is in a night that she and Johnny (Patrick Swayze) are planning to dance in a nearby hotel. <br /> <br /> Thus, the need for a filling dancer for Penny. Johnny is convinced by Penny and his cousin Billy (Neal Jones) who can teach Baby to dance in time for the show. Baby learning the dance steps with Penny and Johnny are wonderful scenes! <br /> <br /> Baby's father (doctor Jake Houseman played by Jerry Orbach) comes to Penny's rescue when abortion is hurt. Dirty Dancing brought me back this time in history when the girls got pregnant and made abortions in the butchers' back rooms. Around this time (1963) many girls died of this type of abortion - but there were not many choices for a girl then. <br /> <br /> Lonnie Price plays a grandson grandson (Neil Kellerman) with Jack Weston's Max Kellerman. Jane Brucker does a great job as Baby's annoying sister, Lisa Houseman. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic and the dance is wonderful! The "dirty dancers" are absolutely wonderful and very sexy - I can feel Baby's astonishment when she sees them dance for the first time and says "Where did they learn to do it?" <br /> <br /> Jennifer Gray and Patrick The Swayzes are simply perfect together in their respective roles. Patrick's song, "She's Like The Wind" brings tears to my eyes every time I listen / watch in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film ends on an ascending note, but lets you know what happens next in Baby's and Johnny's lives. Dirty Dancing gives something new every time it is looked at: it hypnotizes the observer with nostalgia, the feeling of wanting it to be 1963 again.
