I recently saw some films from the Far East ... some were excellent (Battle Royale, Infernal Affairs, the Eye), and some were not so great (Versus, The Triple Cross). Then there are those like Uzumaki and Returner, who despite being flawed I still liked them. <br /> <br /> The basic premise concerns the mysterious and horrible effects that a growing obsession with spirals has on a community. Does it seem silly? Yes, that's what I thought. First of all, good things. The direction was first rate, certainly a bit exaggerated, but never less interesting and elegant. Secondly, the story was original and like other writers have commented a lot on lovelace-esq ... it was interesting. What reminded me the most was the first Cronenberg; movies like Shivers and Videodrome. <br /> <br /> The acting was not great, but not too horrible either. To be honest, I was really bored on some occasions ... I felt that the rhythm, especially at the beginning, was a bit slow. My main problem was that it was too stupid and funny to be true horror, and yet not so much as to be considered a comedy. * SPOILERS * below. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * Some good scenes (washing machine =)) and I liked the final shot / voiceover. At first I thought it ended too abruptly but about 20 seconds later I understood the meaning and I liked the end. However, due to the lack of seriousness in the story, combined with the most important scenes like the news bulletin at school, I didn't care much about the characters in the end. The final scene that perhaps should have been a bit acute, while I really couldn't really care about the girl or her boyfriend. * SPOILERS END * <br /> <br /> So, in general, I liked this movie, but it frustrated me and I think there was real potential besides some good scenes. A couple of other points, the main girl is pretty and pretty, and even the song she plays at the end is good. I rated it 7/10. <br /> <br />
