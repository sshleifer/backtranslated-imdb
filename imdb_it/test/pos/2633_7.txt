For some reason, some shows fail ... some deservedly, some not ... Buddy Faro was an intelligent show with interesting characters and dark humor that was enjoyable to watch ... Maybe it wasn't meant to be a big hit , but he had an "oddity" that made him pleasant ... Having said that it seems that I may have been the only one watching .... Dennis Farina and Frank Whaley were perfectly discredited in their respective roles ... quality of production and the script was fantastic and Las Vegas was the perfect background ... we hope that the first and only season will be released on DVD because I think it deserves some notoriety ... maybe you will at least do it on TV Land .... cheers
