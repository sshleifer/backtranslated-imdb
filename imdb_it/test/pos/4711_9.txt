I'm afraid I'll have to add my name to the long list of people who are stunned that this movie doesn't have STILL (set in 2007) on DVD yet. It's one of those mysteries that makes the mind awful, especially considering the amount of DVDs available today that contain material that should have been skinned years ago. I still have an excellent digital VHS copy in English with subtitles and Nicam Stereo, so my skill is more about principle than frustration at not being able to watch the movie. As for the film, this is an excellent all-rounder with good image quality, a more than satisfactory soundtrack, a lively plot that involves suspense, emotion, sadness, frustration, feeling good and exotic surroundings (for a European). How true the film fits into reality in Burma, I have no idea, indeed, that it is less important, the essential thing is that as far as entertainment is concerned, it is a success. One soon becomes attached to each of the main characters and I admit to having my heart in my mouth during the final river crossing scene. It is a pity that we hear so little about countries like Burma and this film gives at least a vision of the country. Has the situation changed since 1995? The events that will occur at the end of this month seem to answer this question with a resounding "No" and the regime in place seems to be more brutal than ever, not even sparing the life of the monks, let alone women or children!
