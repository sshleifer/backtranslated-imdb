I first saw this afternoon in the 1980s on the T.V. network. I think I was like 9. (Photo seeing a violent horror movie nowadays on normal television). Anyway, I've seen it again years later and it's like I remember it, it's really nice, action movie. I think the reason why it might have gone unnoticed is that it was not followed by a load of sequels ****, that is, Friday 13. But it's one of those films that takes the original idea and does it better. Although this is a killer in the woods like Friday, it has more in common with the original Chainsaw massacre in Texas. This is because the film defines an atmosphere and a sense of terror, even in broad daylight. And the killers feel more threatening on Friday. There is also a good deal of suspense. I recommend seeing it now that it is being released on DVD in late July.
