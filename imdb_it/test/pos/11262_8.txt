being a high school student, I have to take a health course. this year, the subject is drugs. we are aware of the damage they can cause to a person. from what we talk about, I still believe and I know that drugs can really mess up a person. however, my teacher wanted us to look at this. of course, we complain and start sleeping, but like the rest of my class, I actually liked this movie. it was totally real, and not covered with sugar. the characters were incredible and credible. even the plot was extraordinarily realistic and credible. what I liked most about this film was above all the way drugs of effect can take the abuser and the consequences that the person has to face. everyone is reassured that nothing bad will happen to them. well it gets serious. anything can happen in a small town, even to your best friend, like Sam and Chris. this movie shows it. a person can really learn a lot by watching this. it was pretty effective.
