This film is a tour de force by Julie Taymor who directs and creates stage sets and masks. No one comes close to combining his imagination with the stage of modern opera. Since making this film in 1992, he has been very successful in film and musical direction. One can only hope that she can be persuaded to return to work one day. I'd like to see a ring of Ring directed by her. The current Rheingold in Covent Garden has giants with oversized hands just like the characters in this movie. The current Butterfly at ENO uses the Japanese puppet. Perhaps the coincidence, or proof that Taymor's influence is pervasive. <br /> <br /> Taymar uses fantastic costumes, masks, puppets and origami birds to recreate the story of Oedipus on a stage on stilts above a lake. Red ribbons are a recurring theme. They are used as an umbilical cord when Oedipus is born, they hang from the eyes of Oedipus after he is blinded, in a breathtaking effect they are used to make a crossroads when the killing of his father by Oedipus is renounced by puppets. <br /> <br /> This ballet from Stravinsky's neo-classical opera enjoyed justified obscurity until this film brought it to life. The music is not inspired but inoffensive and Philip Langridge, Jesse Norman and a very young Bryn Terfel take advantage of it. The singers are quite still, according to Stravinsky's wishes. Min Tanaka is the Oedipus dancing of the Oedipus song of Langridge. This creates a bit of confusion towards the end when dancing Oedipus sticks his eyes out to sing Oedipus. <br /> <br /> The booklet is in Latin, but don't worry if your Latin high school is a little rusty. There is a useful narrator who introduces and describes each scene in Japanese.
