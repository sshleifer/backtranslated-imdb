Also from the initial title of this film, I love the works of art and the canvas layout of one of the national islands of Japan. We see some large rolling green hills and some eastern houses of a coastal city. Immediately we are looking at the beauty of the Pacific on the big screen of the theater. And to show how beautiful this film is, I must say that Charles Darwin would be proud. Teachers of evolution courses and school sciences like biology would favorably favor Hayao Miyazaki's new film entitled "Ponyo". The title character, as you will see, could be the perfect animation icon of the media to be represented in all classrooms and auditoriums. <br /> <br /> In addition to the scientific aspect of all this, let's dive into the blue waters of this exciting story. We have a thin, old and powerful sorcerer named Fujimoto who lives in a submarine and is cynical about the urban expansion of humanity and their pollution of industrial waste. He wants to have complete control of the seas and the quiet aquatic life with a cute appearance, including fish and organisms. Fujimoto, whose blood is half human and half amphibious, resembles both an antihero and an ocean antagonist; similar to James Bond's villain Stromberg in The Spy Who Loved Me who runs an underwater city called Atlantis. <br /> <br /> Your daughter, who treats like an over-cured pet, is called Ponyo. She is a big red fish that looks like a beautiful red-haired girl already. The father banishes her from the real world, stating that it is dangerous and too much for her to handle. But frankly, Ponyo's exploratory curiosity is as strong as his love nature. Eventually with constructive force, similar to Nick Park's wonderful "Chicken Run" scenes, he frees himself from his father's rocky and fossilized aquatic city and swims to the surface of the water of Japan, and with his luck and joy falls into the hands thoughtful of a captain of tankers of young men named Sosuke. <br /> <br /> Living in an oceanfront home on a well-groomed beach (or beach full of boulders), Sosuke has two stressful parents, a senior mother working at Lisa's home and the first officer of a Koichi barge. Lisa seems angry with her husband for leaving on a ship and leaving her with all the household chores. Moreover, the black magic exercised by Ponyo causes an apocalyptic chain of events: the moon gets too close to the Earth and the waves rise up from the imbalance of the interaction forces of the tides and the tsunami waves create a peaceful but evacuated city. However what seems to underestimate this curse and seems literally more powerful than the supernatural power is the love and friendship closely embraced between the childish Captain Sosuke and the adorable red-headed Ponyo, who wants to be a sensitive human rather than a fish preserved. Just like the frizzy and free-spirited hobbits in The Lord of the Rings, Ponyo gives me a slight reminder. <br /> <br /> I could write non stop on this fantastic animated film, the best since "Coraline" who was in theaters in February. And right now, Hayao Miyazaki, celebrates with his eyes another 10-star rating of your animation fan, Graham Abraham. The year 2009 can be filled with dozens of animated films; however, Ponyo is the most impressive film of many environmental beauties and should be dedicated as a new wonder of the world.
