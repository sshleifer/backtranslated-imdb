Tumbling Doll of Flesh (aka Niku daruma and Psycho: The Snuff Reels) This was on my wish list for a while, and then I finally marked a copy on Ebay some time ago. It has never been on DVD, and what I got from Ebay was a very good quality DVD-R, of which I am quite satisfied. The film is I believe the most extreme example of porn torture, with an emphasis on porn. A woman responds to an announcement for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is shot. The porn is definitely real, with the annoying Japanese pixelization to try to hide the hardcore shots, without much success most of the time. After the porn movie was shot and the actress is ready to go, she gets her head screwed with a baseball bat, and taken back to the room and dismembered wildly with slow strokes, and in one of the most disgusting scenes, male porn the guy fucks her in an open wound in his chest. This is after both legs have been severed, his arm and some other sympathies. This film far exceeds the Guinea Pig series, in fact, they are not even close to realism, even if the economic effects are shown in this film. This is really one of the best fake movies I've ever seen, if not the best. Now I have to warn you that if you don't take care of these things, you should be very far away. This film is very strong, and with real sex, it is in a very sick, erotic way to some extent. And I mean, in a very sick way. But wherever you go on this topic, this movie takes the goods home, and I strongly suggest you look for it. After reading the film, I was expecting something very strong, but it was overtaken by a group.
