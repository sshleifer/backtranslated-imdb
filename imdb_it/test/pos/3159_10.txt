Thank God there are movies out there that don't follow the same old Hollywood shit formula. I think the digital revolution and the DVD revolution actually make it possible to work more interestingly even if you have to dig harder to find it. I like it when a film takes its time to draw you deeper and deeper into its inner emotional boundaries. It was really like taking a trip into the soul of America and that soul is disturbed and confused. What really upset me was the way they used Martin Luther King's speeches about Vietnam and the references to his murder in a way that hit me hard. I felt suffocated every time I heard his voice. I heard about it before, of course, but the way they used the talk here made me feel like I understood his message in a way I never thought. <br /> <br /> What can you say about a movie that has heavy statistics on war, oppression and a call for compassion at the end of what normally a strip of credit should be? In reality, there are no credits in the film. You must access it by selecting them in the functions. Somehow this made me think a lot. All in all I can't say enough about this DVD. Brilliant.
