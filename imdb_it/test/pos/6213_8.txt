Let's do it outside, so those who are checking this page for information on anything related to the word "Seni" (and you know who you are, googler) can move you: it's not in any way pornographic. On the contrary, if this has value as a material for masturbation, frankly, the director has not done a good job since the goal is to keep him on the subject and on the experiences of women and their bodies and images of themselves and their society and health and so on. In fact, I would be a little wary of someone who came across this DVD or, if it still sounded late at night on HBO or Cinemax and used it as a medium of pleasure. You could also go to the supermarket and get a couple of ripe melons and take them home and squeeze them and uh, well, you understand. <br /> <br /> No, this is a semi-serious film making meant for night vision late at night, but it shouldn't be just for late night types. This is intimate in the setting but not in the tone. All women, in all their variety of shapes, sizes and races, and even with a man with fake tits, have something of value to say, from the experience of life in the most direct way. If I say semi-serious it is due to the different small segments that the director feels he has to introduce, with the archive footage of old "how-to" videos on puberty, sex and super rare breasts and cartoons with the flying wings of . This is not a problem but a resource: we need some small visual visual segments between these interviews. <br /> <br /> Nothing is held back, and we see it as feminism in a liberating form: they don't need to cover up, and even if they decide not to take their shirts and shirts and bras they are still open as can be on a natural part of their body that is an object of sex, surprise, comfort, discomfort, curiosity, motherhood and, unfortunately, cancer. In this last part, there is another courageous step when we see a woman who survived her cancer with only one breast. You know you have become mature and an adult when you can see this woman who somehow went on to live a semi-normal life with a breast (the sweetest moment is when she says that a fairy godmother said she could have a desire for having two full breasts should think about it), and you don't laugh at the voice or go "eww, gross". This is the test, folks. <br /> <br /> It is not shot in the best circumstances, but again for TV it has been changed with a fast pace. It is never boring for a moment, and we never have the feeling that someone is holding back, especially when a man might feel the hard truth that breasts might not really be erogenous, or that a flat chest is very attractive to some men . Petti: A documentary talks about the deconstruction of myths with real faces and breasts and minds and naked hearts. If this is worthy of a "I was alone" session, then, well, more power for you, I think, even if it's not the intention.
