Forget everything you've ever read on the straight-to-video version of Mallachi Brothers "Snakes on a Train", especially if it's a bad review. This movie is a lot more fun than the movie that obviously rips: "Snakes on a Plane". Frankly, I'm surprised more people are not rhapsodizing about this low-budget kindergarten exit. Instead, most of the reviews I've read have nothing good or critical to say except the usual stupid herd mentality, like amateur acting, the action was not numerically up to the hype, and the whole what amounted to a huge waste of time. Of course, it doesn't help that the title is a suggestion for the obvious fallback nature of this film. In fact, I've heard that "Snakes on a Train" has passed "Snakes on a Plane" for a variety of reasons. <br /> <br /> First, the producers used real snakes until the last fifteen minutes when they replaced both giant fake snake heads or computers generated a super-giant snake that consumed a whole similar train to Amtrak. How many movies have a snake swallowing a train? Consequently, "Snakes on a Train" is the first film capable of resizing that height. <br /> <br /> Secondly, this low-cost film uses some macabre coarse effects. The woman who coughs the little snakes - the real ones - was fantastic! The special effects of his forearms that were torn off later in the film were visually appealing! Also, you can see a white girl being eaten alive by a snake. She was as pretty as she could be, not more than 10 years or so, and she died screaming all the way while the snake head of the ugly giant ol√® swallowed her. Not only children in danger, but the child ate! This is exactly the kind of graphic material you won't find in 99% of all Hollywood theatrical releases. Of course, it was not eaten by a real snake, but it is the subversive thought that counts. <br /> <br /> Third, it's one of those damn movies in which Alma (Julia Ruiz of "That Guy"), the main female character - no heroine - has a curse inflicted on her by her parents because she didn't marry the man they recommended. As a result, she is full of snakes, coughing up green radiator fluid, then a small snake withdraws. Imagine Medusa, the mythical characters who had snakes for their hair, only with snakes in their bellies. Her psycho-shaman type boyfriend gathers all the snakes that come out of her because they are directed to L.A. on a train to see a relative of his who can put all the snakes back into her and bring her back to normal. Talk about a crazy character who performs in a stomach churning routine. Get ready for a lot of slime, blood and blood. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the train had only about twenty passengers, not hundreds. Nevertheless, it seemed that the Mallachi Brothers filmed this horror film above the average on a real train with real snakes and played on the undulating movement of the train on the tracks. <br /> <br /> Fifth, the snakes crawl for the first hour, silently infiltrating the train before they become strange and attack everyone. In other words, it's suspense, suspense, suspense before people start dying from snake bites. <br /> <br /> Until the last five minutes when the snake gets bigger than the fleeing train and swallows it, "Snake on a snake Train" is deformed, wonderful, and way out. He does not have the Attention Deficit assembly of a Hollywood movie of the great league. It is a fantasy about an unfortunate Hispanic woman victimized because of her feminist attitude, in contrast to society. <br /> <br /> Overall, you have things like gory fantasy; suspenseful snakes that creep around the train, and are a giant exaggerated snake at the end. Incidentally, they get on the train because a group of other Mexicans bribed a train employee and the Mexicans on board think that the girl is so nice to leave her and her boyfriend free. <br /> <br /> I think it's better than "Snakes on a Plane" if you want a hard, small and independent horror movie.
