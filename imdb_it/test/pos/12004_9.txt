I felt this way when I saw the episode in its original run and I still agree when I look at it in replicas. You had the culprits totally mocking Columbo during the episode and treating him as if he had Down syndrome. And in the end you see their shock when Columbo kills them for rights and arrest them. You also have a realistic reaction from the arrogant preppy assassins. They could not yet give Columbo his props and say he was just lucky. I like the formula in which there is an elaborate crime, the killer (s) totally underestimates Columbo, and then you realize that Columbo was playing totally against the criminals. I remember in the first episodes of the episodes after 1989 that they were not following that formula and this was the first episode of which I was happy.
