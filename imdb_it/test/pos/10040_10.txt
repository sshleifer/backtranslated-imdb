Although "I died with their boots" is not entirely historically accurate, it's a very funny western. Flynn is not only the perfect Custer, but the characters are superb. In addition to the action part of the film, the love scenes of Flynn and DeHavilland are very touching and credible (Flynn and DeHavilland were very fond of each other in real life). Flynn was always so tormented not to be taken seriously if he only knew that there were very few actors who could play the characters he played and play them well!
