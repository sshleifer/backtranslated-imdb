Recently I saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan, where it attracted a huge crowd and quite intense discussions. I really admired the story and the visual approach. The action is terrifying and the mood of loneliness that the film projects is surprising. There is a lot of beauty in the melancholy that surrounds these three misfit heroes. Not only in the desert but also in the city. My best scene was after the boy discovered his friends in the apartment and then took his skateboard through all the lights in the city. You really feel for this guy. I've never heard of actors before, but I really enjoyed all three. I think they did a fantastic job on their journey of self-discovery. All in all, this is an incredibly cool and suspenseful suspenseful film. I still carry many of the images in my mind.
