"The Pharaoh's Army" challenges the formula. Instead of selling for clich√©s and big stars, it is completely based on the excellent acting of a strong cast, on the strength of a well-written script and on a fascinating and bitter story. The result is a raw and realistic film that moves quickly, with a strong emotional current. One of the best I've ever seen about the Civil War, and I think he's indebted to the pleasure of being an independent film (if you like this movie, try seeing the equally brilliant independent Civil War movie "Wicked Spring" <br /> <br /> "Pharaoh" simply tells the true story of a small expedition / forage team of Union men entering a confederate farm to take supplies, but they end up stuck there due to an accident of one of men Tensions break and relationships are made and broken Nothing happens in the way Hollywood would write it: this film is born from the mind of someone who really cares about quality films and the story of history. 'plot exposure moves along a film that seems very professional, but often does not seem to watch a movie, more along the lines of listening to a story. <br /> <br /> The film boasts an incredible pe Chris Cooper's performance that shows extraordinary versatility in exploring his role. Transform, but it is always at the height of credibility and it is easy to relate emotionally. Patricia Clarkson is equally stellar and realistic in a role where many actresses could collapse. It shares an interesting chemistry with the character of Cooper and where it is the most severe of the characters, it is still easy to identify it. The rest of the cast is quite capable, and fills their roles well. <br /> <br /> Artistic design and set are wonderful, and I personally love photography. Everything has the feeling of a vintage Civil War photograph with the camera showing strong contrasting colors and shadows and a metallic dye similar to the can, but still maintaining the naturalistic appearance of the rustic environment. It looks like they used natural lighting, but whatever they used works beautifully. It seems that everything belongs to what it is, it seems like a period, something I find rare in films of the American period. Actors play in the 19th century, not like 20th century people in old clothes. <br /> <br /> Above all, this film is very personal. I think how indie can afford it. The film is almost flawless with an exceptional script that creates effortlessly and explores the relationships and personalities of these characters and makes them grow in a situation, however bad it is. He does not fail to reach his point of view, and gets his point of view without the usual and abused techniques that are used in all war movies these days. He's brave. It is based on his characters, on a fantastic script, on human emotions and on the cold and hard fact that the Civil War wasn't all GGI, big stars and circle skirts.
