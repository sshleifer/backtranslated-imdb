This gem brilliantly captures the life of the 80s. As a guy from 1983, I have to say that Valley Girl (along with Fast Times from <br /> <br /> High Ridgemont) stands out as the class of the teen movie <br /> <br /> genre. The characters are accurate representatives of the time; vapid mall <br /> chicks, pseudo-punk rebels, preppy athletes are all <br /> <br /> represented here. <br /> <br /> I've seen it more than ten times. The film's music was the best <br /> notch. Unfortunately, these tracks have never been as popular in <br /> <br /> as the arena cockrockers like Journey, Styx or <br /> <br /> Loverboy. Before the soundtrack existed, I looked for the discs <br /> <br /> and the tapes (they were the 80s at the bottom!) By Josie Cotton, Sparks, <br /> <br /> Plimsouls and Modern English. <Br /> <br /> This film deserves respect. It's not just a 80s teen movie. It is <br /> <br /> a great movie. Period.
