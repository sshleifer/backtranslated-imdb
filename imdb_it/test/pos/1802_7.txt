I'm glad Cage changed his name from Coppolla and got this part alone. Carefree, there is no need for a deep thought, but a beautiful piece that attracts opposites, even if his parents are still hippies .... Capture the voice of the early 80s: the lament of the valley and the funk of the 'other side. You can see the beginning of Cage's talent.
