What makes watching and reviewing movies enjoyable is when once in a while when you least expect it, a movie like The Cell arrives and drives you crazy! This film is a superb horror film that has everything you could want when you want to be scared of your own jokes. Without going into history all I will say is that it has a great beginning, half and end that keeps you on the edge of your place while you are stabbed by the incredible special effects. The acting is good without being exceptional, but it doesn't matter because the topic and the way it is put on the big screen makes this one of the best horror movies I've seen for a long time. It is one of those films that you imagine started as a novel but says it doesn't look like an adaptation, so a lot of credit must go to Mark Protosovich the writer. 9 out of 10.
