For those who have enjoyed Asterix's books and movies, you'll love this movie! Yes, I admit that it mixes some of the books and movies, but the characters are brilliant and it's not just the people who show their CGI left, right and center. I've seen it several times and laughed at my socks. <br /> <br /> Obviously it contains the main heroes Asterix (Astérix), Obelix (Obélix) and Dogmatix (Idéfix), but this time they have someone new with ... to face. <br /> <br /> With a sense of humor like that, the Gauls will go on and on and on. Bless.
