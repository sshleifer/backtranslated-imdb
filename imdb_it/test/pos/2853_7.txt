Renee Zellweger is a Kansas housewife whose bullying husband is confused with drug trafficking. Two professional goons - Morgan Freeman and his son, Chris Rock, kill her husband in his dining room. Zellweger, unnoticed by the assassins, testifies to this and suffers a dissociative reaction, assuming the personality of a nurse, the homonymous Betty, who is a character in his favorite soap opera. Believing to be the TV personality, Zellweger starts with his husband's car, which has a lot of drugs in the trunk, and goes to Los Angeles where he hopes to connect with another character in this senseless afternoon drama, "Dr. David Ravell ", Greg Kinnear. Not realizing she was being chased by the two hit men, she went to Los Angeles where she managed to connect with Kinnear and was actually written on the show as a nurse named Betty. A handful of well-known men, including the local sheriff, understand what's going on and look for Zellweger in Los Angeles. The ending is credible and moving. <br /> <br /> If it sounds crazy, it's because it is. And it is the responsibility of the writer, John C. Richards. The curious thing is that Richards and the director, Neil Labute, with the considerable help of the artists, almost got it all out. This is not a plot that was cast in a familiar mold. No. I give him bonus points for pure originality. Someone came out on a limb. Someone took the opportunity for a film that was NOT a copy or a remake of something that had made money ten or fifty years ago. I imagine the people involved, kneeling every night, praying fervently. I don't know if the film was profitable, but mostly it succeeds on an aesthetic level. <br /> <br /> It is what could be called a film "initial premise". It begins with a single transformative event, in this case the murder of Zellweger's husband and his adoption of a genuinely new personality, and realistically follow the resulting logical paths. "Groundhog Day" is another, better and more complicated example. "Nurse Betty" has its logical cracks, in which accidents renounce their plausibility. For example, at a party in Los Angeles, Zellweger finally meets Kinnear, the guy who plays his ex-boyfriend on TV. She is stunned (because, after all, she thinks she is Betty, who lost her boyfriend a long time ago). He approaches Kinnear and a couple of his colleagues and introduces himself as "Nurse Betty", the character. He addresses Kinnear with the name of his TV personality, "David Ravell". At first the group remains perplexed, then becomes convinced that it is an aspiring actress who insists on remaining "in character" during the conversation - and later even after Kinnear has been fascinated by her and the others are bored. Kinnear drives his home and even when she kisses him goodnight, she's still in the character, leaving Kinnear with wide eyes in wonder at the way he captures Betty's character. The next appointment, Kinnear returns his love. This development, the relationship between Zellweger and Kinnear at this point, is a crack in logic, the type that is absent from "Groundhog Day". At the end of Night One, Kinnear, like any other person, would realize that Zellweger is a bit of a clown running out of a circus. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film, which includes many digressions, exceeds expectations. The relationship between Morgan Freeman and his insolent and nihilistic son is wonderfully stated. Morgan is impeccable in his exasperation. He manages to fall in love with the image of Zellweger while bringing to light the clues about where he is and about the activities, and in the end he can't shoot her. It's too sweet to shoot. After his transformation into Betty, he left a note in Kansas. "I want to help all my life, whether it's animals, plants or minerals." Who could harm the author of such an absurd connotation? His admiration for her is enlightenment as he stands next to one of the spotlights on the edge of the Grand Canyon. Zellweger, dressed as Dorothy, or perhaps the good witch of the East - well, characters who, like Zellweger, are still from Kansas - appears to Freeman and he hugs her and kisses her tenderly. It is a scene that is both disturbing, romantic and a bit spooky. Once I stopped at one of those lights and threw some crumbled paper in the updraft from the dark canyon and found myself surrounded by a thousand bats that had mistakenly perceived moths as moths. <br /> <br /> Right. Where I was? All right. I was trying not to run out of space. Zellweger's performance deserves praise. Everything he does, every movement, every expression, is naive and uncertain. He really is a nice character, and this despite not being a glamorous girl by Hollywood standards. But - what an actress. Compare his performance with the bizarre 19th century "Cold Mountain" hick. Just the opposite. But then everyone's going to quit smoking in this fun movie. Allyson Jannings does a good job in a minor role. Watch it when he tells Greg Kinnear that he is considering killing his character in the soap opera in a drowning accident. Kinnear is one of those narcissists who wear thin black leather jackets from ten thousand dollars that were popular at the time. He chuckles and says, "Oh, one of those shipwrecked business, right? Okay, how can I come back?" Jannings does not respond. She smiles at him with those huge blue eyes and tilts her head mockingly. <br /> <br /> It is not a movie masterpiece but a good job, original, professional on everyone's part.
