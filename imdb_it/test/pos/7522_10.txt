Anyone who has spent time working in a hospital or medical facility should appreciate this film. The plot is absolutely wild but fun from beginning to end. The acting is superb. George C. Scott is the brilliant doctor, but a class failure as a husband, father. Diana Riggs, a sex symbol of the 60s and 70s (of The Avengers), saves him from himself. The surrounding cast is superb and the dialogue quite amusing. I think I enjoyed the film more than seeing it on 4th, 5th. or sixth. time because I have grasped much more than the richness of dialogue and the interaction of the characters. It is worth seeing again and again. You will not want to check in at a hospital in the near future.
