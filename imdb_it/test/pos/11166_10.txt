Great movie about a great man. Thomas Kretschmann is top notch as in all his other films. I would never have imagined him as Pope John Paul II. Talk about the volumes for the casting director. Why do they continue to make him a German officer in the movies? And did he only receive universal attention after "the pianist"? Sure, it looks so warm in the uniforms. I know a lot of girls drool over her pretty face. But this guy is a great actor and has great potential. If you don't believe me, go and look at "Stalingrad". I hope he will fulfill many excellent roles in the future with more diversity. Otherwise, what a heartbreaking waste of great talent.
