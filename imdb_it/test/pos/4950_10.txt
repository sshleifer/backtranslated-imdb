not too high is the classic "top gun" or "independence day" when it comes to fighter jet excitement. Yes, the film from top to bottom is based on a really fictitious example of how anyone can make a save but it's nice because it breaks all the traditional rules. The kid does what he wants to do in a jet the way he wants to do it. <br /> <br /> I really can't understand what I love about this movie, but others I know who have seen the movie like the film the same way. I think it's basically a lot of fun but maybe a little too unrealistic for some to buy. <br /> <br /> Still, regardless, I loved it, the people I know have seen it, loved it so it's definitely worth it seeing you make your decisions about it. In this way, I thought that Top Gun was one of the best films of combat pilots of all time and I like this film as much if not more than Top Gun. Don't miss it, show it, a truly inspirational film.
