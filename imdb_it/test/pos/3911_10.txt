I loved this movie !! I waited for this film to come out so I could see it. I saw it during the opening night and I loved it, some told me that this movie was not going well and being away, but I thought it was great. The actors did great things and it was scary and blew me up. Paris Hilton did a great job for her first film, everyone is giving her a hard time when she has behaved well and hasn't even played an important role. The set was exceptional if it was made of all the wax and how it was made. The two brothers did a great job and the sense of death was great. The killers were really scary and made me want to close my eyes and not look at them. I can't wait until this movie comes out in Video, so I can get it and watch it over and over again. My review is to see this movie if you like Hororr movies and you won't mind loving this movie. I give this movie 10 out of 10 IT ROCKS !!!
