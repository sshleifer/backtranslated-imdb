During the brief period between Clint Eastwood's series of spaghetti westerns and Dirty Harry's films, he and director Don Siegel collaborated to make this unusual film. Eastwood plays a corporal of the Union Army wounded during the Civil War who is welcomed by a southern school for girls until he recovers from his injuries. It's been a while since young women (many of whom appear to be teenagers) have had a man in place, so they are reluctant to hand it over to local rebels. The resulting situations are often humorous, shocking, erotic or even decidedly grotesque, while Eastwood slowly regains its strength and begins to hatch over the structure. <br /> <br /> The basic plot almost seems like the stuff of a porn movie. We have a male male suddenly surrounded by unmarried young women. Many of them are sexually attracted to him. And it is more than willing to spread the love between them. The material never slips to the level of "tasteless", however. Eastwood, Siegel and filmmaker Bruce Surtees are such skilled directors, that the film always retains its dignity. <br /> <br /> Eastwood's John McBurney is like no other character I've ever played. McBurney is an amoral, conniving and lustful quack. He knows that most women, even the youngest, want his body, and let more than one of them shoot him. McBurney often uses flattery to butter women, then uses his robust appearance to pull them in. He's like a drunk at a cocktail party, often hitting different women in the same scene! In the end, his lustful ways cause him great agony and loss in a way you have to see for yourself. This author will never dream of revealing the specific consequences of his actions, but there is no doubt that he will get them. <br /> <br /> Eastwood offers a typically exceptional performance. It seems he enjoys the role until things get really ugly, then it becomes bad and bad. Geraldine Page is a real treat like B * tch steel that runs the school. We know she wants McBurney as much as the other girls, but with her chess past she showed us in flashbacks, we find that it's not all she's looking for! Mae Mercer, as a slave, also belongs to the school. Obviously he knows that McBurney is a skunk from the beginning, and he never lets his fake charm drop his guard. This is a character you would like to know more about after the film ends. He seems to have more knowledge of the world than anyone else in the film. <br /> <br /> The Beguiled has done poorly in its theatrical release. No one was quite sure what to do with it, and some of its contents undoubtedly raised some eyebrows in 1971. For example, in one of the early scenes we see Eastwood kissing a 12-year-old girl romantically. Are you just trying to shut her up when the rebel soldiers approach you, or are you really enjoying yourself? Probably both! A fantasy sequence later also shows Clint that he is doing it not only with Page, but with his young assistant! Truly some interesting aspects in this. It is a good thing that Eastwood has become the star he did, or that he may have been forgotten for a long time. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The hound.
