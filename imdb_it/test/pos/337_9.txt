I finally found a copy of Kannathil Muthamittal through Netflix and spent New Yera night watching an extraordinary drama that took place. It began with Shyama (a lucky Nandita Das) married to Dhileepan in the backwaters of Sri Lanka and then a war takes precedence over their romance. Shyama has to flee to India and is in a refugee camp while giving birth to a child. Several years later we see Amudha, a beloved playful child (P. S. Keerthana), who is the treasure (or weight) of teachers, parents and schoolmates alike, in a sequence of How to solve a problem like Mary. On her birthday she is told by her parents Thiru (Madhavan) and Indra (Simran) who is not their biological child, was adopted. This tilts her trusting world full of love and constantly dwells on why her natural mother left her. Several attempts at absenteeism following adoptive parents take her to Sri Lanka to try to find her natural mother. The country is torn by a violent civil war and the trio is inevitably involved in chaos. But this also leads to their meeting with the new Shyama - one who finally finds himself in front of Amudha and asks why he abandoned his daughter. <br /> <br /> The story of a child who has to face the fact that she was abandoned at birth, her obsessive drive to reconnect with her mother, the unconditional love of her adoptive parents, the demons that guide her mother, Chennai's normality and the horrors of terrorism have devastated Sri Lanka - Mani Ratnam made a masterful film that mixed many ingredients in a saga that comes alive by mixing. AR Rahman's music beautifully complements the magical and poignant moments of the film. The film has excellent performances by Madhavan, Nandita Das, Simran and an absolute stunner role as Amudha - the abandoned one - made by the child artist P. Steerthana. This performance earned her a national award. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is visual poetry: each frame is beautifully crafted and photographed in a breathtaking manner. I am intrigued by the bond that Mani Ratnam has with terrorism, love and obsessions. I think his exploration of these topics is absolutely exceptional. Mahadevan's character was rather unique: his passion and idealism did not make him selfish, but rather well matched to what he cared about the child. His one liners were hilarious. Simran's mother was also very multidimensional: she was idealistic, loved her adopted daughter but was also worried about her biological children. The shock, anguish and obsession of the Amudha child have been interpreted in an exceptional way by P. S. Keerthana. His wide accusing eyes have done most of the talking. In fact the enigmatic characters were those of Nandita Das and her husband. Perhaps Mani deliberately made them mysterious so as not to give us explicit ideas about why they were as they were - the enigma of why a terrorist becomes what he becomes. He also prevented him from judging - this was another conflict in which he did not take a position, but merely reported while showing the human tragedy. <br /> <br /> Kannathil Muthamittal is a visual poem and a dramatic theatrical soul - I rarely cry movies, but this left me with wet eyes and a little heart. This is a beautiful film - a treasure and a keeper if you can find a copy; beg to borrow or steal one today and watch the movie!
