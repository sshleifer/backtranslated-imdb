I must admit that I approached this film with a sense of expectation and terror. The bestselling novel by Louis de Berniere is one of my favorites and anyone who has read it will realize that there is no way that the screen adaptation can be 100% faithful. <br /> <br /> To the end I found myself convincing myself that the film was not successful, and I stripped the plot of the book to make it redundant. The ending, however, is much better than that of the novel, and I couldn't stop thinking about the film later. And yet, the comparisons (the magnificent cinematography of John Toll, the soundtrack by Stephen Warbeck, etc.) seemed to me not superior to my initial negatives (Cage's miscasting, a heavily diluted script). <br /> <br /> But, two days later, I was back in line to see Corelli, and although it's not perfect, I have to admit that the film is the best we can expect. Cage is really brilliant in a role that even de Berniere was interested in was not an all-round character: his carefree spirit that gives way to shattered remorse is apt, and perfectly complements the superb double act of Penelope Cruz and John Hurt. David Morrissey is silently effective as Weber, the Nazi officer who tries to reconcile his feelings for his new Italian friends and his innate superiority complex for those around him. And the beautiful Greek-Italian cast brings the sardoned world of Cepholonia into an incredibly alive world. <br /> <br /> Coming out of the cinema for the second time, I finally let go of my passion for the novel that prevented me from fully appreciating the history of the Second World War Cepholonia in film terms. My hat goes to John Madden who, despite the almost predictable critical pressures he receives from British critics (any director who has had such a great success as Shakespeare in Love behind them is always a target for these ninni groans!), He managed to transfer on the big screen a terribly difficult book with such a heart, verve and humanity (the fundamental virtues of the novel, in fact) that has created another classic love story that will probably be fully appreciated only when the dust has settled in a few years from now. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the book, like me, it is difficult, but try not to make the same mistake in your first vision. Try to erase the book from your mind for two hours, immerse yourself in the glorious Mediterranean atmosphere and discover Corelli, Pelagia, Mandras, the dott. Iannis, as if for the first time (pretend to look at something created by an original script) and I guarantee you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> In fact, you would expect impatiently to own your copy of this delightful movie on video or DVD. <br /> <br /> 8/10
