I loved this movie! Markie Post is truly exceptional. I've seen it all my life, and it's in the same fun class of movies as: "The Betty Broderick Story", "Locked Up: A Mother's Rage", etc. ... which, among other things, are very good, funny movies!} It is a dramatic film about a single mother trying to break with her predictable middle-class personality. This movie is just fun! It doesn't have to be a realistic aspect of heroin addiction. But it shows how any "normal" middle class person can become addicted to heroin (and do it!). Junkies are not just people without education and homelessness on the street. {By the way, if you look at it, take a look at how the child drives his mother around! Spoiled!} 8 out of 10 stars.
