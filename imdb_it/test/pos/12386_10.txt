Okay, I'll say it. This movie made me laugh so much that it hurt me. This statement could offend some of you who might think that this film is nothing but a waste of movies. But the thing that most people don't understand is that this film had to be bad and brash. I mean, did people really think that a movie about a killer snowman was meant to be a masterpiece? Just look at the "scary" hologram on the film jacket and you'll find your answer. Instead, like the original Jack Frost (which I thought was just as fun), this film turned out to be a breaking journey into the depths of banal dialogues, bad copies and horrible special effects. And it's all done to offer us viewers laughter. It certainly worked for me. <br /> <br /> For example: Anne Tiler (to her troubled husband): what makes you so sadly frowning? <br /> <br /> If that piece of dialogue doesn't make you laugh, then you have serious problems. Who in their right mind would have said those words in real life? Of course, nobody wanted to look ridiculous! Take a single look at this movie with an open mind and low expectations, and I hope you will see what is so damn funny about Jack Frost 2.
