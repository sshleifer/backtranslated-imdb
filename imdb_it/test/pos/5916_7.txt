From director Billy Wilder (Double Indemnity, The Seven Year Itch, Some Like It Hot), I can see that this is a slightly undervalued and undervalued film, one to watch. This is the biographical story of Slim 'Lindbergh (James Stewart) of Charles Augustus, who in 1927 wanted to be the first man to cross the solo journey from New York, crossing the Atlantic Ocean, to reach Paris, in a small cabin piloting. The first half hour or whatever is seeing Lindbergh get permission to do so, and the construction of the plane, called "The Spirit of St. Louis", and making all the necessary preparations. Then, of course, the rest sees his dangerous journey through the journey, overcoming tiredness, the loss of fuel and the moments in which he loses his sense of direction, but has been successful. Always interpreted by Murray Hamilton as Bud Gurney, Patricia Smith in the role of Mirror Girl, Bartlett Robinson in the role of Benjamin Frank Mahoney, Robert Cornthwaite in the role of Harry Knight, Sheila Bond in the role of Model / Dancer, Marc Connelly in the role of Father Hussman, Arthur Space as Donald Hall, Harlan Warde as Boedecker and Dabbs Greer as Goldsborough. Apparently Lindbergh was a little younger, so Stewart was a shadow too old to play him, but then again, you can't think of anyone else who could do better. It is a witty and exciting drama, with Stewart (as always) which is fantastic, excellent score by Frank Waxman and good direction by Wilder, a little-known gem. The Oscar for the best special effects (the only award ever nominated) was nominated. James Stewart was number 12 of the 100 Greatest Movie Stars, was number 3 in 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and was number 13 in The Greatest Actor. Very good!
