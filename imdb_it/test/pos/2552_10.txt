Ramin Bahrani opens a scene at the beginning of the Chop Shop that immediately identified me with the origin of the character of Ale (Alejandro Polanco) and his friend. The two enter the subway and, as soon as they close the doors, they ask if they could get everyone's attention for a moment, and that they sell bars or M & M or something, and then proceed to sell some bars. If you (like me) have ever been on a New York subway at any time, this is the kind of situation that happens so often that you hardly notice it. People on the subway often see children like these or minorities who sell something or announce and talk about something in a subway and don't pay attention to it. Bahrani's attention is not necessarily directed at children who are committed to selling objects on the subway, but for survival and the state they are in when they are in the lower classes in America. It is, later on in his hands, caring and heartbreaking, usually at once. <br /> <br /> Comparing it with Pixote or the Bicycle Thief is not too far (in reality in the latter at least the father and the son have each other), although Bahrani is specific in his intentions in its documentary style. We are interested in this character, Ali, no older than eleven, who works in a workshop that cleans some machines and helps dismantle others, and his sister who comes from out of town to be with him. But it's not simply because we are force-fed by any clich√©, apart from, you know, a brother and sister (more-so brother) trying to take care of each other. Bahrani makes history accessible through the simple aspiration that Ali has, the kind of goal that can be achieved in his situation: save enough to buy a used food truck that Ali and Isamar can manage on their own. <br /> <br /> all that Ali is working for, but what Bahrani shows us brutally is this work, what Ali has to do to make it happen even if his unpleasant things like snatching hubcaps from car tires in Shea Stadium or, at some point, to steal a bag in a desperate moment. This makes the problem even more serious when Ale sees what his sister does for the money on the night side, doing sexual favors for the men in an abandoned truck on the roadside. He doesn't talk about it and pushes it aside, but it's always something that adds tension, something that Ale wants to protect from his sister. It adds to the tragedy when Ale discovers the real cost of what it will take to turn the food truck into a profit producer, a cost that adds further anxiety that he has just internalized. <br /> <br /> One could immediately look at the fact that Ale is an orphan in a neighborhood like the one in the Queens area, the film was shot in a natural way, as with a neo-neo realism work (let's call it realism), with practically all non-professional actors in the parts of mechanics, workers and people in the streets - but Bahrani concentrates more - so here and now, and this is what makes Chop Shop so immediate and heartfelt. There is not a trace of melodrama in the film, barely even the musical accompaniment apart from the live Latin music coming from cars and radios. Sometimes the Bahrani focuses on a very subtle moment that makes it pronounced in other scenes, like the way Ale is awake but behaves as if he slept the first night after seeing Isamar's late-night visit, and see as she slips into the bed probably knows he is awake, but neither can say a word. Or, in many other scenes, poetic touches that seem seamless, like when a man shows Ale how pigeons feed. <br /> <br /> It is rough and gritty, as you can expect, and not give its main characters much hope, despite the few moments of happiness sprinkled. It is also a superbly filmed freehand film, where the technique, as with a lot of films made in its tone and urban approach, informs and compliments the subjects on the screen and what they are doing, but it is never recklessly shot or too flashy. The filmmaker has a superb "real life" cast (Ale was snatched from a public school in New York without any experience) and knows how not to waste a shot, while at the same time reaching a brutal art by simply showing what he shows. It is not City of God or Pixote; it's his little masterpiece about a character or characters that we usually won't take a second look (or the first barely) on our way in a city like New York. If you're not moved by Ale and his daily struggles, I don't know what to do for you.
