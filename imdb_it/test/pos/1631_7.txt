I go to the cinema to have fun. I was very entertained by the first film in this series: The Da Vinci Code. He had a lot of twists and turns to keep me very interested. Angels and Demons is no different. If you liked the Da Vinci Code, then you will surely like this movie too. Angels and Demons is made in practically the same style as the previous film, but it is faster, which I liked. Ron Howard kept me glued to my seat for two hours without getting a bit bored. <br /> <br /> What I really liked about this movie is that, even if it's obviously fictitious, they leave enough real stories to make it look very credible. If there's one thing I don't like about this movie, it's that the plot itself is really incredible (I don't want to spoil it). But hey, it's a movie. I was entertained throughout the whole thing and I was very satisfied with what I saw.
