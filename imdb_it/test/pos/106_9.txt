Besides being a portrait of a lesbian love story, FIRE is also a comic satire of Indian middle-class culture (?). I find this a quality that is not appreciated for the film. These two genres (ie the deep love story and the comic satire) usually mix well together like oil and water, but Mehta (somehow) manages to reach balance almost to perfection. The behavior of the servant Jatin, the way the family treats him, the constant inevitable presence of the grandmother from bed, Ashok's obsession with Swami's teachings: coming from a culture very similar to that of India, these are things which I can immediately identify as typical. They screamed to be shown and ridiculed. While developing his main theme, Mehta manages to achieve this secondary theme deftly. Indeed, much of the humor in the film, which provides essential relief from the heavy arguments of lesbian taboo love and gender issues, stem from this seemingly ordinary satire. The film moves from comics to serious with great subtitles. <br /> <br /> All in all, brilliant use of symbolic devices (Radha compared to Sita of the legend and out of the Fire unharmed and, therefore pure; the life wish of the young Radha to see the ocean finally reached when he gains freedom ). Congratulations to Shabana Azmi (Radha), the lighting team and Deepa Mehta; their non-Hollywood (and non-Bollywood!) talents! they made this film special. A criticism: the first scenes seemed rather disjointed to me as they did not flow very well into one another. <br /> <br /> The verdict: 9 out of 10. Nothing less for a film with scenes so burned in my mind.
