I saw this movie for the first time years ago with my daughter who is now 13 and fell in love with the vampire. we both thought it was a top movie, then I saw sub 11 then sub 111 now I find that there is sub 1v that I can't wait to get my fangs and that there is also a fifth in the pipe line. if nobody has seen the movies. these are the best of the best. I think the credit is for thousands of Oscars. I could see them from morning to night. I'd like to have a set of nails like him, watch out for the girls. I like it because all the narrative lines continue from one film to another. these typical vampire movies are better. I would like to live in life that is protracted in the movies. would make all my dreams come true
