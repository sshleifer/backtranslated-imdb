Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) a rich woman discovers that her husband cheats on her with a younger woman (Eva Mendes). He doesn't know what to do and friends Sylvia Fowler (Annette Bening), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing) and Alex Fisher (Jad Pinkett Smith) try to help. <br /> <br /> OK - there was no reason to redo the 1939 film. This is a true classic and does not need to be updated and redone. Of course it was done. This got some of the worst reviews I've ever seen for a movie. I love the original and saw it MANY times - I was constantly comparing it to that. Now this is not a classic, but it's not so bad. <br /> <br /> ** MINOR SPOILERS !!! ** First the evil - the story is old and has been (badly) updated. Really - a man who betrays his wife is not at all shocking today. Meg Ryan (a wonderful actress) is pretty terrible here. His face seems unable to change expression! I couldn't believe how badly some of his scenes had come. Eva Mendes is also bad, but it's not all her fault. His role is poorly written and must compete with Joan Crawford from the original. Smith's character (a tough lesbian) falls apart in an operating room. It's fun ... but it's proving that a strong woman immediately falls to pieces when confronted with an emergency. The script also includes some clumsy passages in which Ryan talks to his daughter about being yourself. In those moments it seems more like a Lifetime movie than anything else. <br /> <br /> Now the beauty - this film retains the original's decision to NEVER show a man on the screen. This film is about and for women - men are not necessary (BTW - I'm a man). Bening is just as fantastic as Fowler: every time he is on the screen, the film takes a big leap. Smith is also simply wonderful - don't overdo (or underestimate) his lesbian character too much. Messaging is also good, but it is not. Bette Midler is only hysterical in a small role and Cloris Leachman does not play the role of a housekeeper. The direction is also good, especially during a sequence of shows. I heard that the English director Diane would have had a lot of trouble directing his first feature film, but not in the final product. Furthermore there are some clever references to the original (especially some lines) that have been inserted without problems. <br /> <br /> I saw this in an audience full of women (there were some guys but not many) and they love it. The film ends in a sequence in the operating room that made everyone scream. So - this was not necessary but it is not the disaster that people are saying either. Also, people say we don't need a movie with all the women. Well why not? I see a lot of movies with all the cast boys and no one complains about that! Ignore complaints and negative reviews and see this. With a better performance than Ryan, I could have given him an 8 or 9, but, as it is, I can only give him a 7.
