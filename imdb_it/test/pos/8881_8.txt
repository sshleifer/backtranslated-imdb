A photo with Danny Devito and Billy Crystal. They are both famous actors, and in this fascinating comedy they try to kill each other. Billy Crystal's little cruelty is his ex-wife who stole his book and gave us his name, and Danny Devito's pet is his evil mother. Billy Crystal is an author and a teacher apparently and Danny Devito is one of his students. This classic comic is very fun and suitable for all ages. <br /> <br /> Danny Devito seems to behave like a child in this movie because of his bad mother who keeps putting him down all the time. He says things like "You have no friends!" and when Billy Crystal fell, he said "Slide it out before it sucks in the basement!" He also puts Danny down calling him "Lard ass!" and other things just to make him angry.
