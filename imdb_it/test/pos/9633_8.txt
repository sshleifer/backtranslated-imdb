Basically, this is a great movie. It is very different from other Seagal films, which unfortunately could turn off some of its fans. Unlike other films, this doesn't look like a "Seagal vehicle". You can see many of the other characters and all of Mr. Seagal's actions are not the same as we have seen before. The concept that he is an 'intellectual' in something other than bombs and other weapons is a nice change. Although there are some unrealistic parts in the movie (some more obvious than others), in general you can let them slide since the movie is fun to watch. <br /> <br /> It boils down to this: If you're looking for a classic Seagal action movie, I'm sorry, but you'll be disappointed. Look at it anyway for the sake of it. If you're open to seeing Seagal without action, it's worth a look. I personally think it's one of the best jobs he's done for a while. <br /> <br />
