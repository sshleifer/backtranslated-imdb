exquisite !! in simple words ... both Aparna Sen and Konkona Sen seem to understand each other quite well or maybe they are both too good. this could be his best performance as an actor and Aparna's best director. yes, perhaps better than the Iyers. Konkona plays the role of a schizophrenic. Shabana Azmi plays the role of Anjali, Mithi's older sister (Konkona Sen). Shabana Azmi made the best of Anjali's character because she had to play a strong, responsible and arrogant role of an older sister who had full responsibility for her family. Aparna Sen beautifully created the character of Anjali, a strong woman who had to sacrifice her personal life, her love for her family. <br /> <br /> Mithi's behavior was not youthful at all, because you can expect this from most Indian directors for this role. It seems that a lot of research has been done to understand the role of Mithi, a schizophrenic. When at times Mithi is a normal girl, a sweet student, she scares you even when she shows herself sick ... both sides have been beautifully judged and interpreted ... believe me sometimes she reminds you of the girl in the Exorcist ... not the scary one though .. Overall .. Reckless work by Aparna Sen, Konkona Sen and Shabana Azmi ...
