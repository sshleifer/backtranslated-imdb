This brief topic has garnered appreciation from all kinds of places for his request for religious tolerance. <br /> <br /> After a session in a recording studio, Frank Sinatra leaves and meets a group of boys who beat up another because he was Jewish. He taught them how only an American icon could affect the meaning of prejudice and what we had just fought against the Nazis. The meaning could not be clearer. <br /> <br /> Both tracks on this short subject were recorded and sold in large numbers for Columbia records. If Are Are But A Dream and the song written for the film, The House I Live In. The latter is one of the best songs on an idealized version of America, which we would all like to fight. <br /> <br /> Sinatra has in fact recorded The House I Live In again in the 1960s for a joint album made for his Reprise record label. The album is now a rarity and should not be. His collaborators were Bing Crosby and Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians with the orchestra conducted by Nelson Riddle. <br /> <br /> Axel Stordahl was Sinatra's principal music director and arranger during the 1940s. When he died that position he eventually fell to Nelson Riddle. Stordahl is orchestrating the short film and the Columbia record, Riddle for the Reprise. <br /> <br /> Sinatra enthusiasts and others should listen to both back to back and comparison. And take this movie useful whenever it is shown.
