I had seen this movie before, but I couldn't remember it being fantastic: it has a funny plot, Madonna fiddles around the city with pumas etc. Causing a commotion. And the music is just perfect! And the happy ending! Who is that girl is a great choice for a romantic like me. In my opinion this could also be the best Madonna movie I've ever seen! 10/10
