Mud and Sand is a parody of Stan Laurel from the popular films of the time, this is Rudolph Valentino's Blood and Sand (from which Stan is the Vaselino rhubarb). While partially inconsistent on characterization (as he did not defeat those bulls at first is not explained), this was mostly fun from beginning to end with one of the best sequences being a dance he does with his then common law wife , Mae Laurel. Another funny sequence is his reluctance to play the part of the femme fatale, Filet de Sole, while his wife, Carmelo, is waiting for him showing some glimpses of his later innocent character with Oliver Hardy. It is worth seeing for anyone interested in seeing Mr. Laurel's early work before his fateful teaming that made him popular all over the world.
