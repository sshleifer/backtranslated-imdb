The director of "Oldboy" Park Chun-wook returns with what must be one of the most yucy and at the same time most serious vampire films in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Trust the latest Hollywood fashion, these days vampires should be rather cheerless, asexual, amorous and angular chevaliers instead of the evil blood-sucking vampire with human blood. This is the movie you want to see if you want to remember the sticky shivers of the past ... well, at least in the second part. <br /> <br /> 'Thirst' begins with a long exposure of the characters that culminates in a slightly different love story. The vampire transformation of a priest has, for some time, been set aside by the romantic and sexual aspects of history, which makes a strange vision difficult. But the last 40 minutes are surprisingly bloody. Well, maybe not so surprisingly if you know 'Oldboy' and 'I'm a Cyborg but that's fine', but I guess it's fair to say that 'Thirst' beats Park's previous films in terms of face-to-face violence. <br /> <br /> All in all, keep in mind that this is neither an art cinema nor a horror movie. It may be too disgusting for many and too tame for some. 'Sete' is original, fun and fortunately a little less bizarre than previous Park Chun-wook ventures.
