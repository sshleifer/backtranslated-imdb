My favorite series of cops of all time turns into a TV movie. It works? Yes. Gee runs for mayor and is shot. The "hall of fame" murder shows up. Pembleton and almost all the policemen who have ever played in this series. A lot of flashbacks help those who haven't seen the TV series but also enjoy the fans. The last five minutes resolve another murder, and finally two of the dead policemen arrive. And a brief appearance from my favorite coroner, Juliana Cox. This is a good movie.
