The original Female Convict Scorpion is an all-time masterpiece. The first sequel, Jailhouse 41, was not good enough in my opinion, although it is still noteworthy that I took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style. Director Shunya Ito managed to repeat the same thing with this film; the story is a little different here, but still managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and create something quite original around it. Once again the action focuses on Nami Matsushima (a.k.a "Scorpion") and this time she is out of prison and does not get too fond of the idea of ​​going back. After escaping the prosecution of police officers, one thing leads to another and Scorpion finds himself doing it together with a prostitute and his late brother. The prostitute ends up being impregnated by the late brother (...), while the scorpion is kidnapped and trapped by someone who has made an enemy out of prison. But the Scorpion doesn't like spending time behind bars and it doesn't take long before she gets back to doing what she does best. <br /> <br /> The film starts off great when we see Scorpion engraving his arm on a copper intent on bringing it back to prison. From there, however, the film slows down a lot and Beast Stable ends up being more dramatic than the previous two films. This does not mean that there is not much action yet - Scorpion still spends a lot of time in "revenge mode" and the film is not exactly short on a general slit. Meiko Kaji once again takes up her role as a sinister title character and is another sober, almost wordless performance. His on-screen presence is great, however, and he manages to have a threatening presence despite being physically small. The structure of the plot of this film is similar to the other two in that everything translates into a crescendo of revenge. There are more people who have angered Scorpion in this film than the previous ones, so this section takes up quite a large part of the film. There are some surreal sequences, not as many as in the first film and not even remotely like the second one, but the film stays with the rest of the series on that point. Overall, I would say that this film is among the top two in terms of quality - not exceptional as the original and slightly better than the second.
