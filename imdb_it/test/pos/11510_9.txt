This movie I've seen many times. I read the book Englar Alheimsins which was written by Einar Már Guðmundsson who received the Scandinavian book awards for work. The film does not start at the same point where the book begins. It happens in Reykjavík and the main character, Páll is young and has a good life with his girlfriend. But as he breaks the relationship with him, he starts to get headaches that make him annoyed and angry. And soon he starts having big mental problems and then the movie starts. Soon it is put into the Icelandic Mental Hospital called "Kleppur" and there you can see some great characters like Viktor who thinks he is Hitler and Óli who thinks of writing all the Beatles songs and sends them to them with a transport mind. Ingvar And Sigurðusson, who plays the main character Páll, does so well that it leaves you breathless. Even the music of this film is crazy about SIGURRÓS and only for the cost of the music you should see the movie. Overall, a great movie was seen to be seen.
