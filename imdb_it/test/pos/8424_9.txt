This review was written by someone who read it (several times) and knows what he's talking about! First, I read other comments and noticed that some of the objections were really rather stupid. People who have read the book and other Jane Austens or, for that matter, a good book, will know that sticking to the book is vital so you have to trust an author with what they do. If he does not like the viewer, BECAUSE he sticks well to the book shows that they do not understand Jane Austen and obviously are not real fans. <br /> <br /> First of all, if the viewer really loved the book or Jane Austen in general, watching it for four hours shouldn't be difficult. Secondly, their society was very concerned about the looks and hairstyles so big and fanciful they showed how rich you are, that in their time was a key factor in getting along with "good" society. I must confess that the female costumes weren't brilliant, but there were only a few bad guys and males balanced, even this prejudice for men of the Navy not in their uniform is in very fine words very silly!, Today people don't go out with the their uniform away from school or work because they have casual clothes and it was the same in the 19th century. Also, acting is very good, it's subtle because that's what Jayne Austen writes! and the scene at the end is beautiful. It is not possible to compare the shots with those of the 1995 version, since the technology has improved so much from them it is ridiculous to compare them in this. The actress who plays Ann is too old but her acting air and the way she does it makes up for it. <br /> <br /> People seem to prefer the 1995 version for some reason that I can't understand! It doesn't stick to the book at all and so it's flat, the ending is sentimental, the main scenes change, the only good actors are the protagonists and they give you a good job for what was given to them. Obviously the people I really like (I'm sorry) are stupid because they don't understand persuasion and therefore they need it to be exaggerated. The 1971 version is beautiful, romantic, was written by an excellent screenwriter (the same that Inspector Morse did), he had very good actors and it is really a movie that you can watch many times and during each one you can be delighted with it.
