After a decade of turbulent agitation, American films began to shift gears and move their cameras away from war-torn battlefields, political corruption and general social unrest in the most intimate world of family dysfunction. The toll of the selfish Baby Boomers began to face the American family as they grew up and had children making themselves heard. <br /> <br /> "Kramer vs. Kramer" is one of the first of these dysfunctional family dramas that will continue to be so popular in the 1980s, and is one of the best. Now it's a bit depressing, because it's known as the movie that beat "Apocalypse Now" for the Best Picture Academy Award in 1979, but comparing these two films is like comparing a banana to a marinated chicken breast: I'm not remotely the the same, but can't we both enjoy ourselves? The director / screenwriter Robert Benton doesn't try to do anything special with his film; his strength lies in his performances, particularly those of Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, who play a divorced couple fighting childishly and selfishly on their son. The scene of the courtroom in which they take custody, and in which everyone is forced to hurt the other in terrible ways, is devastating and feels authentic. The film does not present Hoffman's solid father as a hero, or Streep's deviant mother as a villain. They are neither good nor bad like people - they are simply bad at being married. <br /> <br /> The film is tearful at the end, but not in a manipulative way. You earn the right to arouse hiccups. <br /> <br /> Vote: A
