I was a little surprised by the PG rating on the back of the DVD case. I certainly wouldn't want my children to watch this. I think this could scare the crap of a 10-year-old child. <br /> <br /> Plot: A girl trying to adapt to the clique is amazed and tormented by the "public". They call her to spend the night in this scary mausoleum (which reminded me of the Phantom ...) and continue to torment her during the night. They don't know, a recently disappeared clairvoyant is coming back to life and raising the dead around them! It sounds terribly mischievous, but given its age and budget, which was undoubtedly rather small, this film is fun on many levels. <br /> <br /> Watch an EG Daily as one of the brats of the crowd. I liked it and scared my girlfriend. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10, children.
