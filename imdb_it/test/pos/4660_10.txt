WEEE is still fun! As with most of my friends, we had seen this movie on HBO when we were young, and we've been looking for a copy ever since. When they finally reread it a few years ago, we organized a Midnight Madness party ... and the film gave us good. Sure, it's pure cheese, but it's still a lot of fun. If you didn't see MM when you were young, you might not appreciate its value today.
