I have a 4-year-old daughter, and before this movie, she only talked about Disney princesses, now she watched this movie and all she can talk about is Princess Genevieve and all her sisters. I highly recommend this movie for all the girls. This film is one of the best in the Barbie collection. Show all the good values ​​that every mother would like to encourage girls there. With great songs and dance moves, my daughter gets up and tries to imitate the moves. The extras are also good, one also works on how good your memory is. I would definitely say it is a must see for children and adults.
