I absolutely loved the film positively. I just saw it and can't wait for it to come out on DVD. It is a magnificent and well-designed masterpiece. I am always amazed by the complex work of the Ghibli studios. <br /> <br /> Others have commented on Sosuke calling Risa with his name. He never calls his father by his name unless he talks to someone else about him. I didn't get the impression that Risa was his mother. It has never even been mentioned or implied by anyone. It is quite obvious that she is his stepmother. That's why he makes his promise to go home and why he gets angry when he finds his empty car. His mother must have died when he was a child because he mentions that he was treated by Risa. This, along with the fact that his father is at sea a lot, is why he has problems with abandonment. Everyone also talks about how mature it is. This usually occurs when a child loses a parent.
