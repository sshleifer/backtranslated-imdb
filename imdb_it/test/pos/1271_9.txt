British director Chrstopher Nolan now has a career in America, and a reputation for making popular and critically acclaimed films; but this little movie was where he started. And he certainly showed off his talent, with his amazing black and white cinematography and synchronic narration that foreshadows his next "Moment", albeit in a less extreme way. Thematically and mechanically, the plot reminded me of David Mamet's "House of Games", but the film still feels fresh and clear, until the final turn of the final whose taste was expected, but whose tip is unexpectedly delicious. Acting, on the other hand, is not enough in the same class - the film has a stylized quality, and perhaps to a greater extent than the director intended. But it's still a good debut, simultaneously claustrophobic and captivating.
