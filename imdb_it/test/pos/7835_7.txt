Let's take a clear thing, this gets a 7 out of 10 not on a normal scale, but off the scale of the bad movie. this is the kind of movie you rented on purpose, where you intentionally walk knowing that it's a horrible knockoff and shun'd from everyone else. <br /> <br /> I went with a promise of the film, that there will be snakes on a train, and what a delivery! <br /> <br /> The gore itself is really good, and the characters have fantastic roles. Come on, it has everything, from the pilots of the stone train to the teenage girls who trade drugs, even an electrical engineer who gets his pimp! You can see some topless nudity, explosions, snakes, cold blood and a Mexican conductor who runs around treating his girlfriend by hitting his crack pipe and blowing smoke into his face !! As I said and many others have, the rhythm of the film is a bit off, but still respectable. <br /> <br /> Movies like this maintain our group's tradition of being together and all the chips in a couple of seconds to watch masterpieces like this. There can be no better time spent then to get together to enjoy a good bad movie. <br /> <br /> You could learn one or two things from the likes of Alien Lock-down or Boa vs Python, but those are great shoes to fill. <br /> <br /> A solid 7 out of 10.
