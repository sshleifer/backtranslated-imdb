"Skenbart" is one of the funniest films to come not only from Peter Dalle, but from the Swedish film industry itself. It's a film made in black and white to get something of the atmosphere of the days before Christmas of December 1945, which does very well. Almost the whole plot takes place on a train, non-stop in Berlin. On the train there is a mix of homosexuals, nuns, deported refugees, murderers, alcoholics and the bankruptcy critic "Gunnar" played by the famous Swedish actor Gustav Hammarsten. The lead role of "Gunnar" is the kind of person who, although his intentions are for the best, seems to drag everyone close to him, in an extremely funny way, in a disaster and a living hell, especially for a Finnish war , back home, wounded soldier played by extremely funny comedian Robert Gustafsson. On the train there is also a doctor, who betrays his wife, with his lover. Together they planned to kill the doctors 'wife who also travels by the same train without any knowledge of her husbands' intentions. Will the doctor's wife escape plans to kill her and will everyone survive the unfortunate "Gunnar"?
