I felt cheated for having known the whole story. While there could be a turning point, this turning point was so significant, that I felt betrayed. I think he could have used a better writer who could better weave all the elements of the story. The writer could have revealed more "twists and turns" throughout the film, rather than all at once in the end. Apart from that, I think the actors did very well what they had, particularly Matt Damon, who actually had a small character in his character, little quirks that weren't selfish or like a smooth criminal who always knows what he's doing. The other main characters were their separate entities who were conversing with each other. The cohesion of the group in Ocean's Eleven was gone.
