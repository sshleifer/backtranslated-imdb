For my money, probably the best film - or at least the most purely cinematic film - the director Ford ever made. The dialogue is fast, cut out, to the point.l The story begins right at the beginning and ends only with the final credits. Ford uses a relatively small cast, but directs and photographs them with a verve and a range of epic proportions. Sadly realistic, warmly funny, brilliantly acted (hard to believe that Johnsonj could not become a leading man after that), with the best photography and editing in any black and white American film. He owes a great deal to the editing technique of Sergei Eisenstein, but never so coldly detached or "scientific" as Eisenstein could often get. And a great musical score. A magnificent panorama of an important and little understood episode in American history. <br /> <br /> A small quirk: it is not clear why the film involves the Mormons, who, as far as I know, were never the pacifists the Quakers and Amish were. This confusion leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste. <br /> <br /> However, the rest of the film is such a party, this is easy to ignore. In all other ways, a true masterpiece of American cinema that needs to be revived and looked at again (and again and again).
