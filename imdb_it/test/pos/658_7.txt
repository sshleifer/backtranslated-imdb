** SPOILERS ** Beautifully photographed smirk of the love story of WWI with Norman Rockwell's paintings at the beginning and end of the film about how a "war hero" is not just someone who kills for his country but it is also someone who thinks for himself and is not corrupted by the war propaganda that is constantly struck in his head. Washing off from the Marine Corps Marion "Hedg" Hedgepeth, Jan Michael-Vincent, is kicked out of the training camp, after five weeks, and forced to wear a Baby Blue Marine uniform that proves he doesn't have the Body to do. Humiliated and despised wherever he went as he went home to St. Louis and terrified that his family, which his father was in the corps of marines in World War I, would have thought of him in the fact that he could not "cut mustard" like a marine American . <br /> <br /> Hedg stops in a bar and sits next to him a member of the fearless and deadly Marine Marine Raiders Richard Gere who a Hedge fan buys a beer. Making conversation with Richard Hedge is shocked to discover that not only was he sent back to the Pacific Theater after all the battles he fought, and the combat medals he got, but the totally gray hair and the half thirty looking for Richard are going to 21 years next month! This is what the Marine Corps and World War II did to him! Buying Hedge a number of drinks, Richard takes out the drunk Baby Blue and knocks him out by taking his Baby Blues and leaving his impressive US Marine uniform with money for Hedge. <br /> <br /> As soon as Hedge wears Richard's uniform, which fits him perfectly, he is confronted by this great drunk American parachutist who calls himself Cement-Head who wants to fight the Marine Raider. The hedge that does all it can to avoid trouble is forced by Cement-Head to bind him, after he himself has split two bottles of beer on his cement head, to get warmed by the great encounter between Marine, Hedge and Parachutist, Cement - Head. Hedge incredibly pave the big clown from the cement head and make it out cold with a punch! "I guess the trick is not hitting him at the top of his head," says Hedge stunned his own, Cement-Heads, companions of G.I. <br /> <br /> hitchhiking in this small town of Bidwell Hedge notice this US military internment camp for Japanese-Americans who are there because they are considered a threat to US security. It is later in the film that Hedge shows everyone what a true hero is, not who he thinks it is the people of the city, risking his life to save one of the hated "Japs" who recklessly along with two of his friends escaped from interment camp, where the hell did they think they were going anyway? Hedge risked his life by saving the Japanese-American fear-death of drowning in dangerous rapids outside the city. The hedge in his actions taught the people of Bidwell that not all "Japs", even those who are American citizens, are evil and treacherous Banzai who shout suicidal suicide bombers as if they were designed by magazines and newspapers in that time for think they were. <br /> <br /> Hedge reaches a conversation with the very pretty and cute waitress from local club Rose Hudkins, Glynnis O'Connor, who is just crazy about him that even Hedge at first thinks is his uniform, not he who hit her. Later, when Hedge admits to Rose that this is not what she and her parents think, an American Marine Raider, who is Rose, had learned to know the sweet and affectionate marine faded that she didn't care what she should have been, a marine a parachutist or a postal worker, was what was in his heart that really mattered. <br /> <br /> The film has a number of beautiful and moving Hedge and Rose scenes that show how films were once created years ago without all the sex and swear words we see and hear in today's movies that have involved two people in love with each other. <br /> <br /> The way in which the film is precise, not false baloney, shows the true feelings of the average Americans, then in 1943, on war in general and Japanese in particular could not have been done more authentic and accurate as well as good taste. "Baby Blur Marine" it is better not to be too politically correct in not showing the heroes or the main actors and the actresses in the film who have the same feelings and the same ideas of the time during the Second World War, like most people now , which would have seemed as fake as a three-dollar bill, to those people who watch the film he lived during those historic and epoch-making periods when the film had to take place.
