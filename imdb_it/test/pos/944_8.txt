My Mother Frank begins as a warm and amiable comedy about a middle-aged Catholic woman (Frank, short for Francis, played by Sinead Cusack) who shakes herself from depression by enrolling as a student in her son's university. Most of his friends and relatives are horrified, not least his son (Matthew Newton), who is making himself fall in love with his best friend's girlfriend (Rose Byrne). Meanwhile, Frank aroused the anger of his English disapproving (Sam Neill). <br /> <br /> Matthew Newton is absolutely as disarming as David; relaxed and natural in the role, even when the character is tense. It generates good will, guiding the audience through some of the film's most awkward and comical moments. Not long after the middle of the journey, first screenwriter and director Mark Lamprell deftly leads his film into a darker emotional territory and gives Cusack a real chance to shine. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is full of familiarity and the welcoming faces (Lynette Curran, Sacha Horler, Nicholas Bishop) and all the principals (including a more animated than usual Sam Neill) are excellent. As it gets a little closer to the end, My Mother Frank offers more than it promises and it's a real Australian treat.
