This film is BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> I don't remember this movie even BEING in theaters, so thinking it was a "straight to DVD" I have fairly low expectations, even though I'm a big fan of Mike Giudice. It has the same kind of comic satire of the future as "Brazil" and "Demolition Man", but taken to the next level. <br /> <br /> Then I saw the cast; Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph and Dax Shepard, who were all brilliant in their roles. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, this film won me over in the first 5 minutes, where it shows people above average who have fewer children and the poorest, stupid and scruffy people who have many ignorant children, and how this is leading to a kind of inverse evolution. It takes this concept, and then shows where we are headed with this pollution of the gene pool. <br /> <br /> Sadly, I do not believe that it will take the 500 years as depicted, but probably only about 50. I already see the shocking increase of the "slight delay" in the general population, media and culture. People who love classical music and art are ridiculed instead of respected. The least common denominator seems to dominate, especially in Hollywood and on TV (for example, "Jackass the Movie" and any reality show where they make you eat something disgusting or humiliate yourself for money). <br /> <br /> apart from political / social satire, this film is even just fun. And I don't say it lightly; few films actually make me "LOL", but this has been done. <br /> <br /> Many of the best jokes are the words / gag views in the background, so you have to be careful to get some. I also had to pause and zoom in on some of them (like when Joe got his government ID and "hair" he said "yes" and "eyes" also said "yes"). Furthermore, the prison has had "House for Particular Individuals" on the front, since the cops in the film (very similar to real-life cops) all call "individuals" instead of people, etc. Still, this was on screen for just a moment ... this is one of those movies that you can watch again and again and dissect it to get over the layers of fun. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, I normally watch films with subtitles, and this helped me in some jokes that could pass through the dialogue mix, for example, the police constantly talk about people "running away" instead of "running away", and there are many other mis-pronunciations that have only cracked me. But again, I could not understand them only from the mixed dialogue with music / sound effects; it's very thin but still exhilarating. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the special effects were REALLY GOOD for a science-fiction / social satire. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but overall, I think this is one of those movies that if you don't think it's funny, it's probably kidding you! I'm going to recommend it to many, many people!
