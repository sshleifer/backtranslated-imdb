It was easy to dismiss this film as a hyperbole when it was released. Fonda, Douglas and Lemmon were known as "lefties", but the Three Mle Island incident provided a shocking context for this imaginary drama. <br /> <br /> This film works on many levels, taking shots of both public utilities and television news. 1979 was the zenith of the infamous "Happy Talk" TV news format (see also "Ron Burgundy") and is exhibited here in all its glory. The sound anchor gloomily reads a story about a "frontal collision" before cheerfully introducing Kimberley Wells (Fonda), making a story about a vet making home calls (or is it "aquarium?"). The show's producer and station manager discuss the content - or lack thereof - behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> There are some technical errors. The PR (James Hampton) flack shows Fonda and Douglas the required scale model of a pressurized water reactor plant, built by Westinghouse. Later, while Lemmon and Wilford Brimley (who play good friend and colleague of Lemmon, caught between duty and loyalty) fighting a sudden crisis in the plant's control room, they are obviously running a boiling water plant (built by GE.) A small point, but curious, considering how many details the writers have been right. <br /> <br /> Like any good drama, the film asks more questions than it answers. The real world incident at TMI demonstrates the basic premise of the film. The working title of the film was originally "Power", and you'll see why. While nuclear power is preparing to make a comeback in these days of $ 3 gas, "The China Syndrome" is as relevant today as it was over 25 years ago.
