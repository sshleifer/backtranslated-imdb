Although it was a failure in theaters because mainly Mylene Farmer, one of the 3 best stars in France did not have the first role. Fans had changed their minds and were waiting for it on DVD. When it was released on DVD this year it was a huge success! The others fail the slow pace and the incredible length (3h) at that time (1994) that irritated the critics. But the melancholy story makes that slow and long-time rhythm mandatory. The moral of the film is that you can't escape the death for which you are destined. It is the same theme as in the film "Final Destination" and makes it a Gothic tale. The atmosphere is very melancholy.
