Broken Silence or "Race Against Fear" 1998): Performed by Ariana Richards, William Bumiller, Susan Blakely, Tracy Ellis Ross, Teryl Rothery, Scott Vickaryous, Marissa Rudiak, Ken Camroux, David Neale, Bruce Dawson ... Director Joseph Scanlan, Screenplay Sara Charmo, Jean Gennis, Phyllis Murphy. <br /> <br /> This is another film from the Lifetime channel, made exclusively for television, published in 1998, directed by the director of the longtime TV series Joseph L. Scanlan. Inspired by real events, it closely resembles most of the Lifetime films, a warning for women, raising awareness of the predator lurking within the family (mother, father, wife, husband) and mentor (teacher, in this case coach). The young and little-known actress Ariana Richards (who played the little girl in Jurassic Park) offers a very convincing performance as the high school athlete Mickey Carlyle, who is raped by her trainer, Kurt Ansom (William Bumiller) and has to suffer in silence as no one believes his story, except, of course, his mother (Susan Blakely). Together, mother and daughter fight to put Kurt Ansom behind bars. The film drags on a lot, is ultimately predictable, sometimes too melodramatic for the drama itself, but in the end it is really powerful. Ariana Richards' performance is "daytime" soap, but it's the strongest of the cast. His facial expressions, body language and general acting are realistic in terms of how she, as an aspiring athlete, idolizes her trainer, is also violated by him and must now live with shame, trauma and further, fighting him in court. William Bumiller plays the part with a kind of duplicity, even if it is anything but subtle. He abused other stellar athletes before, who remained silent and arrived at the top, and appear externally innocent. William Bumiller, an actor less known than the others, has never played such a role but, overall, achieves a credible and strong performance. It is particularly disturbing to see him in this role because he is a sexy actor in everything he does, including some lesser-known films and in the soap opera "Guiding Light". The only real problem I had with this film is the way the film is structured. As the movie opens, we look at the Ansom coach about to rape Mickey, letting us know right away that this guy is no good. But this makes the development and the story of the characters weak. If the first scene had been instead the sequence with the opening titles in which we see Mickey run / run in the city across a lake, we would have a better character development because we don't know that Coach Ansom, even if apparently interested in the success of his athlete of tip, it really is a bad job and we would have seen Mickey idolize a person he thought he knew and then received a rude awakening when he realized he was wrong about him. Director Joseph Scanlan is no stranger to the TV drama (Knott's Landing, Star Trek, Quantum Leap, The Outer Limits, Lois and Clark, Earth Final Conflict and films like La Femme Nikitta. In 1996, Scanlan had directed another Lifetime movie , similar to this, "Stand Against Fear" (1996), which manages to convey the gravity of the event, we are really upset by the coach who wanders around the showers where he rapes his own student, scenes that are graphic and should be seen as a mature public, but his message is clear: predators and sexual rapists are not always strangers and can take different forms, and their predatory motifs can even include a high school. This film supports the cause of fighting to prevent violence against women and pushes women who have been silent victims to testify and fight so that the rapists do not cause further harm to others. Despite other negative reviews, this film a great job in expressing his message and should be given to mothers, daughters, hi gh school students (including both boys and girls). As much as rape, being quiet when it happens is even worse.
