A cardboard SUPERMAN <br /> <br /> A huge load of gold is sent across the country by train. Using ultramodern techniques, a sophisticated band of hooded thieves tries to stop the gold. With the intrepid journalist Lois Lane as the only passenger on board, Superman is to the rescue. But now that he has become a running train, can he even stop the BILLION DOLLAR LIMITED? <br /> <br /> This was another of the excellent cartoon series produced by Max Fleischer for Paramount Studio. They have great animations and tense and fast textures. Designed to be screened in cinemas, it is far ahead of its Saturday morning counterparts.
