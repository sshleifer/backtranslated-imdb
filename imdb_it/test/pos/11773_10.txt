This is my favorite movie of all time. It's the best parody of a science fiction movie ever; the fact that it was a Star Wars feeling made it even better. <br /> <br /> I love slapstick. Think of this as the Marx brothers or the Three marmittoni meet Star Wars. The writing is hilarious. The effects are a blast. The free association that continues guarantees all kinds of things that come out of the left field. (I almost wet my pants when the Wookie Monster approached the Princess.) <br /> <br /> Space Balls was a much longer film, but it only had about 15 minutes of good material, and I felt like if I had been robbed later, like buying a hamburger that turned out to be mostly filler. Hardware Wars, although it is only 15 minutes long, it would be worth paying a price for the features, IMO.
