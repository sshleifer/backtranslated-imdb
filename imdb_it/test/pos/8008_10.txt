Of all the Bat-movies, Batman Returns is my favorite. This beautiful, dark and funny film is one of Tim Burton's best works. Although it is very violent and obscure, this is the Batman that creator Bob Kane imagined many years ago. Michael Keaton resumes his role as an avenger of Gotham City. This time it collides with two deadly enemies, Danny Devito's Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman. With a cast and Danny Elfman soundtrack, the film takes us on an adventure as Batman fights the evil forces that are trying to conquer Gotham City. Christopher Walken makes a great appearance as Max Shrek, a clever businessman who has an evil plan in his sleeve. But of course, Michelle Pfeiffer is the one who steals the show. With all these components, you have a movie that will leave you speechless. This is why you go to the movies. It has everything. It is really a pity that Tim Burton failed to direct the other sequels. If so, I think the franchise would still be strong today. Batman Returns is a fantastic experience for fans who love fashionable movies.
