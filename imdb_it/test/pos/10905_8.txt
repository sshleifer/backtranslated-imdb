this film is extremely fun and entertaining, with suitable casts, fun and experienced. I find this film enjoyable not only for the elements of humor, but also for the music in various scenes. Kevin Kline, a good comedian has done a good job at being fun in many parts of the film along with Tom Selleck who is incredibly different from many of his other films. The humor of this film is silly, which makes various exaggerations in many scenes, particularly the initial bits. Joan Cusack is also extraordinarily funny and exaggerated; and the same goes for all the other casts. This film has many elements of silly humor and it's fun if you want to laugh.
