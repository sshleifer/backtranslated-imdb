After reading some of these reviews, it is clear that some have lost the point. What is beautiful about this film (here comes the point), what is incredible about this film, what is surprising about this film is that there is no proselytism. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. Life goes on. It is a masterpiece in allowing the public to think for its collective self. These are just children who do what children do - without conscience. We all went to school with children like these. We are numbed by the reality / invention based on fiction- / movie- / tv- / news. <br /> <br /> Feck's girlfriend (Dennis Hopper the great) alone and her relationship with her is worth the price of renting this movie. <br /> <br /> There have been a few films before or after measuring themselves against the intelligence of this film. AMEN. <br /> <br />
