Hammer House of Horror: Witching Time is set in rural England on the Woodstock farm, where the stressed musician David Winter (Jon Finch) lives with his wife actress Mary (Prunella Gee) and is currently composing music for a horror film. One night, while searching for his dog, Billy David finds a mysterious woman in his stable, calling himself Lucinda Jessop (Patricia Quinn) who claims to be a witch who has been transported for 300 years in the past to the present. Obviously quite skeptical, David finds it hard to believe it, so he locks her in a room on his farm and calls his doctor Charles (Ian McCulloch) to come and visit her, but once he arrives and they enter the room, Dawn has disappeared. Charles tells David that he drinks too much, but in the following days strange and disturbing things start to happen to David and Mary ... <br /> <br /> Witching Time is episode 1 of the short-lived British horror series produced by Hammer TV studios originally aired here in the UK in September 1980, the first of two Hammer House of Horror episodes directed by Don Leaver (episode 13 The Mark of Satan is the other). I actually liked this a lot. As a Hammer House of Horror series dealt with various different themes and were not all connected to each other apart from the name and Surprisingly Watching Time is a sinister and effective story about a witch, the script by Anthony Read benefits from its slight 50 minute duration and it moves at a good pace. The characters are pretty good as well as the dialogue, there are good scenes here and I liked the way it never reveals if David and Mary are going crazy or not. I think it's a well-structured, fun and reasonably terrifying horror-themed TV show that I liked a lot more than I thought. <br /> <br /> Being made for British TV meant that the Hammer boys had a lower budget than usual, if that was even possible, and as such there are no wonderful settings here as in their films Frankenstein & Dracula more known, although the contemporary English setting gives it a certain atmosphere that you can connect a little more. Another TV-based restriction is that exploitation levels are lower than expected, there are some nudity and gore but not much, although I didn't mind too much since the story here is pretty good. It is well done for what it is and the Hammer experience in their films has probably helped make these looks pretty good, the acting is good even with the favorite genre Ian McCulloch that makes a little appearance. <br /> <br /> Witching Time is a good start for the Hammer House of Horror series, as a 50 minute piece of British TV is pretty damn good, now why don't they do shows like this here anymore?
