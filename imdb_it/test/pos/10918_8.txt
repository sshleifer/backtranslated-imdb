I saw this because my cousin is an extra in one of the wedding scenes. I read somewhere that Oz and Rudnick wanted to make fun of liberal message films, but the climax ends up being released from one of those movies. Also, part of the humor is a bit cloying, Joan Cusack was too exaggerated for me, and someone has a strange Oscar timeline. And yet, there were more than enough amusing moments, like the kissing scene, the wedding that is not, and the scene with the headmaster, to enjoy this. Kline as always is good, but for me, the real surprise was Selleck, of which I am not a big fan, but he has a lot of fun with himself.
