a very nice episode, though not as devastating as the end of season 1. The idea of ​​making it a Desmond flashback worked very well, and Henry Ian Cusick was fantastic, perhaps putting the best performances of this entire series but my only complaint would have been Michael's plot, which seemed very similar to a subplot, and after three minutes from the previous episode, I thought he would have more. But the strength of the character and Cusicks' performance surpassed him. plot developments, as always, leave more questions and answers, like who the others are, something we don't know yet, and where Jack, Sawyer and Kate are taking. What was the white light, what impact did it have? Locke, Eko and Desmond are dead? how the door was destroyed around them. If they were it would be a serious mistake, because these three are the most interesting characters and the series would suffer without them and Terry O'Quinn was fantastic in both series like Locke. An ending suitable for a better series than the first.
