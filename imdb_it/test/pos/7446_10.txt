Square really came to this. They didn't try to please everyone and instead focused exclusively on Final Fantasy 7 fans. And boy, will they be happy fans when they see this movie! The story may not be so interesting or believable, but it is perfectly linked to the history of the game and has many honest funny moments !! A total surprise and a welcome also <br /> <br /> There are many cameos and fun references also to the game. And the most important thing of all: the fighting scenes shake so hard they can cut the diamond! They really are the total beauty and would have made the film worthy of the value even if everything else had been sucked. I mean, they are among the best PERIODS ever created. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. Hello. <br /> <br /> PS: I know my review looks like a teenager's delirium. It was, like, totally what I meant.
