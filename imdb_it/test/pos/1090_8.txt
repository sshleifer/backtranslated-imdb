I almost stopped watching Hindi movies because of the mediocre quality and the stories. An exception for this is represented by the films of Ramgopal Verma. This is a great movie with great performances by the star cast. This is necessary to see films for those who are fed up with watching stupid dances and love stories. The adaptation of the plot and characterization was exceptional. You should watch this movie for Nana Patekar. based on the life of Mumbai policeman Daya Naik, this film is more realistic. The film deepens the life of the common man, who besides being a specialist in the meeting. I consider this as one of the best films of the year
