This is one of the best "Bloke" films of the early 90s and, although a little dated, is one of those films that would never have been made today, which makes it really special! In fact, in the 1990s a film very similar to "Masterminds" was created and it was a PG variation on the same theme, but it was nowhere near as fun or realistic. <br /> <br /> so special about this movie? It is the comrade between the main characters and the controversial theme of the film. Sean Astin is very nice and has starred in some of the most memorable films of the 80s / 90s, especially "The Goonies". He also investigated things with the trilogy of "Rudy" and "The Lord of the Rings", but "Encino Man" is a good journey into memory. Will Wheaton of "Stand by Me" lends good support to the film and Andrew Divoff is a terrifying villain. Louis Gossett Jr sleepwalking in his role, but adds a certain brevity to the film, especially his relationship with the rebellious nature of Astin. <br /> <br /> So how's the action going? By today's standards, it's rather boring and cheap, almost like a TV movie, but production values ​​are good and violence is actually rather unpleasant for a film that involves school students. However, the director compensates for the limited budget with some pleasantly suspensive moments and a well-positioned humor. <br /> <br /> So park your brain at the door and enjoy this action movie remembered fondly, but don't expect the Oscar material!
