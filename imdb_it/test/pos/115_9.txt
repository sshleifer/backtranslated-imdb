It is a very sensitive portrait of life with unsophisticated or limited desires. What are we doing about desire in a culture and in a society with strict rules? A husband finds an outlet with the immigrant - since immigrants do not belong or are not accepted, they do not need to conform and grind their desires. The other husband seeks comfort in spirituality and tries to evaporate his desire into nothingness. It fails - obviously - and breaks down in the last scene for multiple reasons. He still cared enough for Sita to find that moment to let him know that he was not responsible for his deviant outlet to his blocked desires. The mother in her still couldn't find the strength to destroy her myth. Do you see him as a child who is glorifying himself in his control of desire, but should give him the opportunity to finally grow up? Both wives find courage and solidarity through their shared rejection by the husband. <br /> <br /> But the final act of rejection was grandmother's - she couldn't get rid of her rusty mindset to accept Sita's wish. A decade and more of loving care has not been enough to break the chains of its culture. It seems to have been easier for the help of the house to let his wishes flow - since he is damned by his culture anyway - to be at the bottom of the hierarchy. Since there is still no respect and no expectations, it could also taste sin.
