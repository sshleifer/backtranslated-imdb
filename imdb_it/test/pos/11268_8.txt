This must be one of the most beautiful and morbid movies I've ever seen. Merhige has created a living painting that unfolds with horrible violence, sex and a minimalist revisitation of the life of Jesus Christ. The high contrast and thick layer of grain make you doubt what you are seeing sometimes, but the use of the texture, combined with the extreme contrast, creates an incredible visual experience. This film is not for everyone. I think you have to keep an open mind and not be so quick to condemn this film for its content, which is extremely rough, but makes a pretty important statement about creation, god and humanity. Whether this film is a work of art, or the value of shock trash is open to discussion.
