I remember when skateboarding had its renaissance in the 1970s. I begged my parents for money with a second-hand skateboard from a friend. It was a piece of rubbish, complete with clay wheels and everything. I also remember reading the Skateboarder magazine and being completely shocked and totally terrified by the Dogtown crew. Skating has never become a way of life for me, but somehow it has always been a part of my life, whether you use a board for transport or simply have a group of friends who are skating. <br /> <br /> This film is a brilliant documentary about the true birth of modern skating. Watching this crew turn skating from the boring flat hobby has been in the vertical lifestyle that has become made me sit open-mouthed for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> It is surprising that there are still enough shots from this period to have created this film, and thank God for that. The film is brilliant. It gave me the feeling of watching an old Buster Keaton movie: I've seen some of the tricks that Keaton has repeated countless times in other films since then, but when you go back and see the first person who does that trick it's unbelievable that, not only they were the first person to prove it successfully, but they lived it and made it look effortless. This is the feeling that this film gave me. Yes, I've seen people skate in the pool before, but watching the FIRST people skating the pools and inventing the tricks that eventually became the basics of modern skating is like watching the front of the house fall on Keaton, leaving it standing safely in the frame of a window. It is absolutely fantastic to see something that had never been tried before, but has since been tried by almost everyone. <br /> <br /> This film is beautiful to look at and incredible to listen to. The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard in a movie. This is a film that will appeal to people who love skating or not. I talked to a couple of my friends who sat their girlfriend in this movie after heavy protests, and everyone said their girls were enchanted by the end of the movie and loved it as much as they did. <br /> <br /> As for the previous comments on this forum that complain that the film is too self-congratulatory, I think it's an unfair contempt. I enjoyed seeing these kids excited about their past. They created something that influenced their sport and changed it forever. They have the right to pet on the back. They were the stars to do what they loved to do. Most of these boys / girls never achieved the incredible success that Tony Hawk enjoys today, but that kind of success was therefore not available to skaters. Of course, they have had some success, but above all, they have been able to live a life doing what they love to do, and, as we finally see, almost everyone continues to surf, skate or work in the surf / skate industry. How many of us can say that we have been able to live our lives and have succeeded by breaking all the rules and doing what we love to do? They can. My hat started for Dogtown and Z-Boys to be themselves and to change the skateboarding world forever.
