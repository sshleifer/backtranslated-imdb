Perhaps the best role of John Travolta ever. Saturday Night Fever was a great film and a role, but a long time ago. I can't think of many of his films or roles that I liked, and it's easy to think of rotten ones. It can do things like Pulp Fiction, but it's the perfect and funky angel, and it's hard to imagine anyone doing a better job (equally faded) with it. Print summaries are available everywhere, but the plot is not the point. Just go around and enjoy the intelligence of the little fun along the way. There is nothing nasty about this film, unless you look for something profound. I wish there were more movies like this. We need a break from the deep or fantastic or frighteningly complex or hysterical.
