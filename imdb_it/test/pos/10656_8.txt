There are only a handful of films that have been made on such a large scale and made such a difference in the art of cinema. <br /> <br /> "Bronenosets Potyomkin" is one of these films, and should be on the list of anyone who wants to learn more about the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Grigori Aleksandrov and Sergei M. Eisenstein directed this revolutionary film that documents the horrors taking place on a Russian warship. When sailors eventually react against their superiors, the locals embrace and support them. Things get ugly when a group of soldiers is sent to the small town to do business. What follows is one of the most imitated scenes in the history of cinema. Anyone who has seen "The Untouchables" and "Bronenosets Potyomkin" knows exactly what I mean. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this film has raised the bar for making films just like "Intolerance" did a few years earlier. If you don't mind the silent movies, do yourself a favor and see "Bronenosets Potyomkin". <br /> <br /> If you don't like silent movies ... look at "Bronenosets Potyomkin" anyway. <br /> <br />
