It must be said that this film is definitely one of the best "bargain bin" movies out there - I'd feel a little cheated if I paid £ 15 for this, but at around £ 1.50 I felt that I certainly got more than it's worth my money. <br /> <br /> The film cannot decide if it wants to be "Mad Max" or one of Clint Eastwood's unnamed "spaghetti westerns", and as such is full of clichés of both. Even the crazy maniac who hangs out with the bad guys in "Mad Max" is there. <br /> <br /> That guy from "Blade Runner" is also good at billing, even if it only appears at the beginning and end of the film. <br /> <br /> Favorite bit - for me punch-up at the top of the oil refinery - if you look closely you can see the post-apocalyptic rush hour traffic that thunders into the distance in the distance like the two protagonists beat seven bells from each other. <br /> <br /> You get different lagers, few pizzas and relax and enjoy what is ultimately light but fun.
