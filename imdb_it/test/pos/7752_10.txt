I tend to fall in love with souls, because the more you look, the more you notice that many shows are just poor copies of the few gems or rehash of the old formulas. But every once in a while one of the real gems arrives and it's the originality that sweeps you away. Haruhi is really one of those shows. Many anime series are originally manga and sometimes the translation in an animated show is rather poor and does not use the benefits that the animation has on static drawings. Haruhi is actually based on a series of light and fire novels on all cylinders, beautiful animation, great dubbing, great music and a complete and well made story. Look at it, you will not be disappointed and I would suggest you look at it in the order of transmission that works much better that way.
