The two new OSS 117 movies have a kind of humor that is both intelligent and speechless, which I find extremely entertaining. It really reminds me of the classic Pink Panther films with a prominent man like Peter Sellers in Jean Dujardin. And unlike Steve Martin who completely ruins Clouseau, Dujardin is quite brilliant. <br /> <br /> Comments regarding the anti-Semitism of the films are obviously a case of complete lack of humor and therefore of understanding. <br /> <br /> If you appreciate or hate this movie, really care about what kind of humor you have. I'm looking forward to the sequel!
