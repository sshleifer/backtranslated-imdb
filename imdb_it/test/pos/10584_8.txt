I bought this film only to see Bam because I really loved it, but after seeing it I don't like it very much. I mean, his acting was good and everything I imagine, but every time he showed totally useless skate scenes I was just telling myself, "Okay, we know you're a professional skateboarder, can we go back to Ryan Dunn now? " Dunn, Rake and Brandon really made the film in my perspective. I noticed that Jenn Rivell, (obviously), and Missy Rothstein were both at Haggard, but who was Bam dating at the time? Anyway, I really appreciated Haggard and I think it's really like no other movie I've ever seen. It's a bit in its category.
