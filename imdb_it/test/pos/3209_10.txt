Hands off, the best drama / comedy show on television. A show written intelligently about a young mother and a 16 year old daughter who explore life and find things not only about the world but also about themselves. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) struggles to find a way to stay close to her daughter, but to lead her on the right path, which is becoming increasingly difficult through the show. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) is involved in a world of books and learning is just starting to discover the boys and his sense of rebellion, which both surprise them. With the help of Luke Danes (Scott Patterson) and Sookie St. James (Melissa McCarthy) and a huge variety of other hilarious characters, this show easily remains one of my favorites. What really puts the show above the lines is the complex, incredible and witty writing that often uses references from pop culture to the mink dynasty.
