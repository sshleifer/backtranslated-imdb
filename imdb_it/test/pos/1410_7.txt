At the same time, John Russell was playing with ranch owner Nathan Burdette, trying to free the bad brother Claude Akins from Sheriff John Wayne in Rio Bravo, who was working on the other side of the law on television. These years were probably the high point of Russell's career, his most famous role and his most famous television role, Marshal Dan Troop of Laramie in Lawman. Russell kept the law and order in Laramie in the same way that James Arness did it in Dodge City on Gunsmoke. Unlike Gunsmoke, Laramie never developed all the minor characters that gave you the impression of Dodge City at the time. Instead, he focused on Russell doing business and learning legal affairs for his young and impatient deputy Peter Brown. <br /> <br /> Brown played deputy Johnny McKay who was a respectful young man, constantly referring to his boss as Mr. Troop. He was quite handy with a needle, but he was inclined to be impulsive. The good thing was Marshal Troop. <br /> <br /> The other regular series was Laramie's Kitty Russell, Lily played by Peggie Castle. This is where Lawman looked more like Gunsmoke. There was an unspoken understanding between Russell and Castle that even the smallest of children could not have missed. And I wasn't the youngest child when Lawman was on the first try. <br /> <br /> Sadly Peggie Castle developed substance abuse problems after the end of Lawman. I remember that a small obituary marked his passing in the first half of the seventies. She was a beautiful woman. <br /> <br /> Lawman was not good, no sense, from the golden age of Western adult television. He was one of the best.
