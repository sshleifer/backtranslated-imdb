He is currently playing at the 2007 Australian Film Festival in Australia http://www.goethe.de/ins/au/lp/prj/ff07/enindex.htm thanks to Peanutqueen and especially AriesGemini for his report on the actors of this cast ensemble. <br /> <br /> In Australia these films were subtitled in English and while French films here are often mainstream, German films are still destined to collect that kind of commercial audience. But like BMW and Mercedes, when the Germans are right, I really like their movies. As PQ, the time spent here has gone so quickly, many laughter from the audience as each of the 9 men and 9 women has moved along the speed dating line 5 minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> While many movies are too long one that I could see much more. He had the type of characters and character development for a series. In due course I will re-read the review of AriesGemini100 and I will report to the actors that I liked and their other work in order to keep an eye on them. I agree ... most of these actors will go on bigger and better things. Some very good actors in this beautiful film. I saw it in the program listed as a mockumentary. Mock or otherwise seemed very real. And quite romantic in its own way. <br /> <br /> Long live the Deutcsh!
