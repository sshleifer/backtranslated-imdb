This is the hardest movie I've ever seen ... the emotional content is horrible, yet unforgettable. A woman accused of being a political activist is interrogated. The whole film revolves around his interrogation. Alan Rickman and Madeline Stowe have intense and powerful roles for which they deserve the Oscars for their performances.
