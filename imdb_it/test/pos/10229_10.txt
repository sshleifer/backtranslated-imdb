As an avid reader of Clive Barker, I really anticipated this film before its release ... I was not disappointed. "Nightbreed" is a horse of a different color. Packed with the underlying decay of Western civilization and dripping with alternative existence in a way we've never seen before. Barker is at his best when he allows us to peek into his world of unprecedented horror, showing us the other side of the coin. Here the "monsters" are the horribly beautiful beings, while the humans are the deceptive creatures of self-indulgence. We soon discover that we have always been wrong. By far my favorite performance by Craig Sheffer, often underutilized, and David Cronenberg's added bonus as "Decker" is a cast that looked better at the time. The "Monsters" are impeccably interpreted by a swarm of English masters, many of whom have brought to life the "Cenobites" in "Hellraiser", including "Pinhead" himself Doug Bradley. "Nightbreed" is a must see for all fans of the horror genre, and anyone who needs a little (something) more of their horror story. This is Clive Barker at his best.
