Wow, I think the overall average rating of this film on this site is incredibly low. There's really no reason not to love this movie. "Michael" is a simple romantic comedy, but quite original and easily enjoyable. The plot involves a group of journalists / experts who will examine the mysterious appearance of an angel (John Travolta) in the Midwest. The angel proves to be less holy and more mundane than we expect, and that is what makes it fun. His interest in women and the Beatles takes a new turn in the Angel thing. The romantic side of this film involves Michael the angel who tries to get Andie MacDowell and William Hurt together. The two may not have the best chemistry of all time on the screen, but they certainly have enough to make it work well. All those who have rated this film so low (at 5.4 ??), come on! The film is not so bad. In fact, I found it quite fun and memorable. Of course, it's not the best thing you can ever see, but it's still good. This is a film that I think has been greatly underestimated. It's fun, romantic and recommended by me. <br /> <br /> *** up ****
