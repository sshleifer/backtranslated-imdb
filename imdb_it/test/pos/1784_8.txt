The lives of three distinct and distant individuals intersect with the brutal murder of one another. The one-hour film reveals only the event that brings together the three individuals only after half of the film is finished. I've seen other segments of the "Dekalog", but this struck me as the poorest in dialogue and even more fascinating in structure. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a law student who makes a false defense request for a man accused of murder. Obviously the same arguments must have been repeated by the man as a full-fledged lawyer, but this is never shown on the screen (at least in the short 1-hour version of Dekalog 5). We are made to imagine that this must have been the case. A taxi driver who is a misanthrope, has two aspects of his character: the good side feeds a mangy dog, meticulously cleans his taxi, collects dirty rags thrown by people without civic sense and remembers his wife while he is dying; the bad side scares the little poodles, refuses to give a ride to a drunk - probably worried he might throw up in the cabin - and glares at pretty girls. The repulsive protagonist who kills without mercy, drops stones from bridges over fast-moving traffic and pushes strangers into urinals without provocation, is also a person who can make innocent girls laugh. Kieslowski's film and screenplay thus present the good and bad side of two of the three main characters. <br /> <br /> However, the film is not about capital punishment but about a killing treaty. The fifth commandment "Do not kill" is explored theologically - ("Even God spared Cain ..."), sociologically the tenderness of brutes to children and poor abandoned dogs, and psychologically (after the effects of drunken night with a friend male who led to the accidental death of his sister, whose photograph he brings with him). What makes ordinary people turn into a killer - this is never completely explained, but the suggestions are legions. <br /> <br /> In the world of Kieslowski there is a model in which events and people are interconnected in a cosmic sense (note the clown's resemblance to the murderer, while hanging from the mirror in the cabin). Kieslowski and the young idealist lawyer seem to ask us to look at the Command literally and figuratively - why do we kill? Are the legally killed people really bad? Is there a force beyond society (the drunken night that led to a girl's life) that makes us horrible murderers? <br /> <br /> We would miss the forest for the trees to discuss the two wounded killings in the film - both without mercy. The film invites the viewer to reflect on why we are asked by God not to kill. <br /> <br /> I understand that a full version of the film was made by Kieslowski. But even this short 1-hour version is superb with its bare and bare script, intelligent editing, interesting cinematography and high-level direction that provides much more than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br /> This segment anticipates the healthiest Dekalogs 6,7 and 8.
