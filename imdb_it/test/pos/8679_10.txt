I must say that this is the best film I've ever seen. I know that on this site they have received only negative reviews, but for once I would like to be the good person who offers a good review to the best film in the world. I find the movie extremely fun and has the perfect mix of everything. it makes me feel all sorts of emotions when I look at it, and I can't get enough. genial soundtracks. I LOVE it, I understand why people might not love it as much as I do, but I don't understand how people can hate it. The film is 100% bright. The blurred image is incredible. I never realized that Australian films could be so beautiful, and I never realized I could watch a movie so many times in a single day without getting tired of it. I think everyone should watch it, if it is to get an idea of ​​what life was like in younger days, or if it is to see what awaits you when you arrive at the end of the year 12.
