A surprisingly large cartoon in the same league as Batman: TAS and its genre, I loved it in my youth and I was able to watch them all again recently, with great dubbing by Tim Curry, Richard Moll, Tony Jay and Maurice LaMarche in various roles. The only thing I had was the voice of Rob Paulsons that seemed a bit too old for the title character, but it wasn't a big deal since the stories were fantastic, and the fact that the whole thing has a fantastic ending. Some say it was a cop-out, but I found it refreshing compared to many series that leave things hanging. I hope one day they released this series on DVD, unfortunately it came out at a time when DVDs weren't prevalent yet and the comic probably only served to sell a particular kind of toy, which I never found attractive despite the funny cartoon .
