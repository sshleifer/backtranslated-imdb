A story about love and hate, tragedy and happiness, and above all, the friendship set in the very interesting period of the American civil war. <br /> <br /> You care about the story, it involves you emotionally and makes you look forward to the next episode. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the casting was splendid. Many superstars appear in short cameos, the main roles are played by a great series of talented mimes - Kirstie Alley and Terri Garber should be mentioned here - this is simply a superb example for a television production as it should be. <br /> <br /> Not to forget the pure beauty of Wendy Kilbourne that portrays Constance :-)
