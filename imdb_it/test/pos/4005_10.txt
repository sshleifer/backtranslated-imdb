First of all I want to say that Ang Lee did a great job on this! I saw it yesterday and was surprised. The story is very good, but all ignorant people would say "This sucks people can't fly!" to them I say that it is FICTION and that it is. This is not a film about reality, we could say that it is a "fairy tale". It is very pleasant to watch the Asian fairy tale. The image can really blow your mind. Because there is so artistically turned, Ang Lee has a lot of talent (maybe you could not say). The fight scenes are very beautiful and wonderfully brought to the viewer. But it's sad but this movie didn't get the appreciation it should have achieved. But Ang Lee has fortunately gained the attention he deserved with his blockbuster that broke the mountain. So, even for viewers who are not interested in the story, the images are pretty funny!
