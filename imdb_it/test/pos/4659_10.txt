I have no idea what the budget of this film was, but whatever it was, they made it work! I have seen films that spend 100 times the amount (Pearl Harbor anyone?) And I sucked 200 times worse. This film has it all. David "Makin 'It" Naughton in the lead role of Adam, an average college student who is wrapped in a game called Great AllNighter "run by Leon! This guy makes a jump! A" genius "with nothing better to do than hang out with a game designed for a group of people to play, but does not just choose its friends: it has a team of athletes, nerds, fat boys, average children and, of course, the Flounder team who are the "bad guys", this film has no black and white, there are many shades of gray, Adam is not a selfless hero with no flaws, he treats Alex P. like crap, and Flounder is the way he is for his father's pressure and an irritable stomach Athletes play dirty , but everyone else does too! This movie swings! The scene in the PBR factory? Classic! "Johnny's Obese Male Child?" Can you write a better clue? This stuff is gold Jerry! GOLD! Maybe I'm from a different generation, but i love movies that seem far-fetched but that have an still roots in reality. This never happened ... but could ... Eeee e-Gypt .... EEEE .... Easter Bunny .... Easter Parade! Oh, look at a young Paul Rubens who is still working on that Pee wee character. PS that Devra Clinger was / is HOT! She must have been a bad actress who didn't work in Hollywood anymore. SEE THIS FILM!
