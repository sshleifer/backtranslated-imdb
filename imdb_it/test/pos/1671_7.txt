As far as I'm concerned, this film noir has had two totally different things compared to the noir films that I'm used to seeing: 1 - the setting is Paris, France; 2 - there is a scene of 28 minutes without dialogue. <br /> <br /> Both make this film a bit unique, at least for fans of English-speaking film noir. In reality, an American, Jules Dussain, made the film, so it's not entirely a European film. Initially, I was disappointed with this after seeing the first 40 minutes. It's an expensive DVD and I was bored. However, once the silent segment has begun - the real robbery (you already know what it is), the film has grown considerably and has become better and better. <br /> <br /> In fact, I thought the best part of the story was what happened after the robbery. The best aspect of the whole film was the cinematography. This is what makes the record worthy of being owned. It is an excellent film noir photograph and a real travel diary for those of us who have never seen Paris ... and this is Paris in the mid-50s. There are a lot of streets and buildings that are parasitic and depressing, full of rain, which I found fascinating to see. In fact, there were many more of those great shots than those in London in the much better-known movie, The Third Man. <br /> <br /> The leading actor here, Jean Servais, I think his name is, it's also interesting to see. Someone described his face as a cross between Humphrey Bogart and Harry Dean Stanton, and this sums it up perfectly. A warning for those who do not expect swearing or nudity in a classic film. This is France, not the United States, so there's a little bit of both here. I appreciate the DVD which also offers the choice of subtitles or a dubbed version.
