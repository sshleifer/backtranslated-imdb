I took my granddaughter to perform soon and she LOVED me (I enjoyed it too). I don't need to explain the plot, since the film remains completely faithful to the award-winning successful book by the famous author Carl Hiaasen. The film takes the popular book and stratifies it with beautiful film photography (I want to go to Florida now!), Humor (thanks to Funny-Man, Luke Wilson and some newcomers), and Great music! I have to get a Jimmy Buffet CD now! I know a movie is good when I get goose bumps at the end. Overall, it was a great family film that I felt comfortable with my youngest granddaughter. I would recommend it to anyone.
