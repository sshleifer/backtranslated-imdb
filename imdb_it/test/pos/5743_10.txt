Forget Samara / Sadako and Jason ... <br /> <br /> Horror has a new name: GRANNY. The plot is simple but efficient. The actors are good (two thumbs up for "Michelle" and the killer) and the dialog boxes are also pretty smart. From beginning to end, the action will leave you breathless, you can't escape from it ... There is blood, horrible murders, funny moments and a sense of perversion that goes far beyond any rule. "Already seen" ? Definitely NOT: "Granny" is not another slash movie, it really is a classic in its own right ... It deserves the success it has had and there is even more success with its re-release. Congratulations!
