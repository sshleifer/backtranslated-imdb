Well, I have to say that I had the chance to see this show here in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in June 06. And I really liked it. My favorite Madonna look of all time was the era of the 1990 Blond Ambition tour. For me this is "MADONNA" now that it's a 3 year old mother she has to change some things to adapt to motherhood. And I completely agree. This is a classic Madonna concert. I wish "living to tell" had not been changed. We saw the body of the body from the buildings on 911, we can see a woman on a cross ... in any case I can't wait to publish this tour on DVD and I hope it's the whole unpublished show and with a lot of movies bonus. He is an artist of all time. The best out there ... and still at the top and going strong. MADONNA long life!
