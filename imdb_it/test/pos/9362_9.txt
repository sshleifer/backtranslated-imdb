This was a very tough film about anti-Semitism. However, unlike GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT (which also concerns anti-Semitism), the film has aged well and does not seem heavy. In other words, it deals with the subject without appearing to be preaching or trivial by today's standards. <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan plays one of the most vile characters, as he beats a man to death just because he is Jewish. Robert Mitchum plays the investigator trying to get to the bottom of this crime. <br /> <br /> The film's compliments give me its gritty and resolute look at hatred. It is in many ways an example of Film Noir - even if the topic does not concern the usual gangsters or robberies.
