I saw this film for the first time in 1959 at the Hoyts Double Bay cinema in Sydney when I was fifteen. I loved it and I still do it. The ensemble cast is fantastic - in those days the actors played "naturally" and you "felt" for them in their respective roles. A "lucid" film of the period - the relationships in it still relevant to the world today but now the sexes are on the same level, women should not or should not allow the kind of treatment shown in the past. The soundtrack is wonderful and it is a pleasure that Film Score Monthly released the CD in January 2005. The pity scenes were cut before publication - even at two hours you want more! I registered with Amazon for the DVD (now they have a special page). To watch this movie in CinemaScope after forty-six years of pan and scan will be fantastic. Twentieth Century Fox, please look beyond your catalogs of Chinese Film productions from the 1950s: there is a big market out there. I await the arrival of the United States in March 2004, Vanity Fair, a special article on the film, which is said to have fifteen pages with many photos on the set. Greetings.
