There are few movies that have the massive amount of nonstop ninja action like Ninja III: the Domination. This is a story of love, redemption and revenge, however, this is mainly a story about how to browse and kill people for no reason at all. If you are looking for a movie in which a ninja goes crazy and brings all kinds of people into their graves just because he is a ninja and can do it, this is the movie for you. I can't think of any film to compare it with, because no film is fantastic. Wait, oh, have you ever seen the thing with two heads? There is a part in that where the main thing is to get around on a motorcycle and about a million police cars are chasing after them, but they continue to crash and what not. WHY YOU CAN NOT CATCH THE THINGS WITH TWO HEADS !!! Well, this is a bit like Ninja III. I highly recommend this movie especially if you like the following things: Ninja, swords, Lucinda Dickie of Breakin 'and Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo, video games about being a bouncer in a bar, ambiguous and underdeveloped love stories or "good" ninja .
