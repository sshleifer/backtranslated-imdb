This is unfortunately the last HBO concert recorded by Carlin, from a series lasting over 30 years. While this may not be his "best" job, it is excellent, fun and challenging. This recording is also a bit different from most of his other concerts which is a little longer than most of his other concerts. <br /> <br /> During his long, prolific and influential career, Carlin has moved from the most observational humor and fart jokes to a more "humanitarian" view of society and culture. His interest in the English language and euphemisms has increased over the years and culminates in this performance. However, I would say that his audiobook "When Will Jesus will bring pork chops?" shows his great ingenuity with regards to language, euphemisms and the rupture of our values. It's Bad For Ya is quite indicative of his long transformation from comedian to writer. <br /> <br /> If you are offended by vulgar language or contempt of the church, you probably won't like any of Carlin Material's positions. However, if you like to be mentally stimulated and can tolerate language and blasphemy, you will probably enjoy this concert very much.
