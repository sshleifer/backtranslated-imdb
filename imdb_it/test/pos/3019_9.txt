*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** THE CELL / (2000) **** (out of four) <br /> <br /> "You believe there is a part of yourself, deep within your mind, with things you don't want other people to see? During a session when I'm in, I can see those things. "<br /> <br /> --Catherine Deane <br /> <br /> And also we. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, "The Cell" is a love / hate film - either you love it or you hate it. I can understand the reasons why some people don't like this production. With a plot that combines disturbing serial disturbances with mental probes, "The Cell" is too much for some viewers; others will not understand the complex actions and emotions of the film. I think it's one of the most exciting films of the year. <br /> <br /> With his feature film debut, Mark Protosevich creates an imaginative world of rich and colorful images and provocative characters. Filmmakers take advantage of every shot. Protosevich conceived ideas for "The Cell" in 1993 when he decided to combine two of his main interests, mind-probing and serial killer. Reportedly, he was influenced by directors like Wes Craven, George Romero and David Cronenberg. They would probably be proud of such an imagination. <br /> <br /> The film combines two main narratives, one on the scientific exploration of the human mind, and the other on a psychopath that kills young women for their own sexual pleasure. Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), a child therapist, is part of a neurological study at the Campbell Center, a research clinic. Because of his empathic personality, the scientists chose Deane to enter the mind of a catatonic preteen hoping to bring his brain back to life. <br /> <br /> A sick and demented serial killer wanders the streets. Inside an abandoned rural farm, Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) blocks innocent female victims in a large glass cell where he then drowns them and performs sadistic sexual rituals with their bodies. The killer escapes from the FBI every time they approach, until now. A violent attack makes him comatose. The FBI captures his body forever unconscious. Unfortunately, he has already prepared the cell with his latest victim. In forty hours, the cell will be filled with water, and Stargher is the only man who knows the position of his victim. <br /> <br /> The FBI brings this situation to Campbell Center, where Catherine enters Stargher's mind, hoping to find out the location of her latest victim before the cell fills with water, sending the woman to a grave of water. <br /> <br /> The parts of science fiction history were based on both real science and theoretical fiction in the creation of neurological cartography and the synaptic transfer system. The premise takes a long time to develop, but it's worth the wait. It's unlikely, but it doesn't matter. The film makes us believe. Even if you do not suspend disbelief, however, visual attraction offers an engaging environment to enjoy. <br /> <br /> According to the film's production notes, Mark Protosevich was thrilled to work with the director, named Tarsem, because they both think visually. Tarsem Singh is known for his attention to detail, extraordinary artistic direction and highly developed skills to tell a story. "When I wrote 'The Cell'", explains Protosevich, "I surrounded myself with postcards or color copies of paintings or photographs of the painter while I was working, so I'm thinking visually, and Tarsem is a highly visual director, similar frame of visual references which made the collaboration very fluid. "<br /> <br /> Vincent D'Onofrio provides the film with a spine, and no actor could have completed his character. It offers a mysterious, disturbing and engaging performance. "I think my character is somehow trapped in himself," reflects D'Onofrio. He also studied the psychology of serial killers to help him overcome the surface of the character. His preparation for in-depth performance is wonderful. <br /> <br /> While the actors, the writer and the director do miracles with their material, the real honor goes to the talent behind the scenes of the film. Cinematographer Paul Laufer, production designer Tom Foden, costume designer April Napier, special effects coordinator Clay Pinney and visual effects supervisor Kevin Tod Haug. They bring the world of "The Cell" to life. It is an extraordinary world worthy of different visions. Some movies you watch, others you try. "The Cell" falls into the next category. <br /> <br />
