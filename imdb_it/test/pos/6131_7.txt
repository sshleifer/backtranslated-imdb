This is a truly incredible story and the most amazing part of it all is that it REALLY really! In case you haven't noticed: it's based on a true story. <br /> <br /> (Possible spoiler) <br /> <br /> Imagine the shock and horror of discovering that your father was once an official SS in World War II. <br /> <br /> It's a very intriguing story and I'm really surprised that the movie is classified as a bad 5.3 here on imdb.com. <br /> <br /> my vote: 7
