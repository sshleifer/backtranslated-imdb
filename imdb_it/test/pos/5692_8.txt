"Black Water" is one of the most tense films I've seen in a long time. The story moves quickly as it follows three tourists (all great actors) in a swamp on a tour with a butch tour guide on a small boat. Immediately after leaving the anchor in a remote area of ​​the swamp, they are turned upside down by something huge in the water. <br /> <br /> In a hurry, the three manage to make it become a tall tree close when they realize that a crocodile has attacked them. During the next two days, they will desperately try to escape from the evil eye of the crocodile and it does not seem want to go away. The film drags only a tad bit, but what can you expect from the setting and the limited budget? It's much better than "Primeval" and other recent predatory crocodile / underwater thrillers. The tension is heavy and all three branches give exceptional performance. Truly chilling, this film struck me with a deep grief of claustrophobic fear. Apparently based on real events.
