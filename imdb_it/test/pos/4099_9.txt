Really, this movie should be released on DVD. I just received a bootleg copy of what I think was a studio film and I was really happy !!! It was on my list of films to own simply because of the cast. Three of my PEOPLE, Michael York, Olivia Hussey. Both were in Romeo and Juliet and also in Giovanni Gielghud. sorry for the bad syllable, we were there so just for that I thought that for the small expense I was spending it would be fine. The boy was right. I'm not going to give any of this away, you may already know the story anyway, but I'll tell you only if you can get a copy in ANY format ... do it! @ You will not regret . JPC
