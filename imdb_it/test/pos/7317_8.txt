This is one of the first kids, but some people may not be happy with it like everyone else. I found it to be different in some way than your average Stooge slapstick. It was more fun for his jokes than for the glance or slap. Watch for a fun part when Larry takes the stethoscope from Moe and sings it. Moe gives him a nice shot. That part made me collapse for ten minutes. Another success for the Stooges.
