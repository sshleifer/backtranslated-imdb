I played the role of Sam (the goalkeeper, Lou's aide) in the movie "Dead Rail", later broadcast as "Alien Express". And, I must say that I really enjoyed watching this movie. As an actor in difficulty this was a chance for me to work with fantastic people, he gave me great scenes to include on my roller, and allowed me to work on a dream job for a month and a half (without waiting tables! ). (the director) And Steve and Scott (the producers) were very kind giving me this opportunity to participate in the production. I made many friends (Lou, Todd, Steven) and I consider myself very fortunate to have been able to work with these incredibly talented people. It hasn't been a day since my ass got back to me. The real tragedy is not so much the special effects, it is that every single person who watched this film could not see what happened behind the scenes and all the talent that really happened to us. Craftsmen who build the set, stage masters, electricians, wardrobes, make-up artists, script supervisors, filmmakers, production assistants, extras, artisans, producers, directors and actors. It is a fact that the Sci fi has not spent a terrible sum of money on the film (2 million). But there has been a lot of time, energy and human power that has been instilled in it. I look at the film now as a production that brought together many talented people for a fun project that was filmed without complications in less than two months. He was a great cast and crew and I'm so happy to be a part of it! An additional note for those of you who don't know Lou Diamond Phillips, Todd Bridges and Steven Brand. They are fantastic people who are incredibly funny. Lou I'm still working on my impression of Deniro and I can't thank you enough for introducing me to "Midnight Run". Todd, every time I listen to an Elvis song, I can't forget the story you told me about going out with him at his house for dinner. "Can you please give me supporters?" (IM AN ENORM FAN!) Steven, "Mr. Brand!" You are a true gentleman and all the advice and encouragement I received from you will always be appreciated. I miss you guys and I hope you are well. Thanks for the good memories, stories, jokes and friendship. Oh, miss, Utah greets you! wink wink. <br /> <br /> joe-
