Because it's late and I'm running out of vocabulary, I'll describe this film as "beautiful and heartbreaking", begging for the forgiveness of those who shudder on such clich√©s. Robin Tunney does an extraordinary job playing a young woman in Tourette's syndrome - her character was absolutely sincere and convincing, and I will follow her career wherever she goes because of this movie.
