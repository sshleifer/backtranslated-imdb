*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Well, since I'm a big fan of H: LOTS, maybe I liked the movie more than normal. However, this film is still excellent. He had tons of surprises and gave a little more closure to the series. While I was sad that Bayliss turned into a murderer, the general feeling I was feeling was satisfied.
