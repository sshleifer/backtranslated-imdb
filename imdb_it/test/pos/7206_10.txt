This is definitely a movie to "see". The excellent director Alain Chabat (also as Caesar) managed to capture the very essence of the "Adventures of Astérix" (the French comics on which it is based) and to create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy, which is also a tribute to the world of animated films. This film is so funny, so full of jokes (both visual and spoken) that it could take two or three showings before noticing them all, among bursts of laughter. The only drawback is that a non-French audience (or at least a non-French speaking audience) may not get all the "private jokes". There are so many dialogues impossible to translate, so many situations directly related to comics or the French way of life, that the fun could be diminished. However, it is still worth seeing for the beautiful image, the incredible acrobatics, the music, the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting. All the actors are fantastic, but the film wouldn't be the same without Jamel Debouze, Gérard Darmon and Edouard Baer. And please NEVER compare this magnificent film with the terrible precedent based on the same comics: "Astérix et Obélix Contre César" and directed by Claude Zidi.
