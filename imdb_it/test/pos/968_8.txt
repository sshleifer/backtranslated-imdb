Big Fat Liar is a great watch for children of all ages, even for adults. I had a great time watching this movie and recommend it to children aged 10 and under. Laughter never ends and the adventurous plot is also beautiful! Frankie Muniz is fun and Marty Wolfe is hilarious! Overall, a film well made for children to have fun and have fun.
