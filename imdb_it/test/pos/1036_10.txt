Absolutely the best thing I've ever seen on TV. It was both fun and informative. The reason I found this site is an attempt to find out how I can view it again. <br /> <br /> In light of the current understanding of the story we must sympathize with Gen. Leslie Groves who was responsible for the nuts and bolts to manage the Manhattan Project. He was certainly not as paranoid about safety as many have thought in the past. <br /> <br /> The casting for real people portrayed was exceptional. It was the first time I noticed Sam Waterston as an actor. Except for the height, he looked a lot like Robert Oppenheimer. <br /> <br /> The opening scene in which Oppenheimer leads a class of graduate students was particularly intriguing to me.
