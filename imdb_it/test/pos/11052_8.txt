78 years ago ... the premiere of "Anna Christie" publicized by the slogan "Garbo Talks!" The film lasts 16 minutes and the spectators reach the culmination of curiosity: Greta enters the bar and passes through an expected transfer from silence to sound: a few seconds close her silent era and, in the end, Greta Garbo says a historical line: "Give me a whiskey, ginger ale on the side and don't be stingy, baby! " <br /> <br /> "Anna Christie" (1930) is the film by Clarence Brown who introduced a great silent star Greta Garbo in talkies. Nowadays, we can only imagine what a serious transfer it has been for actors and actresses. The careers of many were destined to end - something we hardly or hardly see at the moment. And it was no accident that it was Clarence Brown who directed the first talkie with Swedish beauty. Garbo trusted the director after two of his great silent productions, FLESH AND THE DEVIL (1926) and A WOMAN OF AFFAIRS (1928): films that achieved a resounding success at the box office, both with Garbo in the lead. <br /> <br /> But we are in 2008 and this fact of the film, now purely historical, seems to be of minor importance. The question for today's viewer is not what Garbo's voice looks like, but if the film is still watchable after these 78 years. In other words, we all strive to answer the question of whether the film has passed a test of time. IS? <br /> <br /> When I looked at it recently, I came to the conclusion that, except for some minor technical aspects, including the static camera, "Anna Christie" is still a lot of fun. It is, on the one hand, a wonderful story of a life, of a reality that the young woman faces (being based on Eugene O "the drama of Neill), and, on the other hand, an artistic manifestation of true magnificence in the field of direction and acting I would like to analyze these two aspects in separate paragraphs. <br /> <br /> CONTENT: Chris Christopherson (George F Marion), a heavy drinker, lives a sailor's life, on a barge, they are full of sorrow, it is consoled by a letter from his daughter Anna (Garbo), whom he has not seen for 15 years, he says he will return to him, he starts to change everything to improve, but he forgets that his daughter is no longer an inexperienced child, but a woman 23-year-old who went through various kinds of things on a farm in Minnessota where he lived and worked, and he forgets that he has the right to accept another kind of male love in his life ... This brief presentation of the content not from the perspective of main chara ma what is presented to us before Anna (her father Chris) makes you realize how universal it is. Simply no letter from all the text that life seems to have been deleted after all these years. The cases discussed here in 1930 are still significant and valid ... <br /> <br /> PERFORMANCES. There are not many characters in the film, but there are two that really shine in the roles. It was Greta Garbo herself who did something extraordinary in her fifteen-year-old phenomenon, the presence that strongly marked the history of ancient cinema (something I've already discussed in many of my previous comments on her films). But here, Garbo is slightly different. I admit that there are moments in this film when he doesn't feel very comfortable with his role. This seems to be caused by his new experience with English sound; however, his performance is, as always, genuine and unique. But that's what everyone expected from Garbo. The real surprise of the film for the spectators of the 1930s and also for us is Marie Dressler in the role of Marthy. It is excellent in its facial expressions, in its accent, in the whole portrait of a woman drinking while looking at life from the point of "hitting the bottle". His best moments include a conversation with Anna Christie at the bar preceded by his hilarious speech with Chris. The rest of the supporting cast is nice but not exceptional (here the German version compensates). In particular, Dressler, with the exception of Garbo itself, is an absolutely impeccable choice. <br /> <br /> If you asked me what I like about "Anna Christie" today, that's what I'd like to tell you: it's a classic movie. However, there is still one thing I must mention at the end. It is humor, a wonderful spirit that is evident everywhere. Even if the content is serious enough and "Anna Christie" in no way brings a comic spirit (the only comedy of Garbo was NINOTCHKA), there are times when you divide your sides. Do not skip, for example, Anna and Matt's visit to the amusement park, especially to the restaurant where she orders milk thinking how virtuous and innocent she is, beer for herself and where Marthy suddenly joins by chance ... <br /> <br /> "Anna Christie" is a perfect movie for classic fans and a must-see at least interested in the true magnificence of the performance. If you are tired of many of those modern stars, look for these films and you will be satisfied. Really deserves your research! <br /> <br /> Skaal Greta Garbo! Skaal Marie Dressler! Let's toast to the great work you did in the film! Skaal after all these years when the wine tastes much better and your spirit is with us in another sense ...
