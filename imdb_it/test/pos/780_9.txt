I cannot disagree with a previous comment that "Driving Lessons" is more than a small twee, but one man's accusation is the approval of another, I suppose. In my book this film succeeds in pure fascination, it is no small feat. <br /> <br /> I can't help wishing that the story was a little less conventional given the amount of acting talent in it, but from finishing the plot it still looks like a backdrop for character interactions. Dame Evie by Julie Walters is a glorious actress above the top and above the hill. Although Evie has not had a constant job for years, it is not clear the last time she visited reality, if ever (think of Edina from "AbFab" at 65, at some point she is even forced to come to terms with its kitsch factor). Some may find it annoying, but I think that's the point, to point out how much Ben (Rupert Grint) pushes reserved to force him out of his shell. Ben is equally isolated from reality, living his whole life under the control of his overly dependent mother, to whom Laura Linney can breathe a little life, despite being a one-dimensional character (the old domineering religious mother). I was rather impressed by Rupert Grint that I found a very honest and credible performance (not to mention the dessert like all the coming-out), I can't think of many teenage actors today for whom I can say this. <Br /> <br /> The heart of the film is what happens when the worlds of Ben and Evie collide. In the beginning Ben is understandably hesitant, but also fascinated, since Evie is essentially the exact opposite of everything he has ever known. With the combination of Evie's perseverance and Ben's available nature, a genuine sweetness develops culminating in an unlikely road trip that gives Ben his first real taste of independence. <br /> <br /> The tone is evenly light even through a few short melodramatic fragments, but there was still a surprising amount of emotional resonance, a merit for the main actors. All in all I would say that if you are willing to sit down and let yourself be enchanted by some beautiful performances, "Driving Lessons" should not disappoint. However, if "cute" is not in your movie vocabulary, it is better to stay away. <br /> <br /> Another minor note, the soundtrack presents the music of Sufjan Stevens in the foreground, a nice touch.
