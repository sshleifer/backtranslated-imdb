One of the best sitcoms to shoot on Indian television along with Dekh bhai dekh and Idhar udhar. Great acting, rhythm and an extremely entertaining script have made this series truly memorable. The fun opening montage (sung by none other than the inimitable Kishore Kumar) gave a very precise picture of what could be expected. I borrowed it from my local video library years after Doordarshan stopped transmitting it. I would like Indian television to return to periodicals like these rather than to the asinini saas-bahu and reality television that is all right for these days. Anyone who has found a genuinely good comedy should go and get this series. You could also enjoy a couple of Pakistani sitcoms like ups and downs and aik aur aik that are certainly comparable to the best of India.
