He mentions Bollywood to anyone with a slight familiarity with the genre and the images usually evoked are in bad taste, the most popular musical numbers populated by costumes that make Vegas look like a bastion of conservatism. This perception is not helped by the wave of condescension that permeates most of the films that have come close to Bollywood from the point of view of a stranger. Marigold's romantic comedy by Willard Carroll, however, takes a different note. It is not a glance that winks at those silly people and their antics without fanfare, but a sincere appreciation of Bollywood for its vitality, its lack of irony and self-awareness. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the director has enormous affection and respect for Bollywood, while at the same time he is confused by his kitschier aspects. And if you're familiar with Bollywood, you can appreciate what it does here in making a true hybrid of Bollywood and Hollywood film conventions. From one of the initial shots, a flashback of the character of Salman as a child by the sea, talking to his grandmother (played by Helen!) How many Salman movies begin with this same premise?) The flashback sequence incorporated in the film that Marigold and Prem have filmed, anyone who has seen enough Bollywood movies will recognize these references. Does the story itself incorporate tried and true conventions from both Hollywood and Bollywood? fish out of the water meets the family of duty-at-one-at the expense of personal fulfillment. The structure of the film follows the typical Bollywood plot of the most comic set up of the first half, giving way to a more dramatic resolution than the second. However, in the final analysis, the sensitivity of the film is that of Hollywood, with its sober and sober humor and its history of a woman who learns to believe in herself, to achieve self-assertion. <br /> <br /> You couldn't have a Bollywood-inspired movie if there were no musical numbers and this movie doesn't disappoint with seven of them. Unlike Bollywood, however, the songs don't come out of nowhere and carry their characters in a European venue or a beach in Goa; they exist as musical numbers that are part of the film being made, which recalls how musical numbers were justified in Busby Berkeley's films as part of a theatrical performance. Or do they come out of a situation where music already has a reason to be there? a sexy nightclub scene where Prem teaches Marigold to dance or a beach scene where there are musicians (including a cameo by the playing singer Shaan) who performs. All reflect the emotional state of the protagonists at that point in the film. Music often takes a conventional song from one genre and highlights it on the other. So, in one of the highlights of the movie in which Marigold enters his, is the image of the song quite typical of its genre ?? the female star who sings and dances in a row of women ?? but in this case it is the blond Ali Larter who looks like a real Bollywood movie star, emoticon and lip synchronized to Hindi texts without subtitles. <br /> <br /> Even with Bollywood they are sumptuous visual effects and Marigold perfectly fulfills this aspect thanks to some of the best talents working today in Bollywood. The director of photography is Anil Mehta, who was also the director of photography for Lagaan and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. The choreographer is Vaibhavi Merchant and the production designer is Nitin Desai, both from Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam and Devdas. Can you really see the influence of Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam in this movie ?? in fact, the illuminated floor of one of the numbers was originally by Dholi Taro Dhol, who coincidentally has a Marigold motif incorporated. <br /> <br /> As for the cast, Carroll obviously has a weakness for identifying the acting talent as evidenced by playing from the heart ?? one of the first films for both Angelina Jolie and Ryanne Phillippe. And in this film he again hit the mark with Ali Larter. One of the main reasons why the movie works is because of Larter. It makes a bitchy and unattractive character believable and its subsequent transformation is believable and is intelligent, fun and sexy because it's smart and fun. She and Salman share excellent chemistry and this is one of the film's greatest strengths. Salman Khan plays the role of Prince Charming filtered here through his iconic role of Prem. This is the old school Prem, anyway, so expect a quiet and submissive Salman - those used to him in his usual locker avatar could be disappointed ?? or relieved! It is a sincere and sensitive performance that he spoiled only by a poor statement of his lines in English. <br /> <br /> With a refreshing lack of cynicism and an impassive embrace of romantic love, the film is a love letter to Bollywood and Hollywood of the past.
