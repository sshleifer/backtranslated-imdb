This is a delightful movie. Elizabeth Taylor does a wonderful job, as does Mickey Rooney. The film makes you feel happy. It is inspirational, and although some parts are a bit overly sentimental, this is easily forgiven. I could see this movie again and again. The race at the end is exciting every time I see it. I highly recommend this movie.
