I was browsing through IMDb one day when I came across "The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird". Noting how dark it was, I decided to go in search. Thanks to Digiview, it didn't take me long, so I bought it for a dollar, and when I got home, I looked at it, although I have to say, I was very impressed. <br /> <br /> Three of the paintings in the apartment of a king, a shepherdess, a chimney sweep and a self-portrait of the king (who is just as selfish and sadistic as the real king himself) come to life one night while the king sleeps . The shepherdess and the chimney sweep escape, while the painting of the king calls the police to capture the couple. Fortunately for the couple, Mr. Wonderbird arrives to help them, often mocking the police and the king. <br /> <br /> The back of the DVD case describes this film as "a surreal visual pleasure and an understated voice the history of classical animation". I could not agree more, considering that many backgrounds seem rather bizarre, and many of the characters are strange, including depressed citizens of an underground city and hungry lions who calm down with the music of a blind man (who looks like Andy Warhol ), not to mention the fact that Mr. Wonderbird himself is a bit eccentric. The film is very creative and mostly fun to watch, and its only flaw is that it can be slow moving. But overall, this film was very good and is recommended by the undersigned. <br /> <br /> Rating: B + (Fantastic)
