I have seen thousands of films in my life and I believe that this film is the most "perfect" film ever made. By perfect I mean the narration, the plot, the acting, the staging, the work with the camera, etc. (This is a secular opinion, I have no experience in film production.) Many films have perfect scenes, as the bartender presented a relationship with the police officer in the movie Fargo. (In fact, that scene might sound as good as a short.) In The Dead, every scene is made to perfection, making the whole movie perfect. Perhaps, John Huston sold his soul to the devil to make a film like that. I hope Daniel Webster took him out of the contract!
