In the age of the DVD, you would think you could find almost any piece of shit dedicated to celluloid and, for the most part, it's true. So, WHY, WHY is it so difficult to find this fantastic little film, clearly made by people who love noir as a loving homage (which never goes down to the land of parody) of that film genre. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are a HOOT in this and superstar-in-the-making Carla Gugino (KAREN SISCO, SIN CITY), who makes her hot dog / excellent acting brand. <br /> <br /> This movie really has it all for movie fans. A biro of steroids, the intelligent and moist JUDAS KISS succeeds on all fronts. <br /> <br /> Please, Columbia TriStar PLEASE publish it soon on DVD !!!!!!
