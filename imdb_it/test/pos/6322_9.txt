A variation of the same plot was used in an episode of Simon & Simon (Thin Air) that was originally aired in December 1982. <br /> <br /> The gender of the victim was changed, the surviving spouse is one by Rick's "old flames". It is also interesting to note that Gerald McRaney had a role in this episode of Rockford. <br /> <br /> Both episodes were based on a story by Howard Browne - as shown on the "write credits" list. <br /> <br /> Anthony James plays one of his classic bad boy roles on TV. <br /> <br /> The continuation of the concept between Rockford Files and Magnum PI for Simon & Simon is quite interesting.
