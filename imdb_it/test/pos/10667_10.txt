If you are a film student, either you are, or you are thinking of becoming one, the name Battleship Potemkin has or will have a resonance. Sergei Eistenstein, like other pioneers of silent films such as Griffith (although Eisenstein's innovations are not as common as those of Griffith) and Murnau, had such an impact on the history of cinema, is obviously taken for granted. The reason I raised the students is that at some point, whether you like it or not, your film professor 9 times out of 10 will show the "Odessa Stairs" sequence of this film. It is difficult to say whether it is also the "best" part of the different sequences of the film dealing with the (current) times of the Russian revolution. But it leaves the maximum impact, and you can see it in many films that show suspense, or simply a montage (the Untouchables climax comes to mind). <br /> <br /> Montage, which was not only Eistenstein's skill but also the blood of his life at the beginning of his career, is often abused in current cinema, or if it is not used improperly in a improper context for history. Sometimes the editing is now used as another device to go from point A to point B. The editing was something else for Eisenstein; he was trying to communicate as urgently as possible the urgency, the passion (s) and the final tragedies that were in the Russian people at the time and in the place. Even if you don't see all of Eisenstein's fiction or the ideas of the traditional "history" of having many bases (Kubrick said), there is no denying the power to see ships arriving at the port, people on the stairs, and soldiers they reached them in every direction with guns. Some may find it difficult to believe that this was done in the 1920s; he has that power like the Passion of Joan of Arc to overcome his time and remain important if only in terms of technique and emotion. <br /> <br /> Of course, one could go on for the books (which have been written hundreds of times, no less important than Eisenstein himself). On the film itself, the battleship Potemkin is much more like a dramatized newsreel than a specific movie story. The first segment is also one of the great sequences of the film, as a mutiny is traced against the Captain and other witnesses of a certain ship. This is detailed almost in a manipulative way, but somehow extremely effective; editing is also used here, but with flashes of energy that catch the eye. Other times Eisenstein is happier to let the images speak for themselves, while the soldiers get tired without food and water. He is not one of those directors who will try to put all sides of the story; he is, of course, very Russian in the early 20th century, but he is nothing but honest with the way he sees his themes and his style, and this is what wins in the end. <br /> <br /> Some may want to control it outside of film school, since the "Scale" sequence is like one of those landmarks of a dramatic tragedy on the film, which shows the ugly side of the revolution . Eisenstein may not be one of the most "accessible" silent film directors, but if editing, framing details, non-actors and Bolshevik themes are your cup of tea, it's really one of a life's musts.
