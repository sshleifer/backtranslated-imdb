This is an enchanting and fascinating epic fantasy with a lot of heart. I got lost in this sweet movie by watching it at the Mann's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. It's really romantic with a touching message. The artwork and the effects are visually surprising and the fact that the director is an extraordinary artist is so obvious. Frames are like looking at art in motion. He also has a cast of strong and talented actors. What a wonderful surprise to see Joss Ackland, he is just a perfect fairy tale king. Sarah Douglas is as fantastic as the bad one and Christine Taylor and Tom Schultz are a lovely and romantic couple. The fact that the film was made on a ridiculously ridiculous movie budget just caught me off guard. It may not be the crude Hollywood stuff we're drowning in, but it's a really nice movie to rent and have fun curled up on your couch on a rainy Saturday. Don't forget the microwave popcorn. This is my advice Enjoy.
