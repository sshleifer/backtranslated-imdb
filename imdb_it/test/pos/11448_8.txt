The eighties produced a lot of little bloody horror films, most of them in the slasher submarine, putting this film at the head of most of the rest of its kind. Night of the Demons is a sort of cross between the last gore movie, The Evil Dead; and the haunted house-cum-slash night. Movies like this are usually characterized by a deranged / deformed madman as the bad protagonist; but here we have bloodthirsty demons, which is always more interesting than a fool if you ask me. There is also a lot of comedy in this film, and the first third of the film could easily be the set for a direct comedy. But once the characters enter the central position; a sinister funeral known as 'Hull House' - the film turns into a horror movie you'd expect given the title. The plot is as simple as you'd expect, and we follow a group of children who decide to organize a Halloween party inside the funeral home. This turns out to be a bad idea, however, once it is discovered that the house is owned; and the demons begin to inhabit the bodies of children! Their only salvation is on the other side of the underground flow ... but finding the gate for the reasons is not as easy as it seems. <br /> <br /> The focus of the film is the Gothic residence where the action takes place. This squeaky old house is a great location for horror movies; the fact that it was a funeral home only increases. Director Kevin Tenney shoots well at home, and a particularly good job is to establish the fact that the house is in the middle of nowhere and escape is difficult. The comedy at the beginning of the film is generally very funny, and I was hoping that it would continue to laugh once the horror began. The film has its comic moments when children enter Hull House, but it's never overly funny and it's obvious that the main focus of the film is horror. Not that this is a problem; but the Night of the Demons could have been much better if he had fused these elements well. The characters are pretty much what you'd expect from this type of film; but the acting adapts well to the film, and it's clear that the young cast had fun making this film and it turned out well on the screen. The effects are good in that they adapt well to the film, and since most death sequences are well executed; It is a good bet that many people will not be bored watching this. This is not a classic or must see a movie; but I highly recommend it because it offers a good time and will appeal to fans of foolish horror fodder.
