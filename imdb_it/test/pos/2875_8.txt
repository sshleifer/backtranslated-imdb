Well, I'm a few days late but what the hell ....! However, the word that best describes my reaction to "See no evil" was .... SURPRISE. The film is actually pretty good. There is certainly a great deal of blood, blood and action in the film with a modest amount of suspense. Awakens the good times of the music of the late 70s and early 80s. Think "Madman" meets Leatherface with a touch of Norman Bates and you'll get a good feeling for this movie. While SNE is skinny on the plot (most horror movies are), it's a way to compensate for the violence / killing methods, gore, suspense and the fact that Kane does a great job playing the extremely disturbed Jacob Goodnight . The title of the film derives from the fact that Jacob catches the eyes of his victims using only his fingers and keeps them in large vases. Why?? You will only have to look at it and see (pun intended). There are some cinematic elements raised by other horror films like Psycho, TCM and Madman, but they are not shameless. Finally, SNE does not enter a territory that we have never seen before and is granted, SNE is not "Pyscho" or "TCM 74", but certainly deserves an imo look. <br /> <br /> BloodStone recommendation: Take a test of the "See No Evil" matinee Bloodstone rating: 7.5 / 10
