I really like this movie. I like it not only because it's a great movie from the 80s with a GREAT soundtrack, but I discovered that it has some stimulating moments. They are just moments; not the whole movie. It's definitely not like "Less than Zero". <br /> <br /> The scenes deal with the typical peer pressure and also with more difficult problems, such as the betrayal of trust. These problems are not easily solved or forgotten by the characters. Some scenes will stand out and invite you to reflect on your teenage experiences and how those experiences may have influenced your adult character and vision. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie and think about the problems young adults face and your experiences. Or you can simply pay attention in search of the boys to lose themselves! :) In any case it's a good movie.
