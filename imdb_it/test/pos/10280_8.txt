Not all movies should have that predictable ending that we're all used to, and it's nice to see movies with really unusual twists. However with that said, I was really disappointed in the end of the apartment. In my opinion the ending didn't fit perfectly with the rest of the film and basically destroyed the story being told. <br /> <br /> Spend the whole movie discovering everyone and their feelings but the events in the last 2 minutes of the film would have had a greater impact on all the characters, but the film ends and leaves everything too open . <br /> <br /> Overall, however, this film was very well made, and unlike similar films like Serendipity all the scenes were believable and did not go beyond the lines.
