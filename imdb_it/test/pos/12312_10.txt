This is really the only chance to see the magic of James Joyce's writing brought back to life. His novels are all irreproducible (in every real sense) and this is the only long story he has written. It was the last John Huston film and did not reach the screen until after his death, and it is easy to see his touch of grandeur. The Dead is poetic in its on-screen approach, telling us more about Ireland than any modern IRA movie and "problems" could never hope to tell us. We hope that more people will watch this film and experience the best of John Huston and James Joyce, and maybe they will visit this story in your local bookstore (and find that it's probably the biggest story ever put on paper).
