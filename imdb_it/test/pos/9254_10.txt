HLOTS was an exceptional series, it is the one that NYPD Blue will never be, on HLOTS the plots are real, the dialogue is real, the relationships are real. With HLOTS back as a movie, tying each other together, it was nice to have the whole band together again, even some who disappeared are revealed (I don't say how) The plot was fast, emotional and full of spirit the series had a week week. Homicide, Life on the Streets, Network drama at its best !!!! 5 STARS!!!! Thumb up and everything else. Thanks NBC for giving us the Finally we didn't get it!
