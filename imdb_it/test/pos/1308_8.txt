This film is titled "Junior Pilot" here on IMDb but "Final Approach" on Netflix. Go figure it out! The film is a pleasure both for the young audience of reference and for adults who can suspend maturity long enough to watch this film through the eyes of their own youth. For the adult, the story is quite predictable, and perhaps banal and melodramatic; whereas history may seem new and creative to young people who have not yet seen or read many films or books with such a plot. <br /> <br /> In any case, the credit must be given to the creators of the film, in particular director James Becket and director of photography Denis Maloney, for having made this film very funny and visually interesting. The young protagonist's segments Ricky's imaginative thoughts are hilarious and pleasantly filmed. <br /> <br /> The young actors give uniformly credible shows, seemingly enough invested in their roles - as silly as many scenes are. Jordan Garrett plays the protagonist "Ricky" quite well, with an excellent photographic presence. Jeffrey Tedmori creates a deliciously soft and sensitive "Shashi" that thrives on spicy sauce of all the ridiculous things. Even Skyler Samuels and Adam Cagley give solid interpretations. <br /> <br /> As is typical of his always excellent acting, Larry Miller creates a solid parental figure around which revolves the part-real, part-fantasy world of children. Compared to the paternal figure, the other important roles for adults seem to be superficial and one-dimensional, intentionally and quite humorously so, to be sure. <br /> <br /> This film is a simple story aimed at young people, of course, but it is quite funny, perhaps more often for the crowd of young people, but also for at least a vision by adults who keep the ability to watch a film of this kind from their once young perspective.
