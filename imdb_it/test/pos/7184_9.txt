I was a little scared when I went to the cinema to watch this movie. In fact, it's always difficult to make a comic book movie and the first episode of the adventures of the two most famous heroes of France was good but not fantastic. Finally, it is very funny from start to finish with unexpected gags, some cartoon scenes, no timeouts, fantastic special effects, an exceptional cast, fantastic landscapes, great everything !!! <br /> <br /> However, I wonder how they will be able to translate all the French names into English or German, because it is certainly fun in French, but how will it be in another language ???
