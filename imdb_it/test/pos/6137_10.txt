I agree with many of the other reviewers here. This was a great film and an even better novel by Robert Fish. Unfortunately, I believe the author died before he could see this film made. The performances are all of the highest level, with the three principles (John Glover, Ben Cross and Veronica Hamel) apparently made for their roles. The exteriors, both in Europe and in Israel, seem very authentic and the 4-hour miniseries was perfect for telling this story. Fortunately, I recorded it on tape when it was on television and I enjoyed watching it since. I can say without hesitation that it holds up today. I gave a rating of 10. If you haven't read the book, you should really find a copy. This would be an exceptional film to be released on DVD with extras that could easily include interviews from the cast.
