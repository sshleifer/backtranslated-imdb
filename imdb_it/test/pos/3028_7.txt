Style over substance. But what style it is. "The Cell" is the internal version of most serial killer movies. Unfortunately, the story doesn't support graphics much. Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) enters her patients' dreams through artificial means to discover them and help them overcome their phobias and obsessions. A new patient, fallen into a coma, is brought to his attention by the FBI. He is a serial killer who drowns his female victims and places their bodies in grotesque scenes like mannequins. Deane must enter the mind of the murderer and navigate through his sick fantasies to find and save his latest victim. <br /> <br /> Director Tarsem Singh has incredible visions and pieces for this production. Each sequence of dreams is like a nightmare painting in motion, from landscapes to costumes. <br /> <br /> But the plot suffers from the lack of history of its characters. Stargher is the only person with a deep background and he is the last person you care about. Without him, basically you have a movie that moves only in the present time, which is a shame as the film is so visually stunning and really scary. Lopez is wasted, but she is not an exceptional actress, even though she is wonderful as always. And Vince Vaughn? I don't even know why he was chosen. This is not his forte and he exaggerates. He tried too hard to become his character and proved it. Attack the comedy, Vince! Even so, this film is so visually terrifying, I still watch this movie with the lights on and I can never fall asleep right away.
