To tell the truth, I went to see this movie just because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. People might disagree, but it does equally well in bad and good movies. I never saw a movie with Penelope Crus, so I was anxious to see if she was a good actress. So here's what I think: <br /> <br /> The film is good (I haven't read the novel, anyway). Some moments were really exciting and ... unexpected. Overall you will find the plot quite simple. So the only thing that could save the film, which (an experienced spectator will know that from the beginning) would have ended tragically or happily, was the performance of both Cage and Crus. And it was FANTASTIC, GREAT, GREAT !!! In the last part of the film I also liked a rather broad accent of the actress (Spanish, but for those who do not speak Greek it is fine, and even looks like a Greek girl). Overall the film is a lot of fun and has a good dose of irony (classical music fans will surely have fun in some moments :) <br /> <br /> I give them 9/10. You should see it!
