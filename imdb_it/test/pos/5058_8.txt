When I went to see Rendition, I was expecting an exciting film on a controversial topic with famous actors. I didn't expect a film so compelling, exciting, poetic and sad that it took me right away and didn't let me go, even after leaving the theater. A suggestion to those who have not yet seen it, do not let your politics intrude on the enjoyment (or not on the enjoyment) of this film. Take it for what it is. I saw it with my conservative Jewish family (I'm the black sheep, the pseudo-liberal university student) and I thought they would write it as "liberal propaganda". Instead, they said it was a great movie with excellent performances (they like to fantasize film critics). <br /> <br /> It's sad that a film like this should be marketed by its Oscar-affiliated actors, while leaving the ever-underestimated Sarsgaard and new talents like the truly excellent Metwally. The entire cast gave good performances, with some that stand out much more than others; my only problem was that there was a lot of things that didn't allow much screen time for each of the characters. In fact, I felt that the "sub plot" with Fatima and Khalid was equally important on the screen as part of Anwar's story. <br /> <br /> The characters all have the potential to fall into stereotypes, but the actors do a pretty good job of giving them depth with the screen time they have. Streep is really terrifying, like a heartless senator, and as much as I don't want to see the actress in such a terrible role it's impossible not to believe her. Gyllenhaal, who will probably be one of the Oscars for this film, sometimes seems a little insecure in his role. He's trying to portray his inner conflict, but he usually comes off as if he had forgotten his lines or didn't know how he should feel. Sarsgaard gave an excellent performance; his unforgettable confrontation with Streep is easily one of the best parts of the film. Metwally, once again, was fantastic, and I hope to see it in more mainstream films. Too bad Gyllenhaal was named before him. Yigal Naor, as shown on IMDb, has already been some movies but it is a newcomer to my eyes. He, along with Mohammed Khouas and Zineb Oukach, gave great shows. <br /> <br /> The story of Fatima and Khalid has had no credit in the commercials, but brings a sad humanity to the story. The narrative was interesting because I was trying to really connect the two stories until it was clearly told to us in the end. I read some comments here that say the love story was useless, but I disagree. I think it certainly shows another aspect of the controversial problem and of humanity in general. Khalid was the real terrorist, but he was doing it to avenge his brother, and even if he is responsible for the attack, you see a human side for him through the story with Fatima. I don't think we should feel bad for the real terrorists, but I think the "we are all people" issue was very relevant. <br /> <br /> Whatever your feelings about terrorism, politics, etc. Theater. The bottom line is this is an interesting story with a message that we all need to hear.
