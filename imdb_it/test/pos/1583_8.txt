I recently saw episodes 1-4 and now I can't wait for 5 and 6 to be available! (I hear they're coming soon.) Commander's Log looks set to become a cult among the university crowd and everyone else with a taste for extravagant comedy. It's obvious that the budget was small, but the focus on creating the script is pretty obvious. In fact, the simplicity of the show allowed me to better appreciate writing and acting. Bowlsby is a master of put-down ... I would just like to mention all the best for future use on unsuspecting collaborators! Let's just say that if you don't like the Commander log, I will personally provide for your underwear to have extra starch!
