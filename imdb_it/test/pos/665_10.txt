It's the 80s and teenagers are ready to party in a terrifying old house that is said to be haunted by the ghost of Murder McGee. After mistakenly summoning the dead through an incomplete conversation on an Ouija board, the children are forced to fight to the death by fighting a vengeful ghost that possesses and kills all their friends one by one. Does it sound familiar? It should. It is clearly publicized to pay tribute to the classic 80s with the slogan: "Excessive violence, free nudity, zero budget". <br /> <br /> I can't get enough; It's pure fun! I liked the humor and the way it was fun for all the horror clich√©s, but at the same time embraced what was fun for the movies of that period. There is something you get with this movie you never had with the old slasher movies of the 80s: good acting. The whole cast was very talented and you don't see it much in low budget movies, recent or not. There was a lot of chemistry between the characters. I was very amused throughout the film, and I am fully convinced that the writer / director and the cast will go a long way in their separate careers. The script was very well written, and the dialogue flowed naturally. <br /> <br /> The effects were a bit amateurish and the scenes were not well lit, but the fact that this film admitted on the cover was basically NO BUDGET, I already know. This film makes it easy to politely ignore its flaws and simply sit back and have fun. Even if it is not an Oscar winning work, it never claims to be and to propose itself. Is very funny. If you like slashers, you will really appreciate this movie. If you like blood and tits, you will also appreciate it.
