The first time I saw this DVD, I was not only happy that it was the first time in decades that the band was playing something, but also because the DVD itself is extremely noisy. Jimmy Page obviously can't live with quiet music, I guess. I have to say though that during the concert at the Royal Albert Hall, they extended "How many more times" and "Moby Dick" too long. Other than that, it was delicious. My favorite song of all time is now on that DVD. Trampled. It is either that or 'In my moment of dying'. In that song, Jimmy really plays that thing. Have you ever seen Randy Rhoads play? Well, Jimmy plays just like him, except his guitar is lower.
