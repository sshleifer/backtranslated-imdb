Pavarotti and the entire cast are exceptional in this beautiful work by Giuseppe Verdi, the most refined composer of works in the world. The soprano coloratura is particularly spectacular with its perfect height. The main role is well represented and well sung. The entire production is as perfect as one might expect. <br /> <br /> A cinematic masterpiece! <br /> <br />
