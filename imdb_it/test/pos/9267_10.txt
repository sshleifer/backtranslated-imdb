The Closer She Gets ... is an artistic documentary about the death of a person I really knew. It allows you to take a look at the private moments of the family involved in the most challenging moment of their lives. Parents tend to support their children's work, in this case the subject of the documentary went much further. She was willing to share her death experience as an act of love for her son. It is a very touching work of art, which weaves together the most serious, serene and light sides of life for this family. The story is one that can make people laugh, but also cry while facing issues that we all have to face. I highly recommend this documentary to those who are not afraid to cry and are willing to tackle the problem of mortality in a very human way. This film will touch you.
