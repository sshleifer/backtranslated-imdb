There are many familiar Hitchcock elements (from previous and subsequent films) and this time they mix with a piece of cheerful entertainment, but hardly suspense. You can say that Dorothy Parker had a hand in the script, the most memorable scenes are the dialogues of the hero Cummings with the blind and his encounter with a rather bizarre group of circus people. The famous climax on the Statue of Liberty seems a bit heavy - judged by today's standards, but also compared to other endings of the Hitch monument (eg Blackmail, North by Northwest).
