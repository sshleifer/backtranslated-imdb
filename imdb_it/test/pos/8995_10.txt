My family really enjoyed this movie. As for what this film will do for Rugby in the United States ... well, I'm sure it will be debatable. But as for me and the others around me, I know we were more curious about the sport after seeing the movie and personally I earned more respect for the game. You might ask yourself how it is possible, especially because the film does not dive and explains Rugby. But the simple fact is that it has attracted players and the emotions of play and life. The film was inspiring and fun. It made us laugh and cry. The chemistry between Sean Astin, Big Budah and Sean Faris worked well. Some might think that the film is a bit cliché, but I would seriously like Hollywood to make more movies like this. I couldn't help but draw the analogies of the game and the difficulties of life. Eventually I found myself examining my life to see what I had to do better, to be the best person I could be. Honestly, I was glad this film taught morals, values ​​and teamwork, there is so much to say in reverse. After seeing this, I really hope my children are educated by someone who has a philosophy like Coach Gelwix.
