having never seen anything of this beloved of luvvies, not to mention a Venetian merchant production, I cannot comment on how faithful he is to the previous adaptations of the drama, so I will treat him as another film that tries to be more than novocaine for the eye MoV is an instantly engaging film about a young lover bassanio (fiennes) and his friend merchant antonio (irons) and a jew lender of money shylock (pacino) <br /> <br /> summary of the plot <br /> < br /> bassiano is broke and needs money to court the adorable portia (collins), goes to his friend antonio, who enjoys his difficult situation, so he borrows some shylock money <br /> <br /> now antonio no like the Jews in general and shylock in particular and bitter and twisted shylock from the abuse he suffered from antonio in particular and Christians in general undertakes to lend money to antonio on condition that if antonio did not repay the loan within the agreed deadline, shylock cut a pound of meat from antonio corpo <br /> <br /> comment <br /> <br /> the film is incredibly beautiful and played and spoken in such a way as to force you to think about what each riga, this in turn means that the viewer makes me understand the characters and their motivations <br /> <br /> it seems to me a film about the choices shylock makes, and about how the wrong choices lead to the ruin of the shylock < br /> <br /> shylock moment demands that his pound of flesh be condemned, because the rest of the world is against him and connives to provoke his fall <br /> <br /> this has disturbed me a lot, normally in a movie when a victim has a chance of revenge against those who hurt him or the victim succeeds or causes the villain to see the error of his ways leading to a big hug <br /> <br /> not in MoV the victim quickly becomes the villain and is stripped of his fortune and faith <br /> <br /> This film is a powerful and subtle portrayal of casual anti-Semitism that shows how an entire society can turn into a minority and make it look like the victim is really the perpetrator. <br /> <br /> has me blown away with this movie 10/10
