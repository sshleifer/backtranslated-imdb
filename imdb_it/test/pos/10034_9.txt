It is true that "They died with their boots" provides a highly fictionalized account of the life and career of George Armstrong Custer (Errol Flynn), but remarkable, especially with regard to the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Because it is not taken for granted that a 1941 film tries to portray both the American-American cavalryman and the head of the Native Americans Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) in a favorable light. I am almost tempted to say that "Little Big Man" in his unskilled anti-Custer position seems unbalanced by the confrontation. Also, shouldn't you be deceived by the title of the photo ?? this is not just a film about the Battle of the Little Big Horn, it is a film about it that shows the unreliable West Point cadet, the famous Civil War hero, the Indian fighter and, last but not least, her husband. /> <br /> The film begins with Custer's time at the West Point military academy, where his recalcitrant and unruly behavior leads to frequent demerits. During a punitive military exercise, he meets his future wife, Elizabeth Bacon (Olivia de Havilland), who, like Custer himself, is originally from Monroe, Michigan. Custer intends to court her, but the outbreak of the Civil War calls him. Custer's legendary courage is shown in a sequence of battle scenes, the largest of which is dedicated to his engagement with the legendary general of the Southern cavalry Jeb Stuart during the Battle of Gettysburg. While on leave, he went to Monroe and courted Elizabeth, who promised him his hand in marriage. Immediately after the war, Custer and Elizabeth Bacon are married. <br /> <br /> With the civil war over, Custer is demoted, does not get a real command and must go through the slow and slow process of promotion in the small professional American army. While starting to drink, his wife intervenes on his behalf with former general Winfield Scott. Custer is given the command of the 7th Cavalry of the United States, which trains to become an elite unit. Neither Custer nor Crazy Horse are eager to fight, but greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians decide to build a railroad through Indian lands in clear violation of previous treaties. Custer explicitly recognizes the justice of the Crazy Horse cause, but rides in battle to do his duty as a soldier, exposing the conspiracy of interests in a letter he writes on the eve of the battle. <br /> <br /> Dead with their boots ", although short for historical accuracy, it is as good as a war movie and a western in the 1940s: both Custer and Crazy Horse are played by leading actors, nor the Neither the Indians nor the Southern Confederacy are disparaged, and the courtship scenes with the beautiful Livvy de Havilland are simply enchanting.The only negative sign, and that is why I cannot give this photo a total of 10, is the underground current of the racism in the representation of African-American servants; Elizabeth's servant, Callie, is the stereotypical, overweight, good-natured, superstitious black udder. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting that the film has no faults with both Custer and Crazy Horse, but with the greed of the railroad companies pressurize Washington politicians with semi-criminal methods to break the assurances they had given to Native Americans Only a couple of years later, the insinuation that entrepreneurs Americans might even think that doing something remotely questionable would probably have been taken as a clue that the directors were communist sympathizers. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, "Their Dead in their boots" omits the fact that Custer's overly aggressive tactics often border on the insane, greatly enhances the importance of his engagement with Stuart, and does not mention the lack of reconnaissance before the Battle of the Little Great Horn. However, Custer was seen as a war hero by his contemporaries and had some spectacular exploits to point to in the Battles of Brandy Station, Gettysburg, Trevilian Station and others, even though his exploits of arms were not as decisive for the Civil War as "They" Died with Their Boots On "suggests. <br /> <br /> In any case," Theyed With Their Boots On "is a war movie well done with western elements, three exceptional artists (Flynn, Quinn and de Havilland), and offers a positive view of Native Americans as well as a negative about big money, which would not be seen in major Hollywood productions in the decades to come.It would deserve a 10 if it weren't for the racist raking of African Americans.
