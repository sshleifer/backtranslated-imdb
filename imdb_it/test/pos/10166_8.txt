"The Man Who Knew Too Much" (1955) is Alfred Hitchcock's remake of his 1934 thriller about a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) on holiday in Morocco where they were involved in a nightmare that includes murder, espionage, murders and the worst of all, the kidnapping of their 10-year-old son. The movie that Hitchcock considered superior to the original is great fun. Stewart and Day have good chemistry together. The film is full of wonderful comic scenes and dialogues and scenes of chilling suspense. <br /> <br /> The inclusion of "Que Sera, Sera" turned out to be a stroke of genius because the song rarely fits the content and plays such an important role in the film as "Que Sera, Sera" did in "The man who knew too much". <br /> <br /> Hitchcock also treats us about the live music played by "Storm Cloud Cantata" by Arthur Benjamin for almost ten minutes while you play in the Royal Albert Hall in London where the assassination of a very important politician was attempted and both, the scene and the cantata are simply wonderful.
