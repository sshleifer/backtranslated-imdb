Flash Gordon was a first-rate serial. I know there were some tricks, however, I didn't look at it for the flaws. Buster Crabbe is Flash Gordon. He was not a trained actor, but he gave a very good and convincing performance. Jean Rogers is nice and at 20 years old. old, in my opinion, a good job. Charles Middleton as emperor Ming, is superb. He was in many other films, quite versatile, he could sing and dance. His interpretation of "Ming The Merciless", in all three of Flash Gordon's periodicals, was first rate. The rest of the cast also did a great job. Well, boys and girls, take some popcorn, rest and have fun. John R. Tracy.
