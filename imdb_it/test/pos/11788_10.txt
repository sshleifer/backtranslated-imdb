Aah yes, the training show was great. Not only did many women get in shape, but many teenagers also got a good workout. I am not saying that the show was in no way appropriate for family viewing, but if you control the other works of the producer of the shows, you will find more themes for adults in his works, which are also excellent. Many of the spectators were looking forward to the show, men and women all got good information and a splendid exit from training. The girls were perfect, and Bella, the show is a classic and should do well in syndication. The show should still be active, as there are never enough choices to display when it comes to health and beauty.
