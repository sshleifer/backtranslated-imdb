The film, although not faithful to the original novels, manages to create a modern vision of the Gothic vampire. Someone tried to insult QotD by calling it a 1.5 hour video clip. It is actually a complement. The ever-present gothic music combined with music video shots made the film so moody - and "Queen of the Damned" is a mood-inspired story. <br /> <br /> I don't understand die-hard fans who complain about changes in the story. The plot has been modified to be less confusing for viewers who do not know the novels. The number of characters has been reduced and I have no problem changing the producer of Lestat or skipping the character of Mekare. The biggest change - the love story of Lestat and Jesse - seemed very nice to me. <br /> <br /> Actually, I think a faithful adaptation would be a complete failure. The slow and gloomy mood, perfect for 19th-century New Orleans and Louis's distress, did not correspond to Lestat's rebellion and his music. And while the book can be slow, descriptive and combining multiple elements and conveying them well, the film simply cannot do it without becoming chaotic. "Vampire Lestat" and "Queen of the Damned" can be divided into at least three films - the creators had to choose something. <br /> <br /> Some of the special effects, like flying or getting out of the fire were the only thing I didn't really like in this movie. But the death of Akasha was very beautiful. The cast was good, Stuard Townsend was as convincing as Lestat, especially in the concert, but I preferred Banderas as Armand. I love Jesse, Maharet and Marius. And of course Aaliyah was perfect with her almost ancient Egyptian accent. <br /> <br /> So if you like gothic music and vampire dillemies of loneliness and eternity (and don't consider books as cinematic scenarios) "Queen of the Damned" is one of the few films that show vampires like something more than just blood-sucking. But please don't compare it with the movie "Interview". It has a completely different style, just as different as Louis and Lestat were different. Personally I find it thrilling to first see the existence of a vampire from the point of view of Louis's "bottle in bottle", and then move on to one lacking any moral but surprisingly extroverted for a vampire, Lestat. <br /> <br /> I give "Queen" 8 out of 10 as it had some technical flaws, but I decided to give it 9 as it is very undervalued by those who hate it simply because it doesn't match their view of the books, which can be clearly seen by looking at the distribution of votes.
