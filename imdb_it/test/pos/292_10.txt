This is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world. The social critique of our superficial and commercially oriented values ​​is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the "war is infernal" cliché, underlined by a mythical journey to Cambodia by a captain of special forces whose mission eliminate (with extreme prejudice) a rebel colonel, who left behind the concepts of justice of the army to create his own world. When I saw Apocalypse Now in 1980, I thought it was a deeply imperfect masterpiece. In particular, I found the last segment of the journey with Brando, which encapsulates Conrad's Heart of Darkness, to be rather boring. Finally I had the opportunity to see Apocalypse Now Redux and the flaws have been fixed. Redux makes the film an absolute masterpiece, certainly among the 100 best films ever made. Brando's performance now seems complete and complete, perhaps a little less mysterious, but much deeper. Martin Sheen is brilliant in the heart of one of the best acting groups ever assembled. It's nice to see a young Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn, etc. In the first screen representations that suggest which good actors will eventually be recognized. The work of Robert Duvall, Fred Forrest, Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Bottoms is greatly enhanced by the additional movie. If you've never seen this movie, skip the original and go straight for Redux. I wish I could get a Gangs of New York Redux from Scorcese to fill all the gaps in that deeply flawed potential masterpiece.
