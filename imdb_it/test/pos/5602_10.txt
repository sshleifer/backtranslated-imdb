Hal Hartley has been compared to a modern William Shakespeare, in virtue of the fact that he gets his actors to deliver their lines in an iambic pentameter. Surely he knows how to assemble a cast and once again Martin Donovan is sensational, while Thomas Jay Ryan plays his role with an intensity that is unforgettable. Even if the film lasts only 1 hour, the period of time works wonderfully and keeps the audience in a fast race until the end. No doubt Hal Hartley is one of the best directors to come out of America in the last 20 years, with a unique, fun and exciting vision.
