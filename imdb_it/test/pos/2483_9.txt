This extraordinary pseudo-documentary, made in 1971, perfectly captures the spirit of the time in America ... which makes it even more frightening and relevant. "subversives" (university students, hippies, black activists, academics) are collected by the government and sentenced to long prison terms for the amount of thought crimes and social protest. As an alternative to life in prison, these "convicted criminals" are offered three days in "Punishment Park". Their goal within the park is to make their way to the American flag where freedom awaits them. Not surprisingly, the Punishment Park option is a dirty lie. This brilliant Peter Watkins film is even pre-dated "Battle Royale" and "Series 7", although its angle of attack is more obviously political. Shot in '71, it looks and feels as fresh as anything made today. The performances are exemplary and the direction is extremely precise. The story winds back and forth between various groups trying to survive the harsh conditions of the park and the McCarthy-like trials that condemned them. Today, this film still retains its power. In '71, there was nothing but nothing quite like it. This is a masterpiece that succeeds on a dozen levels. He has the balls that most people today have lost.
