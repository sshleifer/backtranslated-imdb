I was reticent to see this film before reading the external reviews and user comments posted here. Why? First of all because the humor of Mick Malloy can (in my humble opinion) be rather gross and exaggerated, evidenced by his sick comic of a television series a few years ago. And secondly, why good Australian comedy films are as infamous as Tassie Tiger. <br /> <br /> Sensibly Mick has retained his natural comic exuberance in this surprisingly watchable movie. Who would have thought that a bowling club would provide the setting for one of the most entertaining Australian films of recent years. The cast is excellent with old local music players, all engaged in credible shows. <br /> <br /> Interesting to see John Clarke play the villain in this piece. It's a one-dimensional part, but JC still adds a touch of class, as always. It's nice to see Judith Lucy even have a Guernsey or I would have seen the bowls uniforms on the big screen. It's a real talent, too bad that some of his answers were curses. His material is much more cheerful. Interesting character though. Bowls reporter on a local rag. How low on the journalist's food chain can be obtained !! <br /> <br /> Crackerjack may not be the funniest movie I've seen this year but it's definitely a fun diversion, it's worth a look. Many other people obviously agree with me because it is this year's main Australian film. It's nice to see someone finally make a bizarre and kind comedy without trying to mimic laughter like so many Australian comedies before him. <br /> <br /> Finally a little curiosity. If you are wondering which Aussie Rules team Mick supports check the flag on his workstation. He also looks for his old crime buddy, Tony Martin who makes the announcement in the final boules scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
