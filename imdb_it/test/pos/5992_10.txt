Romuald et Juliette is one of those romantic French comedies in which they seem to break all the rules, just like Trop Belle Pour Toi. The splendid Daniel Auteuil learns true loyalty and love when his life threatens to crash into his ears. The film is not a story about morality, but a wonderful story that will keep you glued to the last. Firmine Richard (like Juliette) is a heroine that women will rejoice: her laugh is my constant reminder of this hot and witty film. The simple way he has to include all his children from their different fathers - especially birthdays - gives the film an advantage that elevates it above your average romantic comedy. But it is always the French who seems to show us how simple this is!
