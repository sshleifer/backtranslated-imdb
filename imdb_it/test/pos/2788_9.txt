As a former Erasmus student, I really enjoyed this film. It was so realistic and fun. He really grasped the spirit that exists among Erasmus students. I hope that many other students will also follow this experience. However, I wonder if this film is so interesting to watch for people with no international experience. But at least one of my friends who never attended Erasmus really liked me. I give it 9 out of 10.
