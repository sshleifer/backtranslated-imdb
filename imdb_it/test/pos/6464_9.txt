This is an excellent film that deals with the issue of racism in a delicate and balanced way. Great performances in the round but absolutely exceptional Sidney Poitier acting. <br /> <br /> Makes this film alive and breathable. His portrait of a boy who fights against discrimination and violence is simply amazing. His acting is strong, delicate and subtle at the same time. Really worthy of an Oscar, Poitier had to wait (due to the color of his skin) for many years before the brilliance of his acting was recognized by the Academy. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes also turns into a great show, withdrawn, upset and realistic as it has become its hallmark. He and Poitier inimitable contrast the forces of cowardice, courage and human transformation through friendship. <br /> <br /> The film is both entertaining and deeply haunting in its portrayal of racism in the United States. The irony is that it somehow reflects the realities under which Poitier had to work.
