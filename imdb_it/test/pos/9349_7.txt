I've seen this movie more than once. It's not the biggest movie I've ever seen, but it's not a bad movie. The acting is good and the characters are more "real" than many in low budget science fiction. (At least he's not full of stupid bimbos like so many other low-budget scifi.) I especially like Elizabeth Pena. She is a good actress and she is worried single mother as well as any and better than some. <br /> <br /> Don't let the nerd sayers discourage you. Watch it for yourself and judge for yourself.
