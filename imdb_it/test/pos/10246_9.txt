A gem from Japan, where many of the best films in the world are made today. Stylistically, this is nothing special. It's just a simple drama (with some comic traits) that talks about recognizable people moving forward in their lives. Yuko Tanaka, known for dubbing the character Lady Eboshi in Princess Mononoke, plays a 50-year-old spinster. She is proud of her health, spends every morning in a vigorous workout as she carries milk up and down the steep hills of Nagasaki. After completing this part-time job, she regularly works as a saleswoman in a grocery store (called S-Mart, which made this fan of the Dark Army chuckle). Along his milk road lives a 50-year-old man whose wife is dying. It turns out that the milk woman and the man, a child care worker, attended high school and that, apparently, they still had something similar to the other. The film actually has some important narrative problems. When the writer really wants the two unrequited lovers to unite, he uses a rather incredible deus ex machina technique. Even the climate sequence is really forced. But most of the film is wonderfully small and attentive to the two main characters, as well as many side characters. The film also has several subplots that seem to end up weighing down the film, but they never end up doing it. I think the best thing about the movie is Tanaka's harrowing performance as the lone milk woman, who has resigned herself to being alone for the rest of her life. Whatever the problems, the film mostly transcends them.
