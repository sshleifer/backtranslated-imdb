I've always been a fan of Jackass, as well as Viva La Bam and Wildboyz. And when you're a fan of something, your expectations are high for whatever your "heroes" can interpret. And if there's one thing I've learned to foresee a lot from people who simply love to watch and listen, it's never expecting much, because in 99 out of 100 times you'll be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although, when I heard that there was a Jackass 2 coming, I thought "I can't even break down my expectations for this movie", and as a result of that I sat down today, ready to laugh, but also ready to say at the end "Well, it was OK, but I'm a little disappointed". How wrong I was! Every single member of the Jackass troupe brings this film over the first one, showing you the absurdity of the ass after the other, showing the whole world that there is nothing they don't do to try to hurt themselves - and is what we love! I screamed my eyes laughing from the first minute until the last second of the film, sometimes even screaming with laughter, unable to control me! Stunt after stunt, prank after prank and hilarious comments on the flow - it simply can't be better than that! Incredible from start to finish, guaranteed to make you laugh from the ass. I still have two things to say; LOOK, and PLEASE God, let there be a Jackass 3 - these guys clearly have a lot to offer!
