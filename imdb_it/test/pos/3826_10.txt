I saw the original external limits in real time, when I broadcast for the first time and since then I have watched the entire original series again and again in re-performances and completed on DVD. I find that the New External Limits are WELL more than a remake of old reconstruction episodes, as suggested by some of the more teenage commentators. <br /> <br /> With seven (7) years of programs versus only the two (2) years of the original series, producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer TV series and very well produced (by cable). The plots are intelligent, scientifically accurate projections of the unknown possibilities of a sometimes frightening and imminent future. <br /> <br /> While most Hollywood producers and directors ignore science fiction as unobservable from Horror and Fantasy, this series returns to the origins of Sci-Fi in the logical, moral and philosophical projections of current new technologies in their potentially fearsome short-term achievements. This series does it very well and remains one of a kind, avoiding the video game shoot-em-up mentally of much of the current generation. He has brains, history, a message and good entertainment. It is a series for adults without foolish fantasies for all. Hooray! <br /> <br /> Now, if we can only get MGM to release the entire New Outer Limits series on DVD instead of just the poor six teaser discs and the first season now only available.
