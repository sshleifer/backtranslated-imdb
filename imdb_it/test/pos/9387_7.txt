Death bed: the bed you eat. <br /> <br /> Judging from the title, you can guess what this movie is about. Yet there is a much more (background) story in this film, so one might suspect. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the main plot is about a bed that eats people and food, but there are also some subplots. I don't want to ruin them for you, but they are a nice touch. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the acting in this film is very mediocre. The fact that most dialogues are not even spoken by the actors does not actually help improve the quality of the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Because there is a lot of voice over work. The characters' thoughts are also revealed to observers. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. <br /> <br /> The effects are fine. Of course, it could be much better if you compare it with today's films. But you really shouldn't; just judge the film as it is and don't take it too seriously. You have to admit that a killer BED is quite creative. If you are easily scared, don't watch this movie. You may not want to sleep again ... <br /> <br /> Death Bed: the bed you eat is a strange jewel of horror on a low budget, but I would still recommend it to horror movie fans. <Br /> <br /> In conclusion, I gave this film a 7 out of 10 stars for its creative story and unexpected twists here and there.
