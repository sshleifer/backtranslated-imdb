it's a beautiful film. The scenes are well represented. The dialogues of Anne Revere are really well written and stimulating, the philosophy and thoughts that this film offers and the things it teaches make it fantastic and wonderful. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney is great at the film and his role goes through many emotional disorders while the film progresses. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Taylor looks very pretty, her scenes in the movie are inherently poetic, the way the camera follows her and the way the music makes you feel make every scene of her ethereal beauty. <br /> <br /> this film has a fantastic spirit and a beloved classic. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury is rather amusing in her role although unrecognizable if you saw her in the role of "me" in the "Manchurian Candidate". <br /> <br /> Donald Crisp did justice to his father's role and the script provides him with many things to justify his role. <br /> <br /> is a very nice film and a must for the family and children, a favorite of evergreen Christmas.
