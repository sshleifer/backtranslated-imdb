This film is the best film I've seen in a long time. It is also the best film as it uses a drama to tell the story, without going into speculation like with JFK, Nixon or Hoffa. He skilfully describes the clutches that Belgium had on the Congo. It also easily reveals to us the European and American forces that were behind the power that today inflict the Congo. The film was sure to specifically implicate the United States, rightly, in the murder of Lumumba. This film could never be made in the United States for US films that are rarely criticized in acts of imperialism and murder. (Save Stone's JFK) It also allows us to address the problems that were present in the internal conflict of Congo, between Lumumba, Mobutu and Katanga. We can see how precarious countries sit in establishing new governments when their history is that of colonization and those who were colonizers continue to pull the strings of power and strength. The film is excellently shot with Eriq Ebouaney an excellent Lumumba. The cast is fantastic and they really inspired the feeling of the Congo climate at that time. <br /> <br /> Once again, it is a must see for those who love drama with a correct historical background. See my notes on Quilombo.
