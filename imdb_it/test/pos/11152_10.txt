This has become one of my favorite movies and certainly one of the best westerns I've ever seen. Having a weakness for the genre (westerns are or were, since they are no longer done very often - morality games that too often have been denigrated by critics with intellectual pretensions), I bought the DVD, unseen view, because I I had read enough about the work of William S. Hart (much of which he wrote and directed) to excite my interest and I thought I should have had at least one of his films in my video collection. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I approached the current vision with some trepidation. My previous experiences with the "classics" of silent cinema had left me disappointed. Chaney's Phantom of the Opera, The Birth of a Griffith Nation and Fairbanks' Zorro brand were fine, but they weren't as good as their reputation would have led to expect. They were too long, too theatrical, or both. <br /> <br /> The Toll Gate, however, has emerged as a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> It is a story told in a simple and direct way. Black Deering (played by Hart), leader of a notoriously successful outlaw gang, believes the time has come for the group to disband, before luck ends. He is, however, upset by his chief lieutenant, Jordan, who puts them all back in a last kidnapping promising great wealth but leads them into a trap in which he is complicit. Everyone is killed except Deering, who is taken prisoner. When his captors recognize him as the man who once saved a number of soldiers and settlers by alerting an outpost of an impending Indian attack, they allow him to escape. Free, try to find an honest job but he is snubbed and ridiculed and eventually has to steal again to survive. Soon, he is pursued not only by the sheriff's team, but also by Jordan (which is now thriving thanks to the reward money he has collected) and his henchmen. His flight takes him to a remote cottage inhabited by a single mother and her little son. After some initial doubts, they take it into their hearts. Deering sees the possibility of a new life but, with the posse and Jordan closing, he realizes that this may not be possible. <br /> <br /> Hart was the first major western star and the first to inject genre realism. As one of the pioneers of cinema, he has created many of the characters and situations that have become clichés in westerns for over ninety years. What keeps his films interesting, however, is his ability to go beyond the cliché (perhaps his imitators have not gone far enough) so that the material appears fresh and innovative, even now. Three examples of the genre in The Toll Gate illustrate this: <br /> <br /> 1) In one scene, his character throws himself into the crowd in an attempt to kill Jordan, and kills a third instead. A subsequent first floor shows that he is clearly frustrated. The frustration, however, does not stem from the fact that he killed a man who had not caused him any harm up to that point, but who missed the intended target. <br /> <br /> 2) In another, while escaping from the group, his "borrowed" horse enters a gopher-shaped hole and breaks a leg. Hart pulls out his gun to free the animal from his suffering but, before pulling the trigger, gives his head a sad and loving caress, as if to say goodbye to an old friend. <br /> <br /> 3) And finally, after strangling Jordan and throwing his body over a cliff, he returns to retrieve his rifles and sees the opponent's gun lying on the nearby ground. He steps forward and gives him a quick kick before mounting the horse. It's a simple gesture, but it underlines the profound contempt he feels for the man who betrayed him and his companions. <br /> <br /> And I love the title, The Toll Gate. It is allegorical in its implication that a man cannot start a new life until he has paid for the sins of his old man. The Deering payment comes in the form of a sacrifice. Today's most sophisticated audience segments may not fully adapt to this feeling, but they can still work on you if you allow it. <br /> <br /> Spectators who love their videos in perfect condition are undoubtedly opposed to the quality of the DVD images, especially the badly deteriorated final coil. I don't mind at all. The fact that a copy of this movie from 1920 even exists is a miracle because copies of many other silent films have been lost. If you keep it in mind and consider the film as a piece of history, its visual defects are not so difficult to accept. <br /> <br /> William S. Hart was born in 1870 in New York but grew up in Minnesota and Wisconsin where he learned to speak Sioux and Indian sign language. He counted Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson among his friends and collected Remington's paintings, so his knowledge of the West was first-hand. If his vision seems too fictionalized by today's standards, it is still much closer to reality than the spaghetti westerns of the 60s and 70s and the revisionist works that followed. Both the star and his films are late for the revaluation.
