"Comanche Moon" had everything for him. For beginners, Simon Wincer is back, a man whose name is synonymous with high-quality television westerns. Unfortunately, the problems with "Moon" are something that even the most talented director cannot solve: a poor script based on a lackluster novel. <br /> <br /> Forget historical accuracy - as any reader of the novels can tell you, the biggest parody of "Moon" is that it is not even consistent with the information of the original "Lonesome Dove" masterpiece. So many wonderful and rich moments in the miniseries and, to an even greater extent, in the book, they are completely missing in "Moon". Considering the fact that most of the "Moon" viewers are probably coming up with at least some sort of "Where" background, the lack of backstory motivated by the characters and emotional is downright painful. <br /> <br /> That said, "Moon" is an example where the adapted version could and should have been modified to make it more suitable for the screen. For example, the novel "Luna" focuses mainly on the Comanches themselves. To his credit, the miniseries tries to serve the Comanches, but in the end he gives them enough to make the viewer feel that he loses an important part of the story. Similarly, Val Kilmer's Scull is also lost here - the role should have been expanded so that Kilmer (and Rachel Griffiths, for that matter) actually had something to do, or the roles should have been reduced to smaller parts and support. Instead, Kilmer gets the highest billing for a character that just lets you scratch your head after his appearance in the completely bizarre final act. <br /> <br /> There are strange moments in the film that make no sense to those who have not read the book (a killer parrot? what?) - moreover, there is not a single scene that shows us that Call and McCrae are something close to the extraordinary Texas rangers they claim to be. Not even one of their Moon expeditions (or "Dead Man's Walk", for that matter) ends successfully, and Call and McCrae seem to wander around one useless mission after another. <br /> <br /> Frankly Larry McMurtry should never have devoted himself to writing the script, and he did it only thanks to the praise surrounding that other cowboy movie, Brokeback Mountain. McMurtry can write good novels (although there is some disagreement on the consistency of this statement), but he never claimed exactly as a scriptwriter. This production would have benefited not only the director Wincer, but the original screenwriter Bill Wittcliff to adapt the novel to the screen. Witcliff does not have exactly a mountain of material on his credit for writing on the screen, but no one can deny that he did a fantastic job in reducing the original "Lonesome Dove". With all this said, "Comanche Moon" is an almost ingenious production, helped by an exceptional cast that unfortunately is not given enough to do. The portrait of Gus McCrae by Steve Zahn - or rather his portrait of Robert Duvall as Gus McCrae - is perfect. And while some have criticized Karl Urban as Woodrow Call, saying that his performance does not imitate the silent and stoic Woodrow of the original film, all I can say is: blame McMurtry, because McMurtry is the one who - is in the "Luna" "Il novel and now the miniseries - they have transformed Woodrow from socially incompetent, clumsy but natural leaders into an emotionless character whose lines are just boring and whose character motivations are clear only if you've seen them portrayed much more adequately in the "sequel "". <br /> <br /> Still, it's the cast that sparkles in "Moon", to the extent that I left the miniseries with the same feeling of melancholy that I felt looking at the original "Lonesome Dove" - ​​this time because I have realized that it is probably the last time we will see these characters appear on the screen for a long, long time to come - and honestly, this cast could have done so well in a well-developed and full-blown network TV series. <br /> <br /> All in all, apart from the opportunities wasted with the cast, the bi The travest di ggest is that the original novel by Lonesome Dove contained a rich background for the characters that would have been fascinating and absolutely fascinating to see translated on the screen. Unfortunately, all of this has been put aside in favor of McMurtry's boring, inconsistent and ultimately irrelevant prequel.
