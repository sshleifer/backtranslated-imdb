This film is not only the last piece of the Three Colors trilogy, but also the best of the three and one of the best films of the 90s. There is almost no other film that is so wise and consequently asks for humanity and respect for every human being. <br /> <br /> Valentine (Irene Jacob) lives in Geneva, where she works as a model. Even though she has a boyfriend, she seems to be quite alone. One night he has an accident and injures a dog and who leads it to his owner, a retired jugde (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who is cynical and spies on neighbors' calls. Disgusted with him, he can't leave and they meet again. Two lonely souls meet and become friends and develop a deep love for each other. <br /> <br /> The story itself is too complex to be told completely, there is another bond between them in a young man who represents both true love and judge and Valentine's Day and there is a lot of more in their relationship than just friendship. br /> <br /> The actors are wonderful, Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant develop a deep and authentic friendship. <br /> <br /> The arguments are of endless validity, fraternity, not only in contact with each other, but also in respect of the right to privacy. We seem to be losing this right at an alarming rate, which makes films like this even more important than it could have been in 1994. <br /> <br /> Red is one of the strongest colors that exists, which represents inner turmoil, love, anger and passion. Used here as another protagonist, it brings a depth unmatched to the film. A masterpiece!
