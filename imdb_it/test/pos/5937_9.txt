I have enjoyed both Van Dykes over the years and I was delighted to watch them again. <br /> <br /> Equally cute and fun and easy to look at and have fun. <br /> <br /> Dick was good when he was younger, but I liked him better as he grew older. <br /> <br /> Son Berry was great to follow in the footsteps of his fathers. <br /> <br /> Together they form a great team and work well together. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed that I did not find any other 101 listed murder anywhere. <br /> <br /> I have seen both of those shown. I hope more as it is really a nice duo to watch. <br /> <br /> You can tell Berry that he follows in his father's footsteps, they talk the same way and have the same mannerism. <br /> <br /> They would enjoy whatever they do separately. <br /> <br /> They will be sure to look at everything they do alone and together.
