I have just seen this delightful classic again after many years, the penultimate film directed by Henry Cornelius, who died three years later at only 45 years (the same age in which even the film's star Larry Harvey would have died in 1973). Three members of the director were in the crew: Jack Clayton (associate producer), Guy Green (director of photography) and Clive Donner (editor). This film is based on the autobiographical story 'Goodbye to Berlin' by the famous British author Christopher Isherwood, which was first transformed into a play by John van Druten, later transformed into this film, then transformed into a musical, ' Cabaret ', and finally shot as' Cabaret', which brought the incredible Liza Minelli to the world attention, with his voice that can shatter glass at a distance of a mile. Isherwood appears as a character in the film with his name. He was gay, but in those days it was illegal and he could put him in jail, so he disguised his inclinations under the description of being what he calls "a confirmed bachelor". This is the key to his platonic relationship with the wildly eccentric, extravagant, promiscuous, always cheerful and absolutely unique character he calls Sally Bowles. The portrait of Sally Bowles in this film is a tour-de-force of the young Julie Harris, who sweeps every scene in a magical and captivating network of sparkling personal charm. What a vehicle for an actress with a charm all her own! It is one of the great cinema performances of the 50s. Isherwood is interpreted to perfection by the young Lawrence Harvey, in a finely judged show that never allows the comedy to go beyond the limit, and even the moments of farce that border on the slapstick remain somehow "almost believable". Larry is so funny in portraying a hypnotic hypochondriac. What an irony, considering the total lack of hypochondria shown by his courage and stoicism in the last year of his life, when he died of terminal stomach cancer and behaved with such dignity and lack of complaints. I had known him well for the last three years or so, and he was a generous, warm and modest person. He loved his baby Domino, now unfortunately also tragically dead. This film was his best show at the beginning, followed by his spectacular work in 'Room at the Top' (1959), 'Summer and Smoke' (1961) and 'The Candidate at Manchuria' (1962). Larry was often overlooked in his life because he was too handsome, he was often chosen as a cad, and glamorous boys are not always accepted as good actors, but many of the best actresses acted in front of him, and they had no doubts about his abilities and he is He was an important protagonist in many of the most important films of his time. If he had lived beyond middle age, he would have become stronger and become a "big old man" of the screen. Sitting in his Hampstead house one day, he gave me a glass of his usual white wine from a huge barrel he had brought from a foreign cellar. I said he always gave me such a delicious wine, what was it? He replied with pride that it was a Sancerre who had chosen the vineyard in France and had sent it specially. Then he added with extreme melancholy: "You know, I've been waiting for four years for someone to comment and ask me what it is, and you're the first person who ever did it." What mattered to him was being recognized for having taste in wine, and his most glamorous friends had denied him that satisfaction. In this film, Anton Diffring gives a touching performance in advance as a serious young man (he would later have to play the Nazi officers too well, poor boy), and the young Shelley Winters plays a rich German Jewish girl, in her usual noisy but effective way, but it wasn't too difficult, since she was still a noisy Jewish girl. This film has such zest for life, which is pure delight.
