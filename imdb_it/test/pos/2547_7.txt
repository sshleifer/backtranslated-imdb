Some critics have compared the Chop Shop with the theatrical versions of City of God and Pixote. I've seen both the Chop Shop and I like it in many cases, I don't think the comparison is justified. City of God and Pixote certainly had a much higher budget. Chop Shop is an independent low budget film about survival and hope, disappointment and the continuation of life. One of the scenes is supposedly filmed during the US Open and both directors had incredible connections or the scene was shot at another time and US footage was added. I say this because I live in the area where this film was shot and security is crazy while tennis matches are underway. It is also noteworthy that the actual names of the actors were the names of their characters in the film. Return to the film. It's a funny story about survival. However, he ended up getting a 7 because ... sometimes the actors played very well. At other times they seemed to play their lines. If the actors were less competent (as in the low budget "The Big Dis" for example) I would have been more forgiving. But in different scenes each of these actors gave exemplary performances. At other times, they seemed bored. The manager could be at fault here. I also had problems with the ending. This is one of those films that "ends". Maybe there will be a part 2? Definitely worth going to DVD. I will not go into a summary of the story because this information is already available on IMDb.
