I saw this mini in the early eighties. Sam Waterson proved to be a great actor. In fact, when he started law and order, I was disappointed in him because it wasn't such a powerful role. Unfortunately the good roles don't pay the bills. I wish I could find a copy of this rare series and review it. It's both real and fun. Everyone should see it to know what really happened. I was so moved that I bought and read the book "Pppenheimer-Shatterer of Worlds". And I saw how this man became an unlikely hero who was never rewarded for his intuition. If you have the chance, make sure you watch this movie and see what performance Mr. Waterston can really provide to an audience. Enjoy the movies!
