OK. Is Barney the best show for children of all time? Obviously not. But in some of the comments left by other IMDb members you might think it was a million-dollar production with high-class actors and a ridiculous special-effects budget. Well guess what? It's Barney for God's sake. Show the children good behavior, good manners and it's okay to be who you are. For those of you who find it annoying it is because you are not five and the show was not designed for you. For the IMDb member who wrote the review on the front page, I think you may have gone a little too far. Did you actually describe a Sesame Street character as "down to Earth"? Growing up all, this is a great show for preschoolers and actually helps children learn in a fun and creative way.
