Bravestarr was released in 1987 by the now defunct American animation company, Filmation on the back of He-man: Masters of the universe and She-Ra: Princess of Power, in 1983 and 87 'respectively. The plot of the cartoon involved a native American cowboy named Marshall Bravestarr, who possesses the strength of the bear, the ears of the wolf, the speed of the puma and the eyes of a hawk, and his trusty companion, a talking horse called Trenta -Trenta, who carried with her a gun entitled "Sarah Jane" and with the help of the deputy Fuzz and Judge JB serve to protect New Texas from the evil Tex Hex and his band of outlaws. <br /> <br /> The futuristic Texas, this was and still is until today, one of the very few cartoons set in a particular city, in the United States, then in the South, thousands of light years ahead in the future. Considering that this was done in the 1980s, the creators did an impressive job trying to recreate the wild west look but from a Sci-Fi based perspective. Bravestarr has not only evoked morality and good bad verses, as well as teaching children lessons about life, but he has also highlighted the themes of culture and community and that we should not take things and life for granted. And despite the fact that it was an action cartoon, many of the narrative lines, themes, and themes addressed resonate with children and adults in a way that makes sense to them. Furthermore, Marshall Bravestarr was one of the first cartoon characters of a minority (ethnic) to have an impact on TV. <br /> <br /> The sound effects were incredible, the music was great, the theme song was equally memorable and the animation was wonderful. The characters were well designed and the stories were different and taught the children the moral and importance of what is right and what is wrong. Something that cannot be said of the cartoons of today, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> While Bravestarr was overshadowed by the success of He-man, it is still a personal favorite for many 1980s cartoon fanatics. Suffice it to say that I preferred Bravestarr to He-man because of the diversity of the narrative lines, the characters and that the depth of the situations and the problems that the characters faced alone, were more than what I would have said realistic and identifiable in contrast. For some reason, they resonated more with people because, for example, in "The Pledge", where a child dies from an overdose, the fact that there is no happy ending is important, in the sense that when children look at that episode, well, in fact anyone who looks at that episode, will realize the devastating consequences of drug use by himself and that nobody should underestimate the dangers of drugs. <br /> <br /> Bold, brave and at times stimulating, Bravestarr is certainly the one: bold, courageous and stimulating. A cult comic classic for many years to come, he had the courage to take risks, but in the end he had a good result. It will be remembered by many cartoon fans as one of the most interesting and best cartoons of the 80s ever, and rightly <br /> <br /> eight and a half out of ten
