The first of the five St. Trinian films (although the latter is generally taken for granted) was based on the characters of artist student Ronald Searle, and presents the wonderful Alastair Sim in drag like Millicent Fritton, director, as well as her brother. Much of the humor is dated, but curiously moving and outrageous in today's PC world: girls drink, gamble, smoke and later are sold to wealthy Arabs, while still remaining in command, defeating bureaucrats, police, judges and other characters from the establishment like Maraud through England. Perhaps because the films have been seen so regularly on TV, St Trinians still inspires masquerade parties and club nights. The films have recurring characters that include PC Ruby Gates (Joyce Grenfell) and Flash Harry (George Cole). The forerunner of the whole series is a fascinating film entitled "The happiest days of your life" (1950).
