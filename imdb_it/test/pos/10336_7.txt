A moving story told with tenderness: the embarrassing young Jewish girl of World War II in America makes friends with an escaped German prisoner of war who hides in her clubhouse. They discuss their lives and beliefs (he is anti-Hitler), she insinuates food, becomes his only friend and ally. All this reminded me of the very best theatrical film "Whistle Down The Wind", where Hayley Mills makes friends with the condemned Alan Bates, but one cannot certainly criticize the direction here, which is smooth, or the performances, which are pounds. Mature in her pre-teen years, Kristy McNichol carries most of the image and never hits a false note. Suddenly, when the prisoner is discovered (and Kristy is also discovered), the film becomes very hard. Her father, upset and embarrassed by the fact that his son would join "that Nazi", finds himself in her with a silent fury that I rarely saw before (he says "You're dead for me", which must be devastating to a little girl hear). The final scenes do not die out; there are no large meetings, no climax holding hands. The girl has to face the world and in doing so learn a bitter lesson about neighbors, friends and family. An amazing film.
