AristoCats is a fantastic Disney classic that I loved as much as a child. Even today I can't resist looking at it, it's such a wonderful and fascinating film with great animations and delicious songs. I really miss the animated films like AristoCats, they had perfect voices, not to mention the hand-drawn animation that makes it perfect for the family. AristoCats is also very witty and intelligent, the story was really wonderful. This film is just beyond irresistible, I think the most memorable moment for me was the fact that the cats played the piano learning the whims, lol, it was so cute with the piano that plays and paints. <br /> <br /> Douchess and her kittens are very pampered in their huge villa, especially because their woman is very rich and treats them as if they were her children. But when the lady feels that it is time to do her will, she leaves everything to the cats and not to her butler. The butler gets angry and takes the kittens on the road and abandons them in the middle of nowhere. Douchess and the kittens wake up and with the help of a friendly street cat named Thomas O'Malley, they return home to their woman, but they learn the coldness of being a skat cat. <br /> <br /> The AristoCats is just a perfect Disney movie that seems a bit overwhelmed. I always recommend this movie for children or families, it could be appreciated by anyone. The songs and the story are simply memorable. I will always join for the best song in the movie "Everyone wants to be a cat", a very good reason. I also love those dogs that kept the farm where the cats were abandoned, they were so cute. This is a fantastic film, please look at it, you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
