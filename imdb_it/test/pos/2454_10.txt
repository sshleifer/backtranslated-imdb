I had never heard of this film and I only took it because I'm a fan of Martin Sheen. Now I am amazed at why he has not received the praise and recognition he truly deserves. The four characters make you feel everything for them, the father tries to assert his authority, the mother still clings to traditional family values ​​and both try to keep up appearances despite the total fragmentation of their family, the daughter who wants her life and the son haunted by his experiences in Vietnam. It was felt that this was a scenario that had to be played in thousands of "ordinary" families after Vietnam. Emilio Estevez as Jeremy was superb - totally upset by his war experience that no one in his family could relate to. The chemistry of the screen between him and the father of real life Martin Sheen was surprising. And there were times when Emilio's anguished face was so similar to Martin's in "Apocalypse Now". I'm sure that, just as Martin considered Apocalype one of his best films, Emilio will consider him one of his best. The scene with the gun was totally shocking, since all the emotions were present on the faces of the family. Brilliant acting by Estevez, Sheen and Kathy Bates. I saw the movie for the first time last night and today the main news was about a Gulf War veteran who had shot several members of his family. How many other young people will have their lives destroyed by war?
