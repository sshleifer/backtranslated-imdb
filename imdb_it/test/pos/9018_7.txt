It's pretty good, all things considered. A must for anyone puzzled about the opposite sex (ie all of us!). The trailer gives nothing of the plot FOR GOOD REASON. <br /> <br /> The premise is absurd, so it's nice to see that you don't take it seriously. It's like someone from the BBC children's department decides to make a movie for adults. This is not a bad thing IMO. <br /> <br /> 7/10
