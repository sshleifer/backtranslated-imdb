I remember seeing this film on stage in 1984 when I was 6 (do the math). I absolutely loved it. I was Tarzan for 2 weeks after seeing him (climbing on furniture, jumping making monkey sounds). He started to fascinate Tarzan and the monkeys, but strangely a lasting love for Christopher Lambert (remember that I saw Highlander very soon after this). 1984 was the last time I saw that movie, until about a month ago. I happened to be on a cable while I was getting ready for bed at 3:30 am and even though it was late and I was tired and had to be at work at 9:00 am, I stayed to watch this movie I loved as a child <br /> <br /> After seeing it, I realized that it was not a film so beautiful and even weirder than that, that Andie MacDowell's voice was nicknamed by someone else. Ian Holme was obviously solid as usual, and surprisingly the monkey suits were still held, but what was more surprising was how good Lambert was as Tarzan. It was fantastic! The depth he managed to capture in so few lines, his primordial body language and, above all, his ability to take this character through his extremely large ark, were simply fantastic. <br /> <br /> As I said before, I'm a Lambert fan, but I'm used to Highlander, The Hunted and Fortress. In this film he was really good and it's a shame he never had the chance to portray a character with such depth again. <br /> <br /> So, to make a short story too long, I was a little disappointed that the film wasn't so good, but I was glad to see that Lambert was good and I don't regret staying awake until 6:00 to see it.
