Much of this film was beautiful. The acting, the scenery and, without a doubt, Aaron's cinematic background showed through the beautiful shots. Definitely worth looking at, as your attention will be captured all the time, and ends with the right note. <br /> <br /> The acting of the newcomer Jonathan Furr was superb, as one might think he was a professional actor since he was born. He continued to act in other feature films, but this leading role will always be remembered. <br /> <br /> The film has the academic award sometimes, in which it is slow, scenic and quiet, so it is not a film that adds children can sit. However, the rustic atmosphere of East Bend and Yadkinville worked well as a 1940 film.
