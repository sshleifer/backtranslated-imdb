This film was told in Fangoria, where I heard about it, it was interesting for me especially because it was directed at the video and I recognized two of the stars on the cover, James Marsden of Disturbing Behavior and Christine Taylor of The Craft. And to my surprise on Valentine's Day when I was looking through the horror of the corridor to find it on the shelf! I immediately had to take it. My brother and I and our friends watched it and to my surprise it was pretty nice, the stories were interesting and for once they were actually SCARY, unlike many other horror films recently made. Part of the plot I don't understand, but once I look at it again, I bet I'll make it. And surprisingly even more there were other stars that I recognized including one of the girls on The Real World TV show My So-Called Life and Jacinda, I'm not sure why this movie was just directed at the video, with some 'of advertising this film could at least compensate for how much money was spent to make it happen. The only problem I have is that since it wasn't released in theaters I think I'll never be able to see it in widescreen. You should definitely risk it and rent it. <br /> <br />
