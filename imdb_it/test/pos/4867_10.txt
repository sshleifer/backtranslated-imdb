This second pairing of Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner is as big as the first. Maybe it's predictable, but I don't care and I keep laughing so much every time I see it. The short Wile E./Road runners have always had the most special place in my heart. So, knowing that the second Golden Collection record would not have only 11 of this, but would have been in chronological order (from 2 to 12, the first episode was on Volume 1), made me get confused eyes. I LOVE this stuff. This animated short film can be seen on disc 2 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2. It also features an optional commentary by Michael Barrier. <br /> <br /> My Grade: A +
