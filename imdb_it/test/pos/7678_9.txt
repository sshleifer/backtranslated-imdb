It is a pity that the Gershwin family and Goldwyn Estate have pulled this great film out of the vision, thus depriving the public of seeing some of the most wonderful actors and shows ever brought together in a film. <br /> <br /> It is also true that the voices sung by Sidney Poitier and Dorothy Dandridge have been dubbed for this film, and it is used as one of the reasons why Gershwins do not want this film to ever be released again. <br /> <br /> Despite despite the flaws of the film and the creative differences between Gershwins and Goldwyns, this film has some of the most remarkable performances ever made on the screen. Sammy Davis, Jr. and Pearl Bailey are particularly worthy of praise. <br /> <br /> This film was the swan song of the great independent producer Samuel Golwyn. It was also ironically, the greatest shame of Gershwin. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is a loss for the wonderful black actors who have appeared in it. Because we can no longer see them at their best.
