Exciting, action-packed and interesting film that tells the story of a group of men stationed at a naval base in Italy and their adventures aboard a Navy submarine during the First World War. Tommy and Brick (played by Robert Montgomery and Robert Young) are two friends, and they are a couple of beautiful officers, I must say. A new Captain arrives on board, already known by some as "Dead Pan" Toler (Walter Huston) and is a true striker to follow the rules and a "code of honor". Soon Tommy and Brick are chasing an attractive blonde at an officer dance, Tommy insults the Captain - and, of course, the blonde is actually the Captain's daughter. But Tommy wins anyway as he and his daughter slip away from the dance at a street carnival outside, and soon bind themselves during an air raid - unfortunately for him, he reveals himself to be married. Later, Tommy gets into trouble when he disobeys orders, saving his friend. <br /> <br /> This film is rather amusing with an intriguing storyline that aroused my interest and the best performances of all. A death scene set with Sterling Holloway is really haunting - the most memorable scene in this movie, I thought. Eugene Palette and Jimmy Durante add a bit of humor here to play a couple of goofballs balls - Durante's character is studying to become a dentist by correspondence and has continuous direct confrontations with a British man who makes fun of his nose. Okay - if you're looking for a movie that shows a man who cans a kangaroo, that would be the only one.
