GLORIFY not GLAMORIZE the Second World War. <br /> <br /> We had series of documentaries on the Second World War on normal television programming. Without looking for any information in an encyclopedia or film, it seems that this old memory can remember most of the names entirely by itself. <br /> <br /> There was CRUSADE IN EUROPE, which was the title of war memories of an army general and then the 33rd president of the United States of America, Dwight D. Eisenhower. He told the story of the conflict in Europe seen by the Supreme Allied Commander. <br /> <br /> Then there was a CRUSADE IN THE PACIFIC (a self-explanatory topic), of which I don't remember much. Man / Author Journalist, Jim Bishop was the host / navigator of BATTLELINE. <br /> <br /> And there was the excellent WINSTON CHURCHILL, THE VALIANT YEARS. The series was a co-production of the British Broadcasting Corporation and the American Broadcasting Company. It was broadcast for the first time in the 1960-61 season here in the United States and boasts of having Richard Burton utter the words of Sir Winston. <br /> <br /> It is the production of the 1952 NBC Television Network of today, this VITTORIA AT SEA that wins the cigar, hands down. <br /> <br /> To begin with, this must have resulted in several years of accurate and literal collection of thousands of hours of film. The film mentioned here was the official filmed record taken by members of the United States Armed Forces, the independent newsreel, the Motion Picture Record of our other allied partner nations, as well as the Axis images captured by Nazi Germany, from Italy fascist and imperial Japan. <br /> <br /> Once completed, the various corresponding films had to be cut and mounted in a series of half-hour bets. This has been done with great skill, since there have been so many scene changes, whether they have been made abruptly or as if they were loose. The appearance of each episode appears as smooth as if it were a single film project. <br /> <br /> Writing the vocabulary to accompany this very real life film was no less surprising and unique. Eloquence, highly lucid and significant, does not waste a word and sometimes even minimizes the description of the action, rather than exaggerating it. The narration goes to Mr. Ralph Graves, who was a talented stage actor, film, radio and television. Surely he has acquired a certain amount of immortality thanks to his golden tones of the descriptions of the written episodes. <br /> <br /> Finally, VICTORY AT SEA enjoys the luxury of having an original soundtrack, both initial and musical, written by Richard Rodgers of Broadway fame. (Rodgers & Hart, Rodgers & Hammerstein) His compositions are intricate, full, variable and even "classic" in the true sense. <br /> <br /> The classic arrangement was played by the NBC Sympphony Orchestra under the direction of Robert Russell Bennett and as a soundtrack / cassette / compact disc, has been continuously available and requested since its first version, 55 years old does! And, really little wonder, because this soundtrack is so fascinating for the viewer / listener. It really puts the icing on this cake. <br /> <br /> * SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL, THE VALIAN YEARS also had a beautiful and memorable original score. This too was composed by Mr. Rodgers. <br /> <br /> ** We had in the additional "Ace in the Sleeve" in our home in the person of our Father, the late Clement J. Ryan (1914-74). Dad had been in the United States during the war, having been inserted in 1943 or in '44. Our Pop was always available to explain and further clarify the situations represented in the series. <br /> <br /> He and our mother, the now ninety-year-old Bertha (born Fuerst) Ryan, already had my older sister, Joanne (1942-90) as an employee.
