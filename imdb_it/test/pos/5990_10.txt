This film was released around the same time as Pretty Woman. While the general theme is the same: the rich man meets and learns to love a poor working class woman, the characters of Romuald and Juliette are much more lovable and worthy of our time with them. I have never forgotten them and consider the film superior to Pretty Woman in so many ways. Juliette is an extraordinary woman and the intelligent ways she helps her boss overcome her problems will make you happy. The final scenes contain some of the most memorable lines in the romantic comedy. Romuald's efforts to win Juliette's love exceed the climbing scene of Pretty Woman a hundred times. Watch this movie, it will warm your heart.
