It is a fact that there are many of us from the 80s generation who grew up loving those moving John Cusack comedies made by Savage Steve Holland, and while I prefer another more bizarre movie out there, Better Off Dead , it's hard for me not to like A summer madman, a movie I grew up loving with all my heart as a child in my adolescence. OCS was the sequel to Better Off Dead, which returned Cusack and Curtis Armstrong to that movie. <br /> <br /> Cusack is Hoops, after graduation friend Joel Murray (George) in Nantucket for the summer to have some fun on the beach. Hoops finds himself caught in a feud with a blonde, punk buff named Teddy Beckersted whose lustful father has bulldozer drawings on neighborhood houses to build a giant apartment building. One of the houses that needs a repaid mortgage belongs to Demi Moore (Cassandra). There is a sailboat ride that could be their only hope of saving Cassandra's grandfather's house (.. it had recently passed), but it has been won by Teddy in recent years, and Hoops has a deadly fear of boats on the water. But, with the help and motivation of Nantucket's new friends (like Bobcat Goldwait and Tom Villard as mechanical twin brothers!), George, and Cassandra's love interest in the grass, maybe Hoops can come to terms with his fears and win the race to save the neighborhood. Armstrong has a supportive role as the son of a kooky, manic arms salesman, General Raymond (.. Joe Flaherty of SCTV in an inspired casting piece), Ack, who uses his father's training to help Hoops and the company in their goals to win the race. <br /> <br /> The memorable scenes include Bobcat who remains stuck in a Godzilla (!) flowing frantically on a whole Aguilla Beckersted model (Mark Metcalf, barely recognizable as Teddy's rather upset pop), Hoops chased by scouts of unbalanced Cubans who want to perform first aid, George victim of toxic flatulence, the growing madness of Uncle Frank of Bruce Wagner whenever he tries to improve his chances of winning $ 1 million from a radio show, and the wonderful Billie Bird as George's grandmother who actually boils the group after a meal! Jeremy Piven as (you guessed it) a brutal cretin who joins Teddy and causes problems for Hoops and his team, the very tasty Kimberly Foster in the role of Cookie (.. Teddy's girlfriend trying to go out with Hoops while participating in a lunch with his father), and the one and only William Hickey as Old Man Beckersted, who will not reward his son and nephew as an inheritance if they lose the race. Demi Moore is pretty, but this is Cusack's vehicle, even though Bobcat and Villard steal most of the scenes. Once again, some delightful Dutch animations are scattered throughout the film (Hoops is an artist, appropriately). If you like his films, I highly recommend the underrated, How I Got Into College.
