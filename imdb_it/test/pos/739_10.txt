Although not mentioned very often, "Do not Look in the Basement" is a very interesting film and certainly deserves a watch. The story follows a young nurse, Charlotte Beale, who is hired by Stephen's Sanitarium to replace Dr. Stephens after being killed by a patient. Many patients begin to torment Miss Beale, and her boss, Dr. Geraldine Masters, acts as if she is hiding something ... <br /> <br /> This movie has many attractive characters that you really care about and that you have a liking for the climax, something that doesn't happen very often in horror movies. The soundtrack is exceptional and recalls "Dark Shadows", the performances of Rosie Holotik, Rhea McAdams and Bill McGhee are all fantastic, the story is very intriguing with a fantastic ending. This film has a campy atmosphere that no other film I've ever seen was able to capture. Many horror fans have never seen or heard of this movie which is really unlucky because it could have been a classic of horror. "Do not Look in the Basement" is certainly worth watching all the fans of the drive-in movies of the 70s.
