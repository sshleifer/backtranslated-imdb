When I saw Lon Chaney, Jr. and Boris Karloff in the cast, I expected to find a typical 1950s-style "schlocky" horror movie. The opening scene (a cemetery with a wolf howling in the background) seemed to confirm it. Once I started looking at it, though, what I discovered was a tiny little mystery on an Englishman (Richard Green) trying to find out what happened to two of his friends who had disappeared in the Black Forest and, if necessary, to retaliate against the evil count (Stephen McNally) who ruled the territory. Chaney, as a voiceless Gargon, had a rather limited role (which reminded me of the Hunchback of Notre Dame, actually) while Karloff had a more substantial role like Dr. Meissen. In fact, Meissen was one of the most interesting characters in the film, and it was difficult to know until the end whether he would be established to be a good boy or a bad boy! The castle set was magnificent, and even the limited description of the Black Forest was quite real. Certainly you didn't see it as low budget, compared to other films I've seen anyway. The only disappointment, I thought, was the performance of Rita Corday as Countess. He seemed a little dry and didn't seem to have much passion in the role. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I discovered that this film caught my attention everywhere, and there was enough suspense about how it would turn out to be worth watching. Definitely recommended, with a score of 7/10.
