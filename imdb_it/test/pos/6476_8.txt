"Knute Rockne All American", the biopic about the famous Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne, is an excellent sports film to watch. Having never seen it before, we were surprised by the technique used in the film by director Lloyd Bacon, which shows he is ahead of his time in photographing football matches. The result is a lively image of man responsible for the legacy of collegiate sport, Knute Rockne. <br /> <br /> The film features Rockne from his humble origins in Chicago to his studies at the famous Notre Dame University in South Bend, Indiana. He was an ambitious man who had a vision of how the game should be played. Fortunately, he went to give his beloved Notre Dame the glory he sought. <br /> <br /> Pat O'Brien looks a little older when he starts as a freshman. In fact, it doesn't change much during the movie, but it's as good as Mr. Rockne. Pat O'Brien shows that he could inspire players below him simply by being a father figure. Gale Page plays Bonnie Rockne, the wise woman who understood her husband's call in life. Ronald Reagan plays George "The Gipper" Gipp, who was a very young dead legend, but who left a legacy behind him. Donald Crisp makes a good contribution as Father John Callahan, who was Rockne's mentor at the university. <br /> <br /> This film will delight not only sports due to LLoyd Bacon's direction and the fast pace he gives to the film.
