This was the greatest film I've ever seen in my life, the action was great and I was so scared, there was a lot of blood that HAS BIG, I would have seen it another 1000 times, and Paris Hilton, D * MN she's fine in that movie. But anyway, I would recommend it to anyone, even to children (like me) like adults. Probably you would probably have nightmares, but other than that, IT IS EXCEPTIONAL, CANT STOP OF BRAGGING ON IT. ALWAYS SINE AUGEST WHEN I FEEL OF THEM, I HAVE BEEN SURPRISING AND SURPRISING, and at school I distributed the flyer saying it can be seen at home from wax. I took my whole school. But in any case, I would definitely say that the wax house could be 6, be there to be killed.
