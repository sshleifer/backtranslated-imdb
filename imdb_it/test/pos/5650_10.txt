Fires on The Plain (1959) **** <br /> <br /> You no longer see films like this. 'Fires on the Plain' is an incredible representation of the life of the soldiers of the Japanese imperial army. Kon Ichikawa's masterpiece follows Tamura, a soldier with tuberculosis while he wanders through the Philippine landscape in the last year of the war. He is sent to the hospital by his commanding officer only to be refused treatment and then sent back. His agent tells him to go back and if they refuse him again, his last order is to kill himself with his grenade. He is refused again, but meets a band of occupants sitting outside the hospital. The following day they are bombed by American troops and Tamura flees, choosing not to kill himself, and from there he wanders from place to place trying to get to Palompon. He discovers that some men have eaten human flesh to survive, while others trade as much tobacco as possible for everything they can turn back. <br /> <br /> The film is full of a peaceful sense of despair and desolation, with a touch of madness. All those we see are skin and bones, covered with dirty earth with torn and ragged rags. Ichikawa uses his camera to capture some beautiful shots of the destroyed landscape and the Japanese soldiers who walk along it. Kon Ichikawa was famous in Japan for making many comedies and satires, and there are moments in Fires on the Plain that are really hilarious. Take for example a shot of what appears to be a dead man lying face down in a puddle of water; a soldier walks but wonders aloud if this is how they will all end, to which the man raises his head out of the water and answers "what was it?" and then he drops his face deeper into the puddle than before. Another hilarious sequence involves a man finding a pair of boots along the track. Take the boots, replacing them with the old ones. Another man passes and sees that pair of boots and starts for his old boots. The scene continues until Tamura finds the exchange point and examines the remaining boots with almost no soles. Look carefully at his and those on the ground, and deciding that they are both kaput, he removes his and goes barefoot. The film is full of incredible scenes, one after another. Like Mizoguchi and Kurosawa, Ichikawa knew how to use his camera to paint beautiful and wonderful images. There are many extraordinary shots of men in barren empty plains surrounded by nothing but smoke in the air and dead or dying bodies on the destroyed earth. There is another incredible scene where dozens of Japanese soldiers attempt to cross a street guarded by Yanks in the middle of the night, all crawling on their hands and knees while the camera looks down from above. <br /> <br /> The film takes its name from the columns of smoke rising from the fires on the plains seen during the film. They represent a little more ordinary life for the soldiers; the lives of Japanese farmers return home by burning corn grains. Their headlights of hope for normal life are still in hostile hands. <br /> <br /> The film caused a stir in its days with its graphic content. Much emphasis is placed on the horror of war, not only with the enemy but also between your ranks and yourself. The Fires on the Plains by Kon Ichikawa is an incredibly authentic and moving, and somewhat disturbing, portrait of the horror suffered by the men who make up the lower ranks of the imperial army. Letters From Iwo Jima by Clint Eastwood, while it is a very beautiful film, does not get anywhere to realize the horror of the war depicted in Fires on the Plain. (Eastwood has undoubtedly been influenced by the film, as he claims to be a classic Japanese movie buff.) Many war movies show that war is hell through the eyes of winners. In Fires on the Plain, we are shown that the war is even more hellish when you are at a loss <br /> 4/4
