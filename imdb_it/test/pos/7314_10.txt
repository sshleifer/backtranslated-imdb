The Three Stooges has always been one of the many actors I loved. I love practically all the short films they made. I love all six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All the short films are hilarious and act in many other great actors and actresses that many of them were in many short films! In my opinion, The Three Stooges is one of the greatest actors of all time and is the funniest comic team of all time! <br /> <br /> One of the most exhilarating Three Stooges shorts is Men in Black. In this short film are Bud Jamison, Jeanie Roberts, Phyllis Crane, Dell Henderson, 'Little Billy' Rhodes, Billy Gilbert and Ruth Hiatt. The acting of these actors is particularly appreciated by Jamison and Roberts. There are many fun scenes here that I think most Three Stooges fans will love! In my opinion this is one of the most diverse Three Stooges shorts. I recommend this to everyone!
