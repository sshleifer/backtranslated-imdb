I started watching The Outer Limits in 95 when I was 10, and it occurred to me every week with every episode, every episode took a turn and I couldn't wait for the next week. The way the writers managed to make each episode so well and make it different from each other over 7 seasons is beyond me. This show teaches us about life, robotics, alien and human encounters, and an overview of the paranormal and how it affects people. What makes this show really interesting are the characters in each episode, they really show emotions and are really good actors. What you will also notice every week is an actor / actress you will know from a past show that is quite nice in its own way. <br /> <br /> If you want to relax and relax with a good science fiction show, then the external limits are for you
