Well, I'm 12, so that's where you can watch the movie from a pre-adolescent's point of view. I also commented on Magnolia and Bicentennial Man, both great films, if you want to take a look. Well, Here on Earth was a beautiful film with stunning scenes and images, very pleasing to the eye. The writer (I don't know who he was, he controls the IMDB) has worked a lot or appreciated love, poetry and drama. I cried 4 times during this movie, once for over 30 minutes. It was really sad, really beautiful, really significant. It's a great film for anyone, let's say, 11 and who is not a maniac of romantic comedy. Yes, it's romantic, yes, it's comic, but (in my opinion), it's better than "She's All That" or "Whatever it takes". I never cry! It's a tender story. Go get it and register it :)
