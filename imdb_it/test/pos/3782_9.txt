Fantastic Chaplin movie with many memorable moments as Charlie joins the army to fight in WW 1. <br /> <br /> At first he goes to the training camp, where he has to learn how to handle his gun and how to walk in line. It's a really fun scene since the tramp is not used to keeping your feet straight! <br /> <br /> The next thing you know is that it's in a trench in France. Amusing scenes include a hungry Charlie who eats the cheese of a mousetrap and reads a letter from home over someone's shoulder. <br /> <br /> When Charlie falls asleep he finds his flooded bunker and his roommate snoring. This is such a fun part! I can't really describe it, just watch the movie. When Charlie wakes up his legs feel numb, so try to "wake them up". He rolled me to the floor when it turns out that his second leg still seems numb ... while Charlie actually rubs his roommate's foot! <br /> <br /> The film gets a little sad, while Charlie shoots a couple of Germans from his trench (even if it's done in a very funny way) and he personified as a tree to get closer to the enemy, saving a his friend from a death squad. <br /> <br /> The last part is he a French girl in trouble hiding in her house. He must therefore save it and while he is doing it also captures the German Kaiser. To do that, he impersonates a German kolonel or something. I like it when Charlie is asked something in German and he's like nein nein nein. The soldier looks at him in a funny way so Charlie changes his mind: ja ja ja! The Kaiser is captured and Charlie is the hero ... but then he wakes up again at the bootcamp, it was just a sweet dream! <br /> <br /> Charlie made one of those previous "dream sequences" (The Bank comes to mind) but who cares, this movie was so funny that it made me laugh all the time. Chaplin also has something to say with this film (as his later work has become more of a social commentary to different mishaps in the world) and is better explained in the last sentence of the film: "Peace on earth, goodwill to the whole humanity. '<br /> <br /> In short: a Charlie classic, very entertaining, timeless 9/10.
