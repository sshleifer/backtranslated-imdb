Incredibly close to the feelings and emotions of real life captured by Joseph Mazzello as a hemophiliac child with AIDS and by his new neighbor, a redneck who wants to be interpreted perfectly by Brad Renfro. Although the story may seem a bit far-fetched (the two boys try to travel several hundred kilometers to find a doctor who claims to have the cure for AIDS), the emotions, actions and interactions of all the characters involved they are tragically close to real life. Being a "big brother" of a boy in a similar situation who died a few years after the release of this film, I strongly recommend this image to anyone who has ever wondered what really happens in the life of a child with AIDS. Peter Horton's superb direction creates the perfect atmosphere and setting for each scene and attracts the viewer into the various emotions influenced by friendship, illness, prejudices and the final separation of two friends who fought hard to overcome adversity .
