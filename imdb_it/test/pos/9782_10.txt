When I heard that there would be an ABC-based miniseries based on life in the Changi camp [WWII POW] ... with a focus on "comedy elements", I was deeply skeptical and somewhat critical. /> <br /> My father had been in the Second World War. Such was the barbarity of the Japanese, he was able to speak of the horrors in and around Labuan (where he was stationed), until recently. Together with my father, I was given the good fortune to meet many great men (of stronger character and spirit than I could ever have), who had witnessed acts of unspeakable barbarism at the hands of the Empire of Japan, and they had not never completely taken back. The name 'Changi' is meant to conjure up horrible images for ages to come ... <br /> <br /> But after seeing, I was very impressed with the cast, characters and complex textures of this wonderful series. Now I consider 'Changi' the highlight of my week, (keep in mind, I've only seen three episodes so far ... I hope the other episodes meet the standards set by the first three). <br /> <br /> Black humor works incredibly well (however, the flatulent beats are a bit exaggerated), and while much of the horror has been suppressed, the series comes close enough in transmitting the intrepid spirit of the survivors who were able to continue with their lives in spite of inhibitory memories. <br /> <br /> The "flashback" format of this series will be difficult to follow, <br /> <br /> but I can't think of anything better to do justice to the men who have suffered from deep emotional processes of internment ... when painfully repressed experiences are remembered, sometimes years after the horror. <br /> <br /> One of the most obscure chapters of the Second World War, the 20th century, and, (I would say so much), in the history of humanity, is transmitted to a new ge through this series, and I hope that serves to convey the overwhelming adversities borne by the generation of wartime. <br /> <br /> Proceeding with "Changi", I don't think I'll ever hear the moving melody 'on the way to Gundagai' the same way again. Tune in...
