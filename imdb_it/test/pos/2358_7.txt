This neo-film noir is part of a genre of American films of the second half of the twentieth century that seem to involve corrupt characters, fast cars, a highway belt and, of course, a lot of guns held by people who seem never to have taken a gun during safety. The actors are the best reason to see "Black Day, Blue Night". There is the late, great J.T. Walsh ("Swing Blade", "Pleasantville", "Red Rock West", "The Last Seduction" and many others), which made many neo-film noir (see also "Breakdown"). Then there is Michele Forbes from the TV series "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and "Homicide". (In a secondary role, there is also the late Bejamin Lum, who also appeared in an episode of Star Trek entitled "The Naked Now.") A spoiler of some kind - a clue indeed: only the most innocent survive, but innocence is a very relative term in a film like this, and you probably won't guess who is innocent before the final reel.
