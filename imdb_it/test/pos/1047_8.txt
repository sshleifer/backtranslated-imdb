A journalist from the magazine who writes about life in her country house when she actually lives in a New York apartment must find a plan when she learns that her publisher and a war hero will spend Christmas with her. After a slow start, it turns into an entertaining comedy, thanks to a refined cast. In a big deviation from his previous role as a femme fatale in "Double Indemnity", Stanwyck shows a nice comic atmosphere. Morgan is as agile as the affable war hero, while Greenstreet is well established as a publisher. However, Sakall steals the film like a chef trying to master the English language while speaking with an almost incomprehensible European accent.
