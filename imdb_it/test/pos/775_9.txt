I saw this movie on ITV and loved it. He was very watchable and very funny. Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles. Julie Walters receives a special mention as she creates an interesting and interesting character. Ben's character is rather shy and stoic, but the changes he undergoes are wonderfully played by Rupert Grint, I would say he has a future in acting after Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> Laura Linney is quite good in her role as the protective mother of Ben, the only thing they have done wrong is having her too ... Bad. Ben's father was also an interesting contrast to his mother, and in the end he is also very honorable. The only character I wasn't thrilled with was Bryony, it was a bit simple and pointless I thought. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great comedy drama that is very easy to watch. one of my favorite movies of the year easily.
