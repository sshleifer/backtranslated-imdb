I was just looking at "who will love my children" to buy, when I came across this website and a voice made by another Englishman !! I'm a big fan of this movie and I would have recommended it to everyone. What I found comforting was finding someone else who also found comfort in the good will of others. I also have a son with Aspergers (among other things) and it is also my fear to think that if anything happens to me and my husband, someone would not just want to take my beautiful "normal" daughter, but also my special son and gifted. Missing home and being able to relate to people who have grown up with the same values ​​as myself has more meaning than you know. Living here in the United States, I haven't met anyone who has seen this movie. So to all of you who read this, if you haven't seen it, make an effort to do it. It is a very moving experience, especially for those who are parents, or even if you have only one sympathetic bone in your body, you cry and beg. After that you will count your blessings, and to anyone who has ever had a similar experience, or close to it, my heart turns to you. It makes me understand, no matter how difficult or stressful it is, to remind yourself that there is always someone who is worse off than you. A fantastic film and what makes it more powerful is the fact that it is based on a true story. Do not be discouraged by how sad it is, at the same time this film is warming your heart and makes you feel encouraged by the strength and goodness of humanity.
