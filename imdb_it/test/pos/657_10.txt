I saw this film for the first time in 1980 and touched a string that reminded me of a more innocent moment. Norman Rockwell's initial narrative, music and paintings set the tone for me. Either you love the movie or you hate it. Jan Michael Vincent was the best ever and played Cpl Marion Hedgepeth innocently and touchingly. This film is on top of my favorites of all time, a pity it is no longer available on DVD or VHS. The ending was also wonderful. John Hancock has done a wonderful job in capturing the essence of time.
