David Lynch's ninth feature film, Mulholland Drive, is a touching story about betrayal and jealousy. If anything, it brutally contrasts our ambitions and hopes for the often bitter truth. Every frame of this film has importance and links to other parts and to themselves at the same time. Nothing is what it seems to be and it remains a real headache when you end up trying to put the pieces together. It is a film that does not compromise and cannot completely manage the shape and language of the camera, as could have happened previously with Lost Highway. <br /> <br /> Although it clearly recognizes the classic Lynx motifs and devices, the film remains very original, also in light of the fact that it is a Lynch film. Lost Highway has marked a new way to tell a story; generated an unconventional means of putting emotions on the screen. With Mulholland Drive, Lynch not only managed to control this technique, but took it to new levels to make it much more complex and multi-dimensional. In doing this, it creates a structure of different layers in time and in the human mind. At a press conference at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, David Lynch said that striving for perfection could give a result where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Speaking of synergies like this becomes very important for Mulholland Dr., where the different sequences and many details contribute to the total; dreamlike and parallel landscapes intertwine to create history. In some art, its beauty lies in its simplicity. This is not the case with Mulholland Drive, and it has never been with Lynch. It is the complexity that colors and builds the worlds created by Lynch, the same complexity that characterizes the real world. <br /> <br /> It is never forced as, in my opinion, for example, Memento does, using an original way of communicating with viewers. Comparing Mulholland Drive further with other films, I think it shows that David Lynch is a master of what he does and bridges art and film production in a way that no one has ever done. Compared to Alejandro Jodorowsky or the contemporary Matthew Barney, I believe that Lynch can more clearly not let the artist dominate the director or, more likely, David Lynch understand and interpret the film as an art form. <br /> <br /> Understanding the plot is no small feat, but the way Lynch works with sound, perspective, chronology and form paints a work of art so dark and frightening that sometimes it seems more realistic than real life. Lynchian cinema is often, and certainly in Mulholland Drive, a wave of human emotions. Working with emotions is a delicate job that requires understanding and depth. As Lynch says: "A little too much, and the emotion goes away, a little too little, and it doesn't happen". In Mulholland Drive, David Lynch has no problem making this balance. Lynch's portraits embrace all kinds of dimensions and take different directions, creating incredibly realistic characters and situations. Watching Mulholland Drive is a journey into the subconscious. It is a truthful and naked film with unquestionable artistic value. This is why I love Mulholland Drive and what brought it to the pinnacle of film history. The definitive film.
