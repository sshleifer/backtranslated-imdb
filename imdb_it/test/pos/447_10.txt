The "silver screen" is freshly colored with this beautiful film about happy aging and enjoying the rainbows of life. There is a lot of silver hair on this silver screen, but the movie's namesake is more like 85-going-25 with its energy, humor and lust for life. The story of the extraordinary entertainer Uncle Frank, his devoted wife Aunt Tillie and the zippy residents of local nursing homes inspire us to "live every day as if it were the last" and bring a glimmer of hope to those golden years often feared. A great film for young and old viewers!
