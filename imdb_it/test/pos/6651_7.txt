The initial premise is based on the American civil war, but ultimately it is a love story. We start at the beginning of the war, where the main characters (Kidman and Law) are obviously aware of each other and there is an obvious attraction, they have a passionate kiss on the day they leave for war. The main objective of this film is that the character of Law returns to Kidman and his struggles to succeed and his struggle to survive until his return. The reason he can't convince us is that we don't see enough of this relationship before the character of Law starts the battle - it's hard to believe the premise that 2 people wish each other so much that they had so little contact . All the rest is fine, Renee Zellweger and her father in charge and her entourage are delightful additions, as is the threat of the gang chasing deserters. Sure, it's a long film, but it keeps the interest and the cinematography is fantastic. An honorable attempt that does not make it but still deserves a watch.
