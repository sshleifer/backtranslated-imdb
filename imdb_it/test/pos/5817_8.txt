Minnie and Moskowitz is the most pathetic and ungainly love story I've ever seen. Between Minnie, a disillusioned museum curator whose violent fianc√© is married to the download and leaves her even more tense and confused than she already is, and Seymour Moskowitz, a parking attendant so desperate for the attention his nights go by going to bars and restaurants aggravating people, there is a chaotic and disenchanted game from the beginning. Just like so many pairs we see every day. <br /> <br /> In almost all love stories, there is a man and a woman, the confident, amusing, classic or attractive man in his own way, whose shortcomings are fascinating, and the woman a hurt soul that any man who wants those who choose this boy could have because there is only something in him. These films make everyone feel so good because the characters embody what every man and woman wants to be, not what they are. Minnie and Moskowitz, instead of indulging in any hint of fantasy in the realm of romance, portray people who could only be more common than attractive and trusting people with so much experience in the field. What is the story behind the love affairs of the ugly, alarming clumsy lifeless and jobless man we encounter, or the woman so paralyzed by insecurity that it is difficult to talk to her? <br /> <br /> the film is not as fascinating as the faces of Cassavetes or the opening night, but it has that compelling quality that Cassavetes has always fought with so much effort to render, which is a wild representation of people under the ego hiding behind itself in almost all other films. Gena Rowlands and Seymour Cassel, who offer surprisingly pitiful people, are not nice at all. Moskowitz almost drives us crazy, not to mention Minnie. He imposes himself with so much strength in his life, the dates are an explosion of our inner voices that respond to the discomfort screaming inept to the dates in which we have all been, to the refusals we have all swallowed and to the arguments that we have all had that we know that they were our faults. I admire a film like Minnie and Moskowitz because, as the trademark is with the films that Cassavetes has proclaimed itself, it identifies with us with 100% honesty. Our egos are not part of the company of his characters, therefore an extraordinary result for every actor's performance.
