A strange relationship between a middle-aged woman and a transsexual who will soon become a woman. Charlotte and Venorica, both trapped by their inanimate lives and don't know how to get out. Charlotte owns a beauty clinic, broke up with her aggressive ex-husband, moved to an apartment alone with all the furniture packed except for her big bed. Veronica lives downstairs with her poor dog, is sensitive and desperately annoyed by her mother's visit and the bad relationship with her father. His only hope is that the imminent transsexual operation will turn her into a real woman and then everything will be fine. All you can do now is wait for a certificate of approval. <br /> <br /> Then these two individuals meet by chance and gradually they are all involved in the lives of others, there are some sparks between them, but nobody is brave enough to face the truth because they are not willing to accept the change as most people do. In the end the ending is quite satisfying and leaves some imagination to think about it. <br /> <br /> The director's great work gives me a great impression, he manages the development of the characters very well, the emotional atmosphere is quite full and intense. I too am so obsessed with the dark lights of the whole apartment, Delphic but full of desire. <br /> <br /> Two main characters are played by Trine Dyrholm and David Dencik, they are incredible in their roles, the performance is very impressive and the chemical reaction between them is genuine and convincing. <br /> <br /> This independent Swedish film is about meeting and change, no matter whether you are homosexual or heterosexual, male or female, the strangeness of life exists everywhere, whenever you fall on it, you will be hesitant and bewildered, but at least don't be afraid, follow your heart and choose the right path.
