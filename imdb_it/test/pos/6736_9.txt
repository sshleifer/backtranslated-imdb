Blythe Danner and Judith Ivey offer wonderful shows here as Jonathan Silverman, like Eugene, tells his life in 1937 at Brighton Beach. <br /> <br /> What makes the film so beautiful are the relationships between the characters with an extremely wonderful family values ​​scene. <br /> <br /> Bob Dishy had a wonderful opportunity here as the father of the clan. It gives a contained but compelling performance as the patriarch of the family. <br /> <br /> His sons played by Jonathan Silverman and Brian Dillinger are fabulous. There are certain scenes where Silverman skates or jumps where Jerry Lewis comes to mind. <br /> <br /> As for Danner and Ivey, they too are wonderful. Their mannerisms, intonation and idealism of Jewish culture are magnificently realized by them. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is simply wonderful. Beautiful Brighton in 1937! Although the inevitability of war loomed, the film is full of many of the typical problems faced by families during that time. In a sense, you don't have to be a Jew to experience what your family is experiencing. <br /> <br /> To see for nostalgic enthusiasts and those of us who strongly believe in family values.
