SEPARATE LIES is such an elegant, intelligent and stimulating film and I could have seen Tom Wilkinson forever on the screen. The locations in the English countryside, the wonderful London locations, the interiors, the elegant wardrobes and, of course, the writing and the dialogue made SEPARATE LIES an electrifying adventure. <br /> <br /> Having said that, and maybe this is just an American point of view, since the British are much more sophisticated in managing sexual adventures, I found it difficult to watch Tom Wilkinson waiting while his wife goes cheerfully on her way on a sexual journey that brings her very little joy, she creates a lot of desperation for her husband, with the CAD that is Rupert Everett. Yes, I saw the flaws of Wilkinson's character - his goal for perfection, the desire for everything in his place - but in Emily Watson, he would have to look deeper into his true character and his solid goodness, to understand what he threw away. br /> <br /> Tom Wilkinson turns SEPARATE LIES into a powerful film by watching him experience all the pain, embarrassment and despair on the screen as his wife leaves with another man. And he himself makes the journey in SEPARATE, understanding his faults, embracing his wife, despite all that has happened, and bringing her back to London. Bravo, Tom!
