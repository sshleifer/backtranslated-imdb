It is a strangely powerful and touching experience to see "The English Patient" again after the death of Anthony Minghella. Most of his work is devoted to a shocking point. The eternal moral struggle of those who consciously walk on a very thin line. In "The Talented Mr Ripley" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's love-making Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In "Breaking And Entering" Minghella gives the character of Jude Law the need to confess and the rewards are stirring in a chilling way. Here, in "The English Patient", the characters in love are never too far removed from their corrosive sense of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They tear their characters away from any claim in a convincing complicity with us, the public. Juliette Binoche is simply spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are full of sensual "minghelliana" innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that, in one way or another, represented an elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but he was thinking of his audience. He knew how to press the buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and surprising about Minghella's work. I miss him already but I am grateful for the reflection of his soul that he left behind.
