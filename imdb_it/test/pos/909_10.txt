Transcendental, sophisticated, incisive, emotional, powerful ... I could think of a hundred adjectives to describe this fantastic work of art and intelligence, and anyway I would feel insufficient. All I can say is that I am infatuated with this movie. Applause to Krzysztof Kieslowski, Zbigniew Preisner, Ir√®ne Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant. May "Rouge" live forever.
