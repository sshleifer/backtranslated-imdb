This is a good movie for Chucky fans. Ok, I'm sure it's not as good as the Child's Play movie, but this can get really fun and funny, Chucky's laughter is hilarious. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS) <br /> <br /> Now not a doll, but two, which means double the impact, Jennifer Tilly played the part very well and certainly got the best movie killing. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Child's Play movies this is a movie worthy of your Chucky collection, but if you've never seen the children's play movies before, this will be a new beginning. Obviously you will have no idea how Chucky got into his current state (because I'm not telling you) but you'll understand why Chucky is very popular. <br /> <br /> Overall it's a very fun movie.
