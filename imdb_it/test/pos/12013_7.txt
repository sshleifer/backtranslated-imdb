A real surprise. Not exactly "Disney" family entertainment. Some violence, many moments of tension and a great story based on facts. The theme of "Night Crossing" is, the determination wins. Never losing sight of their goal, two East German families risk everything, in their daring hot-air balloon ride to freedom. History is both heartbreaking and moving. Time is not on their side. East German police are approaching and the result is far from certain until the end. If you are looking for good evening entertainment, which does not contain nudity and limited violence, then I highly recommend "Night Crossing". It's pure fun. - MERK
