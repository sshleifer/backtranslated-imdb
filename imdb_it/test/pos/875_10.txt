This is one of the best movies I've seen in recent years. Belmonndo and Deneuve shine in their respective roles, he as an ingenuous plantation owner and her as an enigmatic cheat. Words will not do justice to this masterpiece, it will suffice to say that this is a film that explores the dark side of love and the pain, the humiliation and the capacity for self-illusion that accompany it, although it is dressed as a film noir . Forget that faint remake with Jolie and Banderas, look at the real article instead and give yourself some moments of great cinematic beauty.
