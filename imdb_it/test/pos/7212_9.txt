These guys combine low-brow with low budget. It is glorious. <br /> <br /> Look ... if you want Bergman, rent "7th Seal" or something. If you want to see gross humor and sex exploitation, this is it. <br /> <br /> I think Jane Jensen as Julia makes everything look watchable. He can really act (very well), he is a complete dream boat and does not seem to feel above everything.
