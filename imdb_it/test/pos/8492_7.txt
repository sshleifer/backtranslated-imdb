The year 2004 was the year of the biopic with no less than four images dealing with real events, real people, with varying degrees of critical praise. Of the four images to get to the Oscar race in early 2005 (KINSEY, THE AVIATOR, HOTEL RWANDA, and, RAY), RAY became the big winner of the evening while the acting award went to Jamie Foxx for his portrait of The genius of the R & B Ray Charles. <br /> <br /> And it was deserved despite Leonardo di Caprio approaching and Liam Neeson not even nominated. What made Foxx the winner was the fact that the other two sounded relatively obscure eccentrics, Ray Charles was still making music until his death in 2004 and since then there wasn't a soul that didn't know at least one song that Charles "I wrote. It was a great help that Jamie Foxx grew up well above the film - a bit weak overall and often would seem not to be out of place like a biographical film - and his interpretation is detailed as it is fierce It has the delicate task of embodying a person to nuances, and once the crisis of Ray's heroin addiction hits a head, Foxx brings out everything and it's not hard to imagine that the real Ray is going through such a painful ordeal. <br /> <br /> The low point of the film is how it spends too much time detailing Ray's relationship with women, as THE AVIATOR, Taylor Hackford wishes to establish that Ray had this his turbulent life, a product of his demons and his entry into success at a time when being black and successful brought a great deal of luggage. Of women, the only one who can bring real life is Sharen Warren as Ray's mother. His is a difficult role since he is alone on the screen with the child actor who plays the young Ray, but his face and body language is tormenting, especially when he has to give up motherhood to ensure that Ray find the house. Such intensity of emotion, staying there and watching your blind son crawl through a room and having to force him to have this rude awakening in independence. A beautiful performance, and one that should have been recognized. <br /> <br /> A fantastic counterpoint to RAY is the music in the foreground. Anyone familiar with R&B will appreciate the first recordings of Ray's radio successes as much as his last ones that would bring him to the forefront of popular music, and Jamie Foxx practically steals the show while playing the songs like Ray. Only this will live even when the film itself is little more than a rigid biopic. However, I would have liked if they had used his latest Adult Contemporary success of 1993, "Sing my Song for You" in the credits. After all, it's Ray Charles, an artist who has had a fierce dedication to his art.
