Beautiful description of the situation in the United States, explains different types of Islam, not only to show terrorists and extremists. Islam can be another thing that kills, they show why some people become terrorists and how to be Muslim without being extremist. It is a great series that Muslims and non-Muslims should see. Now we hope that other series or films will be made to change the idea that all Muslims are terrorists and all Americans want to destroy Islam. It gave me the interest to find out exactly what Islam is and what the United States and also the European government do to help people of different religions live together.
