I liked this program immensely. It is exceptionally well written, with finely judged performances and intelligent images. <br /> <br /> He is also very frank and honest, refreshing compared to the sanitized representation of drug use in movies and on television. <br /> <br /> Unmissable - one of the best TV shows in recent years, and triumph on all scales for Channel 4. <br /> <br /> 9/10
