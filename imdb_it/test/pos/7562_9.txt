I haven't seen this movie in over 20 years, but it has had such an impact on me that I remember listening to the credits for several minutes after admiring them completely. This is one of the most undervalued films of the entire decade in which it was originally published. I just ordered a copy on DVD and paid for shipping overnight and can't wait for it to arrive. It is sometimes uplifting, and also very dark and somewhat disturbing. It's the story of a tight-knit band of normal kids growing up in the city center and making them feel like they're actually sitting on the sidelines, rather than watching a movie screen or TV. Difficult to explain, but it is something that must be experienced. The story begins in childhood and keeps track of the lives of the four main characters through high school and as they embark on their separate journeys in life. The entire cast has done an incredible job and is by far the best job of Jodi Thelen's career. I hope the DVD reminds me and plans to see it this Friday with a good friend.
