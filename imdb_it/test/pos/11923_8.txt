It is not really worthy of a "better image" consideration, but as entertainment goes, it does the job! This is one I've looked at, with accelerating impulses every time, at least a dozen times. <br /> <br /> Many of these actors were unknown at the time this was done, and we can recognize them from other works. Those who do not have the recognition of the current name probably do not want it. <br /> <br /> This was a fun adventure. Kind of like The Little Rascals if they are serious.
