Um ... a serious film about problematic teenagers in Singapore, a country I don't have much knowledge of but I have the previous mistaken impression that all the children there are highly disciplined and controlled by their family and the government. Well, I think I'm wrong, just like in other cities / countries, they also have their troubled kids who also drive the not-so-surprising rebel lifestyle of drugs, confrontations, swear words and ... many other obvious signs of being a bad boy. The surprising part of this film is not really about the way these guys go around causing themselves and other problems, but rather the subtle homosexuality hidden behind their so called loyalty among them. The bond between these "brothers" may very well have originated from an unconscious gay tendency within these boys. Although it is not uncommon for the str8 guys to have a very close friendship with each other, but watch this movie carefully, it should enter all kinds of gay film festivals and I wouldn't be surprised that it can win many more prizes in this direction!
