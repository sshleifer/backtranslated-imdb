Before forgetting, let me tell you that the artwork here is exceptional. From garbage cans to the huge cruise ship, the designs are well made. If this were not animated, critics would praise the "direction" here, because it's really good. <br /> <br /> To history: Sylvester is collecting garbage in shipyards but the pickins are thin. While mulling over the dock next to a large ship, he sees Tweety in his cage in a porthole. Even Tweety identifies him and you know his first comment, the same one he always does when he sees the cat. Anyway, Sylvester rushes in, opens the porthole and says "Hi, breakfast!" Tweety slams the porthole window on his face and says "Old bad cat peeping!" The cat falls into the water. <br /> <br /> The indomitable Sylvester quickly creeps on board the ship, tiptoeing into Tweety's cabin, grabs it and is ready to leave when - wham! - There is "Granny" at the door with the umbrella. Sylvester takes a joke while the old lady once again protects her domesticated bird. But, "gibbet flippety", says the grandmother, "I dropped my glasses, I can't see anything without them". There are barriers in Betsey, where these cheaters are. "<br /> <br /> Now Sylvester has the upper hand ... and the normal scam of the cat trying to catch him is back in action, like his grandmother's glasses. Sylvester's smartest act was to take his glasses and paint a picture of Tweety on them, so when he woke up and put on, he would see the bird and think it was fine. <br /> <br /> In general, a very funny animated short that is It was a lot of fun to watch. As you can see from the quotes, I love dialogue in some of these old cartoons.
