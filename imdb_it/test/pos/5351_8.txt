This was very good, except for two things I will mention at the end. The animation is fantastic, underlined by Nick Park and by the trademark of the exaggerated teeth and the mouths of the characters, which make you laugh almost every time you see someone. Even the color was magnificent. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film, however, is the clever comedy woven everywhere. This is another of these animated films in which there is so much to see and hear every frame that would require many visualizations to capture all the gags. It's just a funny and exaggerated look at the strange "Wallace" and his silent and intelligent dog "Gromit". Along the way, he makes fun of funny people who let themselves be carried away by their gardens, something similar to how the obsessive dog lovers were depicted in "Best Of Show". <br /> <br /> My only complaints were two typical features of today's films, animated or not: 1 - we make the cleric look like a total idiot in the film; 2 - we exaggerate with the final action scene with the predictable but too exaggerated result. Apart from that, this is still a very entertaining film that should provide lots of laughs to many people and a movie to enjoy several times.
