Can the intensity of a husband's love for his wife lead him to cover up a crime, despite the betrayal on many levels? Tom Wilkinson is not a brutal Othello, in the context of modern England. Thus, a network of deceptions gradually begins to be woven. And we see cycles of jealousy and drunkenness, guilt and fornication. And so the network of "separate lies" begins to fail and therefore holds itself together again. And life (and death) continues, despite the brilliant flame of her husband's love and the deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives. How many deception networks have to be shown in this growing tapestry? The impulse is to sustain the reputation, the careers and the relationships in this corner of the world more civilized. Wilkinson offers an emotional performance, full of grace, discretion and decorum, and yet of humanity, of those who have much to hide. Those who want clarity and openness to the path of justice will be disappointed by the wickedness of so much deception. And yet, who among us, does not have something like this to hide about his loved ones? However, the viewer might wonder if this web is destined to collapse someday.
