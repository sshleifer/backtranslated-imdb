KRAMER VS KRAMER has won five Academy Awards, including one for the best film of 1979. This intense and deeply moving family drama follows an advertising executive whose life is turned upside down when his eight-year-old wife approaches him, leaving him to take looking after his son and building a relationship with him that he never had. The incisive script by Robert Benton presents us with spoiled but real human beings with hearts, souls and brains. For example, in the scene where Joanna announces to Ted that she leaves him, she doesn't rush out the door ... she gives him the keys, her credit cards, the dry cleaning ticket, tells him which bills have been paid, and informs him that he withdrew from his bank account the same amount of money he had when they were married, not more. This decision to leave was not a whim ... it was thought and Joanna felt, with no choice but to leave, if she left she would do well ... and without a specific plan in mind, she didn't think it was right to take Billy. Dustin Hoffman won an Oscar for his Ted Kramer, a man so obsessed with bringing home the bacon, he had no idea that his life at home was crumbling. Meryl Streep also won an Oscar playing Joanna, the unhappy wife we ​​like at the beginning of the film, but who changes when she returns for her son. Hoffman is at the top of his form here. I always rip during the scene in which he tries to explain to Billy (Justin Henry, Oscar nominee) because his mother left and he does everything in a whisper on stage or when he meets Joanna on his return and slams his drink in a wall (a Hoffman moment not in the script Streep hadn't been informed of to get a natural reaction). Justin Henry hits all the right notes like Billy, the confused kid who doesn't know why his mother left and doesn't know how to communicate with his father. Jane Alexander also received an Oscar as Ted and Joanna's neighbor, Margaret, who switched alliances to end the film. This is an intense family drama, but there are also laughs here ... Billy and chocolate ice cream ... Billy pouting because Ted is late getting him for a party ... Billy catching the night of a father of his father (JoBeth Williams) in his journey to the bathroom completely naked, but these are the moments of the human drama you remember ... Ted crossing Manhattan with Billy in his arms to reach the emergency room after BIlly falls from the gym of the jungle ... Ted is fired just before he starts his fight for custody and instead of making a scene, he tells the boy in a whisper ... "Shame on you." And, of course, the ending in which Joanna tells Ted she's not taking Billy, which I found a little hard to digest. Why should he make all that mess to denounce custody and then change his mind? But this is a little quibble about a wonderful film, masterfully directed by Robert Benton and impeccably performed by a first-rate cast. A must see.
