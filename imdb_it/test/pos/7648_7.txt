I really didn't know what to expect from this movie and I was pleasantly surprised. I took it because I recently stumbled on Norman Reedus and I'm trying to find other films in which it was. <br /> <br /> I'm not great in hustler movies or movies, but I have to say, this tied me in a few minutes. Probably because I couldn't stop understanding exactly who was looking for who. This film is elegant and frenetic, with a story that is credible thanks to the location and fantastic performances. <br /> <br /> While I was impressed by most of the film, I must say that Dagmara Dominczyk was simply excellent. <br /> <br /> Give it a chance, it's a really fun movie.
