I saw Anatomy years ago - nicknamed in a friend's house I don't remember much, and then I saw in the video store that there is a second one - not really tied to the first, Franka Ponte makes a small cameo. And that was ok not as good as the first one. I will see the first one again tonight, not the double edition of collectors. I really like German films like this, it's very interesting and people and cults like that in the movie might exist I think, I don't know. But it's very grossly funny and scary. Anatomy 2 is a little different and the characters are not as good as the first. But if you really thought that Anatomy was interesting and good you should see the second one.
