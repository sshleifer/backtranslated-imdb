I saw this black and white noir comedy yesterday at the London Film Festival. Structurally, it has been compared to Pulp Fiction, but it is perhaps closer to the structure of Amores Perros and to the mood of Kevin Smith's Clerks. Four stories intersect in a French highway restaurant. The first cartoon has Franck (Edouard Baer) who is running down a restaurant outlet. The waitress, Suzie (Anna Mouglalis) has pity and tells him her story. The second has two incompetent captors, Leon (Bouli Lanners) and Paul (Serge Lariviere) take a teenager from his rich family. Unfortunately for them, she is suicidal and her family doesn't seem to want her back. The third is a dialogue between two old rock stars who meet each other at the restaurant (Alain Bashung and Arno play themselves). The last part concerns about four former criminals who smuggle their old companion out of the hospital to visit their old hideout which has since been turned into ?? dinner. An "epilogue" returns to Franck and Suzie to complete their story (not really an epilogue, plus a conclusion). <br /> <br /> The structure doesn't really work. The stories are not sufficiently intertwined like in Pulp Fiction. Nor is dinner crucial to the action of at least two of the stories in the way the car accident was fundamental in the four stories of Amores Perros. The quality of individual stories varies. The history of hiding is a nice idea, with a couple of good gags, but it doesn't come out; and the rockstar meeting is useless and boring. On the other hand, the kidnapping story is hilarious, although its connection to the restaurant is tenuous. The most balanced and successful story is that of Franck and Suzie. <br /> <br /> This film is not entirely successful but has moments of interest and hilarity. I look forward to seeing other works by writer / director Samuel Benchetrit.
