I've seen this movie many times and never get sick. it is a man who comes out of the closet, who does not know he is inside. The character of Kevin Kline is a teacher and when one of his former students announces that the character of Kline is gay, the people in his town start to speculate whether he is straight or gay. Kline's character begins to wonder if he is straight or gay. The acting is absolutely fabulous and exhilarating for the whole cast. I found the movie very funny and exciting. i love this movie, it makes you laugh and makes you feel good while you watch it. I recommend this movie to everyone, you'll have fun watching it.
