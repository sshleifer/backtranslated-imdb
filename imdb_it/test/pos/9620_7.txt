Hong Kong filmmaker Chang Chang Ho's 1972 "Five Fingers of Death" film is widely regarded by many film experts and kung-fu fans as the martial arts film that started it all. <br /> <br /> Released in 1972, it was phase two of the three-step process that would lead to the explosion of martial arts films in the West - "Billy Jack" (1971), with its famous showdown. Hapkido in the park, was published the year before, and Bruce Lee starred in "Enter the Dragon" (1973) two years later, thus consolidating the role of martial arts films in Western cinema. <br /> <br /> But what is the commotion about "Five Fingers of Death"? The film, with its terrible dubbing, explosive (if not highly unlikely) action sequences and technical flaws and all, has a plot, albeit a very subtle one. Chih-Hao (the late Lo Lieh) is a young and dedicated student of the Chinese gong-fu who is selected to represent his school in an upcoming martial arts tournament. His teacher offers him to self-train in the "Iron Fist" fighting style, a style so deadly that he can easily kill a man with one shot. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Chih-Hao's arrival at the school coincides with a violent conflict with a rival school, its students and a trio of culprits murderers from Japan. Before you know it, an important setback threatens Chih-Hao's training, and his ability to represent his beloved school in the next tournament. <br /> <br /> Let me say that "Five Fingers of Death" is actually the movie that started it all. As another spectator said, "Five Fingers of Death" helped establish many standards in martial arts films over the next thirty years: Asian, European and North American martial arts films. These standards include the dedicated student, learning patience and resistance, conflicts between rival schools, intense ethnic animosity between Chinese and Japanese, and learning a system of struggle for that good reason for action old style: revenge. "Five Fingers of Death" would also be a major influence on the American filmmaker Kill Bill's films (Tarantino borrowed quite freely from this project, among many others, just for what you know). <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty good, considering the fact that this is a martial arts movie of the early 1970s, the best of which is Lo Lieh. As the atypical student of martial arts, his performance is quite innovative, even if at first sight in this film you wouldn't really know it because of how that particular arc of characters was made to die so many times over the years. He is quite modest in his acting, he does everything he can to persevere on his enemies and not fight them for anger or to fall to their level of stupidity or arrogance. Also, when he suffers his setback, your heart sinks a little because it is so brutal and you wonder if he can recover enough to fulfill his ambition for life. <br /> <br /> "Five Fingers of Death" is a classic in every sense. It's not absolutely perfect, and viewers would be crazy for expecting something like the "Godfather" of martial arts movies. What it offers you is the last example of the oriental melee combat of the time before the oriental cinema was an important appointment in the West. <br /> <br /> 7/10 <br /> <br /> PS: "Enter the Dragon" Bolo Yeung also appears as the Mongolian street fighter near the beginning of the film.
