Joseph Conrad's timeless novel, Heart of Darkness, was featured in the 1994 film. I read Conrad's novel and, I must say, although I prefer the novel itself, the film was a great representation. The set and costumes gave life to Conrad's novel on screen as we followed Marlow's journey. Acting has also given life to the characters through mannerisms, voices and personalities. If you've read the novel, I suggest you also see this movie. If you haven't read the novel, however, the film could be more difficult to follow. Conrad's Heart of Darkness is too full of action, emotion and information to transform into a film that lasts just over an hour and a half. Therefore, if you haven't read the novel, the plot of the movie might seem too messy to follow. Overall I gave this movie a seven out of ten. The basic plot of the novel was brought to the screen with large sets, costumes and acting. However, nothing can replace the original work of Joseph Conrad.
