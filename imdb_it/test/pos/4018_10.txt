An interesting film based on three of Jules Verne's novels. Considering the special effects and computer animation of today, this film represents a historical indicator of cinematographic initiative and imagination. Karel Zeman gave birth to the lithographic images of the original texts by Jules Verne. this is a must see for classic science fiction and history buffs. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 9 out of 10. Have fun !!
