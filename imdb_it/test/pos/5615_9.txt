I really enjoyed this movie and I'm not a fan of classical music. The story of the street kid who discovers classical music and changes his ways was great to look at, without being sentimental or too unbelievable, even if some details have scratched my head (Frankie and his dog can live in the school basement without the students or teachers who discovered it? Where did you eat? Do you take a bath? Did you ever have a change of clothes? What did you feed with your dog? The school owner did not think it was important to alert the research police of a missing boy, but let him live in the basement indefinitely? :-)). But we can slide these unrealistic details and enjoy the moving, fun and slightly suspenseful story (for me, anyway) and wonderfully talented children. <br /> <br /> I loved the scene with the mothers standing shoulder-to-shoulder on the steps that prevent the cops from entering the school: I doubt they will do well today. And I liked the gentle touch of the boy that Frankie stole from turning the tables on him (even though he never went anywhere), and Frankie's friends who helped him eventually. <br /> <br /> All in all, a great movie for everyone!
