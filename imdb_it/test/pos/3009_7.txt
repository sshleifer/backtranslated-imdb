I could not believe the sweet eyes from beginning to end. Be a fan of films directed by masters of music video. I am happy to report that photography in this film is a shine to the eyes. There are so many rich and complete images that are asked of me, that every time I see this film, I find something new that I've never seen before. As with the previous films I've seen, like Blade and Mystery Men, even by former music video directors, the use of color to capture attention is very well used. Even if the characters could have been developed better, the action and the costume were worth the price of admission. I recommend buying it for your DVD collection. Even if you haven't seen it on the big screen, you won't be disappointed. I know I wasn't.
