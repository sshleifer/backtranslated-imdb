This is certainly the most intimate and stimulating piece of Nolan. Not to mention that Memento or Insomnia are bad, but they were definitely up to Hollywood standards ... while following is more than an independent film. The story is very bright and very well developed. Overall ... look at this if you're a fan of one of Nolan's works, I'm sure you'll be able to appreciate it more.
