1. I saw Branaghs Hamlet: Branagh is too old, he often speaks with a high-pitched voice (contrary funny!) - not a convincing Hamlet, and his directorial qualities - poor! (see also a lot of noise for nothing from Branagh - the fun parts of the dialogues were mostly cut by not talking about the directors' mistakes in the dialogue cuts!) 2. I saw Hamlet 2000: I think the scenario is an interesting idea - But these crappy actors - all of them 3. Orson Welles Hamlet is OK - but this BBC Hamlet is the best! Derec Jacobi is convincing - it seems a bit moody - very suitable! and Patric Stewart - wonderful, and Claire Bloom is a very attractive queen. Believe those actors what they're saying - I think this is the best compliment.
