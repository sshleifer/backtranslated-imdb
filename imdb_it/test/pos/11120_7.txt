Film follows a group of students in New York's High School of the Performing Arts. There is Coco (Irene Cara), a black singer who will manage to reach the top despite everything. A white musician is helped by Bruno (Lee Curren). Then there's Doris (Maureen Teefy) who wants to be an actress - but she is shy and scared. Become a friend of Motgomery (Paul McCrane) - presumably the only gay student in the school and a friend of Raul (Barry Miller). Then there is Leroy (Gene Anthony Ray - who sadly died in 2003), who is homeless and a great dancer - but he can't read. Then there are several teachers (Albert Hague, Anne Meara) who try to teach children. <br /> <br /> The songs are FANTASTIC (the title song and "Out Here On My Own" were nominated for the best song-- "Fame" won), the dances are energetic and the young cast shows much ambition and talent. BUT this movie lacks the boat in the drama department. Many plot lines are shown and completely left open at the end of the film. Why does Coco do porn? Doris and Raul remained together afterwords? Or did you do it? What about Montgomery - what happened to him? And did Leroy ever graduate, and how? There are too many long speeches (Raul has two) and moments that lead to nothing. I assume there were cuts in the script - I can't believe the movie left it all open. <br /> <br /> However, it is worth seeing for the acting and, again, the music. There is practically no bad song and the dances are going full blast (and at some point they stop the traffic - literally!). My favorites are "Fame", "Out Here ..." and "I Sing the Body Electric", which is a great closing song. So I recommend it, but I can only give it a 7 - the script was really necessary to tie the parts together - and it didn't happen that way. <br /> <br /> Curiosities: they wanted to shoot this film at the school proper for Performing Arts but it was not possible to get permission. The school principal read the script and said there was too much oath in the film. This is true - there is a lot of vulgar language, but that's how high school kids talk. Avoid the TV version that overwrites abysmally.
