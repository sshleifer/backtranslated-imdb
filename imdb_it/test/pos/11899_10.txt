I finally see the El Padrino movie, from what I see it's an incredible film, and a lot of action Damian Chapa is a good director, but I have to admit that I love his acting at its best. <br /> <br /> I saw the backstage that was edited by a lady named kinga, who needs to go back to school and learn to change. <br /> <br /> However, the film El Padrino is a real action movie. Why don't most of the people who direct do not put together films that ask you what the plot is? I'm so happy to see someone I know as a great actor becoming a great director too. <br /> <br /> I am one of those people who love to see artists make it. <br /> <br /> BS
