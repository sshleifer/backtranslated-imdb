A film that reveals the discomfort of modern men and women in life in the face of death. We are beyond simple religious belief in the afterlife, and moreover in every kind of hell or paradise. Religion is declared dead Yet human beings are more obsessed than ever by death, especially since we can drive them away for quite a long time. Furthermore, the scientific and technological development of our societies leads us to believe that we can explain everything, know everything and do everything. It was quite typical of the late 20th century. Today things are changing, especially when the president of the United States itself, Barack Obama, in a public speech to journalists talks about their search for truth and qualifies that truth as relative of course because it is more a search than an end, a goal or a result. The film shows the end of the good old metaphysical thought that was beginning to evolve into an obsession with truth, an obsessive conception that the truth was unique and irreversible. Post modernism had not yet reached Hollywood, although today it seems to have reached the White House. So some young doctors and medical students decide to go to death and come back. Technically it is possible but the result is not surprising. Reactivate the old feelings of guilt and the frustrations that had been buried in the unconscious. One has to do with a drug-addicted father of a Vietnam-based veteran who commits suicide, another with a boy who was stoned to death by someone else, another with a young black girl who was bullied in the elementary schools of racism, sexism and hatred if not fear in the face of his shyness. It is so naive that you could cry for the shame of these highly qualified young adults and behave like babies crying for their bottles of sweetened fruit juice. But the film is interesting but in something completely different. The setting and the shooting and every single detail or treatment of every detail are baroque, morbid, decadent, almost in the style of "Death in Venice" or Greenaway, or other works of art that deal with making friends with the enemy basic that death is. Obviously this does not save the film, but at least this makes it worthy of being seen. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID
