I think Shane Black is one of the greatest action writers ever! He gave us the fantastic (at the moment) Lethal Weapon, shooting Mel Gibson at the super star. Then followed the second best film in which Bruce Willis ever was (The Last Boyscout). He got a little closer to The Last Action Hero, but he redeemed himself with this, The Long Kiss Goodnight. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of action movies, this one has it all ... Action, Comedy, Thrills, then tops it with more Action, Comedy and Thrills. Geena Davies is fantastic, Samual L Jackson is even bigger. Not to be missed! <br /> <br /> 9/10
