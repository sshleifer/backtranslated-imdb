The melodrama that tells the story of Sally, the tomboy dancer in the circus, raised by the actress of shows McGargle (played by WC Fields), he with the top hat, the mustache, the checked pants and the skill as juggler, pickpocket and runner of carnival games like Three Card Monte and the Old Shell Game. McGargle raised Sally, who worships him as his "real father" from Sally's mother (kicked out of her father's house, a judge, when he married a "circus man") died and left Sally orphaned. Sally is gritty and loyal to McGargle, regardless of what she can do, but McGargle seems to feel guilty for keeping her in the circus instead of with her family all these years. When they end up performing at a carnival in the city where his wealthy grandparents live, McGargle uses the opportunity to "investigate" the real family of Sally, with the idea that he can give it back to her. But grandpa the judge immediately takes a dislike to Sally because he doesn't like a "show girl" - what a stern and petty man he is, a real piece of that type! Meanwhile, Sally is committed to being chased by a handsome and rich young man, the son of the man who helped his grandfather get his wealth. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie with a few laughs here and there and sort of a weird editing style (I don't know how to describe it differently from how it shows long shots, so jump back a few seconds or change suddenly angle when a close-up is shown). Carol Dempster, who plays Sally, is delicious here - quite cute and comical in her performance. BATHROOM. Fields, even without his famous voice, is very funny - just the way he moves and his funny and comical reactions to things (like a little dog seen in a funny scene), we even see him briefly fiddling with this. I love the few looks at the circus and the old-fashioned carnival that is shown here. The print of this feature on the DVD is very nice, it has a slight sepia tone and the score for this is really excellent, performed by Philip Carli based on the original cards.
