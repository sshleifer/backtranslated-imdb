I think the consensus is pretty unanimous on this recent television miniseries: okay, but it's very different from "Lonesome Dove". It is compared to the latter simply because this is a prequel to that famous story. <br /> <br /> "Commanche Moon" certainly deserves a watch for all western fans. Don't expect it to be as intense as "Lonesome Dove". Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are not Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, and the characters they play are not as strong as Duvall and Jones played the same two boys. Some say it is unfair to criticize this film because of the comparison, but you have to compare it - it's the story of the same two main characters of the Texas Ranger: "Woodrow Call" and "Gus McCrae". <br /> <br /> the main difference, I found, is that this prequel is much slower and more relational (the two Rangers and their women) sometimes. Still, I didn't mind because the two main women were beautiful ladies and generally nice and nice people. They were played well by Linda Cardelini ("Clara Forsythe") and Elizabeth Banks ("Maggie"). They helped make this long film attractive. If you saw pictures of women in the Old West, none of them looked as cute as Cardelini and Banks, anyway. They were a joy for these male eyes to watch. Maggie's "Newt" son was also a wonderful boy - the kind of guy every parent would want ... <br /> <br /> The most interesting character, I thought, turned out to be "Inish Scull", played by Val Kilmer. As in the western movie, "Tombstone", Kilmer almost steals the show from the leads. "Scull" is really an original, if I've ever seen one: a strange type, really. <br /> <br /> Actually, all the supporting actors here did a great job, from "Deets" by Keith Robinson to Wes Studies to "Buffalo Hump". I always find that Studios is fascinating, regardless of the role he plays. I wish he had had a more important role in this miniseries. <br /> <br /> Something that this film has in common with "Lonesome Dove" and other good westerns: scenery and photography. It's simply beautiful sometimes and it's a joy to watch. We also have an excellent director of this film: Simon Wincer, who directed "Lonesome Dove" and another outstanding western TV, "Crossfire Trail". He also made two of my other favorite films, both based in his home country, Australia: "Phar Lap" and "Quigley Down Under". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, although I liked it, "Commanche Moon" is nothing like the films mentioned above. However, I still saw it all and I was sorry it ended, if that makes sense. It made me want to see Woodrow and Gus again, this time with Tommy Lee and Robert. <br /> <br /> Note: the title page says it is 360 minutes. This must have included TV commercials. The two-disc DVD version I saw was about 4 hours and 40 minutes.
