Golden Boy is an ecchi humor (bordering on hentai) as "educational moments". The main character, Kintaro, wanders around the most silly situations involving women ... It's just that he's shy on the surface, but he analyzes everything until he can learn something from it. The most striking feature of the series are the circumstances surrounding his "education", which are absolutely embarrassing, but at the same time amusing.
