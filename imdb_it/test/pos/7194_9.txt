I saw Asterix and Obelix in operation Cleopatra, which was my first exposure to the live action version of the classic comic. Like the comic, the entire film is full of puns based on word games, anachronistic lines and slapstick gags that rarely fall flat. <br /> <br /> Asterix and Obelix are Gauls that use a potion of strength to fight the Roman legions in their Gaul. Here they end up in Egypt to help a friend build Cesar's palace (yes he is picky) in three months to prove that the Egyptians are as good as the Romans. <br /> <br /> The reason I chose it is because Monica Belluci is Cleopatra. She's good but the role is little more than a cameo. However, although it is rarely in the film, I didn't care because he was so smart and the jokes so funny that I was in hysterics. I loved it. I liked it so much that I can't understand why the movies were never released in the United States. <br /> <br /> The import DVD has the film in English, which is quite good especially when you consider that when you look at it in the longer French version word games (and therefore the lines) are not always evident from moment they are phonetic, so if you read the wrong names the lines are lost. Most of the jokes between the full French version and the shorter English one seem to be exactly the same, although some have sometimes been changed for the better and sometimes for the worse. Personally, I will continue with the dub when I look at it again since it's easier to get the jokes and enjoy the humor. <br /> <br /> You really want to see it if you love word games and low eyebrows, but good humor This is a great comedy
