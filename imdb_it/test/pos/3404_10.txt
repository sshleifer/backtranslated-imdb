I saw this movie when I was much younger but it caught me. I loved the relationship between Orry and George so much. I was so entranced by the love story of Orry and Madenline. I am a hopeless romantic, so it really struck me. I particularly liked it when he first met her. I just hope he had more time with her and their baby. So you know that in the third book I felt so sick to die. I didn't really understand it because they had little time together. I loved Patrick in this movie. I just bought all three books and I can't stop watching them. My 12 year old son is stuck on it. He likes fighting in the war. I cry every time. I wish I could meet Patrick and Madeline in person! It was a wonderful film and cast!
