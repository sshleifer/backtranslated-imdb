the film itself is absolutely brilliant, it's that buzz, that haste that makes you want to go out, skip your wages and lose yourself. It's what the weekend is, it's our healing where we can get together and be ourselves without a cure in the world. The film is layered in depth and the dialogue in the places is right, especially with Jip. The characters themselves are immediately likeable, one in particular is obviously the character of the dyers and his opinions on what "Star Wars" really is, genius. <br /> <br /> If you ever have an hour to kill before going out, keep it up, you will immediately feel confident, I recommend it.
