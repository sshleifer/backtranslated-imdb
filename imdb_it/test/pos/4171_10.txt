Wow. We watched this movie in the hope that he would have at least some decent rock climbing scenes. We were disappointed, but it was still a great movie! It was really great that it was great! I haven't laughed so much during a movie for a long time. If you like rock climbing and you like good films, this is absolutely for you!
