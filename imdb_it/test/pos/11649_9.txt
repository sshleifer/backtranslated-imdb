If you think about it, it's almost unbelievable that you can make a movie about the death penalty (one of the most controversial topics in the world) that offends neither those for nor against. It is a testimony of Tim Robbins' extraordinary intelligence and sensitivity, traits that can also be seen in his acting roles (Shawshank Redemption, Jacob's Ladder). <br /> <br /> This film actually suggests a subtle compromise between "for" and "against" fields ... so subtle that it can't be put into words, subtle to the point of fading away, but you get the feeling after seeing the image that a compromise is possible, that somehow can be processed if we only look deeply enough ...
