Sometimes good things happen by chance. <br /> <br /> I had never heard of "Silverwing" until the end of 2005 - I was looking through channels and happened to see something about Toon Disney with the bats in a sawmill attacked by owls. I had no idea what it was, but I was motivated to stay tuned - it was difficult to wait for an advertisement so that I could find out what it was called! <br /> <br /> Part of what intrigued me was the appearance of bats - first of all, they didn't use the popular convention of giving bats "extra fingers" where their thumb claws should be. Rather, they have palms like human hands, but the fingers are longer and have canvases of skin between them. <br /> <br /> Even the faces - they look like human beings (in fact, at a certain point I wondered if they had once been human but turned into bats). I don't usually like cartoon animals, but it worked here - the story is a human story, even if it's bats and other animals (not unlike The Lion King). <br /> <br /> What I saw on TV were the last two parts of the "trilogy". I was lost at the beginning of the first, "Towers of Fire" (the second ever), but for the most part I saw each of them. However, I found myself wanting to understand what was happening, since the first part had not been started and I would not have captured it anyway. <br /> <br /> But I saw that it was based on a book by Kenneth Oppel. How lucky that I paid attention and wrote it - I was very disappointed when I learned that the series WAS NOT AVAILABLE! It wasn't even the recent one that made sense to not be available yet. <br /> <br /> However, I found not only the Silverwing book, but also the two Sunwing and Firewing sequels. When I read the first book, I was asked "Is that so?" Not only because much of what is in the series is not in that book, but even though I had not seen the animated version, the Silverwing book (otherwise a good story) does not end so much as it stops. Only one free end is tied - Shade and Marina meet the Silverwing colony at Hibernaculum. <br /> <br /> In fact, Silverwing and Sunwing should have (in my opinion) published in a single volume, because they make for a complete story together, but not separately. <br /> <br /> Actually, the animated version takes some elements from Sunwing (for example, Orestes, the lifting of the ban on seeing the sun) and some were completely original. It's not perfect, but it's definitely a lot of fun. I like both versions of the Silverwing saga. <br /> <br /> That's why I'm glad it will finally be available in June. It's been a long moment coming, and it's worth the wait.
