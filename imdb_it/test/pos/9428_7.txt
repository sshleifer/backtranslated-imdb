For propaganda reasons during World War II, Sherlock Holmes was transferred to the then present. One of the results is "Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon", starring Holmes, Basil Rathbone, along with Nigel Bruce, Lionel Atwill, Dennis Hoey and Kaaren Verne. It is Holmes' job to deliver a scientist, Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.) and his weapons project to the British government before the Germans can get it. Once the man reaches England, however, his problems are just beginning. Can Holmes decipher the message left by Dr. Tobel before falling into the hands of the evil Moriarity, save for the weapon and perhaps even the scientist? This is an effective story of Holmes, set in the atmosphere of Switzerland and the English blackout. The series has worked well nowadays. He was not without his problems, but those problems had nothing to do with the time period. Whose idea was it to make Watson an idiot? The characterization of Nigel Bruce - helped and encouraged by the screenplays - has always been the false note. I much prefer the characterization of Edward Hardwicke in the Jeremy Brett series Sherlock Holmes - there, he is attractive, intelligent and a credible companion for Holmes. In the Rathbone series, Holmes is often condescending and treats Watson as the crazy fool he is. However, in this particular film, Watson has the possibility of being very useful in different parts. <br /> <br /> I admit to being a complete lymph for Riccardo II's acting of Rathbone - "... this blessed plot, this land, this England" - I can't imagine how much it meant for the English to watch the film in 1942. Sherlock Holmes really served his purpose.
