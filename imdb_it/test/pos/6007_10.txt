Excellent storytelling and cinematography. Touching and pungent social commentary. <br /> <br /> Superb effects. Well filmed and acted. <br /> <br /> However, the parallel action between the present and the travel adventures (although very well done) sometimes drags a little too much (about 3 hours), and over-interrupts the flow of history. <br /> <br /> I first read the book as a child and enjoyed the parts of the giants and tiny people, but the book lost me when it arrived on the floating island and land of the "yahoos"! Well, even if the plot of the adventure may seem a story for children, it is actually a very adult story, full of symbolism about the moral decadence in England at the time of Jonathan Swift, the author of the novel on which the film is based.
