I just want to say that I was happy to find these comments on the show. I tried online research for information on the show in the past with no luck. I loved the show. I have difficulty feeling motivated to exercise, but this show made it fun. As another comment he said it wasn't as complicated as the routines nowadays. It was an ideal workout that did the job! I would give anything to buy a copy of a single workout. I remember many of the moves, but not nearly all. Someone please try to put it back on the air and make it available on DVD too. It's so nice to know that I wasn't the only one who loved this show! Thanks for making my day!
