This film is a fantastic remake of the original with the same title. The film was beautiful, despite the fact, I hate new ones! The whole cast was fantastic. It has an exceptional cast and a fantastic plot !! The main plot is that a man is poisoned and must solve his murder, clean eh ?! Dennis Quaid is the man who is "DOA" (in other words Dead On Arrival). Find help with his friends, but everyone is now a suspect !! Dennis's character has several hours to find out who poisoned him. The film is quite fast and full of action. You can see two other big stars in Meg Ryan (City Of Angels, Courage Under Fire) and Daniel Stern (Home Alone, Very Bad Things, Bushwhacked) in secondary roles in this fantastic, fantastic remake of a classic movie !!
