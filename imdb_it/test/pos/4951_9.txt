I really like the opening of the film, when Colonel Ted Masters realizes on his combat radar that four enemy aircraft are approaching from around 10. The good news is that the film does not mention at the beginning that the colonel, along with a gregarious fighter who was a lieutenant, was trying to do a "freedom of navigation" exercise along the eastern Mediterranean Sea, but he went a little too far beyond the restricted area of ​​airspace reserved for a mediocre Middle Eastern nation as they accidentally move beyond. <br /> <br /> I also like all the interconnections on the colonel fighter's radar displays and on the computer display while the enemy plane aggressively chooses the two American combat pilots in an engagement for violating their airspace . That first dogfight immediately reminds me of the famous fighter pilot movie, "Top Gun". From the waxing of the enemy bandits to the thirty-miliary blows of the enemy aircraft that hit the colonel's jet engines and forcing the plane to descend, forcing him to expel, all this reminds us of one thing ... the fighting techniques with the dogfight can keep you alive ... but a false move can make you break down. <br /> <br /> The only problem in the film was the "snake sequence" scene. It was a little too long. Yes, the opening of the film was great when you see the conflict ... which was the commitment of the dogfight. Only when a boy tells Doug Masters that his father was shot down after the Cessna planes landed in the "snake" race, does he force us to go back to the time when the conflict had already begun. I imagine that the sequence of snakes in the middle should be interrupted a little by Col. Masters who is dragged into handcuffs in the middle of the Bilyad desert as he goes to the detention center ... while the musical sequence for the "snake" continues . The film does not ... if it were, the details of the conflict would have been more fluid at that point. Still good otherwise. <br /> <br /> When it was discovered that the trial of Col. Ted Masters for high treason (which violated the territorial sovereignty of the air) was over and he was sentenced to be hanged on the gallows in three days, he decides Doug Masters to enter in action. With the Air Force having futile attempts to save the man, Doug decides to pull out his friends and Colonel Sinclair (played by Louis Gossett Jr.) for a plan to save Masters. Risking a high probability of facing a court martial and spending more than a year in a military stockade, it goes against Air Force policy and makes a plan to save Masters without the consent of the US government. <br /> <br /> Doug and his friends sneak into several classified areas of the base to get a lot of things about the Masters area for impending hanging, and the surrounding area around Bilyad (which turns out to be a fake Middle Eastern country for the film). One plan was to fire firecrackers outside the Darkroom area of ​​the Air Force as a diversion to get classified photos and maintenance material on the fighter plane, on the fighter base, on intelligence and on all other military things around Bilyad . <br /> <br /> When all was said and done, and Sinclair studied all the intelligence, he almost rejected that plan because Doug was too arrogant. Not before I took the two F-16 planes and tried an empty run on a shooting range, I realized what they would do abroad. I realized that Doug's shooting and bombing are not good until he hears rock music. I remember dropping a Mach 82 bomb on a horizontal target and the bomb missed 20 feet ... I realized that Doug is unusual. He likes music when he shoots the ammunition of the fighters. <br /> <br /> The last part of the conflict, the last action of the dogfights in "Iron Eagle" was better than the Top Gun climax of hostile dogfight sequences. I liked the way the final conflict developed, especially when Doug Masters confronts a Middle Eastern ace-pilot who led the trial against Ted Masters. Short but sweet when Doug eliminated the enemy fighter after a second attempt with a side-loaded missile. It seems that this Bilyad colonel was similar to "Darth Vader" in Star Wars ... in the air, he can be very wicked, because if you saw Star Wars, Darth Vader was actually Anakin Skywalker, who was a real ace in space. Unusual connotation for this, but it still works!
