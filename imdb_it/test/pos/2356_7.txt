Warner Brothers produced this 3D extravaganza that was the biggest commercial success for the westerns in 1953. Guy Madison leads a band of guardians and misfits to save two white women held by Indians, who essentially have everything in it this film. The 3D format was in its early stages as a Hollywood gimmick to compete with the growing popularity of home television, and the effects work very well here. Rescuers leave with women and are chased by Indians until whites stand on an island in a stream bed. Indian weapons reach the public continuously, and a spray of tobacco juice aimed at a rattlesnake is launched for good measure. Madison has been rather popular as Wild Bill Hickock of television and is as good as a displaced cattle farmer who is entrusted with his thankless task by the army. Throughout the film and the presentation of the film, the film was made in just three days.
