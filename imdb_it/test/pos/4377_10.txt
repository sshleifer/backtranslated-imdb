It could be a stretch to say this as a passionate Carlin fan, but the material, both written and interpreted, in It's Bad for Ya is still among the best materials of the last era. At age 70, Carlin recovers from the level of despair (and some of the stumbles in the act itself) from Life is worth losing for a special that is firmly structured but loose and playful - or as much as the "old fuck" can get - and it is continually, incessantly, funny. And funny how you remember what some of us had seen when you looked Back in Town or "Sick" the first time. The material, even if at times sometimes a touch of the previous fact (that is the whole piece about children at school and in the field like the Children's segment in Sick), is always fresh and with a bit of truth for everything that burns the mind while (here it is) tickling the funny bone. <br /> <br /> Moving on from the subject of death (how much to wait to delete a name from the book - six weeks, unless it's on the computer programmer), the aspects of communication, looking down from the sky, points to God (of course), children, and only annoying gestures involving hats in religion and if people really have "rights" constitute the bulk of the special, centered on the premise that what is bad for you, simple and simple, is BS. Total, complete BS, which as we also learn (or if you really learned it, you are like the child who waits on the street corner for a week after being left by chance - not by the parent) holds the country together. But Carlin is not necessarily angry, even if the disdain seems to protrude to most shifts, if only to observe how horrible teeth of children come to look. Skepticism is tinged with the feeling that everything will NOT be "good". <br /> <br /> What comes to mind is this: Carlin is a dirty, witty, cautionary standing comedy, what is Yoda for Jedis everywhere, which is a small spark of hope through crystalline wisdom in a world where it's damn hard to get them. At least, we get the classic GC - outrageous lines and pieces from the 13th (or 14th) male comedy, including an observation for eyebrows on people playing Mozart music during a birth!
