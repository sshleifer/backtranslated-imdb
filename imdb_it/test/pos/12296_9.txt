No one would ever have doubted that the director Leos Carax was a genius, but what we ask ourselves is: is he a mad genius? So many people hated this movie! I'm usually the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive, boring, disgusting and pretentious films (like the horrible recent film "L'Enfant" and the useless and offensive "Feux Rouges"). But strangely, I actually think "Pola X" is a fantastic film, made with great skill and passion by a master of his trade and containing remarkable performances. The film brings melodrama to more extreme lengths than I've ever seen before on the screen. But then, Carax is extreme, we know. The film also contains what I consider to be Trotskyites or anarchist fantasies and wet dreams, something with a mysterious group of young people training to shoot machine guns at the bourgeoisie between playing the rather fascinating music of Scott Walker in a band that has its sessions registration in an abandoned warehouse full of squatters and fires burning in old steel barrels. Guillaume Depardieu plays a rich young man in a castle (whose stepmother is Catherine Deneuve, and wanders in his bathroom while naked in the bathtub, by the way). But he suddenly "snapped" completely when he discovers that his late father, a famous diplomat, had generated an illegitimate daughter whom Deneuve had effectively dismissed as an inconvenience. This is because the sister suddenly presents herself as a kind of Romanian refugee with wild tangled hair, an expressionless face and little ability to speak French consistently. Depardieu then becomes a "class hero" of the extreme left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their hypocrisy and corruption, and lives in squalor and extreme poverty, while despising a vast inheritance. Thus begins an incestuous sexual relationship with the stepsister, which is shown in an explicit sex scene that has offended many people, even though I have no objection to it, since I think people are too hysterical about sex, especially in America, where apparently never happens. The intensity of the acting and the shooting make this scenario unlikely as a powerful, if depressing, hyper-melodrama experience. The differences between Carax that makes an extreme film like this and the many extreme French films that I think are pretentious and disgusting are (1) that Carax is an excellent director, and (2) is seriously trying to explore a meaning, if heartbreaking, emotional condition extreme, in which a human being disintegrates and turns against his past. Many would say that the extreme elements of this film were free, but I disagree. I believe that Carax was genuine and was not at all exploiting. It is very difficult to defend a man who goes so far and who, as far as I know, could be a complete fool, but I think he deserves the defense for this extraordinary cinematic result.
