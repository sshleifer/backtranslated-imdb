George Armstrong Custer is known throughout history as an inept general who led his death at the battle of Little Big Horn. "They died with their boots," he paints a different picture of General Custer. In this film he is portrayed as a flamboyant soldier whose errors and misdeeds are mostly his love for adventure. Errol Flynn plays George Armstrong Custer whom we meet for the first time as a confident recruitment at West Point. Custer quickly distinguishes himself from other cadets as a poor student who always seems to be in trouble. Somehow this never seems to worry Custer and seems to only confuse him, since he doesn't really know how he is in such situations. Despite his poor condition, he graduates and becomes an officer in the US Army. Through an error, Custer receives a promotion in the standings. Before this can be corrected, he leads a Union regiment in battle against the Confederates. His campaign is successful and Custer becomes an unlikely national hero. Custer returns to his hometown, marries his sweetheart, Libby, played by Olivia De Havilland. Libby is an understanding and supportive wife who remains constantly at his side and follows him to the border when he takes over the leadership of the seventh cavalry regiment. Custer becomes a man of honor who strives to maintain peace with Native Americans. To demonstrate his intentions, he enters a treaty with Crazy Horse, the leader of the Sioux. When that treaty is jeopardized by a conspiracy to spread false information about gold in the Black Hills, Custer sacrifices his own life and the lives of men under his command to prevent the massacre of thousands of innocent settlers. /> <br /> Errol Flynn dominates every scene in which it appears. He successfully portrayed Custer as extravagant, arrogant, romantic and funny depending on the mood of the scene. The depiction of Libby Bacon Custer by Olivia De Havilland as the love of her life shows us her tender and kinder side. The chemistry between DeHavilland and Flynn, who had acted together in many other films, is so fluid and almost makes the viewer seem to be playing themselves and not the parts of Custer and his wife. The other actors portrayed of their characters really improve the performances of Flynn and De Havilland. Anthony Quinn in the role of Crazy Horse, Sidney Greenstreet in the role of General Winfield Scott, Arthur Kennedy as Edward Sharp are among the other actors whose roles have made this film fun. <br /> <br /> The reviewer would rate this as a 4-star movie. Although it is not historically accurate, it is very funny. The film has a bit of everything. He has adventure, comedy and romance, so he attracts a wide variety of audiences. The character casting is excellent and the actors give credible performances that make you forget that it is largely based on fiction rather than fact. The reviewer especially likes that Native Americans have not shown themselves to be the bad guys, but simply showed them as if they wanted to protect their sacred land. <br /> <br />
