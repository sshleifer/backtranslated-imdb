When the Bicentennial hit, I was in Hershey, PA and part of the Middletown Skate Team. We did nothing except go skateboarding trying to learn what we were reading in the pages of Skateboarder Magazine. A couple of local hills provided all the speed swings you could handle. At the time Mike Weed was the hot stuff, along with Russ Whats, his name, with the Z-boys hot on their tails. I had a GT plastic table (GrenTech) with Power Paw urethane wheels (loose bearings). <br /> <br /> My parents told me that we would move to California later that year and that they were on a trip to go home hunting. I was an extremely good son that summer and asked if I could not be rewarded with a real skateboard from California. They delivered. It was a bunch of fiberglass with the Surfer magazine logo projected onto it. Large trolleys and large red wheels (precision bearings, I don't know). They took him to Oak Street, a surf shop in Laguna Beach. <br /> <br /> When I arrived in California (all 13), Anaheim had the Concrete Wave and Carlsbad also had a large park. Soon Skateboard Odyssey arrived in Mission Viejo. An indoor park with every imaginable scenario. The whole time I was reading about Stacy, Shogu, Tony and Jay. This film was right and has a wonderful experience to watch.
