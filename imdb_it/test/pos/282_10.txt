The comic book secret agents have made a comeback in recent years, with Austin Myers by Mike Myers and Johnny English by Rowan Atkinson, and more recently Steve Carell in the big screen version of the famous 1960s show Get Smart! '. <br /> <br /> In 1974, David Jason wore a shoulder holster and carried a briefcase full of documents with the words "Classified". <br /> <br /> "The Top Secret Life Of Edgar Briggs" was his first starring role in a sitcom, after years of being a supporting actor in shows like "Six Dates With Barker," the series "Doctor "and" Hark At Barker ". <br /> <br /> Humphrey Barclay had found him while working at a dock theater in Bournemouth and was impressed enough to include him alongside Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Eric Idle in the children's play "Don't fix your set!". <br /> <br /> "TTSLOEB" chose Jason as "Edgar Briggs", a well-meaning but incompetent agent of the Secret Intelligence Service. While John Steed wore a bowler hat, Briggs had a trilby "While Napoleon Solo was carrying a radio pen, Briggs had a pipe. The objects fell to pieces in his hands. He read the confidential documents in bed, while his wife (Barbara Angell) was watching Woman's Own carefully (on one occasion it was the other way) When he tracked down two Russian agents in a heliport, accidentally activated the airport's Tannoy system and forwarded its plans to catch them! When he hid on a train in order to photograph a meeting between a S.I.S. the man and his enemy contact moved with him on board and carried him straight to Brighton! When he tried to organize the defection of a Russian scientist, he took a "shortcut" to evade his pursuers, only to end up desperately lost in a parking lot. Yet, like "Inspector Clouseau", he always seemed to come out on top of the end, much to the dismay of his colleagues. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, he was married. His wife Jennifer was understanding the kind of work he did. Even if once they quarreled, the result is that she screamed at him from their apartment window: "Secret service this, secret service! Never stop thinking about the secret service!" He said, "Think of the neighbors! They shouldn't know that I'm in the secret service!" <br /> <br /> Briggs was part of a group of agents whose number included "Coronation Street" the bad Marco Eden (he was the psychotic Alan Bradley) as "Spencer", Michael Stainton as "Buxton" and " Doctor At Sea "Elisabeth Counsell as the beautiful" Cathy Strong ". They responded to "The Commander", played by the late Noel Coleman. The commander was kidnapped in an episode, leaving Briggs temporarily in charge of the S.I.S. - which of course has horrified everyone. <br /> <br /> This fun show was by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna, who had written for the series "Doctor". Rather than a parody of Bond, it was more of a series broadcast series of spies like "Callan" (although it had a Bond-style motif). Stealthy encounters in underground parking lots, puzzle plans, stolen missile plans, that sort of thing. Jason brought a lot of energy to the role, doing many of his stunts, like Briggs falling off a ladder while decorating his apartment and rolling down a hill into a waste paper basket, and remembered those in the movie Pink Panther ". <br /> <br /> "Briggs" had all the ingredients to be a success. Unfortunately, it was not connected to the network. In the London area, he was put off on Sunday at 7.25 pm where he was beaten in the charts by the drama "The Brothers" by B.B.C. It was then moved to Friday at 7 pm because I.T.V. I wanted to show his latest American import - the T.V. of "Planet Of The Apes". Briggs has never found an audience. A similar fate was reached at Jason's next big show: 1976 "Lucky Feller". It was not until 1977 and 'A Sharp Intake Of Breath' that he found his first successful solo vehicle. <br /> <br /> You can see the title sequence (along with two short excerpts in German!) for this Youtube series. Unfortunately, this is all you can see. Jason will not allow his first starring shows to be repeated or published on D.V.D. A great shame. For the moment, however, Edgar Briggs' life will remain top secret. <br /> <br /> CODA: I have seen a number of recent episodes and I am pleased to say that it rises incredibly well.
