Has anyone ever read or heard comments from Scorsese or David Chase (Soprano's Exec. Producer) on "Death Collector / Family Enforcer"? I bought the DVD after not seeing it for a while on cable (like 20 years), but having seen "Goodfellas" and the whole "Sopranos" performed to date. In retrospect, both boys must have seen Death Collector / Family Enforcer and absorbed the flavor, perhaps inspiring the tone for their masterpieces, both of which are the opposite opposite of Godfather's romantic trilogy. Being a Jersey boy, it is interesting to see how Jersey meadows have evolved since the mid-1970s. It is not the swampy dump it once was, even though from time to time a body appeared in a local stream. Also, it's a bit bittersweet to see a newly built World Trade Center on the other side of the river in the opening and closing scene. Who could have imagined?
