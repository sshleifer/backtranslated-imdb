Eisenstein describes his collaboration with Prokeviev as an equal partnership, in which they worked together to combine image and music, scene by scene. Unfortunately, sound recording was a disaster, so for once the devotion to authenticity in the Criterion DVD's flashbacks. Fortunately, there is at least one restored version of the VHS movie (BMG Classics) with an excellent re-recording of the music (of the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus). <br /> <br /> It is interesting to compare this film with contemporary propaganda films in England, Germany and the United States. Eisenstein's film was made in 1938, in response to the fear of a German invasion; and Olivier's in 1943, when a German invasion of England was still expected. Both films are theatrical, but in different ways. Olivier begins by showing a play in the drama of the Globe Theater of Shakespeare's company, then takes us out of the theater towards a more cinematic setting (although still stylized). Eisenstein's film is cinematic from the beginning, but the dialogues and speeches are still influenced by the melodramatic acting conventions of the old Russian theater. This works very well for Cerkassov's speeches like Alexander, because part of his job as a prince and military leader was to play a role in public. <br /> <br /> In Nazi Germany, the first major propaganda film was boring by Leni Riefenstahl Triumph of the Will, which recorded a huge political show: crowded crowds applauding Hitler's heartbreaking speeches. The propaganda in his masterpiece, the 1936 Berlin Olympics film, is much more subtle, with his adoration of the athletic male body that transmits disturbing undertones of the myth of Aryan superiority. But German propaganda films in times of war might even be subtle. Karl Ritter's Urlaub auf Ehrenwort (licensed on Word of Honor) is typical. He shows a young lieutenant who leaves the men in his company to go on vacation 24 hours before returning to the trenches of the First World War (and almost certain death). Against the advice of veterans, accept their word of honor to return, even if they are subjected to court martial and shot if they do not. Of course, everyone returns, (although some of them reproach themselves for this), presumably inspiring the public to similar demonstrations of duties to their country. <br /> <br /> In the United States, one of the best propaganda films of World War II was Howard Hawks Air Force. In it, we follow the mismatched crew of a bomber who bind each other with the experience of battle and overcome the obstacles to continue their part in the war. Typically for Hawks movies, however, their true loyalty is more mutual than in their country. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein must reach far back in history to find Russian military triumphs. Ironically, Alessandro (like the other Russian princes) descends from the Vikings who climbed Russian rivers to conquer and rule their fiefdoms. So he is a conqueror who rejects another aspiring conqueror. Physically, they are not so different (although the actors depicting the German princes were chosen for their ugliness and grimace of stupidity). But the real contrast is between ordinary soldiers. The Russian peasants are tall and strong like the nobles; while the German peasants who escape from the wall of the shield to kill the wounded Russians are a foot lower than their masters. There is some historical truth in this contrast. The Russian servants in the Middle Ages were much better than their European counterparts, because they could always escape to the wilds and free their land. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein's film also provides us with our first vision of Alexander as a fisherman. In the battle with the Germans, he uses the knowledge of his fisherman's ice and his knowledge of military tactics to defeat them. When Gavrilo breaks the shield wall, they are forced to regroup and pile up on the west side of the lake, where the ice is thinner. <br /> <br /> One of the other pleasures of Eisenstein's film (which most of the public misses) is the historically accurate way that plays the politics of medieval Russia. Cities such as Pskov and Novgorod owed their growing wealth and their importance largely to trade, which put the merchants in power, and set aside the principles until their military experience and their feudal taxes were necessary to repel the invaders. In the film, Alexander is shown not only as a military leader, but also as a political master, who knows how to wait for his time and how to make the most of his popularity after the victory.
