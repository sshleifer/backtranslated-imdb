I just saw "Checking Out" at the Philadelphia Film Festival. What a fantastic combination of a moving storyline and an exceptional cast. Director Jeff Hare did an outstanding job of engaging the public in the disjointed but exhilarating world of Morris Applebaum and his family. Family life is presented in such a way that we enjoy the crazy scenes but we experience the real pain and worry they feel for each other. <br /> <br /> Generally I'm not a fan of Peter Falk, but it's Morris Applebaum and plays the role with great humor and humanity. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone can see this wonderful film and enjoy it like I did. <br /> <br /> An affectionate greeting to the director, Cast and Crew for a job well done!
