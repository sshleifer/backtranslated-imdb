Due to the fact that CGI did not exist in 1976, I thought the film was quite watchable. The studio productions were very good and very elaborate. The background effects were very credible and always appeared as if they were part of the whole set. The actors were right to consider the premise of the film set in a Jules Vern type of atmosphere in which imagination and future exploration possibilities were at most improbable. If I had seen this film in 1976, I would probably have been intimidated by man's ability to build a machine that could travel to the earth's core. I still wonder why we are not all flying in the car, but I digress. McClure and Cushing have their funny moments, especially from their facial expressions towards each other, which makes the film a bit campy that I loved. The "monsters" have left something to be desired, but the story has a good premise, although it seems to me that some other kind of "thing" could have been more credible in those circumstances. All in all quite watchable for his time and fun now.
