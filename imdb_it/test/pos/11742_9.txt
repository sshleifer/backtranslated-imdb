The beautifully engaging song of the same name in the film won the best Oscar song in 1955. <br /> <br /> Love is a very gorgeous thing. <br /> <br /> It is the April rose that only grows in early spring. <br /> <br /> Love is the natural way to give a reason to live. <br /> <br /> That golden crown that makes a man a king. <br /> <br /> Once on a high and windy hillside <br /> <br /> In the morning fog two lovers kissed and the world stopped. <br /> <br /> Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught me to sing. <br /> <br /> Yes, true love is a thing of great splendor. <br /> <br /> How can we forget such a beautiful song. Henry King, the director, had the privilege of working with Jennifer Jones twice that year for this film and the very underrated film "Good Morning, Miss Dove". Jones was nominated for "Splendored Thing", but could have been easily named for Miss Dove. <br /> <br /> William Holden is as great as the war correspondent sent to report on the communist revolution in 1949 in China. His love for Jones, an oriental doctor, was captivating and so memorable to watch. <br /> <br /> While the ending is not pleasant, this is still one of the greatest novels ever put on screen.
