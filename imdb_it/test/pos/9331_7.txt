Music videos are often completely ignored in any discussion of the film, with most people considering them as a minor art form. While the vast majority are only flashy clips to publicize the famous hit single of a famous performer, few precious ones rise above the others, becoming works of art in their own right {anything directed by Spike Jonze or Michel Gondry is worth always worth watching}. While "art" is not exactly the word I would use to describe "Michael Thriller (1983)", "it is an intensely sympathetic hybrid of horror and music schlock, and a shockingly campy short that remains incredibly endearing almost 25 years later. Thirteen-minute music video, the longest and most expensive ever made at the time of its release, was directed by John Landis, a director with whom I am not very familiar, although "The Blues Brothers (1980)" is a classic , and I heard that "An American Werewolf in London (1981)" is a wonderfully funny horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> If "Thriller" actually qualifies as a music video it is certainly ready for debate, taking into account explains its long duration {even though Jackson improved this effort with "Ghosts" in 1997, at 38 minutes} and the fact that the title song includes less than half of the total playing time. The video opens with a short fil m inside the film, while Michael, in a quiet and bright night, reveals to his girlfriend (Ola Ray) that he is "different" from the other boys, turning into a horrible werewolf the night clouds separate to reveal the full moon. As the unfortunate heroine is supposedly beheaded, we meet Michael and his girlfriend in the cinema, actually watching this drama that takes place in a horror movie. When the girl gets scared, both leave the cinema and start walking towards the house, at which point Michael starts singing the first lines of his last song, "Thriller". However, when a nest of bloodthirsty zombies emerges from the local cemetery (their entrance damnedly narrated by Vincent Price), the situation begins to get interesting. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to understand why "Thriller" is considered one of the greatest of all music videos. Can't it be simply that the song itself is very funny, and Michael Jackson ?? though since then he has become the target of all the comedians' jokes for his personality and his peculiar actions ?? there is no doubt that he is an excellent singer and performer. Perhaps a decent explanation for the film's popularity is the incredible amount of work that must have gone into it; nothing like this has ever been seen before, and something strange still remains in the music video world. The macabre monsters make-up effects were designed by Rick Baker, and are surprisingly graphic for a music clip, even though it's all done with a good sense of fun. Several moments make the suspense really exciting, successfully capturing the atmosphere of the films that it is parodying (even if always with a touch of cheese on the usual formula}. Simply put, you will never look at a zombie movie the same way again!
