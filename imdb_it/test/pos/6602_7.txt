I hate sports movies. I imagine that the pre-fabricated Hollywood movie is a bit difficult to swallow because it follows the most identical ideas of each year, what I'm trying to say is that there isn't much creativity in this genre. Use the "A" exhibit ?? "The Game Plan" as proof of this if you want. So, needless to say, I was reluctant to watch this documentary because of the sports thematic element, but at the same time I couldn't wait because I love documenting surfing like "Step into Liquid" and "Billabong Odyssey". I took a step, I immersed myself in the unknown, and to be honest, I wasn't happy at first. I didn't like the direction, the people or the style that the film contained to present these young sports entrepreneurs. With my first vision, I thought the story could not be fully recorded, so I thought Stacy Peralta was doing the movie with fake actors as if they were from the late 1970s. The music was intense, it matched well Peralta had made a mixed band of this generation for our enjoyment, but the images were far from stimulating. The elongated scenes, while using extraordinary music for the support, seemed to blush and too long for my attention. I wanted to meet the pioneers, not just see them skating for ten minutes in an empty pool. I wanted a combination of who these children were, where they went during their rise to fame and where they are now. It seemed I was looking at the birth of our nation with a good score for the settlers who rowed their boats all day. I wanted to get to know the men behind the myths. <br /> <br /> So, with the thought that I would have another negative review, I watched the movie again with Peralta's audio commentary. His passion, his voice, his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this film "haunted" me. This suddenly turned into the movie I wanted to see. Peralta lets us know more about where these children are today, what they are doing and how difficult it was to take them to the camera. He hadn't seen many in 20+ years, so hearing these challenges brought the human element back to the surface. He was sincere; he was understanding, yet he showed such dedication to this project. Although I disagree with everything he chose to do (ie Sean Penn is not PUNK ROCK), he revitalized this film for me. It was because of this comment that I consider this film much higher than initially thought. <br /> <br /> Jay Adams. Tony Alva. Jeff Ho. Peggy Oki. Wentzle Ruml. These are just some of the names that must be mentioned and continually praised if skateboarding continues to follow the rapidly growing trend that it currently sees. While the name of Tony Hawk sells products, it is these guys, these slackers who have redefined an entire sport. Of course, others probably did it over the centuries of stone, but these guys did it with style, grace, and moved it to the next level. This was a hobby for them, but it also pushed them in a direction where I believe none of them were ready. "Dogtown and Z-Boys" is the story of evolution, being in the right place at the right time, living in a generation without televisions to keep us hidden and on friendship. We have seen so many stories over the years that show the progression of humanity, and this is certainly a story that should be added to this. I can't say I loved this movie, nor will I, but it should be a standard vision for anyone who is learning or wants to experience the growing trend of skateboarding. Was it sad, was it exciting, and these guys are no longer multimillionaires? they are people with a passion, and very rarely do you see them in documentaries. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can't watch this movie anymore, but I will recommend it to friends and family every time. I think the downfall for this film, for me, was the recovery ?? the attempts to be at the forefront of style, which eventually moved away from the characters and events. As mentioned above, there were some elements that dragged on too much, which left us little or no time to know where these guys were now. Peralta obviously had a passion for this sport, for people, but sometimes it seemed out of focus. The music was intense and worked perfectly with the film. Sean Penn, while he was decent with his voiceover, was not absolutely necessary. They could have spent the money elsewhere. On the positive side, the audio commentary captures everything that the normal film lacked. Peralta's voice, instead of Penn's, brings a stronger human element to the scene, while telling us better stories about people, places and events. Watch this movie, but don't expect to be swept away. Listen to the audio commentary; I think you will be impressed. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** Â½ on *****
