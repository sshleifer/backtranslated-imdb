This film is a funny, fun and clean film for children. Kaley (played by Nickelodeon's talented Amanda) is the assistant of a turbulent boy who struggles to tell the truth. Eventually he works in a script of the film that is stolen. I won't bore you with the details. If you have children and want to see a funny, if not electrifying, children's film, I highly recommend this.
