Assy McGee is an out-of-control and hard-nosed detective based on the innumerable examples of late 20th-century police dramas. The twist is that Assy is literally a walking buttock. <br /> <br /> The low and cheap facade of the show belies its intelligence and its hidden satire. This does not mean that Assy is devoid of fart jokes, only that the toilet's humor is used sparingly to elicit coherent laughter, not groaning and throwing eyes. The program's title sequence demonstrates the clever and subtle humor used everywhere. The sequence consists of panning the photos of the city set on a 70s cop theme. In one photo, a police cruiser is shown and the "camera" enlarges the front license plate, which is empty. The useless zoom-in satire the production of the typical police drama of the 70s and 80s and, incidentally, makes me laugh every time. <br /> <br /> All the typical characters are included: the frustrated police chief who can't control Assy; the loyal and minority partner that acts as a counterpart to Assy's recklessness; the usual cops who hate Assy's means ... they are all justified and all are hilarious satyrs of the typical police drama. <br /> <br /> Dubbing, mainly played by Larry Murphy, is no less than spectacular. Assy's voice - unkempt and hoarse with a bit of a drunken slur - is so clever and unique that she stands alongside the great greats like Stewie Griffin (Family Guy) and Homer Simpson (Simpson). Although the voice is confused, diction is somehow clear and easy to understand. This is a nice change from the other items in the Adult Swim program that often require captions to understand. <br /> <br /> In addition to the fantastic production and dubbing, the script is also hilarious. Assy's absurd readiness fuels most of the humor, particularly in its interactions with citizens outside the police force. <br /> <br /> If you have access to Swim adult comedies, Assy McGee certainly deserves to be watched. Each episode comes in just 8-9 minutes, so you have very little to lose.
