And (coincidentally a publisher) is hired to cut the horror films so as to be favorable in Europe (where the standards are much stricter). But he finds the films very destructive and starts to get a little crazy. Ok, "a little" could be an understatement. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you first of all: better. opening. scene. never. A man in an office blowing up his head with a grenade. His boss then says - with a straight face - "you're fired". The whole film does not maintain this level of intensity, but it certainly does try. <br /> <br /> Take the shotgun scenes, the beheading, the "Lost Limbs" clips (which my friend Jason wanted to be a real movie). The writer of this film has conceived the idea of ​​a woman who is raped by a beaver and is immediately hit in the face with a bazooka. This is something you won't find in any other film (at least, I'm pretty doubtful you will). <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in this film is quality. The image is not as sharp as a 1997 film should be, and the sound could be retouched (even if it is not bad). I thought I was watching a movie from the 80s. Although this gave me some energy in the mind - the film also had the style of writing and directing from the 80s: a sense of fun and giving the audience something more over the top. I miss those days. <br /> <br /> I would like to have more to say, although at the moment I can't think of anything strong enough to praise this movie. I think you should see it. You saw the box in your video store with the ax splitting your head ... maybe you passed it a couple of times. Maybe you thought it would be a cheese. Take it. Enjoy.
