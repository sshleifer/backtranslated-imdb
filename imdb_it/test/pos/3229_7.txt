Fuckland is an interesting film. I personally love the Dogma movement. I wish it had lasted longer. Looks like he's already dead. Many critics have tried to close them. I do not know why. It is the most interesting movement that takes place in the film world from the French New Wave. In addition to Fuckland, I saw the first three of the series, Festen, Idioterne and Mifune. They were all fantastic, Festen is a masterpiece, in my opinion. Fuckland is not up to those others. I was just fascinated by the movie. It is played as if it were a real documentary, with a real person who was so obsessed with his camera that he refused to put it down. In some parts of the film, it becomes clear that this is a complete fictional work, but that illusion continued for an incredible amount of time. I wish the directors would come up with something a little more interesting to put on the screen. This is basically this boy, Fabian, who is an Argentine who visits the Faulkland Islands. The Argentines were only admitted to the islands in the last two months, and Fabian intends to impregnate women with Argentine children. He puts his eyes on one, and most of the film is spent on his seduction. The two actors are very natural. Camilla Heany only suggests that she is an actress. Fabian Stratas looks completely real. The film's policy confuses me a little, since I have only a vague idea of ​​the situation surrounding the island and its recent history. I was 3 years old, I think, when the Faulklands were invaded. The last part of the film does not work at all. I don't understand what the directors were going there. Still, Fuckland is an interesting Dogma experiment. It breaks some Dogma rules, however, in particular the rule of extra-diagonal music. There is a lot of this. 7/10.
