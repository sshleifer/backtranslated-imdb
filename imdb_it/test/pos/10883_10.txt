This game requires stealth, intelligence and a steady hand. The gameplay is simply the best; furthermore, there are the interesting extras: the bullet holes remain in the walls, the enemies react to specific points where they were hit by bullets, there are tons of animations captured by the movement that make the enemies very real (for example looking through a window on a guard who will stand there crushing flies, sneezing or scratching), the list could go on. This is the best movie / license conversion ever made and puts you in the shoes of the super spy suavest. This game is the best reason to own an N64.
