This show was a pleasant surprise after watching Mad TV on a Saturday night. Spike is an excellent host who can be said to be still getting used to, but is doing a great adaptation to his new job. I can imagine it's a difficult transition from screenwriter (Seinfeld) to hosting, however, unlike many new talk shows, he doesn't let time pass in air while trying to figure out what to do next. It's fast and each segment and section intertwine with each other smoothly. It also doesn't hurt that he's pretty sexy in a nerdy way so it's not as hard on the eyes as Leno or Letterman. I can't remember the exact date of the episode that was my favorite, but I especially LOVED the Paparazzi scene with a fake J-Lo and Katie Holmes. Great new show !!
