Having repeatedly said how many Columbo episodes are brilliant, it's time to honor an episode with the maximum score. "Etude In Black" is not 100 percent perfect, but it certainly exceeds 90 percent ... maybe 96 or 97! <br /> <br /> Last week I reviewed "Just Married" and compared it unfavorably with "Meet The Parents". Well, here's one of the parents, Blythe Danner, in a very early role as the wife of the famous conductor Alex Benedict, played by the legend that is John Cassavetes. Alex had an affair with Jennifer Wells, an orchestra girl (not her first relationship, one of the suspects). He is blackmailing Alex to leave his wife, but as his wife's mother holds the purse strings for the orchestra, Alex doesn't think it would be such a smart move to destroy his career and his overnight marriage. Instead he opens a plot to sneak out of the concert hall before an exhibition and kill his young lover while making it look like suicide. <br /> <br /> Enter Columbo and guess what? It takes about two seconds to understand that murder is more likely than suicide. Columbo will not take much longer to connect Alex to the victim and will soon follow him wherever he goes. Although Columbo is sure that Alex is his man, it actually takes quite a while and some false clues (none of which Columbo actually swallows) before he has the vital evidence. <br /> <br /> Along the way are some extra prominent characters, ranging from the precocious young neighbor of Jennifer Wells and the English mechanic who seems to be more comfortable on Coronation Street, up to the brass-looking player unkempt that he almost finds himself ready for the murder (he had also seen Jennifer Wells, the busy girl!). And there is also a short cameo by Commander Lassard of the Police Academy films. As with Leslie Nielsen in "Lady In Waiting", it is impossible to take it seriously (I bet you are thinking about that speech you made on the podium, right?!) <br /> <br /> But it's Blythe Danner, John Cassavetes Peter Falk stealing the show here. Blythe is absolutely divine like Mrs Benedict. From the moment he realizes that Alex composes Jennifer Wells' number from memory, she feels deeply disturbed by exactly what their relationship is. It's a masterful performance as she struggles to trust Alex despite her intuition that tells her something is very, very wrong. Columbo doesn't help things by interrupting his tennis match to ask impertinent questions about Alex's relationships with his orchestra members. <br /> <br /> As for John Cassavetes, well, it's a pity he didn't make any repeat appearances as Columbo villains, because he could have been up there with Jack Cassidy and Patrick McGoohan as one of the greatest of all times of the show. But this performance is superb! It is another who falls into the "very irritated" category, losing all patience with Columbo rather than making friends with him and granting it to him. Despite this, when the game is finally over, he reluctantly recognizes the genius of Columbo. <br /> <br /> Well, it's a really cool show. He loses a couple of very small points to his rather clumsy view of classical music, as evidenced by many of the posters here, but none of these has any relation to the logic of the story or the characterizations. And at least the music is good, dramatic and exciting! <br /> <br /> Finally, if you've never met him, there's an absolutely incredible clip of John Cassavetes and Peter Falk in the Dick Cavett show from the early 1970s. I am absolutely convinced that Steve Coogan watched this video and based Alan Partridge on it. Everything about the clip resembles Knowing Me Knowing You, from the cruel introduction to Cavett's total humiliation by his guests. The orchestra also enters the scene, playing circus music while Falk, Cassavetes and their friend Ben Gazzara laugh and ridicule the host. <br /> <br /> It may not be strictly relevant to this review, but the Cavett clip show offers a nice overview of the profound friendship and professional relationship between Peter Falk and John Cassavetes. It is clear from the quality of "Etude In Black" how the couple worked together!
