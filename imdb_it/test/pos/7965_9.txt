I was very happy and at the same time quite surprised by other positive comments written by non-Koreans below. This film is incredibly sincere and shows a very sad but warm vision of the typical life of Koreans. I thought that the other foreigners did not understand this delicate sensation and underestimated this quiet film as boring, but I was wrong. The attraction of this film could be difficult to avoid even for foreigners. (Even without subtitles ...) <br /> <br /> I would like to mention some points that others have missed. Of course, this film describes the love between a man and a woman. However, the same theme is far beyond. In reality, it is time, the value of memory and death. In this film, the focus is not on the 'love story' between two people. As some have pointed out, they don't kiss, they don't hug, even without holding hands. So love itself is not completed (both positively and negatively) in the film. Rather, what persecutes Jungwon (a leading actor) is his imminent death. Time is running out, he can't keep it, leaving behind a few pairs including his father and, of course, Darim (a metermaid). So the problem is how he can face death and leave something precious in his short life, not how he can make love with Darim. <br /> <br /> This type of theme seems very familiar to us. There are many films about patients with incurable diseases like "Love Story". However, what makes this film exceptional is the way Jungwon inflicts his death. He's a loser, but he tried to do his best while he's alive, in a SILENT way. He does not tell anyone around him of his death. He hides something in his mind but without anger, hatred, revenge. He just tried to do better while he was alive. This limited communication and obedience to destiny are the typical mentality of Koreans and the point that most Westerners do not understand or, at best, misunderstand. <br /> <br /> This theme is very effectively expressed by the director of this film (surprisingly, his debut). Some say he is heavily influenced by Japanese director Ozu Yasujiro, who directed Tokyo Story. In fact, I remember reading in some magazines that the director himself admitted that he was influenced by Ozu. I'm not so informed to analyze his style compared to Ozu's, but they have some in common and others don't. The angular and static camera, in particular, reminds us of Ozu's style. But, in terms of theme, this Korean director seems to have a vision a little warmer and full of hope. <br /> <br /> Expresses itself concisely with Jungwon's last photograph. I think it's a very well done and really heartbreaking scene. In fact, the director had the idea for this film when he attended the funerals of a famous Korean folk singer who died young of a mysterious suicide. They say they saw the singer's photograph at the funeral and thought of a film about death and memory. (And maybe I hope for what remains, I think ...) <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film to anyone with a keen interest in Korean art and culture. This film, in my opinion, can be rivaled with other films like the history of Tokyo and a kind of American beauty. It's great if you don't have a language barrier. The DVD version will be released on the market this February, so it could be a little help for foreigners with English subtitles.
