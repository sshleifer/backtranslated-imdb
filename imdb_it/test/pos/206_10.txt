The plot of this film is against the most terrible war in the history of humanity: the violent confrontation between Adolf Hitler's Germany and Soviet Russia, from 1941 to 1945. <br /> <br /> With the western areas of their country completely devastated, and 20 to 30 million Russians killed, the vibrations of this conflict can be felt in Russia to the present day. Not to mention again in 1957, when the memories were still very fresh and painful. <br /> <br /> This very black setting contrasts strongly with the refined and coherent style of the beautiful shots of "Letjat zhuravli". His simple story deals with human behavior in wartime: courage, love, patriotism, weakness, cowardice and corruption. All beautifully tied by a toy squirrel. Add to this the truly magnificent acting, and it's easy to see why this film is so famous. Really, one of the best ever made. <br /> <br />
