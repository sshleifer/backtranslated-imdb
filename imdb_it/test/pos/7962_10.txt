This is, without a doubt, one of the most complete debut films for every director. The film only lasts 90 minutes, but manages to tell everything about life and death. There is not much action, and the dialogue is minimal, but the film runs perfectly and requires your attention thanks to the wonderfully natural sensation of everything that happens. The performances of the protagonists are perfection, and even some supporting characters get strong emotional scenes. The film will be a little lost in today's modern audience, but this is one that everyone should see. Although not sincere and honest, this is on a par with Ozu's works. <br /> <br /> Scratch my title, this is perfect!
