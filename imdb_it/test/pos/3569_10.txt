Hallelujah !!!! Finally, a real Colombian film crosses the border to show how Bogotá and Colombia really are! I am an American of Colombian and French culture sick and tired of seeing Colombia so perversely and ignorant portrayed by Hollywood and others. <br /> <br /> How many of you know that Colombia is the second oldest and unbroken democracy in the world (after the United States), or that it has a lively film and television industry (not to mention Ugly Betty), which is the capital, Bogotà (Pop. 9 million) is the "world capital of the book", or that this beautiful city hosts the most GREAT International Theater Festival in the world? I hope that Doug Liman, Simon Kinberg (-Mr. And Mrs. Smith), Robert Zemeckis, Diane Thomas (Romancing the Stone) will visit Bogotá one day, to see how beautiful it is and to focus on Bogota's vitality and cultural diversity instead of produce short-sighted films like Maria Full of Grace from which Joshua Marston has profited much (for this terrifying film) without ever thinking - through the ontological damage his film would have helped to perpetuate the "unfairly stained image" of Colombia. /> <br /> -Away, you'll like at least a lot of Bluff! - Oh, and thanks to IMDb for your priceless / great job !!!
