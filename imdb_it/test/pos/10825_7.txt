An interesting combination of stories, this little film manages to bring together apparently different characters and narrative lines against the backdrop of the Second World War and manages to tie them together without losing the audience. I was impressed by the depth portrayed by the different characters and also by how much I really felt I understood them and their motivations, even though the time spent on the development of each character was very limited. The exceptional acting skills of the people involved with this image are easily detectable. A funny and stylized film with a series of comic moments and a greater number of events that shake the head. <br /> <br /> 7/10
