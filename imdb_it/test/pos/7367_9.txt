Campfire Tales (1997) <br /> <br /> An excellent work tranquility. Everything about this film is perfect. <br /> <br /> The film has an exceptional cast, as you can see from IMDb. The reason I brought the film was because of Christine Taylor and her love for horror movies. allows access to the main parts <br /> <br /> 1. there are 4 teenagers in this film, after crashing their car they decide to tell ghostly stories 2. there are 3 stories and the main plot (the 4 boys are the main plot) 3. the best story is "people can lick too much" in my opinion. the less scary story is perhaps "honeymoon" or the second story (I don't remember the name "<br /> <br /> 4." people can lick too much "talks about a man pretending to be a girl of 13 years (on the internet), he starts chatting with a girl named Amanda and then enters his house, very disturbing stuff that this story will make you think twice about chatting with someone online, basically a pervert enters his house and things they become disturbing. <br /> <br /> 5. The main plot is sweet and simple, the teenagers crash, tell stories, try to scare each other, but in the end there is a very interesting turn. <br /> <br /> The only bad part of this movie is, the teenagers crash their car into another couple, but the kids don't care to see if the couple is okay, they just talk about the couple where they are they crashed. <br /> <br /> The men and women who made this film did it for themselves fear people, not to make money. Unlike "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer", this movie was created to scare you. "I scream" and "I know what you did last summ er" were made to make money in large quantities. <br /> <br /> Although this film was not publicly advertised as it was, it is still 10 times better than scream and "I know what you did last summer". <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are fantastic and have realistic features. The cast that plays these characters is fantastic. Christine Taylor does a fabulous job with Lauren, she doesn't do the best with acting. The guy who plays Eric (laurens younger brother) also does a good job of showing men or teenagers who may even be scared. The screams are like a smuggling movie, the killer is a joke and the kids are stupid <br /> <br /> Unlike screaming and "I know what you did last summer", this movie has realistic people, not one joke of a movie, it should be more noticed.
