"The Merchant of Venice" was one of Shakespeare's most popular dramas during his lifetime, but he fell into hard times during the 20th century because of his undeniably anti-Semitic content. The drama has also been called schizoid in its wake of comic and tragic scenes, leading some to say that they are two dramas that try to coexist as one. Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes, who played William Shakespeare in "Shakespeare in Love") is in love with Portia (Lynn Collins, superb), but he needs to borrow a considerable sum of money to woo her. He goes to his gay lover, Antonio (Jeremy Irons), who does not have the funds for his person, but takes a loan from the Jewish usurer Shylock (Al Pacino). Shylock is amused and offended by the fact that Antonio, who insults him for his religion, now comes to him for money, but offers it, provided that the penalty for non-fulfillment on the loan will be a kilo of Antonio's meat. Which is obviously what happens. Bassanio and Portia offer Shylock much more than the original loan instead of the pound of meat, but Shylock, upset after his daughter leaves him and marries a Christian, refuses to take him. Portia, in a scene where the public is never quite sure where to put his sympathies, deprives Shylock of what should legally be his, and then strips him of his wealth and religion. Shylock was originally tested as a cartoon criminal, but modern actors and directors have turned him into a tragic figure, railing against the injustices of sixteenth-century Venice. Al Pacino does a great job as Shylock, and Jeremy Irons is as good as Antonio, but I think Lynn Collins works as Portia is the best part of the play. Portia is one of the few important female roles in Shakespeare's canon, and Collins is wonderful in the part. Joseph Fiennes is more than a little boring, however; I have never particularly appreciated his often exaggerated acting style. I give "The Merchant of Venice" an 8/10.
