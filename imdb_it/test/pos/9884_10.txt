Take someone you love or want to love and go see this movie. <br /> <br /> It touches you in all the right places. <br /> <br /> All the other reviewers have said it all. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the cynic will not be impressed. <br /> <br /> It just seems like you like things that leave you depressed for days. <br /> <br /> This film is Ga-run-teed to stay with you for life. <br /> <br /> I am so happy that the director is not trained at the USC. <br /> <br /> This confirms my premise that there is too much mediocrity and conformity to the cinema these days. <br /> <br /> It is because of the mentality and inbreeding of the USC. <br /> <br /> Hooray for Jeff Hare and Richard Marcus, cast and crew. Very well!
