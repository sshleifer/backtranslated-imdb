I looked for this film for so long before I found it, I saw it when I was younger and I love it, after my second vision I still loved it and I still do it. <br /> <br /> this is a love / hate movie, if you like the background, the young people, the comic, then you'll find it funny. If you don't like that kind of humor, then don't worry. I love this movie and I grew up with these comedy programs, for me this movie is simply putting their comic genius on the big screen. It's not an award winner by any means, but if you just want a good healthy slapstick then this is it! <br /> <br /> the film lacks the quality of the TV series and this is usually the case with films, but it still has enough material to make you laugh even though many of the lines are quite similar to their previous work. <br /> <br /> yes, humor is a bit childish and not for everyone's taste, but sometimes it is enough to do it in a movie.
