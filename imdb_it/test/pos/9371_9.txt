**** SPOILERS IN ALL **** This is a very strange film - particularly for its time - in every respect. For six years, American films have shown American soldiers the role of son, brother and father of all. <br /> <br /> In films like The best years of our lives and Until the end of time, our hearts are torn by the difficulty that the sweet returning soldiers have adapted to peace and their families. Yet, in this same year, this film shows the soldiers as a rather worse mix of people than the beholder: a message from this film is "Block your daughters". <br /> <br /> Even good soldiers - with a lot of time at their disposal - are gambling all the time, getting drunk stupidly, and are completely indifferent to the fact that they even have more wives. And their reaction to the police investigating a murder is - to conspire against them. <br /> <br /> Mitchum, the most sympathetic soldier says things like "I don't know if my wife wants to try it now after the war, I haven't seen her for two years, do I care? Not really, maybe we'll make it , maybe not. "<br /> <br /> Another soldier is shown as unusually sensitive because after years he would like to see his wife again. <br /> <br /> Subsequently, when this soldier declares to the police station that he spent the evening at a whore's house - without knowing that his wife is sitting behind him, there seems to be no doubt that his wife will be fine. In fact, she is - I guess it's "Hey, soldiers will be soldiers". <br /> <br /> The police detective interpreted by Robert Young who is trying to solve a murder case, convincingly and with infinite tiredness claims to account for some of their actions on the night in question, <br / > <br /> "Am I interested? No, I don't care anymore, I did it too long, I think." <br /> <br /> A man shows up at the whore's apartment. He says "I'm just a man like you, interested in" the whore. Then he says "No, this is a lie, I am your husband, I would like to be in the army, I was rejected first". T <br /> <br /> when he says "No, this is a lie, why should I want to be a soldier?" He goes through another series of lies when the police ask him who he is. At the end of the film, we have no idea who he is or why he is there! He is one of the strangest characters in film history! <br /> <br /> A man is with his girlfriend in a bar that talks to four soldiers, when a clumsy soldier drinks a drink on his girlfriend. He leaves to change his clothes - and immediately comes back with another, no problem. Yet the man does not leave with his girlfriend - who simply disappears - but instead follows one of the soldiers when he leaves to go to another area of ​​the bar! The man then extrapolates from the minimal information he learned about the soldier - to philosophize grandly about the problems of returning soldiers - and immediately invites the soldier home because he is drunk and feels sick. This is a strange thing. <br /> <br /> Similarly, a girl in the ballroom is irritated by the sentimental soldier who would like to take her out "for a real dance - and maybe for dinner". Yet he dances with him - and immediately gives him the key to his house! <br /> <br /> At the end of the '40s did people always push soldiers to come to their homes after having just met them? <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan kills his guest, a stranger, when he is furious that the Jewish guest tries to get the constant drunk Ryan out of his house. The reason for the murder? "No Jew tells me how to drink". "How to drink?" Eh? What does it mean? <br /> <br /> This film is always crazy, quite deliberately so - the soldiers act consistently with total disregard of the law, and all the characters are cold and hard like any movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Yet the film is absolutely thrilling! You simply have no idea how these people will act - or what a new bizarre character will present themselves - without anyone thinking that the person's actions are somehow strange - for example, his wife's behavior. <br /> <br /> Acting is the best I've ever seen - from Robert Young, Robert Ryan, Gloria Grahame (who received an Oscar nomination), Paul Kelly and other actors I'd never heard of . <br /> <br /> I have never heard of this movie - and it is a real pleasure to have discovered one that I will want to see again, again and again. it's really weird but impossible to look away because you have no idea what these creatures will do next.
