I sat in several Pauly Shore films, but this is the only one that I liked. Of course, it helps that it is much less irritating than usual, maybe even a little sympathetic. The rest of the cast does a good job, especially underestimated Carla Gugino. The film itself is basically a harmless and silly comedy, and although some of the jokes are particularly amusing, the film is rather fun overall.
