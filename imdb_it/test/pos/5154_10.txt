I laughed aloud several times during this film, giving him a quick look and you would think it was something else. I love the rhythm and the way it slowly burns in you as these incredibly beautiful tableaux are presented to you. Andersson offers us something else here. He shows us something I haven't seen since his last film. It is extraordinarily compositional and, through its method of fixing the camera and allowing the action to take place before us, it opens the door to humanity and we scrutinize in a place that reflects our lives, our little lives. It's powerful stuff. It is the simplicity with which it allows events to happen that creates the opposite feeling of complexity. Everything in front of the camera is anything but simple. Andersson's attention to detail is extraordinary. I believe that many scenes, if not all, are composed from scratch based on his projects. I can't recommend this movie highly enough. For me he took me to a place and I came out having seen a frayed and beautiful world, starched and sorrowful, sterile and splendid. At the same time alien and familiar. This film is brilliant and alive. I know because I came out smiling, feeling wonderful. It took him seven years to do it. If he had only made this film, he would still be there with the big boys.
