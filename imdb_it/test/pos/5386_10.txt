I saw "Heaven-Ship" ("Himmelskibet") at the 2006 Cinema Muto festival in Sacile, Italy. What a great movie! This Danish steampunk saga is the compelling story of the first trip to Mars, at a time when wireless telegraphy has not been perfected. The ship does not have a radio and the heroes are brought from the landing field through a horse cart. The subtitles are also delicious ... some of them are written in rhymed in rhymed in the original Danish. <br /> <br /> The performances of the actors are ridiculous, largely histrionic by hand. But the sets are amazing, easily surpassing anything made by Georges Melies a decade earlier (or in "Die Frau im Mond" a decade later). Of course, the plot is simplistic. The spaceship's crew consists of seven skinny guys and a fat slob. Guess which one cracks. It is interesting to note that everyone in this film (except for the questionable Professor Dubius) ardently believe in God. Even the Martians. <br /> <br /> Impressive, the writers have the good sense to recognize that a trip to Mars is not child's play: the title tags state that it takes scientists two years to build their spaceship (which has a propeller) and six months to reach Mars. During the construction sequence, there is an extremely impressive set that must have been choreographed: dozens of workers move through the construction site in different directions, without hesitation and without collisions. Danish scientists baptize their ship "Excelsior" ("packing materials"?) And set course for Mars, although Moon and Venus are closer. When the ship (which flies horizontally, not vertically) lands on Mars, it is greeted by "Marsboerne" - Martians - who turn out to be Nordic blondes, all highly developed pacifists and vegetarians. (Like a highly developed meat eater, I felt that part.) <br /> <br /> Fairly conveniently, Mars turns out to have an atmosphere just like Earth's, as well as gravity itself. In an external view of the Martian landscape, the apparent magnitude of the Sun when viewed from Mars is the same as when viewed from Earth. Furthermore, I could not help observing that all the elderly Martian sages are males. Indeed, older women are thin on the ground: both the hero born on Earth and the Martian girl are motherless. Martians speak a universal language, wear ankhs on their robes and greet Earth visitors with a terrestrial globe ... which they naturally maintain with the North Pole upward. <br /> <br /> That Martian virgin is Marya, played by a heterogeneously beautiful Danish actress. (Waiter, I'll have some Danish!) We see a Martian dance of chastity that may have been twee or ridiculous but is actually quite moving and beautiful. Furthermore, Martian's funeral scene presents a shot that reminded me of a sequence in "The Seventh Seal". I wonder if Ingmar Bergman saw this movie. <br /> <br /> "Himmelskibet" has some flaws, but its production design and its other merits far outweigh its flaws. Ole Olsen, who was named in the credits (and appears in a short prologue), has no connection with Chic Johnson's vaudeville partner of "Hellzapoppin". I would give "Himmelskibet" at 12, but the scale goes to 10 ... so, 10 out of 10 for this delightful trip to Mars, the blond planet!
