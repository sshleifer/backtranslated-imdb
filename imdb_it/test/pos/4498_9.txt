one of the best and most inspirational films about a different culture I've seen for years. tragic and moving. worth looking at maybe a couple of times. We all know how brutal children can be. I know that from my and my brothers we experience as children and this film hit the nail on the head. perfectly! The kite race is incredible and I need to research the validity of that event. even if it is done in cgi it is still surprising and very interesting. maneuvering a kite like that with a single rope seems impossible but make it believable. anyway this movie has many twists and turns, i'm sure for many, probably easy to understand but they hit me before i could. which makes a great movie for me! when you can understand the whole movie in the first 10 minutes you ruin it. but this he does so easily that it is difficult to guess even when it happens ... I am a boy and I don't mind saying that the tears were flowing to more than one point in this film.
