Although it does not matter to the film, this is a myth of Creation. God (a convulsive and bloody figure in a chair) cuts his organs with a razor and dies in his own filth. Mother Earth rises from her corpse and imbues herself with her seed, giving birth to Man. However, it is highly unlikely that you will be able to understand all this without first reading a synopsis, and it is not particularly important for the film you make, since it is more a surreal thing than artistic images, all in black, elaborate, black and white. A sick and dreary atmosphere is created with rigid photography and minimal sounds (mostly water droplets, groans, scratches, etc.). But every scene lasts a little too long, as does the film as a whole. This could have been great as a short film, and the scene of God killing himself was excellent and extremely disturbing, especially being the first thing you see, but it's hard to be patient when it goes on this long and you don't even know what you're seeing for most of the time. <br /> <br /> Again, a good movie for the original style, images, atmosphere and content.
