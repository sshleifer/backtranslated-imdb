I don't know where this film was shot, but because it was shot on the spot, it has the authenticity that this story deserves. It is the story of a young English woman who was taken prisoner by the Japanese in South Asia at the beginning of World War II, with a group of other English women. There is no prison camp for women, so they are forced to march for months from place to place, because the Japanese don't know what to do with them. The courage and resilience of English women and the courage of the Australian soldier who tries to help them are the heart of the film. This film is very long, maybe 10 hours, so you can watch it as it was shown on PBS, like a series, which actually adds to the feeling of the endless journey this woman makes from England, through this remote island, and finally Australia. History, cinematography, locations and actors come together to make this a film not to be missed. My only question is why this wasn't released on DVD!
