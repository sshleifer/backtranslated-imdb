I remember when I saw this film for the first time. I was babysitting for a friend of my mother's, and one of the kids suggested I watch it. Thinking it was the "Prince of Thieves", frankly ridiculous, they were slipping into the VCR, I was prepared for a few hours of boredom. What I got was a shock, a pleasant smile that I admit, but still a shock. <br /> <br /> Now you all know the legend of Robin Hood, right? I'll explain a little. Robin Hood was a Saxon criminal, who took money here and there and distributed it to the people who needed it, alluring the beautiful Maid Marion all the time and irritating the Sheriff of Nottingham and Prince John. Here are the basics! Now with the review. <br /> <br /> This film was released in 1993 and is a take-off of the whole legend of Robin Hood and in particular of Prince of Thieves in particular. <Br /> <br /> Freely following the legend, Robin of Loxley is tracked for the first time in an Arab prison during the crusades of the third century, and together with a "Moro" as they were called in those days, runs an escape astute with a cellmate, Asneeze. <br /> <br /> After escaping, Asneeze begs Robin to find his son Atchoo, a foreign student in England and look for him. This Robin vows to do! Robin returns to England. <br /> <br /> Return to his home, Loxley Castle, to find him transported to the back of the cart by bailiffs, and go through the painful revelation that his father, dog, cat and even the goldfish died. Desperate for a familiar face, he finds the faithful blind servant of the Blinkin family sitting in the bathroom with a Jazz Braille magazine. The hilarity continues throughout the film. <br /> <br /> As in all Robin Hood stories, Robin has to counteract the evil plans of Prince John and the Rottingham sheriff, who are wreaking havoc and charging exorbitant taxes in the reign of King Richard is far away. <br /> <br /> Anyone familiar with the films that Mel Brooks has previously directed will have some little idea of ​​what to expect. After all, this is the man responsible for Dracula, who is dead and who loves him and the young Frankenstein. All the jokes, ranging from visual gags to wonderful witty comments, are exactly in the right places throughout the film, with no more than a minute between a laugh. <br /> <br /> Cary Elwes (incidentally, the only English man to play Robin Hood in a movie), which many of you will know from Princess Bride, brings his blatant grinning presence of eyes to this film, and does a great job. From the extravagant heroic position, to a mischievously sexy look, it's really incredibly fun. And the man looks better in tights than I do! <br /> <br /> Richard Lewis is as exhilarating as the plaintive, arrogant Prince John with the ever-changing mole. Bring sissy behavior to a t-shirt, and her vibrant American are fantastic. Throughout the film, a mole on his face constantly changes position: it starts on his left cheek, then on his right cheek, then on his chin, then on his forehead, before returning to his original place. This is a subtle joke based on Alan Rickman's mole when he played the sheriff in Prince Of Thieves Roger Rees while the skeptical sheriff of Rottingham is wonderfully slimy and naughty, and has some big lines throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> There are some faces that you will learn from other Brooks movies. For example, Robert Ridgely, who plays the hangman in this film, has also played the hangman in Blazing Saddles, another film directed by Brooks. He likes to add subtle references to his previous films; with many in this film, Brooks fans who will be easily able to spot. Those who have seen History of the World part 1 will recognize the music of the song 'Men in Tights'. Also, when Patrick Stewart arrives and makes a face at Marion, Mel himself (playing Rabbi Tuckman) pronounces the phrase "it's good to be a king", one of his lines in World History. <br /> <br /> The whole cast is wonderfully comical, even those with a few lines bring a great depth of warmth and humor to them <br /> <br /> What makes this film so wonderfully warm and fun according to me are all the improvised scenes. Although there was some sort of script, some scenes were completely improvised by the actors themselves, like the scene in which Latrine (Tracey Ullman) prays for Rottingham in his bed, and falls through the ceiling, landing right where he wanted to be, which was conceived and designed by the two actors. <br /> <br /> There are few special effects, and those that are there are small but fun moments of computerized gimmicks. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is memorable, with some very funny songs and a couple of cheesy love songs. You will sing 'Men in tights' or at least you will be humming everything for yourself. For weeks. <br /> <br /> The score is Pg, to which I say BAH HUMBUG. There is no bad language in the film, except in the use of double meaning, and a statement of sh! T, and violence is minimal. Indeed, I would say non-existent, apart from some scenes of comic struggle. <br /> <br /> A fun and entertaining film that will appeal to young and old!
