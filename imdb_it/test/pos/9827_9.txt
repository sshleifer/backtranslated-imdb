I really liked "Random Hearts". It was shocking to see such a low rating on IMDB, but chacun a son gotta and all that. I'm a big fan of Harrison Ford, but I have to admit he was a sick cast in this movie, and the reason I gave him 9 instead of 10. Kristin Scott Thomas, however, was just wonderful. It was credible and beautiful, despite being half of the film as if she had been crying for days. Were the "Random Hearts" better? Sure, but it's really worth seeing it as it is.
