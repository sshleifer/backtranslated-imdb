If you're looking for a movie that doesn't take you seriously ... Haggard is for you. I have to say that before writing anything else, if you haven't seen any of the CKY (Camp Kill Yourself) videos in the movie, it probably won't be that much fun. My advice is to watch some clips of those videos made by Bam and his friends. Haggard does not take himself seriously at all and has never been the purpose. During the movie you will have random moments that have nothing to do with the plot, which can be annoying but its nothing is out of control. Despite all this, the plot remains focused and the plot of the character of Ryan Dunn unfolds quite well. This plot that was told to me is based on a true story (mostly) of Ryan Dunn's ex-girlfriend. Brandon Dicamillo is by far the best character in the film. He has a lot of talent and knows how to make people laugh. He stole the movie if you ask me. Overall, I love this film because of its simplicity and its strangeness. It's a Bam movie people, it won't be normal. Haggard is full of hilarious quotes that my friends and I have been using constantly since we first saw him. I've seen the film 6-7 times and I always find new things. The soundtrack is just as good. Everything from Gnar Kill to New Order and some techno. Just don't enter the film with high expectations, let it all take place and then judge it for what it is.
