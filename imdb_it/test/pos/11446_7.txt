Much more than any other film of that period, Night of the Demons represents the mindless and incredibly fun horror pastiche. It's fun without pretensions with a lot of ugly make-up effects, beautiful teenagers (and horny) and adorable clich√© elements. A group of party animals, led by the alternative Angela, goes to celebrate Halloween in an abandoned funeral home that carries a strange urban legend. Everything starts typical and "innocent" with dancing, drinking and occasional flirting among young people who can't control their hormones, but very soon a bloodthirsty demon owns the landlady. In the most ingenious ways you've ever seen, the rest of the cast is brutally slaughtered just to come back as horrible creatures looking for blood. The thing that makes this movie better than the other horror films of the 80s is a good balance between light field and atmospheric horror. Some sequences are really gruesome and the funeral set up gives Night of the Demons an excellent tone. Director Tenney makes great use of the sets (coffins, a crematorium, endless dark corridors ??) and his young and enthusiastic cast obviously loves what they are involved in. The fantastic makeup effects of an entire team of artists and designers are obviously the obvious aspects for lovers of horror and love who will adore the vast amount of cut limbs, bulging eyes and crushed skulls! However, the highlight is Linnea Quigley's makeup with the lipstick that disappears! This nymphomaniac child slips a whole tube of lipstick into the nipple and continues his sexual murderous spree! Terrific! Night of the Demons received two sequels during the 1990s and, although it's still worth a try, they focus more on comedy than on chills.
