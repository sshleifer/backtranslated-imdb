Many of the previous comments are correct, but some, well, not so much. <br /> <br /> This is not really a "B" movie ... it is well produced, the live sequences are really superb and the model sequences are top quality. It is not a "cheapie". <br /> <br /> Ricard Barthelmess is pretty good at this, and does a nice backing piece for "Only Angels Have Wings". <br /> <br /> If you want to see John Wayne, J. Carrol Naish commercials first, they end up together. <br /> <br /> Tom Browne is quite young (and a bit boring), but when he saddles him with the most pathetic pencil mustache in Hollywood history, he makes his character even less credible. Sally Eilers is much more so. <br /> <br /> As for subsequent influences, this is Wellman in the area of ​​the Airiner-in-Distress in advance ... the opening sequence of this film, with the air operations guy arriving at " Grand Central Airport "would have adapted very well to" The High and the Mighty "... imagine Regis Toomey ... and Buick of 1955.
