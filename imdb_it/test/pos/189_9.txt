This is a fantastic movie. Acting is among the best I've ever seen. Tatyana Samojlova is obviously very beautiful and automatically drags you into the film with her credible acting. Cinematography was extremely ahead of its time. Looking at it, I could see the parallels of cinematography used today. This is truly a revolutionary film. Because of cinematography and acting, audiences can feel the change in tone from beginning to end while changing the tone in the environment in the film. It is a very touching and powerful piece. My friend told me it was a must see, and I totally agree with her. This is one of those movies that you watch and never forget. Everyone should see this intensely moving film. This should be included in the "Movies to see before ________ (anything)" list of all.
