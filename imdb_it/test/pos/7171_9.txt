This film has just been shown on Channel Seven - Australian TV - today. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it was a very interesting interpretation of how the Nazis treated Russian Jews mercilessly as elsewhere. <br /> <Br /> Kellie Martin did a really good job, and his tears and frustration as "Frusia" were quite convincing. <br /> <br /> The Holocaust is a part of our history that MUST NOT FORGET. Schindlers List was not the first - and it will not be the last - account of survival and courage in that five-year nightmare. My family is Dutch and I will always applaud all the filmmakers who want to keep the candle light alive by telling someone's courage to stand up and help those who have been abused, violated and killed for being "Jews".
