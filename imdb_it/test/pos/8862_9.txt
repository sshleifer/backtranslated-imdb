Antarctica, winter 1982. An American research base team is surprised by a couple of crazy Norwegians who are chasing a dog with a helicopter, trying to kill him. All Norwegians are killed and the Americans have nothing left but a dog, a couple of bodies and questions. This is the beginning of the biggest horror / thriller movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, all in the end, you feel the mood tense and paranoid. Powerless and only out in the no man's land. Ennio Morricone was nominated for a Razzie award for his score. Because I don't know because as far as I can see his score is simple, disturbing and very good. It really puts you in the right mood. <br /> <br /> The acting is fantastic! The best performance is probably given by the dog which is simply fantastic. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say nothing less. <br /> <br /> Could you think of 1982 and the special effects are not the most impressive? Well, think again! You didn't see everything until you saw it. Falling bodyparts and creatures that change shape ... Rob Bottin has done a great job which today represents a milestone is the trick for special effects. <br /> <br /> The film did not have a great response when it hit the big screen for the first time due to other alien films at the time and is therefore not very well known. In fact you can almost consider it an unknown film. None of those I've asked have heard of it. However the film managed to survive for over twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years are long and with the exception of the haircut the film is still fairly up to date. This film is considered a classic. <br /> <br /> The film is without doubt one of mine, if not my favorite. I've seen it several times, but it's as good as the first time I saw it. As a Norwegian, the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady keeps calling the Norwegian Swedes!
