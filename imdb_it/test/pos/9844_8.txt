James Cagney, the racket and heeler political department, goes on to become a deputy correction commissioner and visit a school of reform for boys. The problem is that Cagney is not involved in the grafting, he really wants to make a difference in the lives of the children there because it comes from a background like theirs. <br /> <br /> The villain of the piece is Dudley Digges who is a chiseler graft and a hypocritical hypocrite to start. One of the subtext of The Mayor of Hell's plot is that these guys are mostly immigrants and those who judge them and are in positions of power are the ones who are here a few generations. Note in the cafeteria scene how Digges offers a thanksgiving prayer for the food they are about to receive, Digges is eating well, but the children are getting a quality you won't feed your pet. <br /> <br /> Cagney has his problems in the city with some of his henchmen and must take him on the run. This puts Digges back in place and creates the film for its climax. <br /> <br /> The Mayor of Hell was a typical product of the working class study. And since it was pre-Code, sometimes it becomes rather macabre. A later version of this, Crime School, featuring Humphrey Bogart and Dead End Kids, was a more sanitized remake. <br /> <br /> Although Cagney does well in the lead role, Madge Evans is the school nurse, the acting honors go to Dudley Digges. Hard to believe that the same man could portray the drunk, but gently, a surgeon of a ship with legs in Mutiny on the Bounty. But Digges is an excellent player and a joy to watch in every movie he is in. <br /> <br /> This film is not often shown due to the racial and ethnic stereotypes it portrays. A lot of minorities would be offended today. Yet it is a beautiful film. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that a few years ago the film Sleepers was released, which touched on some of the same problems. I imagine that films on reform schools do not change at any time.
