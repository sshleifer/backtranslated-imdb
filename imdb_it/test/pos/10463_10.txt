Sometimes it's difficult to watch movies with subtitles (in this case Danish) but it's worth watching them. As the story progresses, the reasoning for choosing two sisters, to care for their father, is questionable but their society is different. Their choice leaves them alone until a French woman arrives. There may be a question as to why the French woman came to their place to stay and this is never fully developed. The party that happens after unexpected funds from France is a source of unusual pleasure for all those who attend and something they have never experienced before. It provides a montage thanks to the kindness provided to the guest. Shot with a dark aura and a display of poverty, it is a wonderful experience for the viewer.
