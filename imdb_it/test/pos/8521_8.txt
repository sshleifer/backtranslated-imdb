As the 1970s drew to a close, rumors about the possible return of Sean Connery in the role he had made famous in 1962 began to circulate in the entertainment industry - James Bond. <br /> <br /> Cubby Broccoli was asked on the spot in Brazil during the making of 'Moonraker' by the BBC Barry Norman as he saw the prospect. Understandably, the producer was reluctant to form an opinion. <br /> <br /> When "Moonraker" opened, Bond fans were outraged by what they perceived as a weakening of the character, and jumping on the star The tank of wars as much as "Live & Let Die "had done with the blaxploitation craze some years before. Many vocalized their hope publicly that Connery would return, if only to show Eon what a real James Bond film should look like. Years of legal battles followed. The original screenplay, entitled "James Bond Of The Secret Service" (later titled "Warhead") was written by Kevin McClory, Len Deighton and Connery, was never filmed and remains one of the great unrealized movie hits. <br /> <br /> A new script, closer to the 'Thunderball' plot, has been commissioned. It was written by Lorenzo Semple Junior, better known as the man who entered the field in "Batman". He also wrote "The Parallax View", one of the best conspiracy thrillers of the decade. Hearing the script he needed a British touch, Connery brought on Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, successful British sit-com writers "The Likely Lads" and "Porridge". The spiritual title was suggested by Connery's wife, Micheline. <br /> <br /> 'Never Say Never Again' was inaugurated shortly before Christmas 1983 with a shower of critical praise; normally sensitive critics were so ecstatic when Connery returned that they ignored all other aspects of the film. Many have used it to brutally attack the Roger Moore series, particularly "Octopussy" that year. In truth, "Octopussy" is superior in every respect. "Never" lack the excitement and the show that is associated with Bond, sometimes it looks like a T-made. movie. The story was made earlier and better in the 1965 Thunderball movie, so "Never" always came out second. He was also hampered by not being part of the official series, which means that the "James Bond Theme" by Monty Norman and the Barry Gun Barry logo by Maurice Binder could not be used. <br /> <br /> Like Bond, Connery is magnificent, returning effortlessly to his most famous role. Playing Bond as an old wiser agent worked. Barbara Carrera got her best role in the film as "Fatima Blush", a lady whose love for murder is such that she dances after (so she thinks) to kill Bond. Kim Basinger burns like "Domino". As S.P.E.C.T.R.E. agent "Maximillian Largo", Klaus Maria Brandauer offers a chilling performance. A big disappointment however is Max Von Sydow as "Blofeld". The posters gave the impression that it would be an important character, in fact it appears only in some scenes. With a stronger screenplay, he could have been one of the worst bad guys of all time. <br /> <br /> "Never" promised to be a return to the first Eon Bonds as "From Russia with love", but did not deliver. The gadgets were there, but they were used almost to apologize. The motorcycle of the Bond rocket was a tiring find even in the 60s. The film tried to compete with Eon's Bonds in terms of humor. Bond, saving himself by throwing his urine sample onto the face of a murderer, is a farce like those found in "Moonraker". But the nadir comes with the introduction of Rowan Atkinson as a clumsy Foreign Office official "Nigel Small-Fawcett". It gives a performance so terribly terrible that you wonder if he thought he'd been in a footlight magazine. <br /> <br /> The music of Michel Legrand is horrible, the man seems to have never seen a James Bond film in his life. <br /> <br /> Even though the film was a financial success, seen years later it stands as the weakest Bond of the 1980s. Connery himself was disappointed and didn't play a movie again for a few years. <br /> <br /> 1983 was a good year for the 007 maniacs, in addition to the films Connery and Moore, George Lazenby made a delightful cameo in the made-for-TV 'Return Of The Man from UNCLE.: The Fifteen Years Later Affair '.
