I have to say that when it comes to Movie to the Movie adaptations, the BBC rarely disappoints me. Now regarding this mini series. I love Starling Novel, it's by far the best murder / mystery I've ever read. The Mini-series provoked my day in a provocative way when I saw it. The main story was kept perfectly intact. The characters match perfectly with those of the novel, the personalities and mannerisms were perfect for Red and Jez. I thought Duncan was very well done, as was Kate, Eric was a too simplistic character, he had a little more depth in the book, but they also altered his subplot so that he could have had something to do with it. Obviously there are changes, but most are cosmetic, but some have disappointed me, the subtext for Eric's murder has changed and this has changed the whole dynamic between Red and Eric for the film, and they have cut the Triathalon Jez formation was doing. Some of the other events in the book have been modified to be visual. Especially if you liked the book, you'll like this, if you like the miniseries, then you'll love the book. I must say that this is the most accurate adaptation of the Book to Movie I've seen.
