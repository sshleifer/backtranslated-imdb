Not all jokes in a comedy are fun. This film takes a serious subject, the deprivation of voter rights and keeps it in the light as he tells jokes about it. It is the film that the Daily Show would have realized if they wanted to turn it into a film. I found Robin Williams much more fun in this film than he was in RV. And while my wife and I share some opposing political views, we have both been doubled by laughter for different parts of this film. Screenwriters here could give Fox News some lessons in a fair and balanced way. Lewis Black was fine for his part, but he never seemed able to highlight his particular brand of comedies for his role. Even Christopher Walken was good, playing his role as a fairly common support undertone, pushing a story forward.
