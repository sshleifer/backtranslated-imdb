This is an absolutely true and faithful adaptation of "The Hollow". It could be argued that the real mystery here is not the best of a Christie, but what makes "The Hollow" special is characterization and I found that the actors here, more or less without exception, were perfect in their parts. In such a uniformly good cast it is difficult to select prominent performances, but I must say that Sarah Miles is just as perfect as Lucy Angkatell. What is extraordinary is that not only does it convey the delicacy of Lucy, her indifference and her most lovable qualities, but she also manages to bring out the underlying truth that, in reality, Lucy is not so beautiful! Megan Dodds is also very good as Henrietta and Claire Price who influence Gerda a lot. John Christow is really a rather unpredictable character, but Jonathan Cake still manages to show us what his women see in him. <br /> <br /> As I said, the script follows the story fairly faithfully. The only disconcerting thing I found was that the relationship between Midge and Edward really came out of nowhere and I think part of it ended up on the floor of the editing room! Theirs is a secondary story and the main story is very well done. Everything looks nice too, really capturing a perfect English autumn. <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful film in every respect and worth seeing.
