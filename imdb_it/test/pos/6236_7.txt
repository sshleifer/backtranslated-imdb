This is a bizarre strangeness, directed by the guy who edited "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". Chuck Conners gives an exaggeratedly exaggerated performance as a "wax" museum owner along the way that our convicted adolescents happen to break down. The wax figures look "so real", emphasizes one of the boys. Heh, heh, heh ... It's not a cool movie like a strange mix of psychological horror and old-fashioned "House of Wax" style. I can think of many, many horror films that are worse than this.
