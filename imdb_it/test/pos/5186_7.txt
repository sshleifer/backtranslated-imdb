This is a catastrophic film set in London. The start of more hurricanes, storms and tornadoes over Scotland have shifted eastward, breaking down the coast of England and later the south. After several hours of heavy rain, the London barrier over the Thames is not enough to run and paves the way for disaster. Then a colossal journey of unstoppable tidal waves to the east causing devastation and the lives of millions of Londoners are in danger. At the center of the story is a climatologist (Tom Courtenay), a climatologist who tries to save London from the effects of the giant wave, trying to convince the authorities that the city dam was dangerous, besides a naval engineer (Robert Carlyle) and the his ex-wife Samantha (Jessalyn Gilsig). They are trapped in the barrier and left in the sea. Meanwhile, the headquarters of the secret government office ruled by Nash (Joanne Whalley) under the direct orders of the deputy minister (David Suchet) tries to control many displaced people and avoid more deaths, about 200,000. They have some time to save London from the total catastrophe. <br /> <br /> A perfectly acceptable dramatic disaster with acceptable acting. Magnificent Tom Courtenay as a climatologist who predicts the catastrophe and the excellent Robert Carlyle and Jessalyn Gilsig as ex matrimony who rekindle their love. The film contains impressive flood scenes that come to life from the special effects of the breathtaking computer generator, better than the classic of the '70s, like "Earthquake, Towering Hell" and similarly to "Armaguedon and Day after tomorrow". Although it is not a clear complaint, we know that the flood is caused by the greenhouse effect and global warming that gives rise to the ozone hole. The film is well directed by Tony Mitchell. I would recommend this film to people who like disaster films. Other adaptations on the floods are the following: "Flood (1976)" directed by Earl Bellamy with Robert Culp and Barbara Hershey; 'Hard rain (1998)' directed by Mikael Salomon with Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater; 'Flood: a River's rampage (1979)' directed by Bruce Pittman with Richard Thomas
