SPOILERS <br /> <br /> As you may know, I have commented on many short films in recent months. Now, I have no idea why I'm commenting on Steamboat Willie, I guess I was just trying desperately to comment on anything, so I looked at this, and now I'm commenting on it. This, or course, is one of the first cartoons, and I don't think it's the first cartoon with sound. <br /> <br /> Here is the plot. Mickey is driving a steamer when Pete throws it away and he drives it. When they stop for the load, Minnie Mouse tries to move forward but fails miserably. Mickey takes her up by a crane. Then a goat eats his sheet of paper with Turkey in the straw on it. They use the goat to make the song. When I say this I mean that they used the goat as a Victrola. Mickey Mouse plays the animals on the steamboat for the instruments of the song. Then an angry Pete throws Mickey into a potato room and Mickey is forced to peel potatoes for the rest of the day. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is another revolutionary silent short film. I mean, this is the third Mickey Mouse comic. Yes, the third. Moreover, this is not the first cartoon with sound. I think there were two more before this. However, this film is really, really revolutionary. Mikcey was even more violent than he. I mean, he throws a potato at a bird and may have brutally slaughtered it. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> Recommended movies: Plane Crazy.
