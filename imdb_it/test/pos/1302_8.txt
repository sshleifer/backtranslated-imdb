It's nice to see a romantic comedy that has no sissy guide, this has a solid acting by both male protagonists and also by the female protagonist and even if the story is a bit long and a little clich√© you can't help but like it . <br /> <br /> I think the story was a little rushed to the end, but extending that would have made the story even longer. Superior to other romantic comedies like 100 days with Mr Arrogant, and possibly linked to my friend tutor. <br /> <br /> It would be an interesting introduction to Korean cinema, not as exceptional as my naughty but good girl.
