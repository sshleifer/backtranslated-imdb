I saw this in 99 and I remember loving it. Even today I can remember parts of the film in my head, like the oblique tone. Unfortunately since 99 - now I could never remember the name of this until I was looking through the filmography of a friend of my uncles and I came across this (played Clive Kennard). Immediately after reading the description, I knew what it was. After getting in touch, I was shocked to find out that not only was it not released on video or DVD, but it has yet to be repeated. This is a great shame, I beg you that at least ITV repeat this superb TV movie. Nick Hancock showed in this film that he could do much more than host a show with his character, Mike Tonker. This is a film that most football fans would love and even those who don't like sports too would be able to enjoy the comic value of it. Yes, this is a brief review, but there is not much to say apart from this is an undervalued film, it deserves to be repeated or published on video / DVD, so ITV, me and the other fans of this film beg you. PLEASE CONSIDER ONE OF THOSE!
