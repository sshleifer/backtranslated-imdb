This film is breathtaking and amazing. But I think maybe you can only appreciate it with role-playing role-playing games. It's like a game. One problem is that the plot is too similar to the game and has too many twists. The twists are excessive. Jude Law offers excellent performance. I really like this film, just like Jerome in Gattaca and Gigglo Joe in A.I.
