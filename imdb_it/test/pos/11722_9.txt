This is the "Citizen Kane" by Burt Reynolds. Tragically he has never been involved in anyone else where he has approached "Sharkey's Machine". It seemed to me that he put everything he had in it. It's a movie that is in love with movies. The opening sequence in which Detective Sharkey saves a load of hostages by bus is an immensely exciting piece of cinema. Everything moves so fast once it has started to fail that it seems to take on a life of its own, a brilliantly achieved effect. It looks cold, tense and dangerous in the streets of Reynolds. The fence house looks dirty and tired, full of desperate people on both sides of the law, screaming, blasphemy, trying to do business or just stay alive. In this subterranean world descends the recently degraded Sharkey, a reward for a drug mess (caused by a corrupt policeman) - he and his team are part of the deputy team. Information they gather about a crooked politician leads them into the world of girls classy ring and ruthless drug barons. Looking at the apartment of one of these ringing women (Rachel Ward) Sharkey falls in love with her portrait on the wall (I know, I know) and when a woman's body is found with her face shot in one of the rooms, she thinks it's her . (Well, I said it was a movie that loved movies). The scene in which he walks on him works beautifully, even if you've seen the original. The film is full of good touches, in particular I like the war story of Charles Durning, recited in a subtle way and taken in sharp contrast to Sharkey's abduction and torture, which is appropriately hard and brutal. I must mention Vittorio Gassman and Henry Silva as two disparate but equally evil brothers, absolutely without salvific characteristics. They are "full" whenever they are on the screen and they are not a loss to society when their time comes, the end of Mr. Silva is really special. As mentioned, this is a Clint Eastwood film that Clint never made. The biggest compliment I can pay "Sharkey's Machine" is to point out that, in my opinion, Clint Eastwood could not have done a better job. The soundtrack has an equally high standard, with Sarah Vaughan, Joe Williams, Julie London, Chet Baker and other high-class artists. "Street Life" by Randy Crawford plays behind the title sequence, and I can never hear it without, in my mind's eye, seeing Sharkey walk on the sidewalk. Like other correspondents, I never understood why this film was a bit of a flop. I hope it is due to a critical review, particularly at a time when so many films and police shows without a quarter of its energy, freshness and pure joy of the vivre are praised by the rooftops. If you are ever tempted to think of Burt Reynolds as a destroyed and burned pony, put "Sharkey's Machine" in your video machine. I promise you won't be disappointed.
