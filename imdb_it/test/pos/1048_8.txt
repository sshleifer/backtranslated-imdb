This film reminds me a lot of the next Rock Hudson film MAN FAVORITE SPORT - about a fisherman writer who has NEVER fished and is forced to enter a fishing tournament. In this case, Barbara Stanwyck is a writer at Martha Stewart who doesn't know how to cook and doesn't have the perfect family she describes in her articles - in fact, she has no family. Well, like Rock, she's maneuvered to perform - in this case, creating a huge dinner during the holidays in the countryside. Since there is no family, take a veteran and some friends home and desperately try NOT to "leave the cat out of the bag" that cannot do any of the things for which it is known. A nice little comedy and a welcome film for the annual film holiday line-up.
