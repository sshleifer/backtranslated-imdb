I'm not a fan of musicals, but I'm a big fan of Jean Renoir and Jean Gabin. I rented this movie on a whim and was pleasantly surprised to expect the greatness of the classic director. This film is BEAUTIFUL. The shots are like oil paintings with movement, something that many directors are looking for but Renoir MASTERS. I can't express how this film transcends itself ... it's not really a musical, it only has a couple of well-placed musical numbers and a great dance finale. But there is something in particular about this film that makes you feel the absolute JOY when you look at it. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of foreign art films, but I'm also a meathead who loves things like Die Hard and Film Schwarzenegger. I explain very easily to things that are overly happy or in "la la land", but this film has an overwhelming positive energy that is simply irresistible - not to mention every frame is gorgeous and the plot is good. 10 out of 10.
