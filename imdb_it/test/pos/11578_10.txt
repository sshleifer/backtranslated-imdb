I saw "The Sea Within" today and I loved it. The actors in the film are wonderful (especially Javier Bardem, of course), but I thought that Belén Rueda would have played a better role. Lola Dueñas, Clara Segura and, in particular, Mabel Rivera perform excellent interpretations. And I can't forget Celso Bugallo and Joan Dalmau (brother and father of the protagonist). <br /> <br /> There are two technical aspects that I loved a lot: the photography of Aguirresarobe and the soundtrack of Amenábar itself. I liked the song, "Negra sombra" ("Dark Shadow"), by Luz Casal with the music of Carlos Núñez. <br /> <br /> In short, I think the Spanish Academy should choose "The Sea Within" in order to compete at the Oscars. I liked other Spanish productions, like "Bad Education" by Almodóvar, but Amenábar's film is much better than them. 'The Sea Within' deserves all the awards.
