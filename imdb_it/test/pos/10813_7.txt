The film takes place during the year 1940 and the French are about to lose the war. <br /> <br /> The film includes all genres: comedy, romantic, murder and history. It is likely that the historical part may not be as likely as the rest. <br /> <br /> It is not, however, a great film of laughter, but a wide and occasional smile!
