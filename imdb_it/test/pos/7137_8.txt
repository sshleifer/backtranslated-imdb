Based on a true story . . . <br /> <br /> The premise of this film is to illustrate that through fairly normal events it is possible for a "decent" external mother to withdraw into heroin addiction. <br /> <br /> *** semi spoiler *** Some scenes are quite inaccurate - while others almost make you want to get the 'fix'. <br /> <br /> Computer technician / female graphic artist with a good relationship with her young addictive girls after her work colleague, who is a 'chipper' (-someone who can have fun + from time to time). Then it becomes an addiction that leads her to mark "street" traders after losing contact with her constant dealer. br /> <br /> The scenes that show that he is going down and becoming "sick" are often VERY real - especially the first real night sweat. Before all these events he started a relationship with a guy who just happened to have lost his wife to the bottle, and insists that she has an internal radar to avoid getting involved with such women. Some radars! However, after a few laps later and a strange behavior, the boyfriend challenges her on "what's going on". His radar starts getting more with it and asks him to empty his bag; she hits the roof and goes wild. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the excellent and open relationship he had developed before this tragedy, he is the first to "find" some real evidence in his bag; then he looks around the tube for his "deposit" - apparently his sensitivity comes from the school lessons on taking drugs - and when he finds a large supply in the bathroom he rinses it! NOT A HAPPY WOMAN when making her next bathroom and her 'disappeared'. <br /> <br /> The boy holds one back and puts it on the dining table - then goes into further refusal - he admits it and says no worse than the drug. <br /> <br /> Thge kid does all the right things and calls his friends and generally puts it in a position where it needs to be "cleaned up" - if you forgive the pun. <br /> <br /> The film takes the viewer through rather arduous situations where danger is not far away. <br /> <br /> Eventually you get help from a professional organization and it is cold turkey - you will have to watch the movie to see what happens next. . . .
