Oz is one of the most exciting and compelling TV experiences ever. <br /> <br /> After capturing pieces of this on SBS, I was initially skeptical, however, having finished the fourth season now, unfortunately I know that this brilliant show is nearing its end, (6 seasons), yet I still can't get enough of OZ. <br /> <br /> You want something that pushes your senses and your stomach to the limit ... Oz fits the bill, hands down. <br /> <br /> This is not children's stuff, people, it's violent, brutal and not pretty. Because, it is an experimental unit within a maximum security prison. <br /> <br /> Tom Fontana's Oz is brilliant in all departments, actors, scriptwriters and directors. <br /> <br /> HBO's Oz site is also highly recommended, for newcomers, for information on this series. This was the first one-hour show produced by HBO, and shows how masterly it is and what others will follow. <br /> <br /> Thank-You HBO
