Small (not exceptional) small horror film with a high "creep" factor (not to be confused with a 1991 film of the same name, or the most recent (2001) Campfire STORIES). A central fairy tale of stuck teenagers telling ghost stories around a bonfire in spooky woods leads pleasantly and binds the different stories that make up most of the film (Watch for Ron Livingston (Office Space, Band of Brothers) and Jennifer MacDonald in a lively and sexy segment ("Honeymoon")). Solid acting and some really "scary" moments make this cooler above average. A good example of an interesting plot, together with a recitation of quality ensembles resulting in a set larger than the sum of its parts. The end of "Surprise" of the main plot adds a nice disturbing touch, although some may see it coming. The film is not available on DVD, but can be found on VHS.
