If you haven't seen it, try to do it. It is available on DVD. It is a production of channel 4 (United Kingdom), possibly in conjunction with German and Danish TV. If you've seen the movie it's basically the same storyline. Several intercalated stories are connected through the drug trade. The story jumps between the housewife (played by the excellent Lyndsay Duncan) who tries to conclude an agreement on behalf of her husband, who to her surprise is an international drug dealer (and generally a dangerous man). <br /> <br /> To the minister, who is rooted in his work at the expense of his family, he is investigating the whole state of affairs with international drug trafficking. He gets some eyes open on the reality of heroin when his daughter discovers she has a "problem". Then he visits Pakistan, officially, where he seems to have been taught that abuse (not just drugs or his casual use) is the problem and he even goes so far as to sample some products (an excellent scene in which he simultaneously realizes what the attraction is and why it is and why it is such a problem). In Pakistan we can see the other side. The desperation of farmers who can barely survive by switching to opium production and crime lords. Unnecessary attempts at subsidies lead to the system getting rich. It is such a drenched country of drugs, but only a relative fraction of the abuse we have in the West. Around all this an interpolation customs officer / police officer tries to capture the "Dutch" connection in heroin smuggling. I seek justice for his murdered companion. This is truly a masterpiece. Super and sober performances of all the main actors, in a way that only European cinema can really do. <br /> <br /> To see. Especially if you've seen the film, they compliment each other and present some subtly different opinions / attitudes on both sides of the pond.
