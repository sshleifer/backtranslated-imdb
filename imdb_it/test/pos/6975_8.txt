I have a letter from Mrs. Knight, who went to college with my older sister. In it, he tells about the difficulties in making this film. She herself was pregnant - an interesting conjunction with the plot of the film - and the director of novices was insecure, quite green, and had great difficulties with all decisions, logistics, etc. They were always on the move, and it was a very difficult recovery. <br /> <br /> The film, however, with an important debut for James Caan, remains effective and influential. It is a great showcase for the talent that Mrs. Knight has demonstrated throughout her career: on television, in films and on stage, where she won the Tony for "Kennedy's Children". <br /> <br /> This film has aged well
