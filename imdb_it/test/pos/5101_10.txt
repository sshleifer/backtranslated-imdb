I wish I had been exposed for the first time in a cinema when it was released, as some of the commentators had been. It really is a treasure. To be honest, I haven't seen any other version of Goodbye, Mr. Chips, and neither do I want to. For me this is a perfect version. I saw it for the first time on TCM years ago and I never forgot it. I had the pleasure of watching it yesterday with my girlfriend, even though I had recorded it from the TCM days before. There were parts of the movie where we were both cross-eyed, it's really a moving film. <br /> <br /> And shouldn't that be what movies are made of? <br /> <br /> The music is beautiful, the film was shot beautifully. Acting is top notch. And the story is delicate and timeless. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite movies of all time.
