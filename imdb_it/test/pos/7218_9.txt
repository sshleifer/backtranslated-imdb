This film is a brilliant revisitation of Shakespeare's classic love story, complete with "vicious sex, piercing and dismemberment". It has the same spirit as all the other Troma films [except Combat Shock ... That windy was depressing] but it's not just for Troma fans. Anyone who appreciates lowbrow graphics and an exhilarating script will undoubtedly fall in love with this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't expect pretentious and artistic crap like the R & J version with Claire Danes and Leo DiCaprio; this knows that it is a stupid film and draws its humor. Acting is also surprisingly good, and you can only feel Sammy Capulet's pain as he tries to put his brain back into his head. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack, which contains many original and high-energy bands like The Wesley Willis Fiasco, Supernova and The Meatmen is also four-star. This film should be seen by all, because it remains faithful to the original story while it is still chock full of cold-blooded / characteristic Troma humor.
