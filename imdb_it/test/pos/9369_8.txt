Crossfire remains one of the best films for Hollywood messages because, unlike the admirably admired Gentleman's Agreement, which has beaten in theaters for a few months, it chooses to send its message through the form of an excellent noir thriller rather than having an outraged star which constantly says "It's because I'm Jewish, isn't it?" It's much easier to get the message that hatred is like a gun being loaded through when corpses are real rather than metaphorical. Quite shamefully, the short featurette on the Warners' DVD does not mention the fact that the novelist Richard Brooks denied the film in the transition from homophobic to anti-Semitic murder, but it is interesting to note that while the victim is killed mainly because he is Jewish, there is no doubt in the performance of Sam Levene that the character is actually also gay ?? not a minced caricature, but there is certainly an aspect of two lost souls in his scenes with George Cooper's confused soldier. There is not much mystery to who the murderer is: even if the murder is performed in classic noir shadows, the killer's body language is immediately recognizable, but then the film has its characters drifting to the same conclusion: the tension comes from trying it and saving the falling boy. <br /> <br /> There is an element of Ealing Films in the band of soldiers that come together to knock out their friend (one might almost see that aspect as a project for Hue and Cry), but the atmosphere is pure RKO noir. Set in a long and stifling night, the film looks good full of deep dark blacks and shadows born as much from the economy as from the style (reduced lighting times and allowed director Edward Dmytryk more time to work with actors) and the excellent cast is what manages to make the most of the script: a casual but charismatic Robert Mitchum, Robert Young's detective as Maigret, Gloria Grahame's tramp and perennially fearful Paul Kelly as his compulsive liar admirer , a boy who looks for stories in the way other people feel about bonds. But the lasting impression is the excellent interpretation of Robert Ryan as a boy who could make a good move on his own while doing his best to help the man wrongfully accused to death row. A great surprise success in 1946, as a prize, Dmytryk and producer Adrian Scott found themselves investigated by the UAC, which had a noticeable tendency to hit the Jews. So much for the crusades ??
