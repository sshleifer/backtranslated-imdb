My favorite movie of all time. This was an imperfect piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary "Heart of Darkness" made it even more compelling. Coppola at that point was the king of Hollywood after making "the Godfather" and "Godfather" and had developed the ego necessary to dare even try to make a film like "Apocalypse Now". Out of sheer arrogance he went to the Philippines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he reached the col fence. Kurtz. And just like Willard, he didn't know what he would do once he got there. This is a masterpiece of American cinema, beautifully photographed and the river is a perfect metaphor and background for the story. What I like most about "Apocalypse Now" is that it offers no answers or conclusions. As a result, due to this openness, it infuriates some viewers who love their films to be much more obvious. <br /> <br /> This film challenges categorization. Some call it a war movie that is not at all, in reality it is more a personal study of man. The best photo of Vietnam is "Platoon" in my opinion and if a spectator looks for a review of the Vietnam war, he goes there first for the answers. <br /> <br /> Coppola should be praised for his grip on the war bureaucracy that he transmits quite effectively with his meeting with Gen.Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate review. Kilgore's pure audacity makes him an unforgettable character and the attack at dawn will always be a Hollywood classic. <br /> <br /> It is an almost psychedelic cruise towards a surreal ending that makes it a film not accessible to everyone. Very stimulating to look at but also rewarding. I could offer my explanations on every scene, but it would be totally useless. This film is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification. <br /> <br /> A small footnote, surely if you are your first Apocalypse Now viewer, look first at the original version, the 'Redux' version is, I think, more intended for hardcore fans and it's more of a curiosity than a "new and improved" version of the film
