This film is surprisingly good. The ninja fighting sequences were incredible. I haven't seen all of Sho Kosugi's films, but this is probably the best of those I've seen. Probably the most impressive fighting sequence was at the beginning when ninja killed about 20 people, which was one of the most impressive ninja combat sequences I've ever seen. Another good combat sequence was at the funeral of a policeman where the ninja provide more people to bury. Even the last battle was very impressive. I also liked the soundtrack of this movie. The story was pretty good for a ninja movie, actually it was a little different from the other ninja movies. So if you're a fan of ninja movies, you'll probably like this.
