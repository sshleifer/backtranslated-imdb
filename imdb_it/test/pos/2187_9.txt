SWEENEY TODD by Stephen Sondheim: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET, opened on Broadway on March 1, 1979 with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in the lead roles. Although it has practically conquered every conceivable prize, the box office has not lived up to expectations and the original production ended its run at 557 shows. Fortunately, however, the opera went on tour - and along the way it was captured in a movie. The result is a remarkable capture of the show with George Hern, who replaced Cariou, and Lansbury in a close approximation of the original Broadway scene. <br /> <br /> There is, however, a flaw. Simply put: theatrical performances do not run very well, because a performance that works well on stage must fill the theater and is therefore very, very large - and when positioned on the film, these performances often seem slightly static, oppressively aggressive, or both . SWEENEY TODD is no exception. Seen in the cinema, it has a "stand and sing" quality, and while both Hern and Lansbury seem to have modulated their performances for the taste of the camera, it is not the case with Betsy Joslyn as Joanna; his greatest performance of his life is read on the film as unpleasantly hectic and his extremely operatic voice feels out of place when it is in contrast with the voices of the general cast. <br /> <br /> Taking this effect on the film stage into consideration, however, this is indeed an exceptional performance of a unique and macabre comic opera in the operetta style. Lansbury is amazing, a mixture of nonsense, stupidity and cunning malice, while Hern really does have the role of the psychotic barber whose clients "go to their tomb shaved impeccably". The general cast is pretty good and although the movie doesn't let us see enough of the set, there's enough to be impressive. And the music! Who can argue with what you consider to be the best job in Sondheim? The story itself is extremely well known, particularly in England. In 1846 Thomas Peckett Perst collected some urban myths for a story entitled A STRING OF PEARLS; within a year or so it was adapted to the stage as SWEENEY TODD, THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET - and, in an age that knew little about copyright law, the variations of the game soon spread throughout England. Each, however, was more or less the same: Sweeney Todd, a barber, kills the men who come to him for a shave; Mrs. Lovett, her collaborator, prepares them in cakes and feeds them to an unsuspecting public. Sondheim's version is specifically based on a 1973 version of Christopher Bond. <br /> <br /> The story is very Grand Guignol, with a lot of blood, bodies that slide down slides and grotesque humor; at the same time, however, the music, lyrics and subplot of an innocent in the clutches of evil open the subject to numerous lyric choirs that one would not expect. Sondheim's lyrics are often ironic, but never more than here; he weaves a great deal of evil satire into industry and capitalism along the way, and certainly one cannot fault the strange and elegant Victorian style of his complex music. <br /> <br /> As the "concert version" starring Hern and Patti LuPone, this particular film also provides us with several selections that have been cut from the 2007 Tim Burton film version, in particular the "Attend the Tale of Sweeney Todd ", which runs like a thread for the duration of the game. It is also, in my opinion, much more comical than the film, which tends to underestimate the comedy in favor of an even bigger show of blood. In any case, if you're a fan of the story, this is the legendary Broadway show on tour, and it's a knock-out. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
