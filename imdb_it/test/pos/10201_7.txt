WESTERN UNION tells in a melodramatic way the stringing of telegraph lines between two points to the west. Brothers Dean Jagger and Virginia Gilmore work for Western Union, and Randolph Scott and Robert Young work for Creightons. Indians and some bad white boys get in the way, but nothing can stop America's progress. This sense of manifest destiny is greatly enhanced by a first-rate musical score and a lively color photograph. Scott is a bank robber who tries to repair his ways, and both he and the engineer Young compete for the lively Gilmore's attention. A lot of great character actors help advance great production.
