For the record, the 1949 version of "The Blue Lagoon" is not the original film, as many have claimed. <br /> <br /> This story was shot in Britain, in 1923, immediately after the novel was written. As much as I'd like to see the 1949 version, I'd really like to have the opportunity to see the real original version of this story on the film. <br /> <br /> Grant, the 1980 film starring Christopher Atkins, Brooke Shields and the two young men were filmed with a beautiful photograph. The acting didn't seem very good to me when I saw this movie for the first time, but after seeing it a few times ... it becomes obvious that two children growing up on an island without an adult guide would really have a simplistic way of get closer to life ... either in their language, appearance or daily activities. <br /> <br /> Although some have had the good fortune to see the "Blue Lagoon" of 1949, I cannot help wondering if there is anyone alive who could remember the 1923 release of this story from film.
