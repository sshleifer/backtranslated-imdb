<br /> <br /> `<br /> <br /> 5 years ago, if you watched an Australian film, you would expect to see crocodile hunters, war stories, drag queens, kangaroos and koalas and Australians in the general is represented as a fool who lives off the ground, saying words like "cobber" and generally being the classic loser. <br /> <br /> The fortunately Australian film has evolved over the past two years and is turning out modern days ?? classics such as Blackrock, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Yolngu Boy and Sample People. <br /> <br /> In this evolution of the film we also find Two Hands. <br /> <br /> Set in Sydney's Kings Cross, Two Hands is a black comedy about crime and survival in the harsh part of the city. Pando, played by Bryan Brown, is a boss of the Mob in Sydney. He is the king of organized crime who wears flip-flops, wears a squat and helps his son with his origami. It's vicious, but real. As are his "mobs", holding the gun to someone's head in a scene and then playing boardgames in the next. They are very respected and if they ask you for a favor, you don't say no. <br /> <br /> Enter Jimmy, played by Heath Ledger. Jimmy is your average Australian boy in his early twenties. He's a good guy who wants to make a name for himself without being fooled by anyone, so when Pando asks Jimmy to deliver $ 10,000, Jimmy accepts. <br /> <br /> Things start to get exciting when 2 teenagers manage to steal money while Jimmy is on the beach. So now Jimmy is $ 10,000 in a mob boss. From here we start to see all the stories interconnected with Jimmy and his bank robbery attempt to recover the money, Jimmy and Alex (the love interest, played by Rose Byrne), Pando trying to find Jimmy and, of course, the two adolescents and their new well-being. The concept is deepened by the narrator, Jimmy's dead brother, Michael, who was killed by Pando and his band years earlier. <br /> <br /> In the end all the plots came together very well with a surprise touch to shock and stun the audience. I loved it. <br /> <br />
