A GOOD THING: this hidden treasure of a dramatic crime is incredibly fun from beginning to end. An example of low-budget film production at its best, writer / director Skip Woods apparently uses everything he could find (ex: Lamborghini, super model, cow phone) and an ear for dialogue to add satire levels to the plot and all his photo shoot. <br /> <br /> OTHER GOOD COST: This film seems made for the era of DVDs, with several segments that include a larger story (similar to the work of Tarantino and Desperado by Robert Rodriguez). Each "chapter" of the film features the main character of Thomas Jane who spends a day at home making fast and memorable performances of Aaron Eckhart, Glen Plummer, Mickey Rourke, Michael Jeter, James LeGros and an unforgettable role of Paulina Porizkova. <br /> <br /> EVEN ANOTHER THING: Not exactly a "good" thing, but incredibly shocking and memorable ... Every person who sees this film remembers an important scene. Just as Deliverance will always be remembered for the terrible rape of Ned Beatty, Thursday will come down as a movie in which a woman forcibly violates a reluctant man. Unforgettable. <br /> <br /> A BAD THING: the title suggests that it is somehow related (or derived) to the series of films "Friday" with Ice Cube. <br /> <br /> GRADE: A +
