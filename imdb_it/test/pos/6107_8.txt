Boasting the title of the sickest film ever made, Pink Flamingos is an undisputed classic. Of course, the camcorder is shaky and decentralized, the plot is confused and slow, and every single character in the film is repugnant and contemptible, but Pink Flamingos has a certain playful charm and a brilliant satirical spirit that no other film can match. <br /> <br /> Even if this film is really offensive, reading the descriptions of what happens in the film is much worse than seeing it. Only John Waters can succeed in rape, murder, sadism, cannibalism, coprophagy, and almost every other form of human debauchery known to man seems utterly exhilarating. This film must be seen to be believed.
