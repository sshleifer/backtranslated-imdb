It looks like a b grade and you will probably think that there are no reasons to rent this movie! But do it! I didn't expect anything from this movie, just something to pass the time, but I was caught from the start! Two interesting premises - A failed bank robbery, a million dollars missing and two girls on the road to start a new life - How will these two stories clash? Just when you think you know where the movie is headed, make it a 180 and you're left speechless by the great plot twists! It has a great but unexpected ending, and you still want - always a good sign - to rent it or even buy it, you won't be disappointed!
