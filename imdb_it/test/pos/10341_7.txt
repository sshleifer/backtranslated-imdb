This film is still alive and well today thanks to the presence of Alan Ladd. This is positive in a sense because the film has some interesting things to say, but badly in another because everyone who looks at it expecting that the robust ladd may run into his usual steps, will be very disappointed. Without fanfare or introduction, Ladd is suddenly introduced into the third reel. True, his role is fundamental but it is small and risks being lost in the fray. There are many key roles in the ambivalent screenplay of journalist Martin Mooney, which affects all political alliances and the ruthless denigration of Reform candidates. It is the beautiful and extremely talented Joan Woodbury who ties together the various aspects of the story. Unlike the usual Hollywood production, the plot actually proceeds in a series of jumps, very similar to the later films made by the French "New Wave", although easier to follow here, especially if you are aware that the original title of the film it was Paper Bullets. However, some of the narrative switches and characters in the film are a bit disconcerting, particularly in the role played by Jack LaRue who wisely chose to play the part in a strangely undemanding way. One of Jack's best acting jobs ever, but no one will probably notice, alas!
