A low budget but memorable bet would be rather upsetting that instead emerges as the theater of the bizarre. The vulnerable and naive nurse, Charlotte Beale, arrives in a remote psychiatric hospital and is completely unaware of the fact that the only healthy people have been murdered, despite the red flags that are constantly being raised around her. <br /> <br /> The lack of a decent budget really gives filmmakers little more than a sense of style, as well as a cast of wacky characters. The pleasures of this film do not come from the shocks of the film, which are quite docile, but with a strange atmosphere. First we have the delirious woman who thinks her doll is real. There is also an ax murderer judge, a shocked war veteran, and old Mrs. Callahan is like everyone's crazy daffy grandmother. A young patient named Allyson attributes a new meaning to the term "nymphomaniac". A guy named Sam is just a little slow after a cursed lobotomy, and Jennifer suddenly goes between catatonia and violent outbursts of anger. The only other sentient person in the place seems to be Dr. Masters, but does she have a secret? <br /> <br /> "Do not Look in the Basement" is a great example of low-budget exploitation films. There isn't much plot going on, but convenience works for the film. Several cast members turn into memorable shows, most notably Betty Chandler and Annabelle Weenick, and the way the director adds strange little details to the film can really stay true to you. <br /> <br /> The scene between Allyson and "the man of the phone" is an all-time classic, and especially the facial expressions of Dr. Masters when it starts to cross the limit near the end of the movie Brownrigg also makes good use of the economic soundtrack, with several musical cues that really evoke the characters they accompany. . <br /> <br /> It is also wonderful how Charlotte herself plunges into the hysteria at its peak, with patients revealing that Dr. Masters is simply another prisoner, and therefore suggests that CHARLOTTE is also a patient who is allowed to recite his disappointments (he certainly has a weak grip on reality, because otherwise he would not question the ominous lack of telephone services or external contact?) The scene in which Charlotte manages to finish Dr. Stephens , barely alive, with a toy boat, must be one of the greatest moments of low budget horror. Yes, "Do not Look in the Basement" could very well be the "American beauty" of Grade Z garbage.
