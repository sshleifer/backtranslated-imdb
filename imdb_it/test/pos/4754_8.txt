this movie has a great hunting scene, if you listen to the soundtrack when the cars run after each other, it looks very similar to the soundtrack of the movie, you will hear the movement of a 4 speed and show the brake pedal in Roy Schneider's car, it's automatic brake pedal !, I think one of the most enjoyable moments of the film is when the bad Richard lynch is looking at the driver of the car he is in, as if he were a fool! ........ the scammer who runs the garage is also the boy who in the first rocky film, the rocky head. Nice film! even when the door is torn, you can see the guy sitting in the car opening the door, the guy who helps him get out of the car looks like a Mr Brady from the Brady group, doesn't he?
