especially when you look at the amount of shit that came on DVD. I found this movie very funny. Rip Torn is classic with its tips; Rob Schneider if exhilarating and irritating like the overcompensed Ensign; Bruce Dern is a big "bad guy". The whole cast seems to have enjoyed it, and it's not at the expense of the public. If you like simple fun comedy, and you're not looking too deeply into meaning, you might just fall in love with it.
