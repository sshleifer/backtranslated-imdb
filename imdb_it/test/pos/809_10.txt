In a better civilization, this and many other David Suchet films will be released in theaters. The plots are fabulous (no, I had no idea who had done it, but the clues were all there if I had been more imaginative - the best kind of mystery), the surprising production values, the acting (by Edward Fox, Sarah Miles, Lysette Anthony, Megan Dodds and, of course, David Suchet as Hercule Poirot) simply perfect, the wonderful dialogue, the music and the sense of suspense and tension are wonderful things. <br /> <br /> One of the pleasures of these Hercule Poirot films for a man is how many beautiful women perform in them! There were two here - the sexy curvy Megan Doods and the gorgeous Lysette Anthony. <br /> <br /> You can't really go wrong by renting these - they are simply wonderful - like the most wonderful dinner in the most wonderful restaurant with the most perfect company you can imagine - your mind is constantly working because it's all there and you fight but keeping your mind constantly able to keep up with everything - and beautiful settings. <br /> <br /> I can't think of films that stimulate thought more than these films by Hercule Poirot / David Suchet. It is impossible to praise them - and I had never seen one before a few months ago or read a Christie Agate.
