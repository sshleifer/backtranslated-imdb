Love Jones is one of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The main thing that comes to mind is the fact that it is very well directed. I studied this film in its entirety - with watching movies more than once, certain things are born on you unconsciously - the direction of this film, as well as writing, is chic, fashionable and cunning! I'm in love with management. The scene in which Larenz Tate and Nia Long are driving the motorcycle through northern Chicago at night is amazing. The director of this film deserves the awards for his excellent work. <br /> <br /> Love Jones is a classy and sexy film. It highlights the fact that we can be people who love, who have defects, who love to live, learn and simply be us without the clamor. Being our natural selves. <br /> <br /> Poetry is wonderful, but the plot, dialogue and scenes really make this film. <br /> <br /> This film deserves to be seen. It's a great movie for lovers and friends to sit and watch, or, the hopeless romantic (like me) to sit and enjoy alone on Friday or Saturday nights. Every day of the week when peace, solitude and some entertainment is needed, Love Jones is what I recommend.
