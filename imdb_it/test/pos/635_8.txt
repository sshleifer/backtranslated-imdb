I couldn't stop watching this movie, even though my bedtime was over. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with Hitchcock are deserved: this thing really plays with you. Walk a wonderful line between real, immediate suspense and a dark and distancing humor. Like many of Hitch's heroes, our silent doe-eyed witness has innocently stumbled onto something really horrible - and we are teased with her, taking turns identifying and feeling her fear, taking turns looking at her with exciting suspense as she further endangered. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers took great care in working out. From the beginning, they engage and challenge you to determine what is real and what is manufacture; who should be trusted and who is a monster. The plot turns and turns unpredictably. The suspense is created with a combination of camerawork, images and carefully chosen music, but more simply THE EYES of the characters, which convey a pure fear to you. <br /> <br /> A word of warning: there are some terribly real gores, as well as some nude scenes. The horror scenes are made in an emotional way that makes them much more disturbing and disturbing than in any photo of teenagers. <br /> <br /> And a teenager's photo is not. The characters are bizarre and they feel real people, for one thing: a couple (including the heroine) can also be as captivating as I did. There will be no errors in watching a movie made for adults. I mean, Alec Guinness is in it, briefly, and you know he didn't have the job! <br /> <br /> Insert it into the VCR one night when you can't sleep. . . and I don't want to, yet.
