it didn't look like it was from a fantasy movie. The film is dark, with dark shades. The soundtrack is too uplifting to the point where it intruded into the images. I'm sure they were aiming for something militant, but it just didn't work. The scene in which Astin is trying to escape is a perfect example. Why does it sound like the Goonies? There is no comedy, there is no brightness for this !! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is fantastic and the acting is also very good. I enjoyed everyone's performances. It is available on the Netflix online display. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth a visit, but write your soundtrack !!
