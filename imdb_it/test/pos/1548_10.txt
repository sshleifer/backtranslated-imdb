Ken Loach showed the world the downside of Swinging London with "Poor Cow", of the London woman Joy (Carol White) who teams up with a thief and who has a son with him, just to see the man end up in the babble . While his friend (Terence Stamp) manages to help her, he proves to be a little better at what he is a loser. It soon becomes clear to Joy that she will have to make a serious decision about where she is going in her life. <br /> <br /> One thing I determined - I don't know if this is accurate or not - was a use of irony in the film. His name is Joy, but he feels no joy in his life. Although it was not expected, it is still a film that I recommend to everyone. With Donovan songs (one of which - "Colors" - appeared in another Terence Stamp movie: "The Limey" (which, incidentally, was released in 1999, when I was as old as my parents when "Poor Cow" he's out )).
