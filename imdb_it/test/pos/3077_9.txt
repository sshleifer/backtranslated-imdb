This film was fantastic, if you want a film with word games and endless laughter, then this is right for you. This film was fantastic because it took Robin Hood seriously and did something that the whole family can enjoy and have a good laugh. I saw this film for the first time when I was about 10 years old, and I took most of it. This film is also beautiful because it makes fun of everything involved, "By order of the financial secretary of Kings H and R Blockhead?" <br /> <br /> Everyone needs a bit of Cary Elwes (Robin Hood) in life, whether he is not his liar lying with "claw" or saw. <br /> <br /> It is worth watching this movie
