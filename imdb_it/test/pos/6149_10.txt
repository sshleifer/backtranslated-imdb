I disagree with the imdb.com synopsis that it is a bisexual guy getting ready to get married. It's about all the crap we go through - self-induced and thanks to our parents - that we have to "overcome" when we grow up. As the poem by Linda McCarriston says, "Childhood is the rod that throws you over the falls". This film is much more like a narrative poem. It's about the life and mistakes we make and hurt that we inflict and experience over the years, and how in the end it's about love (I'm not trying to be hyper-sensitive or schmoopy) and to find and be with a special person.
