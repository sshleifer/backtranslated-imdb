After reading all these reviews, I am very surprised to see that no one has ever noticed that this show was based on the NBC "M Squad" police show from 1957 to 1960 with Lee Marvin, I read reviews comparing them to "Dragnet" and some of the Quinn Martin police shows, but if you look at M Squad you will see that it was based on it. In the last M Squad episodes of 1958, you'll see Lee Marvin playing Lieutenant Frank Ballinger get out of his car and then shoot him, and he shoots backwards, the start of the Police Squad is pretty much the same (including the Music jazz) and then Lee Marvin tells what happens, (Lieutenant detective Frank Ballinger, M Squad, a special department of the Chicago police) and on the police team Leslie Neilsen does the same (Im Detective Lieutenant Frank Drebin, Police Squad, a special division of the Police Department) and so on, in one of the episodes of M Squad there is also the character of Johnny the shoeshine guy and in an episode of M Squad entitled "More Deadly" there is an episode of the Police Squad from title "A substantial gift (The Broken Promise)" which is the same story!
