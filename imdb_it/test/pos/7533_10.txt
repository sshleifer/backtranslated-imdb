"Nagisa no Shindobaddo" or "Like Grains of Sand" is an incredibly beautiful story of teenagers and girls who take care of the state of becoming one with what they are. This film is not about homosexuality, but about sexuality. <br /> <br /> Aihara, a detached girl, will surely make the spectators reflect behind the detached girl. Do you love Yoshida? Or do you love Ito? Or has she somehow turned into a lesbian because of the "accident"? (I doubt it). <br /> <br /> And what about Yoshida? Do you realize that you adore Ito in the end? Well, we all know he loves him as a friend. But you'll never know once you see this movie ... haha ​​:) In the end, Aihara (along with Ito) offers an exceptional message to the public: which is that it doesn't matter if you love a boy or a girl. And I have to tell you, I'm so dense that I didn't understand it at first. ^^ ;; It's because of the whole scene without speaking ... You have to try to understand what the characters think and say through their actions and NOT with what they say (especially the final part ... whew, boy, that was confusing!) a confusing story, but it's still beautiful. :) This film is definitely one of the best Japanese films I've ever seen (and believe me, I've seen many).
