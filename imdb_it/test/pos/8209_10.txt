I loved this movie! <br /> <br /> Films and plays meet their purpose when they expose social, political and other problems that affect the majority. This film had this purpose. <br /> <br /> I identify with the plot and know the people that happened to this. At the time this film was made, the concepts presented in this film were advanced for the public, yet they had already happened to my friends through people in powerful positions. And I know how it is when people do to you what they did to Angela Bennett, because they did it to me. <br /> <br /> I really liked the portrait of Sandra Bullock by Angela Bennett / Ruth Marx. It portrays a cute, intelligent and witty young woman who has the courage to avoid giving in to overwhelming odds, fighting hard to maintain her sanity and restore her life, and try to protect those she loves. Losing his self-concept and succumbing to that age-old attempt to sustain a fascinating self-esteem abandoning himself to sex with a stranger added a touching touch of reality. <br /> <br /> The climax of the plot reveals the only real solution to this kind problem.
