A truly unique and surprising film of "For The Flag" by Jules Verne of the Czech director Karel Zeman. Although the story is declined in a rather discreet late Victorian style, the images are direct elimination. Zeman uses animation, graphics, set paintings, model animation combined with live action to create the atmosphere of Verne that the reader associates in his mind. The style is reminiscent of the steel engravings of Dore and Bennet and Riou who illustrated these stories with a good dose of added Georges Melies. Photographed in a splendid black and white, the animation is of the highest order and not of a Saturday morning variety. There are underwater sequences in which the fish that swim are drawn accurately and can be used in a field guide. There are images of ships, submarines, flying planes, castles and machinery that are designed with such accurate details that you need to freeze them on your VCR or DVD to pause the scene and study the remarkable details that have gone into this production. The late Victorian atmosphere is designed to resemble this world that has never been and delights us in the magic of science that made Verne the great father of its kind. If that's not enough, there's also the soundtrack that is probably one of the best ever created for a fantasy or science fiction movie. Truly a forgotten classic, this is worth hunting and buying. Always one of my favorite movies of all time, surely it will also be one of yours. And remember: this was done decades before the CGI or computer animation. Congratulations to the great artists who obviously put their heart into it. Exhibition. Jules Verne himself would be proud of this film. A film that deserves to be better known, but those who have seen it love it and treasure it. An exceptional result, this extraordinary film improves every time you look at it. A true cinematographic work of art by a visionary director.
