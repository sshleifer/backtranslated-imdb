The film doesn't take itself seriously, and if you follow his example you'll have a lot of fun (as long as you don't mind that your murders were really bloody, and your horror was filled with extra cheese)! <br /> <br /> This film gives a nod to every horror fan, and then gives them their finger. He knows it sucks, and for this reason, it is by far the best in the "Child's Play" series. <br /> <br /> Reproduces the "stoopid humor" humor corner so well, you find yourself doing much more than laughing, but with it. And believe me, all the time you're laughing, he's laughing again. <br /> <br />
