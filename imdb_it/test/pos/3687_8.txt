Minor spoiler <br /> <br /> In Chicago, Grace Beasley (Kathy Bates) is a housewife who has twenty-five years of marriage with lawyer Max Beasley (Dan Aykroyd) and a hysterical and psychotic daughter-in-law of dwarf, Maudey (Meredith Eaton). Grace adores singer Victor Fox (Jonathan Price), who will present a television show in Chicago and will award five front-row spots in a TV promotion. Kate calls the show and wins a ticket, when Max simultaneously asks for a divorce, claiming that their lives are too monotonous. Grace gets depressed and when she goes to the show, the audience is informed that a Chicago-based serial killer, who uses a crossbow, killed Victor Fox. With a broken heart, he decides to fly to England for Victor Fox's funeral. There, he realizes he was gay, and becomes a friend of his former partner Dirk Simpson (Rupert Everett). They return to Chicago, trying to find the killer. This film is a delightful, original and strange dramatic comedy with bizarre characters. It has enormous potential to be a cult film, with the appearances of Julie Andrews and Barry Manilow and a joke with Nicolas Roeg's masterpiece "Do not Look Now", when Maudey wears a red raincoat in the underground part of the city of Chicago. The beginning of the film, with Jonathan Price singing "Hitchcock Railway", is wonderful. I repeated it four consecutive times. The cast has a magnificent performance, highlighting Kathy Bates, Jonathan Price, Rupert Everett and the unknown Meredith Eaton. Indeed, this film is excellent entertainment. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Amor a Toda Prova' ('Love to the Proof')
