This production was quite well done for a television original, providing a very appropriate original cut on Swift's work. To make the plot work well, the film begins with Gulliver arriving home. Everyone who has read the book knows that it will happen anyway. The plot of the book has the confusing confusion of Gulliver in the sections. For example, he is horrified by the fact that he will trample small people in England because he has just returned from a land of giants. But the film has all the sections of the book within a long journey. When Gulliver talks about his travels, the cuts of assembly from England to travel are very effective. I confess that at first I found them intrusive and irritating, then they became natural. Moreover, they eventually became a welcome addition to history. As he recounts his adventures to a wider audience, more and more people are listening to his compelling fantasy even if they doubt his truth. For example, his hatred of the filthy Yahoos and the admiration for the pure logic of the fourth section manifest well when he defends his sanity. The interconnection between events in England and similar events or scenes of the story is very effective. For example, tearing the fabric off the table to suggest the movement of towing a group of ships is inspired to film. The addition of Gulliver's family threatened by the lascivious doctor works well. Swift only mentions this by having his long-suffering wife protest against other journeys. Become a natural part of this story. Casting and acting were competent everywhere. Some roles were exemplary. Omar Sharif's crazy fool is superb. O'Toole's little emperor is deliciously melting into senility. Many specific complaints made by other writers here strike me as simple personal preference, which, after all, is what we are here. I read the reduced version several times a year from the fourth grade onwards. I may have missed the full version until a college class, but I've read it a few times since. And I had to start over while I started reading about this movie. While Danson's version is superior to any previous film, it does not replace the book. However, I think it will bring many readers to the book. If you haven't read the book, enjoy this movie and go to the source. If you appreciate satire, find "A modest proposal" by Swift and his "Letters of Drapier". Both are satires that attack the dismal treatment of Ireland and the Irish during Swift's time. The drapier protests by throwing cheaply inflated copper coins in Ireland. These were Wood's light coins, not good for the face value in the payment of taxes and official debts. The protest of Swift's satire caused the coins to be sent to another abused British territory, the American colonies. Universal satire in Swift's book and this movie are just fun; they cannot change human nature. Give Danson's torturous experiences an opportunity. I think you will find them stimulating and fun.
