This film was a surprise. The synopsis plot sounds extravagant, and the stars of Clint Eastwood and the great Geraldine Page. I didn't know what to expect. There is that opening scene in which the wounded soldier says that 12 years old is old enough to kiss and proceeds to give a persistent and very adult kiss, mouth to mouth. The child takes him to the boarding school for girls where he lives. Take advantage of the situation by trying to seduce the principal, interpreted by Page, her assistant and another student. Jealousy, sexual tension, incest, intrigue and the macabre come together in this wonderfully original story. <br /> <br /> I have read the other comments here and find little disagreement. However, I wanted to clarify a point raised earlier about the fact that there are no sympathetic characters in the film. I find that there is one. The attractive female slave successfully resists the soldier's advances in a scene that works well because it touches on the common history of slaves exploited by white men. Although her strength and lack of illusion are the sum total of her experience, she is what I would consider a sympathetic character. You, more than any other woman and school girl, have a legitimate reason to participate in what happens at the end.
