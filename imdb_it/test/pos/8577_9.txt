Personally, I think the film is pretty good. It's almost at the rate of 8. I enjoyed the ethnographic aspect and the beautiful photography. Colin Firth's character is not the nicest, but he does a better job than his role. The heroine, played by the beautiful Nia Long, is a heroine of the family film in that she is trying to do what she thinks is the best for her son - by marrying a respected member of her expat community - while fighting her attraction to the "bad" "man - one who is not a member of his community (the" outsider "). Most of the film is about this mother's struggle: she should do what is expected of her, what she thinks is best for her son or should he follow his heart? I don't want to give the final. Let me tell you that this is a good-looking film with beautiful shots on location, exquisite African dresses (it's worth seeing the film only for African clothes and hairstyles from bright colors of women) and funny characters in general. The actor who plays the son of Nia Long is brilliant and adorable. The plot is a little formidable, but I liked the film anyway. If you are a Colin Firth fan you must absolutely see re this movie. If you like chic movies, watch it. I think I'll watch it again tonight!
