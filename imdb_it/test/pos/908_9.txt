Stan Laurel considered PUTTING PANTS ON PHILIP as the first real L & H movie. THE SECOND HUNDRED YEARS was the first 'official' L & H movie, but this was one in which Stan was completely resigned not only to perform ( he had signed with Hal Roach Studios as a director and 'gag-man', before certain situations - among others the Oliver Hardy incident with a lamb leg that led to replace Stan with Stan, and the extra money that the 'exhibition would provide to himself and his new wife, Lois - led to his historic return to the show, in addition to writing, directing, editing and involvement in other areas of production), but he also realized that it was part of a team that worked well together. This, therefore, is a historical film and very important in the history of comedy. <br /> <br /> It's also a surprisingly fun little silent film; quite different from what Laurel & Hardy would have become famous for and what they are most immediately associated with today. The characters of Stan and Ollie do not appear: the Scotsman Stan Laurel plays the nephew of Oliver Hardy, a respectable man in the city who is reluctant to be seen with this strange little boy with a habit of chasing beautiful girls. There are some very funny moments in this well-made and fascinating little movie, and the performances of these two Kings of the Comedy are well-chosen: look at Stan's little "scissor-kick" and the smile that says "Well, waddaya, you know?" when he sees the girls, or the scene that ripples his hair at the airport, for example. Exhilarating. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you can, with the accompanying music from The Beau Hunks Orchestra (available in video versions of VVL) that improves the feeling of the 20s and is very, very pleasant to listen to. It's a little brilliant and undervalued movie, which is why I said it was "surprisingly" funny.
