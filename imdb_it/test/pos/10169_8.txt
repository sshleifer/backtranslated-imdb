Alfred Hitchcock shows originality in the remake of his 1934 British film, "The Man Who Knew Tous Much". This 1956 version of the same story is much lighter than the previous one. Mr. Hitchcock was fortunate to have collaborators who went with him from one film to another, thus maintaining a standard in his work. Robert Burks did an excellent job with the cinematography and editing of George Tomasini showing his talent. In the end, Bernard Herrmann was seen directing at the magnificent Royal Albert Hall in London at the height of the photo. James Stewart was an actor who worked well with Mr. Hitchcock. In this version, he plays an Indiana doctor on vacation with his wife and son. When we meet him, they are going to Marrakesh in a local bus and the intrigue begins. His wife is the beautiful Doris Day at its best. She had been a well-known singer before her marriage and is now the perfect wife and mother. The film has a good supporting cast, Brenda DeBanzie, Bernard Miles, Daniel Gelin, Alan Mowbray, among others, do a great job portraying their characters. <br /> <br /> Although this is a "light Hitchcock", one cannot dismiss it as a failure. "The man who knew too much" is a change of pace for Hitchcock fans.
