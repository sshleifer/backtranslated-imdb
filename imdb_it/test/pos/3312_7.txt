Although dated, this film certainly deserves a watch. I saw him about eight times as a teenager when it opened and changed my life ... I had to live in New York. He has great shots of opening the Manhattan skyline with Johnny Mathis singing "Romance is still ... the best of everything ..." that rivals those of West Side Story. There's a pretty make-up performance from the first real Supermodel in the world, Suzy Parker (I'm sorry, Janice D.), but it's a real eye-catcher! It also offers some insight into the American customs of the late 1950s - our obsession with (and the repression of) sex (at work, no less!), Romanticism and marriage before lib women. It represents a time when New York was at its best and a super-bitch exhibition by Joan Crawford is just the icing on the cake.
