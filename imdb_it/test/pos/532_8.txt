I'm sorry, but "Star Wars Episode 1" didn't do justice to the talent of Natalie Portman (and undeniable cuteness). She was completely abused like Queen Amidala, and when used, her makeup was appallingly terrible. For "Anywhere but here", she loses her terrible makeup and acts normally. And not only can she behave herself, she seems to be good at it. I'm a little older than her (she's only 18) and I have little or no chance of meeting her, but hey, a boy is allowed to dream, isn't he? <br /> <br /> Although Susan Sarandon makes a good turn in this film, the film belongs entirely to Portman. I was a Portman observer from the "Beautiful Girls" (where she was younger, but just as pretty). There are great things for her in the future - I can see it.
