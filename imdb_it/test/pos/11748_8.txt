Age cannot tarnish the beauty of this east-west love story for me. Ignoring the famous and adorable song of the title and its lyrics, what we have is a dramatized biography of two extraordinary people captured in a moment of counter-current involving social conformism, bigotry, war, doubts and the need for immense courage. With Hong Kong as a backdrop, this film tells the story of a Eurasian doctor and an American journalist who meet and fall in love during the Korean war. Like Mark Elliott, William Holden is intelligent, airy and a bit weak; Jennifer Jones is perhaps almost as perfect as Dr. Han Suyin, in turn uncertain, ecstatic, impatient and hesitant. Others in the cast include Torin Thatcher, Isobel Elsom, Murray Matheson, Virginia Gregg, Richard Loo, Soo Yong, Philip Ahn, Jorja Curtright and Donna Martell; many of Hollywood's best oriental actors have also played non-accredited minor parts. John Patrick's script closely followed Han's exquisite novel; Henry King's direction was as solid as ever. The thrust of the plot is the way the reluctant Han would fall in love with Elliott, with her busy and demanding schedule as a doctor and her doubts about their future; and how fearless he was, despite the intolerance and interference they faced when their relationship became known. The film is unquestionably physically busy, interesting and often beautiful. The hill where lovers go to stand aside, the enchanting bay where they swim contrasts with a crowded and crowded business city, large social events and bustling streets, hospital corridors and traffic-filled arteries. With the photography of Leon Shamroy, Ben Nye's make-up and Helen Turpin's hairstyles, the great work of set designers, sound and lighting, of the art department and all those interested, this is one of the most memorable productions set in a large non-US city in the United States. always and one of the most difficult to capture in a movie. Yet what is most remembered here is that lovers, fortunately not extremely young, face adversity against them and evaluate exactly what they are - so they proceed as if love were important and those conditions that are set as barriers to love don't. The culminating point of the story is that Mark will return to war; later Han receives his letters, even after knowing he was killed; they look like messages from a better wold. A world where hope is all that matters, courage is the price of admission to that world, and it is always summer on a high and windy hill separated and above an area where beauty and individual desires can be persecuted, made object of luck or swept away by the militant forces of evil. In truth, love is a thing of great splendor, says Dr. Han; and this film stands as one of the brilliant proofs of this doctrine, shining like a pearl, timeless as a Chinese proverb and as beautiful as a polished jade on a rough background.
