Wow! the French are really learning from it. If we look at their first Asterix movie, we see a beautiful story with nice actors (especially thanks to Gerard Depardeu) but a very lame special effect. In a fantasy story like Asterix's special effects are really important. Well .. they did well this time! It looks fantastic. I personally think that the Cleopatra mission is the best Asterix story ever written. In the film there is not a single moment that you get bored. Go and look at this! One thing! they didn't exactly go according to the script that I think is a bit fussy. For example, in the comic strip Obelix breaks the nose of the Sphinx, immediately all the small shopkeepers begin to break the nose of their miniature Sphinx. (really fun to see) .. Well, they didn't put it in the movie, but they buried their noses under the Sphinx. Asterix: "They will never look for him here" (guess what). It was fun but not as good as the original. Another thing I didn't like about the movie was their choice for music. He brought the film to the children. But no less ... It is a must C! <br /> <br /> Grz From Jean Holland
