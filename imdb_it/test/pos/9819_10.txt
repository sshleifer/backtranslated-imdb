This is one of the few films that I was recommended as absolutely brilliant, really. If you give this movie a low tone of what you really missed the point. You could describe Fosca as a manipulator, but if he were really serious, he would get sick when the love he is sure of won't be answered. But what would you do when you are sure that the other loves you, and is 'only' rejected by the fact that you are ugly. You wouldn't fight for it. At least I think it's better to fight for it that dies in bitterness. And it reminds me of the fact that I, as a man, react at first sight completely to the physical ugliness of Fosca and do not look beyond the person who is or could be. This film confronts me with very solemn questions about respect, trust, manipulated feeling and so on. How do I do now if someone manipulates me or is trying everything to make contact? What I think is the most important feature of this film is that Ettore Scola has made it absolutely credible that Giorgio falls in love with Fosca.
