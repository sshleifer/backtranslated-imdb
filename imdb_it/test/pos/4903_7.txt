Although it is a "women's story", I found this quite interesting. It is unusual for three sisters in real life to play sisters in the movie! I refer to Priscilla, Rosemary and Lola Lane. <br /> <br /> Because national critics loved this film was the presence of the rebellious bad boy John Garfield. In their twisted minds dominated by liberals, all-American characters are disgusting but harsh types of life, poor types of attitude like those Garfield played are people they can identify with. Nevertheless, this film still has a general feeling of goodness, which is why I liked it. Some characters may have done stupid things, but they are good hearts. Whose heart was bigger than "Ann's" (Priscilla Lane) here? I agree with the criticism of IMDb user comments here that says this is Priscilla's film as much as Garfield's beloved (not me). <br /> <br /> With a director of the caliber of Michael Curtiz, the film is better than it could have been under someone else. Curtiz made sure that no scene, soaped or not, went on too long. <br /> <br /> In addition to sisters Lane and Garfield, we have Claude Rains (which adds humor to the story), Jeffrey Lynn (the main love interest of girls), Gale Page, Dick Foran, Frank McHugh and Mae Robson. Apparently, this film must have been a success because there have been several spin-offs from it, nor of them comes close to this in the success of content and box offices.
