"The King of Queens" could be divided into two eras. <br /> <br /> The first era, constituted by the first seasons, represented the problems of the daily life of a man and his wife making him go through life in the city salary by salary. <br /> <br /> The second era increased the scope of the show, addressing current popular culture and marital issues with a humorous twist. <br /> <br /> But beyond all that ... <br /> <br /> This show was really fun. <br /> <br /> Kevin James, when he does not make comedy films with Adam Sandler, is a genius of laughter, and his chemistry with Leah Remini has no equal on TV. <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller as the live psychotic father-in-law added his unique style of bizarre humor, and Patton Oswalt as the "man-child" Spence Ulchin was incredible, (he's a great comedian also) "The King of Queens "was the last sitcom of the 90s to take off, and it's a real shame.
