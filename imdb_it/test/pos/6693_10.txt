Life is composed of infinite possibilities; some known, others a mystery and destined to remain so. And what of the vast unknown, of the kingdoms beyond which knowledge has no boundaries or established parameters? Who is going to say what exists or what is possible? Valid questions, all raised and explored in the history of a particular individual's personal journey, a strange and dramatic odyssey that challenges facts and logic, in "K-PAX", directed by Iain Softley, and starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. In the wake of an accident in New York Central Station, a man named Prot (Spacey) is transported to a psychiatric hospital in Manhattan, where he is handed over to the care of Dr. Mark Powell (Ponti), who tries to discover the truth of his patient, who claims to come from the distant planet K-PAX. It quickly becomes a challenge for Dr. Powell, as Prot, with his calm, direct, imminent manner and propensity to produce (eat banana peels and everything, and Red Delicious apples are his favorites) is quite convincing. But it is Powell's job, as well as his nature, to be skeptical. Prot's claims, however, remain intact and stand up even under the most intense poll and the watchful eye of Dr. Powell, who finds himself in a kind of embarrassment ... Prot even tells him the date and the the exact time he will leave for K-PAX, a planned return journey that allows Powell but a short time to fix everything. And Powell just can't seem to think of the idea of ​​dealing with a real alien being; and it is something that you will have to solve quickly, if you ever know the truth. And he must know. The truth, after all, is the only thing that will make him free in his mind. <br /> <br /> Softley has created and produced a sensitive and stimulating film that challenges the viewer by supporting the mystery surrounding Prot while you force yourself to reflect on your own concepts of what is, in fact, possible. And as you don't know for sure about Prot until the epilogue, you can identify yourself with Powell, seeing the situation from his point of view and trying to solve the puzzle with him. Softley creates an atmosphere of wonder and a true feeling of being faced with something that is truly unique as the story develops and you begin to understand that Prot could be just what it claims to be. And in the context of the reality to which the film is arranged, it's a compelling question to try to wrap your mind. How do you react when all the tests are against the physical limits we have set for ourselves? While at the center of the film there is a profound depth of humanity that is evident, not only in Prot, but also in Dr. Powell. All this makes the drama extremely engaging and compelling. <br /> <br /> As expected, Kevin Spacey offers a brilliant interpretation as Prot, presenting his character from within, emotionally deep and physically convincing at the same time. This is a unique individual and Spacey brings him to life with care and the ability to share those moments that are particularly revealing, which adds to the credibility of the character and the credibility of the story itself. For this film to work, it is essential to believe in who and what Prot is; we do it, and it does. Spacey simply pushes it beautifully. It's a memorable performance, from which evolves a character that will stay with you for a long, long time. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges, meanwhile, emerges on the same level as Spacey, skillfully making a very real person of Dr Powell. It's a fairly simple role, and the challenge for Bridges was to take this very normal and ordinary character and make it one of a kind, which, faced with the character of Prot, was no small task. And, again, to make this film work, it was necessary for Bridges to be up to the task. And, with exceptional skill and being the consummate professional that he is, he succeeds without a doubt. Ponti gives Powell a basic complexity, and gives so much to his performance, which makes the interaction between Powell and Prot vibrant, and sometimes intense. It is a demonstration of two of the best actors in the industry who do what they do best, creating a lively and stimulating dynamic. It's a great job by Bridges, who never tries to steal the spotlight from Prot, which serves to raise the level of the film to an even higher level. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes Mary McCormack (Rachel), Alfre Woodard (Dr. Villers), Ajay Naidu (Dr. Naidiu), Vincent Laresca (Navarro), Kimberly Scott (Joyce), Conchata Ferrell ( Betty) and Saul Williams (Ernie). A funny and emotionally engaging film, "K-PAX" is a thesis on the possibilities, as well as an examination of the ever-changing complexities of the human condition. It is a film that requires an open mind and rewards those who are able to face it according to their own terms and embrace it. In the end, it makes you realize how real K-PAX is; and makes you appreciate Prot's journey, and how much we share and share with those around us, human or alien. And it might just make you think about your journey ... where you've been and where you're going. And this is the magic of movies. I consider this 10/10. <br /> <br />
