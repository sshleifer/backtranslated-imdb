Daffy Duck has signs hanging from every inch of every available tree announcing it's rabbit season. But, you guessed it, it's really duck season. Elmer Fudd appears: he is the only fool enough to fall for the gag. <br /> <br /> It's even more stupid than that. When Bugs Bunny approaches him and asks how the rabbit hunt is going, Elmer admits he hasn't seen a rabbit yet. This is more than Daffy can stand. He emerges from his hiding place and immediately points to a rabbit: Bugs Bunny. "Shoot him now!" Daffy screams. "Shut up," Bugs says. "He doesn't need to shoot you now." Daffy insists he does. <br /> <br /> After Daffy has returned his beak exploded to the head, he is sentenced to more arguments infected with "trouble pronoun" which all have the same result. Later, Bugs dresses up as a sexy woman and jokingly asks Elmer for a duck dinner. Will Daffy take the last laugh? "Ah, ah, very funny! Ah, ah, ah!" <br /> <br /> What's funny about this classic cartoon? Bug gets scared scared while Daffy screams in his face. Bugs Bunny says "Yes?" while dripping with self-satisfaction. Daffy Duck stands on tiptoe asking to be shot. Elmer Fudd complains that "he can't wait for any wonger". Daffy sees Bugs in women's clothes and makes that little noise with his tongue. Carl Stalling plays "You must have been a beautiful child" during the Bugs dragging act. Daffy demands "pure honesty" from Bugs. Stalling sounds "Home Sweet Home" at an appropriate improper time. Daffy tells Bugs it's "terrifying". <br /> <br /> In five words: every detail of this film. <br /> <br /> NOTE: This short film is available on "Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume One," Disc 1
