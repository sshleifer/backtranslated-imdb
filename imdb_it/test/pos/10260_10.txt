This film set the standard for African American film excellence when it was made. I've heard about various stories of the film over time, that there was a push for an Oscar nomination when it was released. This film plays on various emotions and you definitely feel for all the characters. Of course, a little acting is a bit of wood, but fortunately those parts are not decisive. Music is sensational, and if you don't think the ending is a tear-jerk, you don't have the heart in your chest. If you look at "Cooley High", you will see that many, many films have copied various elements from it to strengthen their films. The biggest example of this is "Boyz N The Hood".
