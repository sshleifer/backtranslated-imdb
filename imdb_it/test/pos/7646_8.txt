I like Armand Assante and the summary of my cable company seemed interesting, so I looked at it twice already and probably will do it again. <br /> <br /> The first part is difficult to follow, but later it is clarified. I believe the writer did a good job of tying the ends together. <br /> <br /> Some acting is not convincing, but maybe it's because I always expected a sort of double-cross. In that case, poor acting would be the insincerity of the characters that interact with each other, so it fits very well. <br /> <br /> The important theme is the owner of the carnival (Assante) who is laundering money for a local casino and his snake charmer wife (Dagmara Dominczyk) wants to steal it. He complains to "Archie" (Reedus) about how terrible his life is, and how he could help her get out of it. <br /> <br /> There are 3 or 4 twists (which is probably the reason for all those pending parts), and just when you think you've solved the mystery, something else will happen. <br /> <br /> My score of 8/10 is mainly for the plot. <br /> <br /> I won I don't talk about it anymore - I don't like spoilers, so I don't want to be one, but I think this movie is worth it.
