Was this film made on a relatively small budget (10-20 million dollars?) Almost without promotion from its distributors. I only knew it because I have been a Jean-Claude Van Damme fan for a long time and I always watch his latest films in the hope that they are at least watchable and beyond some real turkeys (Derailed, Second In Command), they are. This film has a fairly easy to follow plot and Van Damme gives a good, fun show, but the film owes all its credit to the fighting scenes involving Van Damme, Scott Adkins and the last of them together. The editing and working with the camera for most of the movie is pretty awful, but Isaac Florentine can definitely shoot a good fighting scene. I too am happy that Van Damme has played better in recent times (In Hell, Wake of Death, Until Death) but with good acting the martial arts have failed. In The Shepherd, Van Damme shows that he still has it.
