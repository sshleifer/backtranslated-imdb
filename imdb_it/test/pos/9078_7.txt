Hollywood is one of the best and most beautiful things in my life. I admire and am very fascinated by the way Hollywood generates ideas and implements them. It makes me think of the reach of the human brain. I saw Flatliners a long time ago, but the story, the direction, the cast and all the recitations are still fresh in my mind. The story begins with our lead actor Sutherland saying "what a beautiful day to die" during the dawn. For all of us, it is a story that shows emotions sometimes held in our mind throughout our lives. Never able to understand a few things in life. It shows us to be motivated and to improve our quality of life. However, I recommend it to everyone who looks at it once.
