Because the end of the film could not have been that of the men of Sean Connery who fought the French instead of the Germans. Since the French occupied Algeria in 1830, the tribes of Morocco and those of Algeria were making raids on French military and civilian settlements. This film could have been a continuum of that historical aspect in which the French had conquered the Rasuadli so his followers would not attack Algeria, and then his followers would attack the French to free him. <br /> <br /> The film is still stereotyped of shootings between Germans and Americans. When the Americans shoot at the Germans, their cannons (even guns) emit loud noises, create large bleeding gunshot wounds and their enemies scream after being hit. When the Germans shoot the Americans, their guns don't make great sounds, they don't create bleeding wounds, and their enemies make little or no sound after being hit. <br /> <br /> In real life, the American Krag rifle was the worst rifle that America had ever produced until the first version of the M-16 arrived. The Krag was difficult to maintain, not reliable, and the rifle bolt was always jammed. The German Mauser was one of the most beautiful rifles in the world. We were so impressed during the Spanish-American war that we made a copy of it and call it the Springfield rifle. <br /> <br /> Finally, the people of Morocco must have a word for artillery since the French were using them in their incursions against Morocco. I didn't like it when they made the Rasuldai believe there was no word for artillery in the Moorican vocabulary. Instead, the Rasuadli claimed that Europeans had guns on wheels that shook the ground.
