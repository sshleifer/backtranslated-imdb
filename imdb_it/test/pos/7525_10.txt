The brilliant Chuck Jones, master of the Warner Bros. cartoon comedy, brings us the first (?) Pepe LePew comic strip. A stray cat, tired of being pushed around, paints itself in the colors of a skunk and, with a good dose of Limburger, turns the tables on its tormentors. Then Pepe arrives and you know the rest. Many of Pepe's famous gags were born here, including his chase / hop, in which he casually skips as his prey drags on to exhaustion. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Warner Bros. cartoons became less imaginative and more ho-hum in the 1950s. This 1947 film is one of the few examples of Mel Blanc that puts his absolutely crazy voice in Pepe's mouth. But the kicker is the finale, in which Pepe turns out to be a "American wolf dressed in skunk"! A must see! Classic Warner Bros ...
