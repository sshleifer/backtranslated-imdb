Very often these "life" gestures are one-dimensional, with exaggerated characterizations and performances, and with dashed lines and climaxes that aim to exchange any semblance of reality for the drama. <br /> <br /> But most of all, many of these gestures provide characters in which it is difficult to prove a trace of sympathy or empathy even for the "good / good" characters and much less for the "bad" ones. <br /> <br /> However here the performances were all good, the characters realistic, and the relationships between the three protagonists (as well as the former husband / father and the two females) sounded sincere everywhere. <br /> <br /> The mother's boyfriend was portrayed halfway between mother and daughter, and the actors were age-appropriate at this time of their actual age. None of the characters was portrayed in the extreme - or all is well or all evil - and everything resounded. <br /> <br /> Without in any way justifying the fact that he allowed the relationship with his future stepdaughter to advance to the level he did - you can still feel sorry for him without withdrawing the blame. <br /> <br /> Neither the mother nor the daughter were perfect, neither good nor bad, but simply two individuals whose relationship seemed realistic and not forced by the writer script. <br /> <br /> Lifetime gestures - even those that start with some semblance of normality - often end up with an unbalanced character wielding a work knife or something else. Other stories seem to need to "close everyone happy and content". <br /> <br /> This film presented a realistic premise, history and resolution, from beginning to end - a welcome variation in the norm of this kind
