A sensational film that has highlighted so much the disability that generally makes people scared. He showed how minds can be captured by less willing bodies and how difficult it is to be witness to things that happen to others that are sought after by the disabled individual. <br /> <br /> Love, friendship, fear, frustration, joy, humor and many other things were so well captured. The 2 protagonists were very well interpreted by the 2 able-bodied actors and invited your laughter, tears, worry, joy and dismay. <br /> <br /> I approached this film with a mixture of interest and trepidation worried that it could be too much a game of sympathy or dwell only on the negatives. It was however a fabulous story of 2 friends. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it.
