The film begins with a sloppy housewife (Norma Shearer) who discovers that her husband (Rod La Rocque) has betrayed her. Three years pass and apparently they have been divorced during these years because of infidelity. Oddly, during this time, La Rocque did not see Shearer or his two sons when Shearer took them to Paris. <br /> <br /> Marie Dressler is a rich woman of the company and has invited a new and improved Norma to come to her home for the weekend - apparently to help Marie break a budding love affair between her daughter and La Rocque! Apparently, Norma is now a super-vampire and with her magical sex appeal, she can break romance - and no one seems to realize that she and La Rocque were married. Many others are there for the weekend and immediately Norma is a hit with her gay, carefree and sexy ways - and almost all the men (including La Rocque) are fascinated by her. No one tells anyone to be married, but it's obvious that his ex wants Norma's new and improved return! This film is a sophisticated costume comedy among the upper crust, similar in some ways to THE RULES OF THE GAME by Jean Renoir. Strangely, despite the seriousness of the Depression, these films about rather rich people were quite popular, although many today will find them a bit too weird. However, fortunately, in LET US BE GAY, there are many nice and funny moments (especially towards the end, when Marie Dressler shows her true colors). Although it's not a great movie, it's definitely a good movie and much more than just a pastime. My only real regret is that I didn't really love it. You just have to see it for yourself - maybe you'll agree on the ending, maybe you won't, but I'm pretty sure you'll like this smart movie.
