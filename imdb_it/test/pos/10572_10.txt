I saw this movie recently and fell in love with it. I loved the plot and the actors. He has a little bit of everything. I was completely taken by the unfolding of history. It has so many surprises along the way. I highly recommend it. In fact, I loved it so much that I ended up outside and bought the book. I felt I had to read it to appreciate the art in writing behind the film. I also wanted to make sure that I didn't miss anything in the book but kept it out of the movie. I recommend to those who love movies to read the book because there is enough difference in the book, especially in the second episode, to want to read it. It has become my favorite movie. Now I'm a fan of Sarah Waters and Elaine Cassidy !!
