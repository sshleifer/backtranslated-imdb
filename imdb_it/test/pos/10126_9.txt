This is a movie that you will love or hate. I loved it. If you are looking for suspense, great special effects, action, sophistication, cynicism, etc. You won't find it in this movie. It is a pleasant, sentimental, positive and uplifting film. The film's heroes are Coach Jones (played by Ed Harris), a man of strength and integrity, and Radio (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) a mentally retarded man who finds a way to contribute to his world. I guess I didn't find this film as "sentimentalism" like so many, because it seemed very real to me. I know people like these. I've seen athletes who think it's fun to choose the vulnerable. I saw men of integrity defending the vulnerable. I've seen people who think high school football is serious business. I've seen people who know what's really important in life. Each of these people could have been the people I knew. I laughed; I cried. I let the film feel good, remembering that in my world there are people like Coach Jones and Radio. If there are no people like them in yours, you might not like the movie. If you don't like a movie that shows the best side of human nature, it will hate it.
