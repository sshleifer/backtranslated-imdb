Any Batman fan will know how great the movies are, they have been a great success. However, Batman Returns is by far the best film in the series. A combination of excellent direction, brilliant acting and settings makes this worthy of watching overnight. <br /> <br /> Tim Burton, who directed this film, made sure that this film gives a realistic atmosphere and that he did a great job. Danny Devito (Penguin man) is a man who inherited the characteristics of the penguin as a child and grew to become a horrible and ugly thing! Michelle Pfiffer plays the elegant and very seductive 'Catwoman' after the cats gave her the genes to be bitten. The result in both character changes is excellent and both Catwoman and Penguin play a very important role in this excellent film. The mysterious Catwoman is a lot of fun to watch - her classic sayings and a fun part in which she jumps with her whip in a jewelry store adds such fun to the movie. Even Danny Devito does well, his ability to play a strange creature has been fundamental, and adds a great atmosphere to the film that brings us back to the boring sewers in which he lives. <br /> <br /> You can't forget Batman though. Michael Keaton pulls a comfortable performance again and shows us another side of Batman. His affection is unleashed when he confronts Catwoman at the end of the film, and her encounters with her when she is a normal person, Selina Kyle, leads him to be seduced badly at her home. There is a clever part after they leave, and the film is full of great scenes. It is worth noting that Bruce Wayne's Bat furniture is not used as much as in the other Batman films, as the close combat and story scenes are part of this film. <br /> <br /> The winter setting is created perfectly in Gotham City with most of the scenes being set at night and the city is full of snow. So if you watch this movie over the summer like I did, it doesn't look the same. Better to watch it during the winter. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a fantastic film. All the credit goes to Tom Burton and the cast, they did an incredible job.
