Slipknot is a heavy metal band from the big city of Des Moines, Iowa, where rockers wear their distinct mask (I know someone has already said this, but I need to fill in the space for this review). The band members are Joey, Mick, 133, Sid, Clown, James, Corey, Chris and Paul. This band is one of the best new heavy metal bands in my opinion and should be listened to by all those who love hardcore rock. Another good film is called "DISASTERPIECES" which shows the band's performance at the London Arena. The "My Plague" video was shot there and is included on the DVD. Even the most absurd song they did is there (Sic). So if you love the band you have to see it and if you love heavy metal music you have to listen to this band.
