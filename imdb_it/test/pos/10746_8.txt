Dragon Ma (Jackie Chan) is back, freeing the seas of the feared Pirate Lo. Back on the ground, he is assigned to the police, where he has to clean up corruption and crime in a local suburb. Along the way, he is involved in the fate of many Chinese patriots who try to ensure sympathy and support for their revolutionary cause. The Chinese Manchu government is pursuing these revolutionaries and anyone on their way is in trouble, even if they are in the police force. I had great expectations for this film after seeing Project A. But unfortunately I was a little disappointed. There is little action compared to the first film. There is only one good fight scene until the big final. That fight scene is in the "gangster place" and that's fine, many people fly everywhere and kicks and punches last. Jackie Chan and his stunt team do not disappoint at all. The ending is a lot of fun, Jackie Chan shows us why she is the best stuntman in the world. Really exciting stuff! The only negative thing about the ending is that the fights are too short and forgettable. Conclusion: many funny moments, good acting and crazy acrobatics. But not enough fighting for a higher rating.
