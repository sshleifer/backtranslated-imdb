I just discovered this dark 70s horror movie while browsing YouTube. For a low-budget endeavor, it has a lot of exciting moments in a gradual rhythm to bring to the surprisingly shocking finish. While there is a woman who continually takes off her shirt, the fact that she is a nymphomaniac makes the scenes important for the story and there is a scene with the curly-haired young man trying to seduce her that excited me before he pull back made her scream mad. The young nurse who arrives and is hired is seducing and I'm not surprised she posed for the cover of Playboy. Some characters are very irritating and some scenes look ridiculous. For the most part, however, Do not Look in the Basement (this is the title I saw on YouTube) offers enough drama and thrills for a fun B-movie.
