I have heard some comments, particularly from prisoners of war, that CHANGI is not historically accurate, and that it is disappointing. Maybe it's for those who actually had to live through this stuff, and much worse. But for the rest of us, who really have no idea how the detainees were treated by the Japanese during World War II, CHANGI is a remarkable introduction. But CHANGI is not a war documentary - if it had been, then the aspect of historical accuracy would have been fundamental. It is a drama of miniseries, with fictional characters and fictitious situations (although based roughly on real events I have heard and read about) - and at the center of the plot is the ideal of mateship. This group of young Australian soldiers, taken prisoner by the Japanese and kept for years in appalling conditions, became companions through adversity and the strength of their friendships continued throughout life after the war. It is also a cultural study of the differences between the Japanese of the time and the western world, with its music, games and entertainment: in part 5, when it is becoming clear that Japan will lose the war after Germany surrendered in Europe, the colonel of the Japanese prison camp insists that his country must study the culture of their prisoners - to defeat a people, one must defeat one's own culture - and to do so one must understand it. All in all, Australia continues its rich tradition of producing exceptional television miniseries and is a world leader without equal in this sense: the sails for the AFI Award with CHANGI is MY BROTHER JACK, the adaptation of the novel by George Johnston and also a worthy winner. The miniseries in recent years includes DAY OF THE ROSES (the story of the Glanville train crash investigation), KINGS IN GRASS CASTLES (adaptation of Mary Durack's historical tale of her pioneering ancestors), KANGAROO PALACE (on a group of friends of country towns in Australia who travel to London and change and develop apart), and the (somewhat disappointing) adaptation of Bryce Courtenay's powerful novel, THE PATCH PATTERNY. Not long ago: the life saga of Nancy Cato on the Murray - ALL THE RIVERS RUN; Cusack and James's brilliant novel on post-war life in Sydney - COME IN SPINNER; The outstanding pioneering saga of Colleen McCullough: THE THORN BIRDS; THE KING OF THE RIVERS; The novel by Ruth Park THE HARP IN THE SUD; BODYLINE; EUREKA STOCKADE; ANZACS; etc ..., etc ... (Of course, there were some not very good productions - for example, MOBY DICK, DO OR DIE, ON THE BEACH, THORN BIRDS: THE MISSING YEARS, etc ...) In general, however , if an Australian miniseries comes your way, make sure you see it - and that's the double for CHANGI, a superbly direct masterpiece. Rating: 9/10.
