Stewart's age didn't bother me at all in this film, even though he was playing a much younger person. I still remember my fascination with Lindbergh's story and while I was fully grown up when this biopic was done, I had to see it. <br /> <br /> Not only does it boast a great performance by Stewart, but it also gives a lot of fascinating technical data, which makes it understandable to those who are technically in trouble like me. And the appearance of the plane was fantastic. <br /> <br /> I loved this representation from a period prior to my birth and awakens the childlike love I had for airplanes and for the idea of ​​air travel.
