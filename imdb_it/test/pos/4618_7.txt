Present at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and becoming quite famous, this film seems to be another modern and profound school drama. <br /> <br /> It is a group of teenagers going through a desperate and revealing day at school. Everything is going around a suicide - shown at the beginning to some extent - which happens at 14:37. The characters are somehow all connected together. What moves them is described through short sequences of interviews, rigorously filmed in b / w. The characters are well written, the acting is intriguing (especially Teresa Palmer as Melody and Frank Sweet as Marcus are discovered). <br /> <br /> We remain faithful to the film technique. This is what really impressed me. There are rarely any cuts, most of the time the camera follows one of the protagonists as in the elephant of Gus van Sants. Some scenes are presented more often than once, but each time from a different point of view (here: character). This certainly evokes a slowly developing atmosphere, but that literally drags you inside. The colors are vibrant, somehow unsuitable considering the difficult texture - but this is nothing less than an intelligent contrast, a disturbing "everything is beautiful". The use of lighting is always adequate, emphasizing the current mood of the characters. And finally, there are decent music places. <br /> <br /> 2:37 somehow itches you from the beginning. Does not compromise or serve laughter. Rather, it combines what psychologists would call moments of terror. This film focuses mainly on emotional precipices. There is no one who cannot handle a sort of neurosis, even the minor parts depicted (eg teachers) seem to be in a state of disorder. And that's what keeps this movie from being really good. His summary of insightful tragedies is unrealistic for his own bones. There is not: friendship, love, smile, truth, passion. There is: fake, humiliation, despair, sickness and beatings. It's like always being hit hard, but after the first hour you're numb. This blow continues to hit you until it reveals something very instructive in the end. <br /> <br /> To be sensitive and superbly recited: 9. To be technically innovative and original: 9. To be one-dimensional: 3. <br /> <br /> Make a solid 7 out of 10.
