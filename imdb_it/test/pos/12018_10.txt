This is one of those movies that, for whatever reason, has just clicked with me. Everything about it is right. Laconic Eric Roberts, sympathetic investigator, his narrative voice, the twisted plot, Dan Hedaya and Denis Lipscomb gave good roles, the settings, the paintings in the artists' scenes, the final credit sequence and the wonderfully disturbing music that perfectly encapsulates the atmosphere of the whole film. If I have any reservations about Beverly D'Angelo as the femme fatale, but she plays the final scenes beautifully. I think director Matthew Chapman was looking for some sort of "Chinatown" atmosphere for the whole thing. It did not work. But like a murder-mystery it is a gem.
