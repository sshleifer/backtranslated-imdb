Like so many other reviewers here, my memories of this show are universally warm. In fact, I am so fond of my dear memories, that I recently bought the DVD set to revisit that happy and carefree childhood period, for which I used to be enchanted, while I watched the continuous search for Monkey, Pigsy, Sandy, Tripitaka and followed Yu Lung on horseback / dragon / man (you really have to watch it to understand), when the most loved show was broadcast on BBC 2 for the first time on Friday night, as a souvenir. <br /> <br /> Well, I am pleased to be able to say that even after all these years and now looking at it with adult eyes, more cynical (!), the show has lost none of its inimitable charm. <br /> <br /> Simply wonderful entertainment, with magical characters and their comic interactions between them for the effects perhaps not so special (which actually serve to increase the fun) and, of course, without forgetting the sequence of titles of extremely memorable opening of the first season, the passage of time has in no way shape or form diminished the magical charm of Monkey. <br /> <br /> As probably Monkey himself would have said, 'Oi! Ehi you! Go out and get some nostalgia. "
