This is as good as it is. <br /> <br /> These are six episodes that trace (briefly) what life would have been like when dinosaurs ruled the earth. Made in the style of a nature documentary, this show eliminates talking heads, but only gives us good things with dinosaurs trying to survive. Certainly this is not a real documentary since none of what you see on the screen can be attested with certainty, but it is a good hypothesis, and amusing to this. Here is a show that brings dinosaurs to life in a realistic way that doesn't involve them eating people. This is a show that should be shown to all dinosaur-loving children as it will instill them with the OH WOW factor to go out and find out more. It will also be fun for them, and you. <br /> <br /> See this. If you love animal shows or nature or science or Disney True Life Adventures (except that nobody is really killed) or just a nice trip somewhere else short and take a copy. Your brain will thank you.
