This was a lot of fun, even if it finally fell apart. Don't exaggerate with tributes after Hitchcock - Owen (Danny DeVito) was lucky enough to have "Strangers on A Train" playing at the local cinema, so the plain film tells you that that was the inspiration. <br /> <br /> DeVito is a lot of fun but also a little sad. He has no friends and all he wants is to write and have someone like his writings. His teacher, Billy Crystal, is going through a group of serious writers and his wife stole his book and made his own success, which also frustrated him a lot. <br /> <br /> The best parts are the proposal of Mr. Pinsky's book ("One Hundred Girls I'd Like to Pork") and all the scenes with Anne Ramsey, which is so horrible that even Mother Teresa wanted to kill her , also!
