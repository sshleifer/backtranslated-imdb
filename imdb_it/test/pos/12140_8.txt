This is a black and white film from France, <br /> <br /> simple plot, gangsters on the run looking for and getting help, etc. We have seen this type of film many times over the years. What makes this film different is mainly its acting and style. All the actors perform in silence, nobody shouts and almost nobody loses their temper. There are several dead, some surprising. There are also beautiful women, but no sex scenes. No cars chases either. <br /> <br /> JUST talking / It is so refreshing to hear people talk, and here we must also read the subtitles. <br /> <br /> Acting is almost perfect for everyone. in particular the protagonist interpreted by <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura and in a more vital but vital role, Jean Paul Belmondo. These 2 actors were among the best. <br /> <br /> I said above that the film is imperfect, there are some script deficiencies in a few points, they are minor, acting is the thing in this film. Production is also top notch. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (out of 4) 88 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
