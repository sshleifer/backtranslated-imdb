If you repeat a lie enough times will it become the truth? 15 Park Avenue is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic (Mithi). The film is about his search for his home in a fictitious address where his imaginary husband and his five children live. Aparna Sen still offers another masterpiece. Every actor in the film was better than the other. Konkona Sen seems incredibly convincing as a schizophrenic. The role is removed with such ease and maturity beyond his age. Shabana Azmi is amazing as usual. She plays the dominant and fiercely independent older sister of Mithi who takes care of her sick sister and her elderly mother. He refuses to accept that despite all his strength and courage, he sometimes still feels alone. This should have been an easy film for Rahul Bose. The role was less demanding and anyone could play the role. <br /> <br /> The end of the film was the most surreal part of the entire park avenue experience. It took me a while to understand that the film was finished. It left me confused and maybe even a little disturbed. But later, he started to sink. My eyes are black. But if everyone says I'm blue, I'll still think it's black ??!
