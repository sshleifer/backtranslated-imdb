This is probably the best film of 2002 on Romanian cinema. I recommend it as an intense drama without lack of action and chills. The film focuses on adolescent life on the outskirts of Bucharest through the main character, not focusing so much on the shape or definition of the character, but on the anger he and other characters feel. The title "Fury" means anger rather than anger, but it could be considered in the film in both senses by the behavior of the actors. The strange love story (not typical romantic, but rather modern suburban concept) is well structured towards the end. It's a captivating photo, and the cinematography is good enough to capture the suburban nightlife, thus making it a good movie to watch and. <br /> <br /> You won't get bored for a minute, I promise!
