Art imitates life imitates art. Atticus Finch is reincarnated in D.A. in this thrilling and suspenseful thrilling documentary that sounds more like a who-done-it and how it happened. The authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of individuals make this story compelling in many layers. Although racism is one of the themes, there are other elements such as the work ethic, integrity and the way to deal with the pain that brought me back to review and revise this film again and again. The music is guide but not intrusive; the rhythm and the images are such that one cannot go wrong with the fact that they are real people who live an authentic experience.
