I saw this movie for the first time when Quentin Tarantino showed it to a group of us at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin. He preceded it with the incredible beauty he thought he was and how much fun it was and, in the context of his explanation, it was HILARIOUS. I can see how it would be harmful to some viewers, and the subject is not funny at all, but there are at least three lines in the film that made me laugh so hard that I thought about peeing. They don't arrive until after half the way, but when they do, oh God ... you'll die. Oh and Jim Brown is brilliant. It's not in much of the movie, but when it's there, you know who the movie is. Of course, the best (and the funniest) line in the movie is his; you'll know when you hear it.
