My husband received the OBWAT DVD for Christmas and it was the best gift we received! We look at it every time we need to laugh and so far we've seen it 12 times! The scenery in this film is beautiful and the music is exceptional! We also bought the soundtrack and we play it in our vehicles and at home when ever. If someone needs a suggestion for a good gift for movie lovers, this movie is fun! The characters are hilarious, fascinating and their facial expressions are too funny to describe! I've always been a fan of George Clooney but now I'm also a fan of Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro (Pete) and now I'm looking for them in other movies! You have to see this movie !!!
