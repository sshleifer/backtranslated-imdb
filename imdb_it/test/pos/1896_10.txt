This movie is fun in more ways than one. Has action. He has humor. He has an attitude. Has the whole army of kung-fu hos Dolemite girls! And that's exactly what the film offers as a movie. It is also poorly managed by some, the microphone makes more than a cameo and some "punches" are missing on foot. But when you make such a beautiful film, who has time to pay attention to those "details"? This movie sucks. Rent it tonight, if you can find it ... I had to buy it to see it, but I don't regret it!
