Chen Kaige has lost the sense of time. I envy Europeans and Americans who can watch the film without following the dialogue with their ears, because it is painful to do: slow, unnaturally heavy and too deliberate. But westerners, on the other hand, suffer from the poor quality of the subtitle translation, which manages to lose all the subtleties and double meanings that make a careful study of the film so funny.
