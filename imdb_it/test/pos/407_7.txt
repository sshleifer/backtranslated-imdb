Red Skelton plays a radio detective known as "The Fox" in "Whistling in the Dark", also played by Ann Rutherford, Conrad Veidt, Eve Arden, Virgina Gray and Rags Ragland. Wally Benton, aka "The Fox", discovers that his plans to marry his girlfriend Carol (Rutherford) are thwarted when he is kidnapped by a fictitious cult leader (Veidt). Joseph Jones (Veidt) has just learned that his cult, The Silver Haven, does not get a promised legacy due to the existence of the old woman's nephew, who will live out of interest. He wants Wally to come up with a perfect murderous plot so that the man can be killed on the plane in flight to meet his lawyer. For backup, and because he is not sure which Wally's boyfriend is, Jones kidnaps Carol and also the daughter of the radio sponsor (Gray). <br /> <br /> This, for me, however, is a superior film to the second entry in this series, "Whistle to Dixie". The plot is better, the cast is better, there is less slapstick and less banal jokes. Skelton, when he is not making faces and rolling his eyes, is rather amiable, and Rutherford is very good. Veidt has always played these evil men perfectly. Eve Arden is Wally's agent, who arranges an appointment for him and Gray to make sure his contract is renewed. Later, I had only seen Gray in films from the 1950s onwards. She was always a good-looking woman, but who knew she was a real spill in the 1930s and 40s? This is a funny film with a clean cast.
