Rose and the good doctor find themselves in a space station that is on a planet that hovers almost impossible in orbit right under a black hole. The station crew is equally perplexed as the two new inhabitants are. Suitably spooky in its atmosphere and improving as the Doctor and Rose find themselves stranded due to circumstances beyond their control and speaking through the submissive alien race of the Od, something quite dark comes from beneath the planet's crust. I have not seen the second part of this two parter that I cannot guarantee that the end is still strong. But it's a hellish start. <br /> <br /> My Grade: A
