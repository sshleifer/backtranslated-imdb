When I was young, I was a big fan of Naked Gun movies but I recently saw the Police Sqaud show! and I think it's great! Leslie Nielson's fantastic, Alan North is beautiful, and who the hell is Rex Hamilton? But anyway, it's a stupid show. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite parts of this show when they make the freeze frame during the credits. I think my favorite is when Norberg (not O.J.) comes in during the scene and tries to adapt to the still image. Classic! <br /> <br /> The only problem for me is that the cigarette gag gets very old (when Drebin shows someone a cigarette and asks "Cigarette?" and the person answers, "Yes, I know.") I think they used it too often from anything. <br /> <br /> Good acting, good gags, great show! <br /> <br /> 7/10
