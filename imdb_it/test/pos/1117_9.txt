A wonderful family film and a beautiful horse movie. 75 +% of entertainment. Casey, Buddy, Kelly Marsh are very interesting and adorable characters. Horses are true beauties. <br /> <br /> It has horse racing as a backdrop to show how luck is sometimes just good sense. Show how children can do stupid things for stupid reasons. Show how adults can do stupid things for selfish reasons. The characters interpreted in a very realistic way transform the unrealistic theme of the film into something in which everyone can identify. <br /> <br /> Andrew Rubin performs in a wonderful performance as Buddy, the sensitive older brother. Something reminded me of Aidan Quinn (eyes, expression of language, appearance of the face). <br /> <br /> Casey makes you fall in love with the character because of seriousness. Sarah Blue is also well represented by Alexis Smith. Lloyd Bourdelle, the father, is played by Walter Matthau and he is the character. <br /> <br /> Although there is room for improvement in the film, it is a very fun and enjoyable movie.
