Surface, from the day his teaser first showed in the summer of 2005, was a mess. On the one hand, it seemed so high-level conceptual and guided plot that it seemed to passersby that it would work better as a film (or more). Furthermore, it appeared to be NBC's attempt at "Lost-killer". On the other hand, one might have realized that the story was too expansive to tell in a movie or two, and fans of Lost seemed intrigued. <br /> <br /> So after a (and maybe only) season on NBC, the show is about an indefinite break that could either put it in the vault, in science fiction, or fill a gap in the NBC lineup in summer or autumn of 2007 or later. His appraisals were among the best on the net (which he is not saying much), but the show was removed from nothing without a real official announcement of his future. <br /> <br /> So, is it worth it? Yes. <br /> <br /> Surface follows a continuous plot format, guided by the plot with filling episodes close to zero. Almost everything that happens on the show is important for the plot, much like a movie. No filling episode, which made you suffer when you lost an episode. Still, the double benefit of the show made up for this; Great things seem to happen in every episode, but since it looks like a movie, you end each episode feeling like it just happened and you remain to wish for more! That stretch of the show, even if it shows how beautiful it is. The cast is solid; the three main protagonists, including the beautiful Lake Bell as Laura Daughtery, gave a solid performance to each episode, each driven by their own reasons for finding / studying creatures. The supporting cast, including Ian Anthony Dale and the short performance of Rade Serbedzija complete the cast. The story is slow at the beginning (my only regret, in reality it doesn't take up to 3-4 episodes in the short season of 15 episodes), but the second half of the season makes up for it. The visual effects are stunning (the jaw will drop when you see a top view of one of the creatures "attacking" a ship). <br /> <br /> Many of the show's problems can be solved by purchasing the complete the first season and you don't have to wait a week (or three) to watch the next episode. <br /> <br /> In short, if you've lost the first season and you're curious, come back and watch it. It's not Twin Peaks in terms of oddness, but its high-concept nature fits into what it is, Lost and other similar shows, with a touch of action and adventure. Have fun.
