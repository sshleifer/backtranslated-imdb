Cinema, at its best, is entertainment. If you question any aspect with which there is room for disagreement, and much of recorded history is based on contemporary opinions - often biased - you should leave the cinema, because their prejudices always ruin their fun. When I saw a plane flying overhead in a movie dated 33 BC I was amused. The background scenario in "Casablanca" is absurdly false. So, am I complaining and say that the film failed to convince? Fiona, relax and enjoy some excellent acting. Wajda's decision to play the protagonists as French and Polish was inspired. one was immediately aware of which side all the main characters represented. No need to dwell on the authenticity of wigs. This is a powerful cinema. If there is a political message that is still relevant today - organize a dinner - a Château d'Yquem with foie-gras; a Pulcher Montrachet with the appetizer; some Polish vodka sorbets and perhaps a 1961 Château Lafite-Rothschild with beef - and discuss the political aspects of Danton to the point of falling from fatigue. Would Danton surely accept?
