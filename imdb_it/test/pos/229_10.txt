One night I was listening to radio talk and they had Leslie Nielsen on the program. He went on to explain why there were only 6 shows. '<br /> <br /> With TV shows like MASH you could go to the fridge to get a beer and until you heard what was happening you didn't miss anything. But with the police squad, you had to watch the show, with the view that made you lose a lot if you didn't see them. Who could forget "... the part of the city known as" Little Italy "..." with the Colosseum in the background. <br /> <br /> The films also relied on the gags, but again being in the theater you were a captive audience. <br /> <br /> Leslie also said that the only reason the show, movies and other films like Airplane were fun was that they didn't try to say what was funny. It was up to the spectator to take the lines. <br /> <br /> Well, it's just my 2 cents.
