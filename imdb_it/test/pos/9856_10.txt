I loved this movie! It's worth the long travel time. I need help with the ending though .... <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Marie's last shot at the end - This is to suggest he is still looking for Renaud ? or maybe she was the one who wanted to reinvigorate the 13th? (she seemed to be the one who delivered the initial letter to Colin in the first place) I don't understand it, but I know I really liked it. So, if someone has seen this and remembers it or has just seen it, please deepen the ending. <br /> <br /> Thanks
