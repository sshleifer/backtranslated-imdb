Towards the end of the sixties, director Sergio Corbucci produced four spaghetti westerns in a row: the classics THE MERCENARY, THE GREAT SILENCE, THE SPECIALISTS and COMPANEROS. Three of these, all except THE SPECIALISTS, are constantly displayed on the ten best lists when spaghetti westerns are evaluated. Until recently, all I had seen was a poor quality compilation with a little English, a little Italian, a confused image, and it was almost incomprehensible. Now, having seen a beautiful widescreen version with subtitles (however in two languages, anyway), I can easily include THE SPECIALISTS in that group of four classics. Johnny Halliday is as good as the charismatic Hud, a notorious hand with a gun back to Blackstone to investigate the death of his brother, who was lynched by the citizens for losing their savings. It involves a voluptuous beauty who owns the bank, a Mexican bandit chief, El Diablo, who was once a friend of Hud, an honest sheriff who dreams of better days, and a small band of hippies - well, it was the late sixties, and hippies were everywhere, even apparently in our westerns. It's not a desert western, filmed in the Alps somewhere, and it's adorable to watch. There is a little more nudity than I expect in a western, but it's not a bad thing. Sylvie Fennec is as adorable as Sheba, who could be Hud's niece, or the dead brother's girlfriend ... which has never been clarified. This film deserves to be seen and, once again, we ask for a nice DVD with all the details - I think the SPECIALISTS would be known as all the other Corbucci westerns, and this is really a great praise.
