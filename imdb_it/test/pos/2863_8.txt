My tastes in movies continue to amaze me and probably rave readers of my reviews, but to each of them and I have a weakness for crazy horror, slasher movies and See No Evil looks exactly like that and more !! I think the biggest mistake made by producers and directors of this film is the fact that they publicized it as a WWE movie and "played" by KANE. WWE could have a big following, but it's a very, very specific group that follows the incredibly cheap and (sorry) "sport" species of the trailer park and those who don't like it HAATTTE IT !! He would put them away from a typical film of clandestine shots that people would come around to see. See No Evil does not break any new horror, it is exactly a typical horror game with some exaggerated and bloody scenes that make your screen really smooth. They really drive him home and give him gratuitous violence. There is no psychological aspect, although being chased by this monster has some elements of fear. <br /> <br /> KANE (the wrestler) also known as Glen Jacobs plays the man tortured religiously and physically Jacob Goodnight. It is the last cross between Leatherface and Jason Voorhees. It is not an original killer and even his murders do not go for the uniqueness or the original with the main exception of choking a girl to death forcing her to swallow her cell phone ... well !! He does a good job and the man is legitimately huge !! It is 7 feet tall and without special effects is monstrous !! Tiffany Lamb, Penny McNamee, Samantha Noble, Michael J. Pagan, Luke Pegler, Christina Vidal, Rachael Taylor all play the typical "think they're invincible" band that celebrate teenagers who reluctantly become victims of the serial killer. The story is that in exchange for one month from their prison sentence for minor crimes ranging from theft to drug possession, they are sent to an old hotel to do "community service" by fixing it. It turns out that a serial killer lives upstairs and is removing the victim's eyes to purify them from their sins. Luke Pegler stands out as a sack that eventually becomes a hero, even saving his ex-girlfriend who used to beat. The rest of them play prospective roles quite well, but it's not a great way to act. <br /> <br /> Sad porn director ... yes PORNO ... Gregory Dark, does a good job putting together the modern day slasher. He even goes into a bit of history with the murderer and even if his story on the back is not unique, in fact it's a bit stale, it's still quite interesting. And in the few shots where the film-goer is actually looking through the murderer's eyes, it's interesting to hear the voices and see the distorted things like he does. Throw the mandatory soft core naked shot, and the grotesque scenes, soaked in blood and turn everything into a notch. It fits well and for a horror fan like me it's fun. Kane's serial killer is terrifying and haunts them with brutal intelligence and silent horror. The film is slammed and scrambled and I don't blame anyone because it's pretty lousy but isn't that the point ?? It's a horror movie and I thought it was exactly what it should be. It made me jump, it made me shiver, it even made me turn my back in different parts ... impressive by any standard. It's fun, with a decent story, and a lot of set ups to serialize See No Evil to the fifteenth installment, if they wanted to and I say bring it up !! It is true that the film is full of holes in the plot, ridiculous details but the deadly blood and horror above ride everything. Everything depends on whether you love horror movies ?? Do I really love them ?? If yes, then you will think that this is a terrifying asshole ... if not ... he will hate it ... clear and simple. 8.5 / 10
