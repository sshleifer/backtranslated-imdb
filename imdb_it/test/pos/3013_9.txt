It must be said that the director of The Cell, Tarsem Singh, has quite easily established himself with his first feature film, which ranks as one of the most visually stunning films of contemporary cinema. <br /> <br /> The Cell is more a visceral experience than a movie. As a thriller, he stands above most of his peers, with competent editing and a chilling score that provides an exceptionally suspenseful atmosphere. However, it is ultimately Tarsem's ability to process and disturb scenes and images that convey the film's sense of terror. <br /> <br /> Like many other recent films, I was shocked by the alarming hypocrisy among those who have negatively commented on The Cell; in defense of the film, I will address some of these problems. The plot seems to be the main concern, and while it is not revolutionary and borrows heavily from The Silence of the Lambs, it was never intended as the most important aspect of the film; the plot itself is a vehicle through which Tarsem's vision - simultaneously horrifying and wonderful - is presented to the public, in the same way that the plot of The Silence of the Lambs is secondary to the fascinating study of its two protagonists, Lecter and Starling . While The Silence of the Lambs is clearly the superior film, it is irrational to condemn The Cell's plot and, at the same time, praise that of The Silence of the Lambs. <br /> <br /> My final concern is the mention of the "MTV style" direction. It pains me to see the condemnation of directors who use innovative camera and film techniques. A camera has the potential to be much more than just a tool for recording events; corners, pans, color regulation and so on, are all used in their full extension in The Cell with the aim of creating the sense of a dream state that could not have been otherwise reached. This is essential for the film, since the whole premise behind it is the visualization of the subconscious mind of a serial killer. If you simply want a series of static shots, take part in theatrical performances and completely give up cinema. <br /> <br /> That said, The Cell is extremely fun, terrifying and breathtaking in both rhythm and design. Anyone who is able to look beyond the script, perhaps not inspired, but never boring, will find one of the best films of the year 2000.
