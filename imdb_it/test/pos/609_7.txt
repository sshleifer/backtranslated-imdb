A look at three geishas who pass their first. Now they look back on their past with affection and lament their present. Kin (played by Floating Weeds' Haruko Sugimura) swore the men and made a good life as a usurer; everyone on the block owes to her. The other two, Nobu and Tamae, would like their husbands to land, but they are not foolish enough to believe that they will ever do it. Meanwhile, their children - one has a son and one a daughter - are about to get married (not to each other). Tamae is annoyed by how much her daughter has become prettier than her, and tries bitterly to convince her not to marry the man. Nobu's concerns about his son are more legitimate in nature, but they are also (understandably) selfish. After your son leaves, he will be alone. Somewhat in the film, two of Kin's previous clients came to look for her, a man so obsessed with her that he tried to convince her to commit a double suicide with him, the other of his most beautiful clients. Unfortunately, he comes for his money, not for his love. The way I described the film makes it irresistibly depressing, but in reality it is not. Sad, but not fatally. It is more sweet and sour. Unfortunately, I liked the late chrysanthemums only marginally. The story seems better when I look back, but it's very slow and boring. Actually I nodded twice during the movie, and I wasn't tired at all before starting. This is the kind of film I can appreciate more than how; reminds me a lot of my reaction to a couple of Ozu's most famous films. 7/10.
