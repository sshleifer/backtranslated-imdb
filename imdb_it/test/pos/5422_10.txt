I only saw him once - in 1986, in an "artistic" theater in Minneapolis ... but I remember him as I saw him a thousand times this morning. Exhilarating ("Sawing for Teens", playing Scrabble with all the tiles "e"), wonderfully animated (taking your eyes off, shaking them back into position, then putting them back) and moving (the end of the world, the pettiness of a bite) ... <br /> <br /> Display required for the human race. Calling this simply a cartoon is like calling the BIG GATSBY by typing nifty.
