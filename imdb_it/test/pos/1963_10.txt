I just saw this movie for the second time. I saw it for the first time in the mid-90s as a Vanguard video. He has retained his power. <br /> <br /> It is interesting from several aspects. One is that it is based on a true story. Due is a springboard for two interesting actors: Keanu Reeves and Crispin Glover. And three, he has Dennis Hopper in one of his best maladjusted / psychotic social roles. <br /> <br /> The film is also a study of how people act in different contexts. You have characters in one, family group, peer group, school, general society settings, etc. History does well to show how a person will act in every context. <br /> <br /> I wish I could find the details of the actual murder to compare with the movie. I saw a little bit that indicated that it occurred in California and that several schoolmates had been taken to see the body. <br /> <br /> This is a good choice for a rainy night video rental. Be ready to feel upset at the end.
