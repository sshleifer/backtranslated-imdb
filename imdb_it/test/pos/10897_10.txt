GoldenEye is a masterpiece. The plot is incredibly represented, the characters are beautifully animated and the weapons are tyte. The plot is so interesting, even when you complete every single mission, to get more levels you have to beat them on a higher difficulty. And the multiplayer mode is tyte. Choose the weapons you want to play with, then play. My friends and I, along with my brother, always play Goldeneye. If you don't have this game, I suggest you buy it.
