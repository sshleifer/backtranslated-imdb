The only conceivable flaw in this film is its title !! Please stop comparing it with the first one! I did this in my previous review just to separate it from the first one. If you haven't seen the movie and you're curious, TOTALMENTE forgets the first one and invents a different name for it. There is nothing like it and it has a mood of its own. This is a great exponent of the moving comedy of the 80s. I seriously doubt that such important names in this cast made the film because they were broke or even wanted to redo the first one. Anyone who ever wanted to kick the snobbish aristocracy should love this little work. I argue, the only reason why this is in the number 100 of IMDB is due to the title. I usually hate movies like these (for example sandal, farrell, bruscosino ....), but this film makes me laugh hysterically. I don't know, maybe it's like a bad relationship I can't get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure. However, this is the single underrated movie of the 80s behind "The Stunt Man". <br /> <br /> Robert Stack - WE LOVE YOU !!! (1919-2003)
