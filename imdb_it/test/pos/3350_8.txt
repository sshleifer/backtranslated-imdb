What can you say? This is the integral hardcore, the musical Alice! It also works with a big energy cast that seems to be enjoying it to the fullest and while one might want a remastered version, I think we're lucky to have this video transfer too. Practically a delight for everything. There are a couple of slightly off moments, but this may have been embarrassing all the time and it certainly isn't. It could also have been and today it would have been too much camp. No, a very nice effort that is fun, melodious and quite sexy. Excellent performance especially Kristine DeBell in the head and was an uncredited Richard Prior in that the inclined rider was vigorously (if discreetly) ridden?
