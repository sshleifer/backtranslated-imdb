Finally I saw the real reason why Peter Boyle became famous. He was not the "Young Frankenstein" monster or Frank Barone's irritable being in "Everybody Loves Raymond". For the younger ones who only know him from TV, try this movie, make Frank look like a saint. <br /> <br /> "Joe" is Boyle in his best role as an actor and as someone mentioned, he most likely gave the inspiration for "Archie Bunker" on "All In The Family". I think Boyle went back to "Joe" a little bit to play Frank. (I say this because I noticed that the basement of both "Joe" and Frank Barone look similar.) <br /> <br /> I knew nothing about this movie when I looked at it outside the library, I knew Boyle and Susan Sarandon were present. Yes, Susan looks good and for a young actress is a great first role. A young hippie wants to be, who runs away from his parents at home and lives with, the last lost in a drug-induced hippie haze, which also sells as much as he buys. <br /> <br /> After an almost fatal overdose on too many pills, she is hospitalized while her parents go to get her things, her mother will not enter the smelly apartment, but down at home, but her father it does. While Dad picks up his things, his boyfriend comes home and the two words of exchange and then his father does what we later hear from Joe that he would like to do a hippie. <br /> <br /> Joe is turning his mouth out about how he hates different cultures / races, hippies and a list of others. When he says "I'd really like to kill one," his father (trying to sound like he was joking) says "I just did it". Joe almost buys it but then takes it as fun. <br /> <br /> Later, when the police are on the scene and the story is in the newspaper, Joe understands, he wasn't kidding. Instead of nailing the rich for money through blackmail, he actually blackmails him in some way. Just wanting him and his wife to "know" him and his wife. In short, their association is embarrassing, but after Sarandon got rid of what his father did, the fund could fall. <br /> <br /> As this will all end, you will have to look for yourself. Even though it's over 35 years ago, the ending is something you don't expect. Unless you've seen the movie before, of course. Once again, I recommend it especially to those who have not seen it. <br /> <br /> 10 stars for Boyle not only interpreting someone completely opposite to his nature but for what he will show to others that he was more than just a TV and comedy movie actor. (END)
