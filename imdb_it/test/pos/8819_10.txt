A wonderful little production. <br /> <br /> The shooting technique is very modest, very old-fashioned by the BBC and gives a sense of comforting, sometimes uncomfortable realism to the entire piece. <br /> <br /> The actors are extremely well chosen - Michael Sheen not only "has all the Polars", but also has all the voices down! You can really see the montage seamlessly guided by references to the entries in Williams' diary, not only is it worth looking at but it's a terrifyingly written and interpreted piece. A masterly production on one of the great masters of comedy and his life. <br /> <br /> Realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard who, instead of using traditional "dream" techniques, remains solid and then disappears. It plays on our knowledge and our senses, in particular with the scenes of Orton and Halliwell and the sets (in particular of their apartment with the murals of Halliwell that decorate every surface) are terribly well done.
