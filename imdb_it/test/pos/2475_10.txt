Death Camp Opera: right here, right now! <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, I read that a very special film was directed at the polarization of our society. A certain Peter Watkins was the author. His photo was played by non-professional actors, citizens like you and me ?? and other. Atmospheric violence has been described as extremely realistic. Was it a film, a documentary? Both actually. <br /> <br /> Over the years I realized how difficult it was to find it. Maybe I would, by chance? However, it is still an old story. I saw it a little while ago. Totally impressive. My favorite art peace: Punishment Park is its name. I love this "docu-fiction", this "truecastmovie", this "realityshowfictionnal", what ever. After all the shock movies I saw, I achieved the best with this strong and intense cinematic experience. I found a masterpiece. There is enough on the net to know a lot about the film. It is also to be bought on DVD, with other things. The only words I want to add concern my experience with this film. I can only trust such sincere and committed peace of art over people and people, those who direct, act or look. A cinema that is simply a true human experience within an artistic adventure? or otherwise. <br /> <br /> So, I'm not talking about all the "mucs" we can see on TV, especially the "reality show" that the concepts of people who interpret them are interesting, but used in a stupid and perverse way . In Punishment Park, we can see some real individuals living as they are. We insert them only in a very specific context, with a few lines to follow and let them be what they want to be. It is a kind of therapy, a way of "individuation" for those who are inside the film and also for the spectators active in front of the screens. Then, to finish, the director's touch changes a short and sweet film of the apocalypse, a desperate scream, a 'Death Camp Opera', in which some people are on the run after virulent trials. Punishment Park is for those who want to grow. Watch this movie and you have the opportunity to choose your morality. Grow and harmonize with it! If you can hear it! If you can see it !! In my case, Punishment Park is stuck in me forever, with all my love, conscience and will.
