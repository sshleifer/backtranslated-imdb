I would like the cast and crew members to sit down and make an audio commentary on this movie! All the different places they went to film this movie! It should provide some very good anecdotes! Fans of this movie would love to know: <br /> <br /> What kind of permission did they have to film in certain places? <br /> <br /> Were there any memorable outtakes? <br /> <br /> Were there any scenes that have been deleted? <br /> <br /> What challenges did the cast and team face? <br /> <br /> Did any actor have stand-ins? <br /> <br /> What was it like working with other cast members? <br /> <br /> Have the scenes been advertised? <br /> <br /> What are the cast and crew members so far? <br /> <br /> Which places are still there, and which places are gone, or are they a different business now? <br /> <br /> It is one thing to read curiosity about this film on this site and other websites. But there is no comparison to take it directly from the horse's mouth! <br /> Come on, guys! Stay together and make a comment! Never give up a challenge! Go for the taste!
