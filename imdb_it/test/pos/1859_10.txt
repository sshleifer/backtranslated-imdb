I read reviews of this film that they found it "disappointing" and "confusing". I can't understand why it should be. From the beginning I found an extraordinary experience and a total joy to watch. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: the opening titles overlap with a beautiful view of the evolutionary process, and this introduces the story with a serene and radical style. The film is not about the process itself, but about the struggle of Charles Darwin with his conscience, his love for his wife, his dead daughter and his search for the truth. <br /> <br /> Her daughter's appearances are manifestations of a tormented mind who knows she "killed God". The daughter is an adult, making comments as an adult about his work and torturing Darwin with personal doubts. Was he somehow responsible for his death? Husband and wife in real life Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly offer wonderful performances like Charles and Emma Darwin, as well as Martha West as Annie. Bettany's size and awkward gait give Darwin's character a real sense of reality, while Connelly seems very comfortable with his English accent and occasionally a rather severe character. <br /> <br /> It is easy to misunderstand the times when this film resides. The grip that religion had on society and the inner struggles that a man like Darwin must have suffered to seek the truth in what he saw. Science and religion have always been embarrassing bedfellows and, although it did not cost his life, as he did with so many previous men and women, science has put a barrier between husband and wife, fact and faith. This film portrays that barrier extremely well. I give the Creation ten stars, because I think it's beautiful, deep, superbly well acted and a genuine, non-alien-required look at one of the real geniuses. <br /> <br /> What seems obvious to everyone today (well, almost everyone ... see Bill Maher's wonderful "Religulous") has been hidden for millennia. The truth, once discovered, was undoubtedly painful for many. Creation examines that pain and the knowledge that we are all we possess. <br /> <br /> A wonderful cinematic experience.
