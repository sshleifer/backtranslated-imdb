I would rate this movie at the top of my Ingrid Bergman movie list. Apart from Ingrid's beauty, her talent is evident on stage after scene. She was sad, mean, witty, snobbish, flirtatious, delightfully amusing, loving, tender, sorrowful, anguished, happy, etc. You call him, she was all that and more. - And so so <br /> <br /> convincing. Ingrid plays a well-known woman (Clio) who returns to New <br /> <br /> Orleans and falls in love with a Texas gambler, Gary Cooper (Clint). I particularly enjoyed the scene where they sat at the dining table without saying anything, just staring at each other. She, in an elegant white dress and he in a beautiful white cowboy dress, sitting there looking at her with a beloved air. What a chemistry! Which love!
