Attending this film was an excuse to escape the work I had to do for my lessons, but it turned out to be one of my best experiences here in France. The film does a quick job of building multidimensional characters and has an extremely elegant plot. The characters really had the voices you would expect from reading the graphic novels and the artistic talent exceeded my expectations. The music was captivating and the play fiddled and carefree, almost a flaming inscription of modern objects in playful ways. The film was carefully captured, cute and full of action at the same time. A wonderful fairy tale turned with skill. I will show it to my French students.
