A huge cast gathered for this remake which unfortunately was a box office failure despite a great soundtrack. I can't say it was compelling entertainment, nor a cure for insomnia. However I liked the movie - it provided the escape I was looking for after an afternoon. Looks good for those of us looking for the ideal life, even if it's a fantasy. Expect some trivial moments, a few chills and an occasional laugh.
