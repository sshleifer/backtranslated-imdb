When the incident was made and aired, Eisenhower was president. Kennedy was the elected president. <br /> <br /> As for the episode, it was a passable episode, if not a bit serious. "The professor" does not show much space here, and everything seems a bit hasty (many episodes of the TZ seem to not fit the time slot, some seem to be crammed and rushed, some with little or nothing distributed over the course now, and some, naturally fit). I guess you expect a little more tension than being reported in some rooms and drugged. But overall a decent episode. In fact, the "what if" motif of time travel is a nugget in itself and places the table of basic interest. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10, considering that there were many episodes of TZ not as good, and much better.
