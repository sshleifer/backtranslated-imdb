Frank Sinatra has starred in this strange little RKO short film that is now in the public domain. The film was released around the same time the war ended and is a beautiful request for religious tolerance. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Sinatra on stage. After leaving the stage, he goes out into the alley and finds a group of boys who choose another because of his religion. Instead of screaming at the kids (or helping them with that subject), Sinatra offers a good lesson in civic education about religious tolerance and equates to prejudice with fascism. The children seem to have the lesson but then, suddenly, Sinatra starts to sing a song that, frankly (understood?), The children would have hated. He had a beautiful voice, but unfortunately I think this negatively affected the excellent message he gave to children about tolerance. It is a case of a good message with too many songs, even if the singer is Frank Sinatra. It is also an interesting curiosity - a beautiful historical piece that is often overlooked ... plus it is quite moving even though it looks a bit schmaltzy.
