I won't bore you with the plot and the plots, as they have already been presented many times on this page, so ?? It's been a while since I saw a movie like that. Beautiful, elegant and sober, with a narrative rhythm to match. A film with sensitivity and discreet quality that is rare in these times of clich√© plots. The wonderfully subdued photography, saturated with rich and luxurious colors, and for lack of better words, each frame is full of an air of tension. The settings and settings are used repeatedly but the film succeeds in giving new life to them every time they are present, it always seems that there is a prop, a lamp or a set to lightly induce the public to understand where we are in the characters world. <br /> <br /> The acting reminds me of "The Bicycle Thief", not the style, but the fact that you forget that you are watching two actors engaged in their art. There is a meaning behind each gesture and almost every movement has given meaning to explaining the inner world of the characters, the relationship, the feelings and the situation of the two lovers. The dialogue is scarce but, like the rest of the film, it is steeped in meaning. Speaking of meaning, the soundtrack is contagious. Used here it becomes a device for telling stories. And even if the film is of Chinese origin, even a song sung in Spanish by Nat King Cole gives the film a subtle meaning. The orchestrated soundtrack is repetitive, but repetition is what makes it comfortable. It is used along with history, and not just a means to put music into action, or to push the audience to feel a certain way at some point in the plot. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this film to everyone, I fear that most people would be tired from the calm flow of the story, but I would recommend it to someone who is looking for an alternative to the romantic schlock that fills our multiplexes part of the world. I must say that I was completely taken by this film and I kept watching it night after night. History takes time to present itself and brings repeated visions as very few films in this genre are open to such a broad interpretation. A very beautiful film.
