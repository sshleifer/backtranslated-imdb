OK, this is not comparable to the explosive time of the opening sequence of the first part; nor to its value of visual shock; nor, moreover, to the melancholy suspense of the second episode. No, it is surprisingly and pleasantly different (apart, of course, from the two main actors). The ironic futuristic scenario pushes the characters towards each other through genres and languages ​​with an almost gravitational force. The moment of impact-conclusion is your choice of: a) Shakespearean metaphor of life and humanity in a cartoon costume; b) sublimation of homo-erotic violence; c) humorous detonation of an impossible accumulation. Everything until then is even less unequivocal. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for fans of indiscriminate films that don't mind following the foie gras with a hot dog; attention to those with the most refined palates.
