The Museum of the Moving Image here in New York recently presented a complete retrospective of Jacques Rivette's films. After falling in love with his "Paris Nous Appartient", I decided he couldn't miss it. <br /> <br /> Largely through prolonged shots and flexibly structured scenes, the film portrays two avant-garde theater companies preparing their interpretations of "Seven Against Thebes" and "Prometheus" by Aeschylus. In addition, we are shown the daily lives without direction of two individuals remotely connected to the companies: a working-class woman named Frederique who finds creative ways to sell men out of their money, and a young man named Colin who visits the local cafes pretending to be deaf-mute, and plays the harmonica acute to the customers until they pay him to leave. The first four hours are devoted to the creation of the characters and their models, before a slightly silly and extravagant plot that involves a conspiracy and the deciphering of covert secret letters emerges. <br /> <br /> The film is largely about life on the fringes of society. Theater companies are desperate, using their elaborate emotionally draining exercises (which are really something to look at) to distract themselves from the fact that their actions are unlikely to have ever been staged or even seen. Colin and Frederique both have very few friends, who find only for a short time some excitement or purpose after the conspiracy has touched them, since they are encouraged to discover more. The film meditates on the consequences of the rejection of normal society in several memorable sequences, including a long rundown of Colin as he wanders the streets of France shouting poems to himself. As such, the film was called an analysis of the counterculture of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> There is no film structure that is not charged with energy and vitality. The fact that much of the dialogue and movement are improvised makes the characters much more spontaneous, much more immediate. The camera also becomes an important character in this sense; in all the shadows of the film boom they are visible here and there, or other similar errors, yet they seem natural and in tune with the flow of the action because the camera is such an important player in it. <br /> <br /> More than anything else for me, the film seems like a great example of another way of making films, a place for films outside the usual scheme. For me it was an experience of open-mindedness, even more than "Paris Nous Appartient", although the latter has many similarities of theme and structure. A must-see for those who reflect the nature of art.
