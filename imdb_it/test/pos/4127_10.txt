This is one of those movies where I just want to move my feet and dance at home. It's a very positive and happy kind of music. The film has some sad parts, but above all music is what makes me happy. Gary Busey did a great job as Buddy Holly. Buddy Holly continued to attend even his pastor, his parents and the Nashville record producer told him no. Buddy Holly did not give in to what he liked. I didn't know much about Buddy Holly until I saw this movie. I was at the Surf Ballroom where he played for the last time, but I didn't pay much attention until I saw this movie. It's an incredible movie with a lot of fun so stand up and watch this movie.
