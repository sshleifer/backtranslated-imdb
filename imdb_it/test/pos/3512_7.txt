I was lucky enough to see the DVD version of "Horror Classics" of this movie before it was mysteriously removed from the DVD of the 4 films and replaced with something else. The quality of the image and sound of the film in that edition was a nightmare in itself. Still, that version is STILL superior to that with luxury DVD treatment. The reason was expressed in the segments of Brad Fiedel's interview on the special edition DVD. He had noticed what I had found so surprising in this film. This is the use of music in the moments of inactivity of the film, but leaves the moments of activity in silence, thus giving horror scenes a stronger feeling. The problem with this reprint is that it brings the extra score of the film used to fill these intentional gaps in the score. Fiedel complained about this and made it clear that the fill music was not his. The music sounded very similar to Howard Shore's work for Videodrome. Sad for me that I'm also a big fan of that movie and I have to associate the two. <br /> <br /> The film itself has managed to add some realistic elements of interest to the horror genre. A group of friends gets on a mountain inherited from one of them. On the mountain they find themselves in front of a family with a nightmare secret. The film is proceeding at a fast pace. In fact, every time I saw it, I still find myself shocked to see that 45 minutes had passed before things really started going wrong for campers. <br /> <br /> While the version of Horror Classics is full of many gaps, the fact that there is no score accompanying the horror scenes is what makes this film intelligent and even superior to most slasher movies that have ever seen. Director Jeff Lieberman had made some unique horror films prior to this, making this one the most mainstream and at the same time very different from the mainstream. It's a fun movie with amazing acting performances. The new version of the DVD in vogue is worth a rent, now the collector's version of Horror Classics, now it's worth hunting.
