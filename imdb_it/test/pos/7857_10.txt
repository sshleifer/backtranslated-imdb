This film is not what it appears to be. Clint Eastwood is not Dirty Harry or a "cowboy" here. The film's appeal comes from its careful manipulation of atmosphere and theme. It is a Gothic tale set in the Civil War and as such the entire "action" of the film, or its lack, takes place inside a house populated by Southern Belles of all ages and forms. <br /> <br /> Horror comes from seeing the whole story through the eyes of the Clint Eastwood character. Seeing him stuck at home and held captive by women is truly a "captivating" experience. And who is "deceived" here exactly? Are women seduced by the incredible appearance of Eastwood? Are we, the spectators, fascinated both by her sexual charm and by the potential deviant sexuality that triggers? Or "deceived" refers to what the director does here ... keep us fascinated for a short space just to (maybe) let go? Don Siegel does all of the above in one of the most memorable and disturbing movies I've had the pleasure of watching.
