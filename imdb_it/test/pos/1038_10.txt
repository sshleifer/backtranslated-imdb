I posted on IMDb recently about this series, giving an email address to the commercial arm of the BBD where it would be written to appeal for release. I wrote to that address, mentioning Sam Waterson and his popularity. I just received the following reply: <br /> <br /> From: emilyfussell@hotmail.com Subject: Oppenheimer Date: May 14th, 2006 1:44:00 PM MDT A: kk2840@earthlink.net <br /> <br /> Dear Kate, <br /> <br /> I work for BBFC, the British equivalent of the MPAA, and we classify DVDs and videos as well as films in this country. However, I am currently in the process of issuing a certificate for the 1980 Oppenheimer miniseries. While looking for a job on IMDb, I noticed your post and thought you would like to know that the work was about to be released (from here the need for a certificate). <br /> <br /> I don't know which company is distributing it, but keep your eyes open! <br /> <br /> Kind regards, <br /> <br /> Emily +++++++++++++++++ <br /> <br /> cheers! <br /> <br /> I also want to contact Netflix to purchase this. <br /> <br /> Kate Killebrew <br /> <br /> kk2840@earthlink.net I recently sent an email to the BBC to find out if their extraordinary Oppenheimer series had ever been published on video or DVD. I haven't been able to find it. I received the following answer. If you write the BBC, make sure you mention that Sam Waterston is very popular in the United States. You can also enter "Oppenheimer (1980)" on amazon.com, and find a checkbox to request the release from the owner (BBC) and receive a notification upon release. <br /> <br /> Kate Killebrew kk2840@earthlink.net <br /> <br /> Here's the BBC response: <br /> <br /> Dear Kate <br /> <br /> Thanks for the your e-mail regarding 'Oppenheimer'. <br /> <br /> I was interested in reading that you would like a copy of this program that you liked. I checked the BBC Shop and online retailers and found no sign of being available. At the moment we are not aware of any plans to publish this program on DVD. However, if you want to make a suggestion, I can suggest that you put it in writing on the BBC business section: <br /> <br /> Commissioning Editor BBC Worldwide Ltd Woodlands 80 Wood Lane London W12 0TT <br /> <br /> I can thank you again for taking the time to contact the BBC. <br /> <br /> Greetings <br /> <br /> Elaine Hunter BBC Information ______________________________________ <br /> <br /> - ---- Original Message ----- <br /> <br /> {Comments:} I'm trying to find a copy of the extraordinary BBC production "Oppenheimer", a six-part series made in 1980 with Sam Waterston from a book / script by Peter Prince. I've watched some parts of it on PBS American Playhouse, but I can't find it on videos anywhere. <br /> <br /> http://www.bbc.co.uk/
