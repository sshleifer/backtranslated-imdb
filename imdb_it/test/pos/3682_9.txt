Friend, I had my doubts. I love Kathy Bates, but I thought, how beautiful it can be, I had never even heard of this thing ...! You know, it was one of those things, we gave her "20 minutes and we will turn it off if it sucks" and we were stuck from the beginning. This is a very catchy and fun movie. It's weird, you know? I mean, you have a lounge singer, a killer (and credible), you have a farce, then Kathy Bates in all her acting brilliance, Rupert Everett finally acting for her true potential, Dan Ackroyd, and a dwarf who makes you laugh aloud. I tell you, you'll laugh / cry. <br /> <br /> Maybe I had a strange week, but I think this movie is at the level of Fried Green Tomatoes. If you don't like that movie, maybe you won't like it, but I think it was a great movie. I went out and bought the DVD.
