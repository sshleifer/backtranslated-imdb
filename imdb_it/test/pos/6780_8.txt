I play this game exactly after seeing the trailer in the old magazine advertise CD ... <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is very interesting and dark (missing in today's games / movies). The game is set somewhere in the mid-90s in the spooky mysterious villa. Games like Adam Randell and your mission is to free the soul of your father trapped by death. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the game is similar to a destiny, but it is a very different type of game. Lots of action, various puzzles, missions, mazes and many other interesting places and characters are presented in this old classic game. <br /> <br /> The game will run only on Windows 98 and there are no patches for Windows XP.
