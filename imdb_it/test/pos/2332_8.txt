Starring: Kelsey Grammar, Rob Schneider, Lauren Holly, Rip Torn This film is a family favorite classic. At least for most of my family members. One of us looks up at the mention of this film and thinks: "What a stupid movie". I'm not that person though. I still find this film very funny. I saw him again last night with someone who had never seen him before, and I laughed as loud as I ever saw him. It's still a lot of fun for me. <br /> <br /> The naval captain Tom Dodge (Grammar) is a bit of a black sheep in the navy. He's the kind of guy who will play golf while he's on a submarine, breaking a ball on a golf course as they pass by. He's the kind of guy who gets drunk, faints and wakes up with a hangover and a tattoo on the dongle. He's not the kind of guy everyone wants to be in command of a submarine. <br /> <br /> But Dodge is at the end of the line. It is put into applications to get its subtitle command several times, and if it doesn't receive a submarine this time, it's headed for a desk job, which means it's for naval life. The Admiralty decides to give him his boat, but they do not give him a new nuclear submarine. They give him a diesel submarine, an ancient relic of World War II. His mission is to clean it and take it to the Atlantic for a war game. Dodge is obviously a little frustrated to have such a crappy boat given to him when he worked so hard to get to the point that he is at, so he goes and talks with Admiral Winslow (Torn) about it. Winslow explains the purpose of the war game. Diesel submarines are still for sale in the real world, in countries like Iran, Iraq and Libya, just to name a few. Winslow wants to know what would happen if a renegade captain in a diesel submarine came to the United States and tried to smuggle a nuclear warhead into one of the bases. Would they do it? Dodge and most of the Admiralty don't think so, but Winslow wants to know for sure, so why he came up with this war game. Dodge's mission is to bring the Stingray into the sea, then try to escape the US nuclear navy and blow up American naval bases. In the simulated battle, of course. <br /> <br /> So, it's as deep as the plot. This is not a plot based movie. It's a stupid movie that's just a big gag. He makes fun of himself and is not expected to take it seriously. If you are looking for some stupid good laughs on a Friday night, I urge you to take a look. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: 3 out of 4 (worth a look)
