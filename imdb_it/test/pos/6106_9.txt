Margaret Colin is the protagonist of this story; as I watched her, I remembered her part in Adrian Lynes's "Ãœnfaithful" as the neighbor of Diane Lane in a tony New York neighborhood. <br /> <br /> This film was surprisingly good, and Diane Stillman deserves credit for an accurate portrait of class, crimes and misdeeds, which actually occur in upscale neighborhoods (perish thought !!!). It is real but not too dramatized; the public lives through its accident, the pain it caused, the denial; and the final resolution. <br /> <br /> It is more than a simple matter of "what a good person is", as Colin speaks to her husband .... is the character of a person defined by a single act; and should they be condemned forever because of their action ?? The questions are pertinent; It is also fun to see several film references to Martha Stewart (ie the fussy, annoying mother), Colin is reputed by his friends to be sometimes a "perfect hostess, with perfect geniuses" .... (gag); and a scene in which Colin is in front of the police (the "friends" betray her even later). <br /> <br /> The negation and facades of American society are addressed; (Oh, the murder does not occur here, similar to the "Season of Purgatory" theme, by author Dominick Dunne, on the real murder of Martha Moxley, in Greenwich, Connecticut); Colin is aware of his crime; but it is consciously perpetuated by the facade, until it breaks, rents or buys this film; she is an underrated actress who does quite well in these roles.
