The first creature of the 1980s concerns a long-abandoned gold mine that some intrepid miners are determined to take a look at. Of course, they don't find gold down there, but a very hungry monster that crawls in search of prey. <br /> <br /> Although I have to be honest and admit I found it boring at first (personally I prefer similar themes "The Boogens"), it actually grew on me as it went on. Now, the characters are neither too interesting nor the actors. The closest to an interesting character is Morgan, played by Keith Hurt. In any case, the female protagonist Terri Berland is quite pretty and Rolf Theison makes her bully idiot an easy person to hate. The effects writer Mark Sawicki thins quickly. <br /> <br /> It starts in a fairly predictable and comfortable way, with a night song in which two victims claim to start things in an acceptable way. The monster itself is intriguing for its design (as you can imagine, it is revealed a little at a time until late in the game) and for being the product of stop motion animation when this process has not been used much. Director Melanie Anne Phillips (director with the pseudonym of David Michael Hillman) and the crew deserve some credit for their atmosphere creation. They manage to make the film rather claustrophobic and gloomy, and their use of lighting works well. The film develops in intensity towards a rather good ending. Suffice it to say that they do the best they can with their small budget. <br /> <br /> A dark article that is worth looking for for hard horror fans. <br /> <br /> 7/10
