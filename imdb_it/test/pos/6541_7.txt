I imagine that all of us, no matter if we are car enthusiasts, love the sound of a Dodge Challenger as it growls along the road, the noise that makes a 57 Chevy as it cries out of ecstasy when it turns on a corner and, most of all, the explosion of sound like a classic vehicle explodes in flames when it explodes. I'm not the biggest car enthusiast by any imagination effort, but none of the above really makes my engine spin! The importance of cinema transport cannot be denied. It was also said that the invention of the train was one of the greatest influences on ancient cinema (looking out of a window almost like a moving film and the idea of ​​being transported to another time / space). But the car remains the most popular and the most loved, it even has its own genre: the car-car genre. A genre that focuses exclusively on the beauty of cars. In fact, it's just porn! Car porn! And I'm not talking about that rather unpleasant documentary on Channel 4 where men actually had sex with cars. Whatever floats your ... machine, I guess. Going forward ... while RUNNING ON EMPTY is not really pornographic like VANISHING POINT (Richard C. Sarafian, 1971), for example, with the close-ups of the moving car, all that is bumps and curves (!), This does not it does "I mean that the car is not the main goal of this film. In fact, the same cars become characters (we'll talk about them later). They are objectified and fetishized as much as women, indeed, maybe even more "And holy, these machines are something! Every car in this film (besides the ones in the background) are simply beautiful works of art, no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> How I was saying, these incredible cars are, in a sense, given themselves characters. Actually you start to sympathize with the car! SPOILER ?? Especially during the scene where the car is destroyed and burned SPOILER OVER. This has become almost a convention of the carsploitation genre, the wicked Plymo uth Fury from 1978 by CHRISTINE (John Carpenter, 1983), the habit of Satan Lincoln Mark III in THE CAR (Elliot Silverstein, 1977), the elegant little Mini Cooper of the film JOB (Peter Collinson, 1969) to the Volkswagen fir tree Beetle in THE LOVE BUG (Robert Stevenson, 1968) and, of course, each machine from DEATH RACE 2000 (Paul Bartel, 1975) and even WACKY RACES (1968-1970) which all had their own character. Ironically, however, this emphasis on the machine often takes (!) The human characters! And this is certainly the case with RUNNING ON EMPTY, in which only a human character (the blind character who drives his car with his hearing rather than his sight) has any kind of dimension, the rest are standard characters. These are all your stereotypical Australian teenagers of the 80s; big hair, annoying accents and none of which would have seemed out of place in NEIGHBORS, especially the Kylie Minouge look. Who cares? It's about the cars that run and crash! That's all! If you don't like it, you're really looking at the wrong genre. <br /> <br /> The car scenes are certainly the strong point of this film, and the best thing is that you go away. They are fast; very fast! And we're not talking about the rather annoying technique that some films seem to use where they record the car's acceleration at around 40 miles per hour, and then accelerate it. Oooh no! You don't do it with this movie. Are these cars zooming in at full speed in real time ?? no fancy trick here. So we have the speed. Check. And the crashes? Check, check, check! While there are no cars crashing EVERYWHERE aside from the incredibly BLUES BROTHERS (John Landis, 1980), when the cars crash into this film, they definitely crash! It would seem that they use gunpowder or something similar to build machines as a small hit and KABOOM are on fire. It reminded me of THRILLER: A CRUEL PICTURE (Bo Arne Vibenius, 1974) in this sense. <br /> <br /> Among these simply fantastic scenes (especially the beginning and the end) there are some scenes that slow everything down and, in my opinion, do not add much to the film. Note: more explosive machines are needed! However there are a couple of exceptions that are great scenes ?? SPOILER in particular the attempted rape scene. <br /> <br /> So all in all, this is a man's movie! A movie for kids! Full of vroom vrooming machines inland and a pair of tits also thrown for good measure. Would I recommend this little film to anyone, even if they are passionate cyclists (!) ?? It's a great movie that you can simply turn off your brain, sit in your leather chair and put on the whole volume! I'll give it 3.5 luvs on 5 luvs ?? Bruuuuum! P.S ?? Amazon is selling this for just over £ 2 ?? it's a real bargain even if the DVD has no special features.
