I saw it because my friend said we could try it, when my father asked if we would see him. I didn't want to because it was such an old movie, how could it be good? Finally I looked with that friend and my father. my friend and I loved the movie. the songs are fantastic, the actors were fantastic and we were crazy. I imagine this show, even if it has been Dad's time that doesn't mean it can't be a good movie. I bought the film not long after seeing it on TV, I put it up a lot and sang along with the songs. I even watched it with my classmates at my birthday party. it is a beautiful film, good and sometimes funny. <br /> <br /> If you don't try it, you can't say it's bad. even if you don't think so, I won't watch a movie from Dad's time. try the first part of the movie that you can always stop watching if you don't like it. I really recommend it, it's fantastic !!
