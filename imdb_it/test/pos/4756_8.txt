A squad of sturdy New York cops driven by the sturdy and tough Buddy Manucci (beautifully played by the ever excellent Roy Scheider), chases a bunch of ugly mobsters involved in a kidnapping ring after one of them was killed by them. The director Philip D'Antoni, the producer of "Bullet" and "The French Connection", cleverly creates a powerful, gritty, starkly amoral tone without frills, maintains a steady rhythm for everything and stages action scenes with remarkable roaring vigor. The soundtrack by Don Ellis further stimulates the intense intensity of the shot, while the very small locations of the Big Apple and the rough and grainy cinematography of Urs Furrer contribute greatly to improving the ramshackle realism. Furthermore, the thin line that distinguishes cops from criminals becomes chilling in this image: the titular team uses strong, brutal and morally dubious strong arm tactics as a means to an end to enforce the law and there is certainly no code for honor among the hooligans and thieves who populate the petty, squalid urban space that is vividly depicted in this film. Beautiful supportive interpretations by Tony Lo Bianco in the role of vice president Vito Lucia the Undertaker, Richard Lynch in the role of evil psychotherapist Moonlum Moon, Bill Hickman in the equally lunatic partner of Moon, Jerry Leon in the role of funky flatfoot Mingo and Joe Spinell as parking attendant. An extremely wild and exciting destructive car chase qualifies as a highlight. The climatic shooting also offers agitator products. A real little winner.
