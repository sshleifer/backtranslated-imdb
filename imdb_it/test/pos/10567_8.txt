This film is certainly one of the best of its kind. A love story of Victrion and grit. The depth of his plot is the one that will arouse the most intimate emotions of love, and hate, with some very interesting twists, this is a film not to be missed for not only the lesbian audience, but, for all the spectators. I can't say much more or I'll ruin the experience for a new young audience that may have just come out. Another great job for Sarah Waters. It's also a great way for Sally Hawkins to win over audiences that only have a brief look at her talent in another Sarah Waters opera, in "Tipping the Velvet" .. It's also a must see ..
