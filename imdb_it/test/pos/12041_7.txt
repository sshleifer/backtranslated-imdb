Darr was a Super Hit movie, loved by many people. It tells the story of the innocent obsession of Shahrukh Khan for Juhi, who loves Sunny Deol. Honestly it was a funny movie, but if you look closely it's not too realistic. Shahrukh Khan continues to call Juhi and tells her he loves her too much. He gives an announcement to college that he loves her and gives her some nice surprises like beautiful pictures of her. Unfortunately, instead of being flattered that a boy loves her too much, he will be very scared. I personally know hundreds of people who are frigated by someone, and these people have fun, because they play for a long time. Yash Chopra gives us a good movie that entertains, largely because of the character of Shah Rukh Khan. Sunny Deol should be the main actor, but Darr belongs to Shah Rukh Khan offering a superb performance. Shah rukh Khan is literally the villain of the movie, but I would be happy if he got the girl, because he loved her so much. Sunny Deol gives a decent performance, but he beats all those guys alone and survives a brutal knife attack. Juhi Chawla is cute as always in a pretty good performance. Some good songs including Tu mere samne is the best.
