The English are a little too wicked, the Scots are a little too heroic. The dialogue is excessively dramatic at times, and the transitions between the scenes could be more fluid. <br /> <br /> Again, "The Bruce" feels authentic, if not polished, <br /> <br /> chronology ... even if you play freely with some important <br /> <br /> facts. <br /> <br /> Sandy Welch is not Gibson or Branagh, but he is a faithful <br /> <br /> Bruce. And Brian Blessed chews the scene in a delightful rascal <br /> like Edward I. <br /> <br /> While lacking the necessary budget to make the final battle truly impressive <br /> <br /> , they have still lined up an impressive crowd for the British and Scottish armies. <br /> <br /> According to the filmmakers, it is the "largest film reconstruction of the medieval battle ever set in the <br /> British Isles". <br /> <br /> Allowing some defects and shortcomings, the film still <br /> <br /> makes a convincing portrait.
