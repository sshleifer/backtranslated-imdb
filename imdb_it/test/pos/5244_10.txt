A young heroic scout leads a great pioneer party along THE GREAT PATH to the West, with Indian attacks, natural disasters and romantic complications that are part of the adventure. <br /> <br /> As broad and magnificent as his story, THE BIG TRAIL by Raoul Walsh is a wonderful film, as much fun as it was over seventy years ago. With a very good acting and excellent production values, she lives up to her reputation as the first epic western talkie. John Wayne, pulled out of the darkness for his first major role in the film, looks incredibly young, but he immediately impresses with the natural charm and masculine authority that leads to the role of the hero; quietly dominates the film with the attributes that one day would make it a huge star. Marguerite Churchill is becoming a beautiful southern girl who slowly warms up to the attention of the duke. The El Brendel dialectal comedian is a lot of fun as a Swedish immigrant with mules and a mother-in-law; his appearance in a scene marks laughter for the viewer. <br /> <br /> Looking and sounding like a human grizzly bear, Tyrone Power Sr., vast and repulsive, is a wonderful villain. Smooth card cards Ian Keith is a sophisticated bad boy. (His famous physical resemblance to John Gilbert is very evident here.) The silent actor of the cinematic character Tully Marshall is as impressive as a clever highlander who helps drive the wagon. Corpulent Russ Powell, as a friendly trapper, puts his vocal talent to make good use of nonsensical noises. Attentive film experts will see Ward Bond as one of the Missouri settlers. <br /> <br /> What will surprise many modern viewers is that THE BIG TRAIL was shot in a large-screen process called Grandeur. More than living up to its name, the image looks wonderful, with Walsh showing the mastery of new technology. Fills the screen, every portion of it, with action. Notice during the crowd scenes, how everyone is busy doing a real job, which adds so much to the likelihood of these sequences. Walsh deserves great credit for being one of the first directors to use the big screen. Furthermore, the film is blissfully free from rear projection photography that blocks so many old movies. It should also be emphasized that it is natural that the soundtrack is a bit primitive; the talkies were still in their crib. That Walsh was able to use a microphone, with most of the scenes shot outdoors, is more an honor for him. <br /> <br /> THE BIG TRAIL was not a box office success. In the 1930s, the plays of William Haines were the great money producers and the public sought dishes different from intelligent Westerners. Most of the cast slipped into darkness, including Wayne. It would not have been until 1939, when John Ford saved him in STAGECOACH, that the John Wayne legend would begin in earnest. And despite its grandiose and expansive vistas, it would take another 25 years before the screen reached Hollywood, largely as a response to the economic threat of television.
