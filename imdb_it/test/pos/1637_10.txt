This is certainly the most tense X-Files episode of the first season. this episode is what I think when I hear "X-Files". the plot is simple but exciting. Our main cast and some scientists go to investigate an Alskan outpost where the research team seems to have killed each other. It turns out a small parasite that was unearthed by the ice, which infected the research group. The parasite attaches itself to the brain and causes paranoia and madness. Soon no one can tell who can trust or who is infected or not. <br /> <br /> This episode was a direct tribute to John Carpenters' great horror film "the THING". the Thing is set in Antarctica and a team of scientists finds a destroyed outpost in which the occupants were killed or killed. A foreigner who had been buried in the ice for 10,000 years had been thawed. It has the ability to imitate any form of life. therefore the main characters can no longer distinguish friends from enemies. <br /> <br /> Believe me The THING is one of the most exciting and tense horror movies you've ever seen. if you liked the ICE episode, I suggest you see it. Or if you've only seen WHAT, I suggest you see ICE. <br /> <br /> ICE is the best direct tribute / tribute to John Carpenter's The THING I've ever seen, and it lives up to its inspiration as the best episodes of X-Files. I give him a 10/10.
