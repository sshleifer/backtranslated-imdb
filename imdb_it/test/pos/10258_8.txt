This was the first film I ever saw in my life in 1974 or 1975. I was 4 and I saw it in a drive-in theater. I didn't realize that this would have been a classic at the time (I went to sleep for about twenty minutes in the film). After seeing it on television, along with two of my other favorite films, Car Wash (my favorite movie) and The Wiz that seemed to come together more or less the same time every year - about 40, 50, 75 times I knew that here it was a movie I would have had as one of my favorites. Those three films were the only live shows I could see as a child. <br /> <br /> I would not consider this film blaxploitation but rather a film of urban interest. Cochise and Preach reminded me of some of my uncles, particularly Wild Irish Rose, who drank. My mother also told me about some of the parties in the neighborhood she attended and that some of the things that happened in the film were similar in nature to what happened in real life. If you are one of two or three blacks over thirty who have not yet seen this movie, I suggest you buy the DVD right now. I'm glad to have been around to watch some of the events of the time.
