I can't explain it, but I find this film not only funny, but so enjoyable that I feel compelled to watch it over and over again, or at least I did it when I had cable TV. I always thought it was a really bad film, but maybe it's because I saw it on cable. I plan to get a DVD of this film to give an honest look, but above all to have fun watching it. I liked the plot and the idea of ​​the film and I particularly liked the cast. I always wonder if the cast has enjoyed making the films they are in and this is no exception. This film deserved a better fate than the one received and Kelsey Grammar deserved at least one love scene with Mrs. Holly. Who wouldn't do it? The characters in this film were the kind of guys I could identify with when I was in the army and laziness was right. Beautiful troops underway.
