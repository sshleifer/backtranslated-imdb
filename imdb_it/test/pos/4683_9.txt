I really liked the movie. Everything in The Italian Job is simple. An explosive guy, a secure cracker, a computer genius, a wheel man and a man with a spectacular 35-million-dollar theft plan without using a gun. This movie is fun even if it doesn't have a central idea. It is a non-stop film with many actions. All the stunt work is great. From the motorboat chase in Venice to the beginning in pursuit on the busy streets of Los Angeles involving three mini coopers and even a helicopter. The best chase I've ever seen. I like mini coopers. Experienced thieves used mini coopers for escape cars. The chase between the mini coopers and the bikes is fantastic. They chased underground. I can say that there was not a moment that I was bored. Mark Wahlberg (Charlie Croker), Charlize Theron (Stella Bridger), Donald Sutherland (John Bridger), Jason Statham (Handsome Rob), Seth Green (Lyle), Mos Def (Left Ear) and Edwin Norton (Steve) really made a good job. I like actors in this movie. I've seen a lot of robbery films but The Italian Job and it's one of my favorites. A great Hollywood action movie without a drop of blood. After all, I love this kind of film.
