It was nice to see John Denver again even though it was several years ago. I found this film very moving and a great film to sit by the fire on a cold winter night that reminds me of Christmas. The scenes in Georgetown, Colorado, have been magnificent and make you want to move there immediately. While I sit here in my mountain seen in California, I loved the story and the plot. I hope everyone who sees this film a little older will appreciate it as much as my mother and I do. Merry Christmas! A great film for the whole family too. Enoy and tell it to others. Thanks for the memories. We need more movies like this to come out of Hollywood.
