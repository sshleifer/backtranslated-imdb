I loved this show. I was waiting for it to come out on DVD ... it never had. Does anyone know how to get the show available on DVD? I contacted Lifetime TV and some others and nothing. Please let me know if there is a way we can have this series on DVD. I would be the first in line to buy it. I really enjoyed this show. I don't understand how a lot of other TV shows are available on DVD but not on any day. I'm sure there are many of us out there who would like to have this series on DVD or even VHS. I thought of contacting the production company. Has anyone else tried to contact someone for this information?
