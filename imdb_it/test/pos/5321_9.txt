I noticed that the official IMDb review refers to Leland as a sociopath. I believe this diagnosis is manifestly and profoundly incorrect. <br /> <br /> This is a film about sadness and the ability of a particular teenager to see sadness in everyday life, while lying in ambush around every corner, ahead of the lives of the lives it impacts. A sociopath is a person who cannot empathize with others and who, while understanding the difference between right and wrong, does not care about this difference. A sociopath is a subject who places himself at the center of the universe of that subject, with total disregard for the impact that the subject's actions have on those around him. One of the distinguishing features of a sociopath is that a true sociopath lacks the ability to feel empathy - he lacks the ability to feel what others feel and does not relate changes in the moods of others as a result of that sociopath's actions with those Actions. A sociopath cannot feel the pain of others, or understand that the pain of others is the result of the very actions of the sociopath. A sociopath is a person who is not fully formed. A vital piece is missing from the psychological and emotional composition of a true sociopath, making the sociopathic immune to "talking therapy" and other treatment modalities that involve human interaction and the exploration of personal feelings. Sociopathy is devastating, even when the subject is treated and placed in a highly structured environment aimed at containing the damage that the sociopath can do to others. Many sociopaths work more or less normally and never make their way onto the radar of the criminal justice system, although they tend to leave a trail of emotional debris in their wake. <br /> <br /> Leland Fitzgerald is not a sociopath. He is a person who is blessed (or cursed) with the ability to foresee what he considers the consequences and inevitable outcomes of human interactions. Leland literally sees the sadness in the eyes and faces of the people around him, as he slowly assimilates and internalizes the philosophy that life is a loss and people slowly succumb to the inevitable and inexorable fact that, for lack of a better metaphor , things fall apart. People who fall in love and kiss and cuddle today are transformed into "pathetic" elderly couples. Electricity in the eyes of Leland's "mother" (a rich New York socialite who loves Leland and who invites him into the house she shares with her family when she arrives in New York, alone and determined to stay in the city at the age of 12 years) fades as she explains to him, during the last of his visits to New York, that he learned that her husband has always betrayed her, that she got a divorce, that having a broken heart happens to everyone, and that such loss is an inevitable part of growth. His eyes still reflect light, but the electricity that once illuminates them has disappeared. This scene - this explanation, late is coming - is crucial to understanding why Leland commits an apparently savage and senseless crime (killing the retarded younger brother of his ex-girlfriend). Leland knows what awaits us for this little boy - a life of unattainable goals, of being taught only words that indicate danger, of never knowing the love of another human being, of never experiencing such love and never connecting with another person. More than any other character in this film, this kid personifies all that Leland considers inevitable and terrifying for the world. Leland's act - to kill this boy - is, for Leland, an act of mercy, committed because this was the only thing he could DO in a world where actions cannot change results. While a true sociopath knows that actions can and do change results but does not care about the damage inflicted on others by those actions, Leland worries. What most people consider a barbaric and horrible act is, in Leland's eyes, the only decent thing he can do to alleviate the suffering of one person. <br /> <br /> It would be comforting to be able to present this as an explanation of Leland's actions - comforting but incomplete. In the end, the "blame" for Leland's actions lies elsewhere. As often happens, there are no easy explanations and balm to apply to the outraged soul. Why hasn't Leland learned something that even the most pessimistic people usually recognize - that sometimes - just sometimes - people MUST stay in love and that relationships succeed and that even the saddest lives are transformed? For Leland, there is no middle ground, no inner core to which he can retreat and reorganize. There is only pain and sadness. It is tempting to blame his arrogant and unpleasant father - the brilliant writer (played by Kevin Spacey) - for not having been there at critical moments during Leland's development, but given that man's wickedness, that may have been a blessing . br /> <br /> In the end, this viewer was moved by a tremendous sense of sadness. Why was Leland condemned to see the world through a veil of pessimism and depression? There is a maturity in the character of Leland - present, for example, when he repeatedly insists that no one is to blame for the rupture of his girlfriend with him - which is both stoic and heartbreaking. Stoic, in the sense that it is absolutely genuine, despite the heated complaints of Leland's teacher. But heartbreaking, as it arises not so much from understanding as from despair. Leland's indifference to his destiny is only a reflection of the total certainty of his belief that nothing is really important. Nothing he does can change his destiny. <br /> <br /> This is not the sociopathy on show. This is, if anything, its polar opposite ......
