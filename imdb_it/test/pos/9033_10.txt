I'm not a fan of Faulkner (which is considered sacrilegious, especially since I grew up near the author's hometown); however, I think this is an excellent film. On par with the quality of the film "To Kill a Mocking Bird". If you haven't seen it, buy it anyway. It's worth having in your permanent collection. TCM recently starred in the film as part of the Race on Film series. I would like them to play it more often. Very moving. <br /> <br /> In a side note, the people of Oxford, Mississippi, will also enjoy watching the town square footage as it was in the 1940s. The Courthouse, City Hall, etc.: they are all on the screen. I never knew the film was shot there until I noticed the familiarity of the buildings. When I saw the arch in the front of the town hall, I started to get suspicious. Look closely at the pennants on Chick's wall: you'll see two for Ole Miss!
