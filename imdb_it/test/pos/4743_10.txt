The things that are just now "news" have been taken as a given in this shocking documentary. I fear that as the investigation proceeds, the producers of this film will be avenged in spades. <br /> <br /> The producers show us the Davidians, government agents, investigators, with all their flaws and all their humanity. Nothing a reviewer can say could approach the impact of looking and listening to yourself. Test pieces - Congress testimony, 911 tapes, news footage, expert commentary, interviews, photos and home videos - are seamlessly interwoven and tell a disturbing story. <br /> <br /> Don't wait. Watch this movie and tell your friends.
