This is a classic that will be able to keep up with the dramas to come simply because it was shot in a 70s style and is a story from the 70s. It's fun, full of action, fun and sad at the same time. It has the effect of dragging you into the lives of these poor people and the consequences for their actions. 4 STARS!
