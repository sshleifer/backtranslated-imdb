While the Muppet movies go, this is easily and clearly the best. It features a lot of cameos of great comic stars of the time, a solid screenplay and some great Disney songs, and mixes them together in the culmination of Henson's best show performance. The plot is basic and the jokes are on many levels to entertain both adults and children to whom it has been marketed, without exposing them to the ideologies that their parents might not find desirable. <br /> <br /> This is simply fun, but it is also a well-made classic, well written, beautifully captivating. <br /> <br /> Evaluate an 8.9 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
