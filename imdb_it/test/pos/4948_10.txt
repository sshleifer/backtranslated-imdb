This was a fantastic movie with incredibly realistic flight scenes! I saw it several times and kept my attention at all times. I'm a big Air Force fan myself and I love watching any movie where I can take a look at a flying F-16. If you like Top Gun, then I guarantee you will love this movie too. Except for some minor curse, this is an excellent film for the whole family. He has a fantastic plot and doesn't have a dull moment for the whole movie. Every second is full of action and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next. So once again I highly recommend this movie !!!
