I don't know why people consider it trashy or hateful; It's not like American Pie or something. I don't know why people are offended by the Universal plugs; since it is part of the plot, advertising is excusable. <br /> <br /> This is a funny film with a good dialogue, a good subtle intelligence, a good story, a good moral (which fortunately does not become too sloppy), BIG acting, and a cheese ending. <br /> <br /> (small spoiler) The basic premise is the classic story of a little shepherd (Muniz) who lies so much that no one believes him when the wolf (Giamatti) arrives. So he gets his best friend Kaylee (Bynes) and they go to drive the Wolf crazy. <br /> <br /> Frankie Muniz can be annoying in other roles, but not like Jason Shepherd. He perfectly manages the gentle reserve of his character, and what at first appears to be a lack of expression is actually a perfectly executed nonchalance. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes. What else can I say? The girl has the gift. It's fun, talented, versatile and very, very attractive. (I'm only 6 months older than her. I have to go to California very soon.) In fact, the "best friend" part was originally a boy, but she became a girl as soon as the producers saw Amanda's interest. Which works pretty well, as the part would have been pretty boring without the blessing of Bynes' skills. <br /> <br /> Paul Giamatti is a very talented man. While some played Marty Wolf as diabolical and diabolical, Giamatti did it - not just an idiot, mind you, but a LIKEABLE jerk, an idiot who enlivens the screen, rather than intentionally darkening it. And I doubt that many other actors could bring out the psychological collapse that Wolf also suffers. <br /> <br /> All in all, great movie. I liked seeing Jaleel White able to make fun of himself. I liked seeing all the little references and so incorporated into the film. (one of the guests in the party scene is the director, Shawn Levy, another is Bynes' former co-star, Kenan Thompson) I loved seeing Amanda in those clothes ........ Take the DVD if you can . It has a lot of extra things and the beautiful Mrs. Bynes is your guide through the menus. :)
