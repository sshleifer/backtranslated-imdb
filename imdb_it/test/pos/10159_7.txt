I hate to admit it, but I didn't find it to be one of Hitchcock's best, but still an exciting climate thriller. In a remake of the 1934 Hitchock film of the same title, Dr. Ben McKenna (James Stewart) ?? the man who knows too much - and his wife Jo McKenna (Doris Day) are on vacation in Morocco with their son Hank (Christopher Oslen) when there is a case of wrong identity and caught in the network of a murder plot. The conspirators do everything to stop them from interfering with their plot: they kidnap their beloved Hank. I found it surprising that Doris Day, who usually associates with Rock Hudson comedies, was chosen for a Hitchcock movie. While I was watching, I immediately realized that it was a family movie compared to Hitchcock's other works (for example: Psycho) and that he had the ability to sing necessary for "Que Sera Sera," which he did magnificently. She was as well launched as she and James Stewart had a chemistry, which helped make the couple credible. <br /> <br /> In comparison to the other works of the great director I believe that it is not so good, but it is nevertheless a fun family / mystery thriller. There is also the added bonus of Que Sera Sera, which turned out to be a great success for Doris Day. Well directed, well acted. A nice movie.
