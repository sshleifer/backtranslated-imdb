First of all, those who are weak at heart should definitely avoid this movie. Even those, like me, who are desensitized for most of the sexually violent and sexual acts in movies should be careful. I'm not telling you to get away from the movie, but know that what you're about to see is a disturbing material. Surely it is not a pleasant film to look at, but nothing is put on the screen strictly for the value of the shock. But I have to admit that when I saw the movie for the second time, I had to skip to the next chapter when the "razor scene" arrived. <br /> <br /> The main character is one of the most sympathetic and understanding characters I can think of, but we begin to better understand the humanity of his character later in the second act of the film. In one scene, she shoves the broken glass into a pocket of her student's jacket after being dissatisfied with her seemingly unsatisfactory performance and becoming nervous in front of a live audience. The student enters his pocket and cries out in pain as he stares at his bloodstained hand. Next to the razor blade scene, this disturbed me the most. The student's mother is not much nicer than her. When he receives the news that his daughter will not be able to play, he talks about it as if he also had his wounded hand, being one of those spoiled mothers trying to torture his daughter to become an overachiever. <br /> <br /> Although the film intrigued me and aroused my interest for the most part, I felt more need to be explained about the character of Isabelle Huppert. When a woman is fascinated by sadomasochistic porn movies and engages in that same behavior, you want to understand the root of the problem. The film states that he desperately wants to be loved. So why the hateful attitude towards everyone? Why receive sexual pleasure from pain? <br /> <br /> The acting is exceptional and I liked the shiny and stylized lighting. Overall, it's not a movie I'd recommend if you're in the mood to have fun, but like I said it's very intriguing. And I'm sure that if I had looked at it some other time, I would have been able to identify some subtleties that will shed more light on aspects of the film that I didn't initially realize. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
