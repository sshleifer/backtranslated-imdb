One way or another, you can't get away from the basic message. The strong survive. Those who are psychologically or emotionally sensitive go away. They leave a hole in the lives of those who love them. A hole that is seen in its purpose as selfish. This is what Phoebe finally understands. Just before helping Wolf recover from his self-blame. You can accept the closure of the missing ... of your sister. Beautiful European scenery. A lot of truth about idealism and dependence on the next big moment. For a moment, I thought of the Baader-Meinhoff band that was in the early 1970s. I liked this film because it reflected a time when I came of age.
