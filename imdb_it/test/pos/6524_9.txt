Fans of apocalyptic films will savor this well-made low-budget thriller that is essentially a remake of the 1951 George Pal classic "When Worlds Collide". A comet is headed for a near-earth collision, and when his fellow scientists ignore his warnings of destruction, eccentric scientist Peter Crawford (Dennis Hopper) brings together a group of private investors to secretly build an underground sanctuary. <br /> <br /> The story develops through the eyes of Gulf War veteran Jake Lowe (Peter Onorati) who inadvertently discovers Crawford's hidden sanctuary and decides that Crawford is wrong to keep his project hidden from the rest humanity. As the comet approaches, the subject of who should live and who should die makes it interesting for the drama. <br /> <br /> While the special effects are not in the same league, I liked the story more than Spielberg's War of the worlds did, because I feel this script is better. A suspension of scientific reality is necessary, but it is useful for the development of a good story. I highly recommend this movie to fans of the genre.
