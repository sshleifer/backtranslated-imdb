This show is actually pretty good. Like all the shows on TV, it has its good episodes and the bad ones. <br /> <br /> I read where people compare this show with Married with Children, and I suppose it's a similar show for the new generation. However, due to what was expected and allowed on TV at the time of Married with Children, the show was taken to extremes to show that it was actually a TV show, and didn't want to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> The War at Home has the luxury of being a little more realistic. Parents talk to each other like real life parents often do, telling their children something, when they turn around and do the opposite. <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the contents may be considered controversial. But I find that this show really tries to maintain a sense of honesty. Like it or not, there are many families out there just like this. <br /> <br /> Each episode teaches a "valuable lesson". It's just that sometimes the lesson is that you won't find a perfect solution to every problem that a family can encounter, and sometimes the solution is to choose the lesser of two evils. We all know that, in some cases, as a parent, the only goal you can have is to keep children out of trouble, and hope they learn from good. <br /> <br /> I respect the writers for trying to keep the show true to life, instead of having a magical ending like the Cleaver family has always had.
