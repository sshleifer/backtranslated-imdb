This is one of the many Techno-phobic films that sprouted like mushrooms in the mid-1990s, after the Internet became mainstream. <br /> <br /> Hollywood movies have always had their way in "beautifying" the images represented, making them look better and more attractive. The same happens when Hollywood tries to show us some hi-tech. The outcome of these attempts varies from being very far-fetched and ridiculous (see Hackers (1995), Johnny Mnemonic (1995), etc.) to be quite realistic (see Sneakers (1992)). <br /> <br /> "The Net" is located halfway between these two extremes. With the fussy, you can end up with a lot of technical inconsistencies, and many cases where the expenses seem to be much more "sexy" and graphic than things are in real life (as usually happens in movies). br /> <br /> However, by simply neglecting those, the viewer ends up with a fairly solid and fun movie. The characters and the acting are convincing and the film does a good job of keeping you in your place until the end. The plot is fine (a fairly standard version, based on good old paranoid design, but with a hi-tech touch this time), and quite convincing (again, ignoring technical problems). The development of the plot is a bit slow, though, and from time to time you can anticipate some seemingly surprising turns in the plot. <br /> <br /> The bonus here is the cutie-pie Sandra Bullock, who besides being pretty (something she does quite easily, apparently), also portrays a solid act. You can really feel his character - his despair, his emotions. <br /> <br /> In the end line, the film is fun and interesting, with a value of about 7 out of 10 on my scale. It's worth renting from the video library, or even watching the cinema. Whether to buy it or not depends on you.
