One of my favorite movies. Big cast, led by Jonathan Silverman and Blythe Danner. Dramatic situations serious with brilliant comic fists. An exact mixture of character and history. Real people with real problems, and everyone has a different relationship with each family member. Sensitive moves from slightly sad to hilarious-fun. Read the quotation marks. This is the best adaptation of a Neil Simon reproduction. <br /> <br /> If you want to see more of Eugene, check out Biloxi Blues (played by Matthew Broderick who played in both versions of the scene) is OK, a little darker. Get away from the Broadway Bound made-for-TV.
