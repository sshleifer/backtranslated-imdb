The crew of an American submarine discovers that it is HELL BELOW while fighting in the Adriatic in 1918. <br /> <br /> Although almost forgotten, this excellent war movie still offers solid entertainment, thanks to a literal script, performances superior and very believable action scenes. <br /> <br /> Robert Montgomery and Walter Huston play aboard submarines under the stress of war, which are quickly at odds with each other, with dramatic and tragic results. Because Montgomery is in love with Huston's daughter, Madge Evans in a well-interpreted role, the situation becomes even more complicated, both on land and under the waves. The viewer is divided between the two strong characters, one of whom is governed by his heart and the other by rules. <br /> <br /> Robert Young makes an effective appearance as a friend of Montgomery. Sterling Holloway creates a short, vivid portrait of a doomed sailor. <br /> <br /> Eugene Pallette in the role of the torpedo master and Jimmy Durante while the submarine cook makes a very funny comedy and provides the story with many laughs. During Durante's nose comes a lot of ribs and his obsession with amateur dentistry leads to some chaotic encounters with British tars. <br /> <br /> Film stars will recognize Babe London as an obese Italian lady; Maude Eburne as wife of a British admiral and Paul Porcasi as Italian admiral - all uncredited. <br /> <br /> MGM has given the film first-class production values, with particularly well-produced underwater sequences. Both the ship's claustrophobic compactness and the inevitable tension associated with submarine warfare are accurately represented. Other moments of unexpected drama (Montgomery and Miss Evans caught on a Ferris wheel blocked during an aerial bombardment) and hilarity (During a kangaroo's boxing) are cleverly tucked into the plot of the film to offer a totally satisfying viewing experience.
