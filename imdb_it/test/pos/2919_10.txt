Being a fan of everything that is Egyptian, this is a classic from the 50s, along with my other favorite, Land of the Fharaohs. "The sets and colors are simply wonderful and everything looks so" clean "in the quality of the production. Victor Mature was cast and Peter Ustinov a real gem! The whole aspect of the film (along with others made in this era) has a charm that you don't get with modern movies with all their digitized effects (I still have to watch the 1999 movie "The Mummy" but I'm sure I'll love it!). <br /> <br /> Top stuff!
