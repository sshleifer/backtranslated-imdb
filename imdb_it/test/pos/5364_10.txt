An excellent film for those who simply need to switch off and enjoy the beautiful scenery of Scotland. Based on the facts, the film takes you on a journey of love in a spectacular setting. The cast is "dressed" for the parts they play, so no glamorous costumes or combed hair in this film in which acting is superb, gritty and down to earth. Each character is believable giving a convincing portrait of the life of the island, of the beliefs and culture of time A defined for those who also have the smallest drop of Scottish blood ..... how will the strings of the heart be tugged and awaken the soul. Something that can be shared with the family and looked over and over again .................. a true classic, one that I'm sure will walk along with some of the great movies that ever to die.
