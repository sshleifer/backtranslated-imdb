As if the reality show like "American Idol" wasn't enough, in which judges like Simon Cowell throw razor-sharp beards at competitors trying to make their mark in the music world - smears that have often reduced even exceptional singers to tears after what has been considered a "bad show", now "America's Next Top Model" has invaded the tube in the last three years with its version of "looking for the next big thing" in a company that values ​​superficiality, concepts of beauty and body dysmorphism. <br /> <br /> A concept created by Tyra Banks, who is also a show judge, brings together about fifteen competitors from all walks of life and has them subjected to countless "tasks" in which they must demonstrate their "talent" in front of the camera and subject themselves not only to the now-defunct Janice Dickinson (self-nicknamed "American's First Supermodel"), but also to the gloomy Jay Manuel and Nore Marin who at one point could concentrate on a girl does not perform well and cheerfully shreds like an ugly morning coffee. Like many other reality shows, a competitor is eliminated every week and has to pack up and leave immediately (which Tyra reminds him of every turn). Of course, there is the bitchy tension between many of the more feminine of type A, the feminine bond, the tears, the dramatic sounds of music in key moments and some truly breathtaking images that transform the former ordinary, beautiful girls into unattainable goddesses. > <br /> I have to admit, the show is a guilty pleasure. Maybe it's the state of mind I am in, but I kept wondering where the vomit was in cases where the already thin girls would have to throw them to make the cut and look in the way the judges, photographers and many designers fickle would have felt right for the moment. Even so, it attracted me despite my previous paragraph, perhaps because I've always had an interest in the fashion world and I've always loved watching wonderful women being made even more worldly by makeup and perfect lighting. But I wonder where they are going with these increasingly difficult photo shoots. It's like they're in competition with "Fear Factor". Shots that look like re-enactments of combat scenes in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, shoot where the models have to pose underwater or in almost impossible situations, What's next: posing while tied to the tracks while an incoming Amtrak roars on them at 70 miles an hour? Or a shot in which they are underwater, chained, trying to break free in a record time and at the same time looking at the shattered chiffon, and never, never forgetting to smile at their pearly whites with that camera? How about a "Pit and the Pendulum" version of a photo shoot? <br /> <br /> In one thing the show must be complimented, and is somewhat similar to "American Idol". This will probably help justify the harshness of both shows, and his judging judges - and I will basically go against my initial paragraph. "America's Next Top Model" is a show that is an extended audition, like "American Idol", and in it the girls will receive the kind of trial treatment they will receive in the real world, where potential designers and photographers, as monstrously fickle as may be, they will smash them to pieces at the drop of a hat if they can't sell themselves the way you expect, and where one is asked to leave, another will displace it with the necessary requirements. Which is surprising that any girl would like to get into such a difficult media, but it's what dreams are made of. <br /> <br /> Entering his fifth season was a great disappointment for the departure of Janice Dickinson; during his run he was a pretty hard barometer about how girls should walk, talk, emulate, express themselves and eventually present themselves as a living, living product that sells. With the cool addition of Twiggy I wonder where it will go from here - Twiggy cannot simply replace Dickinson's exaggerated temper. So with the absence of Janice, the show lost some of its edge and may even have signaled its slow disappearance, but in the meantime, it's still a catchy pleasure to watch, carefree entertainment on weekdays, if at all for beautiful images. If it's for nothing, it's the show that launched Adrienne Curry in the spotlight. Curry has made a name for herself because of facts that have less to do with modeling than her theatrical love affair with former child actor Christopher Knight in their reality soap opera.
