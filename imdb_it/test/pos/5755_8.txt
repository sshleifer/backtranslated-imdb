This is a gem of a movie, Slapstick violence a-plenty, Simon pegg and Green Spew. <br /> <br /> A suspicious-looking cyclist and an uncontrollable bike join this stoner. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it, maybe not quite as good as below but not far away. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen a man impaled by his nose on two hooks then what are you waiting for buy this movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't even see the turning point at the end when it turns out that Ritchie and Eddie are both ghosts. <br /> <br /> Feeb - 1 boiled egg.
