You can find a declaration against the war here without seeming too difficult; that layer is minced. Or you can find a neutral comment on the madness of the war (stripped of the "judgment"); that level is not at all interesting. <br /> <br /> Or you can watch this for the good entertainment value of Duvall's one-liners, but this is just a coating for commercial chewing. <br /> <br /> You can try to see this as a "realistic" Vietnam War movie, but ask any veteran and he will break down this notion - most veterinarians will say it stinks. <br /> <br /> Either you see it as a "he" or you won't play morality - nothing rich even there. <br /> <br /> Where I found the value was in the superb self-reference. Coppola needed a large enough container (the war) to adapt to the greatness of the multidimensional actor who played "a great man". <br /> <br /> Brando the man was as much a non-conformist as the Kurtz character. His studies were uncomfortable with his "method" of acting, yet he has always excelled and won recognition; the "generals" are uncomfortable with Kurtz's "wrong methods" despite his strategic genius. <br /> <br /> So Coppola makes a film about Brando's greatness. To beat the point, he positions himself in the film (like Hopper, a manic photojournalist full of multiple cameras) to unleash his praise. Brando himself can only be seen in the shadows and in the shapes: a brilliant photograph of Storaro that only increases the actor's power. And it comes out as the sacrificial bull to complete the narrative equation. Oh, yes: "the horror ..." <br /> <br /> Other pieces of interest: the great use of the perspectives of the camera of the point of view, including "being in the firefight" long before " Private Ryan "; the innovative use of sound, in particular the left sweeps and the sound representation of an acid journey. <br /> <br /> Don't get caught in the outer layers; the rich part from which you should strip yourself is the brilliant core of sound, vision and self-reference.
