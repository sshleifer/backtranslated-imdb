This is an incredibly fun 80s action / exploitation. Charles Bronson rules like Paul Kirsey. The bad guys are hilarious. The soundtrack by Jimmy Page is ridiculously bad. Alex Winter (Bill of Bill & Ted) is exceptional as one of the street punks that is wasted by Bronson and the crew. Crew? Oh, those are the oppressed citizens who join Bronson to reclaim the streets. The entire film is enjoyable, with the last half hour or so almost exploding into endless action and chaos. 9/10
