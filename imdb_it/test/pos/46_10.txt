I saw this movie most nights that he was on HBO. It is my opinion that he could have succeeded in the theater, provided that the advertising that led to it was of excellent quality. I was really impressed by the actress who played Nanny. She is an exceptional actress. Of course, my favorite actor is Terrance Howard. He is a very discreet actor and deserves much more credit than he received. The Ebony magazine has done a nice article about him, giving him some of his weak propolis. Lakawanna Blue gave me an understanding of the stories my parents use to tell us. They came from a similar city, "Philadelphia, PA", where they had to have fun in hunting joints and so on. I also like to say that Mos Def is an incredible actor. He found his vocation. I saw him in several movies where he played a series of roles, from hooligan to doctor and he has things! Overall, please put Lakawanna Blues on video for rental.
