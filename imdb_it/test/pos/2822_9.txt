I'm surprised by some comments on this site because I really enjoyed this movie. If you're looking for something different, this movie is a good choice. Surely it's not your typical nonsensical story that seems to be everywhere starring Ben Idiot Affleck or some other Hollywood loser. It is an intellectual film, in reality you have to pay attention so that some people could be turned off. However, if you are looking for something that keeps you in hand, this is a good choice. Beware of parents - it has some pretty graphic sex scenes so watch it when the children are in bed. People who like European films will appreciate this. Adam Sandler fans should skip it because it will be over their heads and definitely NOT their style.
