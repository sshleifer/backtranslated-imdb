A fantastic film with a great Australian talent. Director Mark Lamprell dealt with potentially hiccup topics in a way that was humorous and refreshing. Definitely the highlight of the Brisbane Film Festival of 2000. A veteran of Australian cinema, Sam Neill was, as always, fabulous in the role of Frank's university and the new talent Matt Newton gave a performance that will see people say " you know, Bert Newton, Matt's dad! " Go out and watch this movie !!!
