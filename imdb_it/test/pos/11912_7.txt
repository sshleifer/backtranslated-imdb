I'm sure the film contains certain gaps in logic, but I was so fascinated that I really didn't care. The film presents itself as a fun, carefree fun for teen combined with an action movie like Schwarzenegger. It is full of action, full of emotions and also has fun moments. Sean Astin is fun to watch, and I haven't seen Louis Gossett, Jr. since I saw "Diggstown" in theaters. He is a refined and underrated actor and I love watching him on the screen. I just wonder what he's doing now. Unfortunately, he could be the star of many of these video-directed films. I hope my hypothesis is wrong. However, this is a fun thriller on the edge of your seat and I definitely recommend trying it out. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
