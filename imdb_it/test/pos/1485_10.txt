The 1990s were a great decade for the British sitcom with many popular creations like ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE, THE ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS THE THIN BLUE LINE, THE BRITTAS EMPIRE and MEN BEHAVING BADLY coming to television screens for the first time. <br /> <br /> However, MR. BEAN is, without a doubt, the largest sitcom of the 90s. <br /> <br /> MR. BEAN represents the first major attempt to return to the era of the silent great as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton for several decades. Brings to the audience a single character - Mr. Bean - played to perfection by Rowan Atkinson. <br /> <br /> Many people who have commented on this page and the message boards of this and other websites have engaged in debates about whether Mr. Bean has a mental disability or has significant learning difficulties resulting from this disability. However, I believe this debate is not necessary because I strongly doubt that the creators of this show expected anyone in the audience to even consider Mr. Bean in such a context for a moment. <br /> <br /> It is said that Bean is a character who seems to have very few friends, rarely speaks and chooses to solve problems on his own without the guidance of others. Some of his methods for dealing with everyday activities such as preparing lunch or going to the dentist are oddly approached to anyone watching the show. Hence the humor. Mr. Bean is not necessarily someone with a mental disability, he could just be an eccentric person accustomed to dealing with things his own way. And of course some of his methods for completing a single activity often result in disaster, which we will then see Mr. Bean try to solve. <br /> <br /> Sometimes we see Mr. Bean showing a petty or mean streak, often trying to compete with those around him or making jokes to those who least expect it. But in the end there will be no real damage and the results are always reassuring. <br /> <br /> Unlike most examples of British comedy in the last 30 years, MR. BEAN is a simple, harmless and harmless entertainment suitable for all tastes of the family. This is why the TV series has become a big hit in dozens of countries around the world. It is also the reason why it will be remembered in several decades since many other television programs will have come, gone and forgotten. <br /> <br /> Some critics claim that the show is aimed only at children, but I just laugh so much at Mr. Bean's antics now as when I saw the boyish episodes in the 90s. Rowan Atkinson used her natural ability to create effective visual gags that seem just as fun in repeated visualizations as they did for the first time. <br /> <br /> The TV series gave rise to two spin-off films, BEAN and SIG. BEAN FEAST. As you'd expect to know the kind of humor shown in the TV series, it doesn't translate to a big screen success. The two films do little justice to the TV series and fail to really capture the magic of the episodes. Perhaps the biggest failure in both films lies in the change in setting. In both films, the producers bring Mr. Bean out of his normal British environments in America (the first film) and in France (the second film). As a result, the characters in the movie around Mr. Bean respond differently to his behavior than their TV series counterparts. Both films re-use the TV series gags, and evidence shows that the gags were done well the first time. In the second movie, we see that Mr. Bean is acting out of the character with some aspects of his personality exaggerated to the point that some gags seem mute rather than amusing. On several occasions, I found myself thinking that the character I was looking at was not Mr. Bean but a pale caricature. It is clear that Rowan Atkinson was not enjoying himself as much as in the TV series. His heart was not in the show. After the second film came out, he publicly stated that he would no longer play Mr. Bean. I realize how he felt. <br /> <br /> Returning to the TV series, each episode shows evidence of meticulous planning in terms of writing and execution in every single scene. Even the weakest episode is still very enjoyable and well ahead of the two films. <br /> <br /> My favorite episodes are the first three: they set the high standard that was to continue. I consider the final episode as the weakest but still hilarious. <br /> <br /> In summary, MR. BEAN is a truly superb sitcom suitable for the whole family. Rowan Atkinson is a true comic genius and the proof is in the 14 episodes of this TV series. My recommendation: look and have fun. But watch the movies only if you consider yourself a huge fan after watching the TV series.
