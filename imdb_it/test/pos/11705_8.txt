This is the first feature film by Australian comedian Mick Molloy. Mick wrote the film with his brother Richard with the help of John Clarke, another comedian and actor. Mick & John also have leading roles alongside many other iconic Australian actors: Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson and others. The film's basic premise is that the slimy Jack Simpson (Mick Molloy) became a member of a Lawn Bowls Club for the sole purpose of getting free parking near his work. The Club is in serious financial difficulties and calls Jack to help. John Clarke plays the circle of archers - he is trying to take the club and turn it into a "Slot Machine Poker" Jack and the other members of the club come together to try to save the club with lots of fun twists and redemption of Jacks . This is a nice smart movie. It is well above Mick Molloys, the usual bumpy humor. It is quite well written and well acted. The old Australian actors are brilliant (Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson, Monica Maughan and ors). The film turns rather forward and then goes to breakup rhythm, but this adds charm to the film. There is a low-level vulgar language.
