Being a college freshman, this film reminded me of my relationship with my mother. Of course, my situation does not coincide with the situation of Natalie Portman and Surandon; but my mother and I grew up with the typical battles between mother and daughter. There is always the mother telling you what to do, or not being the kind of mother you want to be. I was swinging my eyes at the end of this movie. Surandon's reaction to his daughter going to the east coast, miles away, after all they had been through, reminded me how I felt, coming from a small town on the west coast, going to New York. <br /> <br /> The film is designed for women who have children who are now all grown up. It's very moving, I was touched by the movie. Every feeling of the characters in this movie was absolutely real, you didn't receive any false sentimentality. I was sitting through the end credits at the screening of this film, alone, wishing that my mother was sitting next to me so I could hug her and thank her for everything. This film is a bit trivial, of course, but everything is really memorable. It's all about what a mom can learn from her child; and what a child learns from his mother. 8/10
