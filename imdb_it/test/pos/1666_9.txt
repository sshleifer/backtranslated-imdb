I heard they were going to redo this French classic in 2007, and I see that it is under development for 2011. This will be a shame, as Hollywood has ousted writer / director Jules Dassin because of the infamous blacklist. They should not have the right to redo any of his films. <br /> <br /> I love movies of "capers" and "film noir", and this combines the best of both. <br /> <br /> Tony (Jean Servais) comes out after making a nickle, and after having beaten his old girlfriend (Marie Sabouret), plans a great success with his friends Mario (Robert Manuel) and Jo (Carl MÃ¶hner), What makes this a great caper glance is the attention to detail in planning the robbery. You see it reflected in the capers of George Clooney Vegas. Nothing is left to chance. <br /> <br /> The caper is fine but Grutter (Marcel Lupovici) sends his sons, Robert Hossein and Pierre Grasset after Tony and the band. After blowing it with Mario, they kidnap Jo's son. A lot of bullets fly before it's over. <br /> <br /> A great film by a great director. The standard by which other caper films are measured.
