I just saw the movie, actually it's pretty good. The trailers left me with the impression of yet another Dujardin one-man-show-turned-film (at the end of Nice) or an expensive, stupid French comedy. Surprisingly, it is neither one nor the other. The secret agent OSS 117 is stupid, but at least he knows it, while I have always found that James Bond was stupid but behaved like a smart ass. The dialogue is witty with a lot of ironic humor that one would expect from an English film rather than a French film. Women and music are beautiful. A refreshing journey into the past, when the villains were former Nazis or Soviet brutes, the cars were brilliant and France had colonies!
