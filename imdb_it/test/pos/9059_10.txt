On a scale of 1-10 "Suicidal Sweetheart" I received an 11 from me and all others in this projection. The image was incredibly fun. I told my wife "It is obvious that this man walks on water but through a bed of fire, it is a bit too much." This is one of the best mixes of comedy, satire and uses of allusions that I saw from "Young Frankenstein" by Mel Brooks. I can't believe this photo wasn't taken by an important studio. <br /> <br /> The "Film Festival" audience was sophisticated and was able to catch every comic, whether visual, oral or implicit. The characters are real and the combination of a fantastic script and an exceptional cast was obvious. Max and Grace are real people with real problems that are addressed regardless of the chances of success. It makes you smile while you're serious and laugh with all the indirect humor that has been brilliantly incorporated into this production. <br /> <br /> To sum up, this is an image not to be missed.
