I don't go for those "robbery" comedies, and I might not be interested in this if it weren't for the actors, when it was made, and when I saw it for the first time (only a few years later). It's almost too similar to "The Happening" (although it's obviously a far less serious comedy than that). The figure of the mafia takes over his own kidnapping, or rather transforms it into a completely different direction. Obviously, Raquel Welch did not interpret the sharp character that Faye Dunaway did in The Happening, but it is not even a sexist film - she was practically playing a character, almost the HER version of a "moll"! But I'm completely biased: it's one of the first movies I've ever seen with her, and by the time I saw it, you couldn't shoot without seeing a poster of her (thankfully). I think that Robert Wagner was really right as a leader, not entirely sympathetic or likeable of the group, as were Edward G. Robinson (of course) and Vittoria De Sica. And Godfrey Cambridge, an actor who always managed to be funny.
