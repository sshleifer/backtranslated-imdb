The first full-length adventure of Jim Henson's beloved muppet characters is a very competent musical vehicle like Kermit The Frog that leaves its carefree and swampy environment for bright lights (incited by Hollywood agent Dom DeLuise who heard him sing); during the trip he meets Fozzie Bear (a moving commissary at El Sleazo Caf√© by James Coburn with Telly Savalas for a bouncer and Madeline Kahn a patron!), dog Rowlf, bestial drummer Animal and his posed. back, funky group, egomaniacal beauty queen Miss Piggy (in a ceremony presided by Elliott Gould and Edgar Bergen), etc. All the while, Kermit and others are chased by Charles Durning, the burger mogul frogleg and reluctant acolyte, Austin Pendleton, sold car, Milton Berle, Bob Hope and Richard Pryor served the food by the insolent waiter Steve Martin, almost done the brainwashed by the mad German scientist Mel Brooks and, finally, auditioned in the offices of film magnate Orson Welles (who has Cloris Leachman for a secretary)! The pleasant soundtrack is kindly offered by Paul Williams, who also makes his appearance as a pianist based in El Sleazo. For the record, I recently purchased four of the Muppets' next films and I should watch them in the weeks to come when their shift expires.
