A demon, from a tree, removes himself in the form of a human man to make love with a young beautiful girl just because she dies. The demon's eyes freeze, two drops of blood fall on a bed that he has specially created for his object of desire. The bed consumes blood and hunger remains ... everything that comes into contact with the bed is consumed! This is explained to us by one of the victims of the bed, a painter whose soul is trapped "inside" one of his last works, the artistic surrender of his last resting place (.. he was dying of consumption, coughing blood, deciding to die on deathbed). See the painter, whom we can see as if he were trapped in a small room looking through his painting, unfortunately a spectator at bed meals. The bed has an obscure sense of humor, and we see that through this the painter is allowed to live, even giving him jewels and other possessions, once owned by eaten victims. A victim's skull grows bright red flowers not far from the basement that houses the bed. The film presents three young women who come across the villa that houses the basement that contains the death bed. The painter (Dave Marsh) may simply have a method of destroying the death bed but will include human sacrifice to resurrect the body of the one whose death first caused his hunger. Patrick Spence-Thomas provides the sweet and depressing voice of the trapped painter, the film tells, complaining about his current situation, telling us about past victims and often berating the bed of its predatory nature. <br /> <br /> A definitive and genuine cult film ... I expect its status to go up now that DEATH BED: THE BED THAT EATS has found a way for an audience (... like me) that appreciates the bizarre and the grotesque. The bed itself contains a type of liquid acid with a shade of apple cider where we see objects and human beings (struggling for nothing) consumed. Many could recognize a young William Russ (BOY MEETS WORLD, THE UNHOLY) in curls, look for his fugitive sister, find her in the basement, similar to a zombie and traumatized (.. of course, Julie Ritter was practically such a film, in trance, barely uttering a word) with them both trapped. In one of the most demented scenes in the film, Russ tries to stab the bed just because his hands are trapped in his grip, the flesh is acidified only with the remaining skeletal bones, the cartilage deteriorates. There is a long escape attempted by a victim whose legs were caught in the bed, almost out of the basement when the sheets ripped them back into her belly where she belonged. The film seems almost completely surreal as if we were looking at a macabre nightmare. Director George Barry often presents gags about the victims who find themselves in the most unfortunate position that they choose their deathbed as their refuge ... the painter gives us a memory of all the various people who have been eaten. There's really nothing like this movie, it's definitely one of a kind.
