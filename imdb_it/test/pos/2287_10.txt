This is an excellent film, little known. Tom Selleck plays an exceptional role in acting in this film, with the Japanese "Clint Eastwood". I'd like to see if this movie has already been released on DVD, there are some points that have been clearly cut. Hiroku (Tom's love interest) has clearly had some parts cut off. It would be interesting to see more of Japan in the film. Baseball sequences are by far the most realistic of any baseball movie, I'm sure most of the actors were current or previous baseball players. I love to upload the tape of this film at least once a year. The best scenes involve the lack of a flip of the hat after Tom became a fan of the big game, and an intensely sensual scene from Tom taking a hot bath with Hiroku. Even Dennis Haysbert does a great job, it's nice to see that he finally gets an award, not only in baseball movies (he was also in the Major League).
