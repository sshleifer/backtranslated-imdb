David Suchet is Agatha's mustachioed detective Christie Hercule Poirot in "After the Funeral", produced in 2005. Anyone who has heard David Suchet speak with his British accent knows what a shock is, because his accent like Poirot is so perfect and organic from the character. Suchet is the Poirot of Agatha Christie's books, and although I confess a love for Peter Ustinov in the role, his performance has little to do with what Christie wrote. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Poirot is asked by a lawyer friend to investigate the possible murder of one of his clients. En route to the train, the lawyer recounts events after his death - a strange desire to disinherit the expected heir and the declaration of the murdered man's sister. When Poirot meets the family, he discovers adultery, many secrets, another will and a murder. <br /> <br /> The story is excellent with rich production values ​​and a wonderful and detailed representation of the period. All the acting is superb, especially from Monica Dolan, who plays Miss Gilchrist. Poirot is here without Hastings, his beautiful office, or Miss Lemon, but it's still effective. <br /> <br /> I had the privilege of seeing David Suchet on Broadway in "Amadeus". Breathtaking. What an actor - when he plays Poirot, all I see is Poirot.
