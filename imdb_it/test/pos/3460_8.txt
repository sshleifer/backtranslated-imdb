This is definitely a movie that will make you think of the daily struggles that a person can go through every day. The great acting of the two main roles exemplifies it further, and you will not regret seeing this film in any way. <br /> <br /> It is a moving story of two new friends exploring the ups and downs of everyday life seen from a wheelchair seat. Their friendship is tested, as are their spirits when they get their apartment outside the nursing home. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to all those who like photos of friends or who just want to see a wonderful and moving film that moves away from all the clich√©s and pitfalls and never gets wet .
