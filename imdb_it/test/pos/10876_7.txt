I was really satisfied when I played this game. The graphic was something new. The missions were great. But still, I felt I wanted more from this game. For a James Bond game it's pretty good but not as good as its other games. It would be nice if they could do a 360Remake for it. It would be much better then. This could just be because they are in games like Resident evil, Dead rising and that kind of games. So it could be better but it was OK to play. One thing I absolutely hated about this game was Natalya! It was irritating to always die and couldn't even run. I recommend this game for those who love FPS games more than me.7 / 10 STARS
