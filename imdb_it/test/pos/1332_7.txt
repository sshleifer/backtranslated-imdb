Soderbergh is a fabulous director, but nothing he could summon could beat the incredible cast he collected for this zenith of sequels. Clearly, he knew it from the beginning. The term "star vehicle" has traditionally been used to refer to a film that is built around a star. What this film does is a whole bunch of Hollywood hot-shots and make them shine even brighter than before. The last scene says it all - all the stars sitting around with NOTHING and NOTHING are said. We can only see them socializing as if it were a scene from a reality show where George Clooney, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Don Cheadle just came out, being themselves. So history is not important at all - at least, that's not where the great pleasures of movies come from. If you want an intelligent robbery film, better stay with 11. But if the stars look at you, this will make your day.
