I saw "9 souls" at the 12th Athens International Film Festival (September 2006), where Toshiaki Toyoda, the film's director, was also present and answered many questions from the audience. This road movie is about 9 fugitives, all very different characters. They decide to be together traveling in their red van through Japan. Whenever the van stops, we see these 9 fugitives trying to escape from their past to build a new life or make a dream come true. However, no matter how hard they try, it seems impossible and their violent past follows them and leads them to their ultimate destruction. <br /> <br /> Although it is a very pessimistic film, it is not a dark film. On the contrary, it is full of beautiful images, surreal elements and elegant humor. Toyoda's heroes cannot escape their "prison" and face a divine punishment (?) For their "crimes". They are small pieces of a beautiful painting, where the Tokyo tower depicted as a huge inverted knife prevails!
