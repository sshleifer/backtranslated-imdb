This film deserves a lot of praise for me, because even though I'm not a surfer or a skater, I was inspired for the whole documentary. <br /> <br /> The depth of the story and the development of these two extreme sports emphasized what they could do for two groups of individuals. The dedication these people have / have is really inspiring and it was thanks to them that now others can have fun and do what these guys have founded. <br /> <br /> Unlike most other documentaries, this has been cleverly put together, the amount of footage that has been recorded and survived over the decades is exceptional and that is why some of the the greatest touches I have ever seen have been put together and brought the subject to stay focused. Without the need to respond to recent shots of the most famous surfers and skaters that remain popular today. <br /> <br /> The film explores areas such as success, how to make new tricks, win contests and gain fame. As well as failures like injury or exhaustion. <br /> <br /> It was also rewarding to listen to the experiences coming from the skaters and the surfers themselves and not from the second-hand information. This led to a better image to draw. <br /> <br /> Overall, a truly exceptional effort.
