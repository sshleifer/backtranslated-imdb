I just reviewed this thriller, one I had previously believed was one of Hitch's minor efforts. How wrong can it be! Maybe because I'm older, or maybe because the film improves with every vision, but now I think it's incredible. Every tiny part of suspense is squeezed into the smallest details and that final scene on the carousel is simply breathtaking! Perfect in every way, highly recommended.
