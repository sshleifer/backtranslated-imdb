This film is not only beautiful, it is fantastic. In addition to providing us with good performances, original plot, fantastic special effects, thoughtful messages and much more, until then it was a world completely invisible to the public. This is the first science fiction film that takes us into the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and the mind that explodes into reality that the public is left speechless. I'm only 16 and so I grew up in a world of modern effects and 3D animations in movies. Nevertheless, I was really, and I mean completely, blown away by the quality of these effects, even after almost 40 years. The visual effects were only one of the merits of this film, the camera was in true Kubrick style surprising and enchanting. It seems to be consumed by the screen and sucked into this surreal world (especially in the circular control room or as you call it). The effects, the camera and the size of this film captured me from my guards even though I had seen the evaluation before buying it. But this film has much more than that. The meaning of this film can also be interpreted as desired, although I think there are some clear points about humanity (even the true style of Kubrick). How humanity at the top of its evolution is only maintenance on board, and therefore not necessary by the computer, one of the humanistic tools. Like us in space they look like children, learning to walk once again, losing control of our instruments in zero gravity, breathing through the equipment like fish out of the water. At the peak of evolution, we started off on the endless adventure as simple primates. Many may think that the length and slow pace of this film is boring? ridicules? or just a waste of time. But before jumping to these conclusions, think about why Kubrick spends time with calm music and a spaceship in the middle of space for several minutes. This is to illustrate its beauty. Beauty, in many cases, is not guaranteed by the right respect of the spectators. Kubrick wants to show us beauty, and if we don't succumb and relax, we can't enjoy this movie as it was intended. This is not a normal film, we cannot simply sit and watch as we can with other films, this takes time, thoughts and above all commitment and feelings to watch. All this together makes this one of the greatest successes in the world of moving images. 10/10 Let me know if you agree with me.
