Entry is not too bad in the series, heavily balanced with war propaganda, but the sincerity of Rathbone and Bruce makes me happy. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty fantastic story from start to finish, just how many McGuffins are there? Holmes (and Moriarty independently) fumbling Dancing Men code unencrypted so quickly was Amazing Watson - so why weren't you stunned! The post that explained the bomb-magnifier view tickled me, it was the kind of economic trick that Universal would interpret, reminding me again that they didn't expect people to look at it critically over 60 years later. This (and I think every other Universal potboiler around this time) was meant to be seen once or twice and forgotten. Perhaps they should have realized that basically people don't change, that what was fun for ordinary people in 1942 would still entertain a select group now (2005) and strengthened in the script and in the sets! <br /> <br /> Lionel Atwill was going through his Hollywood rape case around this time, wondering if this was a particularly effective trick that made him look as upset as Moriarty? <br /> <br /> But the important thing about SW is that this was the first Holmes film directed by Roy William Neill, I think he directed everything else and produced all but one, thus establishing a wonderful environmental continuity.
