I have read many reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark. I noticed a lot of reviewers who call this typical "friend" movie. De Niro is by no means a friend of Murphy during most of this film. In fact, part of the comedy of this film is De Niro's reluctance to be friends with anyone. <br /> <br /> Murphy really shines in this. He returned to doing what he does best, acting like a real ham. He's a cop who really wants to be an actor and enjoys being on the reality show. De Niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the whole thing is stupid. I thought the two had great chemistry and they were a perfect casting choice. Rene Russo is also great as a television producer. Obviously, he loves everything that Murphy does and tries so much (together with Murhpy) to make DeNiro go too. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers touched the hilarious scene with William Shatner, resuming his role as TJ Hooker to train Murhpy and De Niro to "behave" as cops. But my favorite scene involves Murphy in the "confessional" hoping to get a Wesly Snipes-Like cop instead of De Niro. Dude, it was fun! Comedies often depend on your personal tastes. Sure, you could dig holes in the plot, most of the time you can with a comedy. I was happy to see the combination of Murphy and De Niro ... I think he brought out the best of Murphy, which was good to see him back at the top of his game. I can only imagine that it was a great honor for Murphy to be paired with the great De Niro. Rated 8 out of 10 stars.
