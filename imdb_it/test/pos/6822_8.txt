There have been many people who have tried to make a film identical to the story, Heart of Darkness. Some movies are based on Heart of Darkness, like Apocalypse Now. In 1993, Nicholas Roeg directed a film that was exactly like the book. Heart of Darkness the film is almost identical to the book. This film is full of action and adventure. Heart of Darkness talks about the journey of a sailor named Marlow sailing along the Congo River to meet the super powerful ivory merchant, Mr. Kurz. <br /> <br /> Heart of Darkness, the film, has the exact same beginning and set as the book. It takes place on a boat in the Thames River and Marlow tells the story to four other men on a boat called Nellie. The whole film is a flashback to Marlow's journey to see Mr. Kurtz on the Congo River. Marlow works for the Belgian company, which trades ivory along the Congo River. Tell us about your account in the company office and all the maps you saw in the office. <br /> <br /> Marlow leaves for a steamer in Africa. He arrives at the central station, where he receives orders from the general manager. The general manager tells Marlow about Mr. Kurtz and the ivory trade that Marlow would have done. Marlow soon discovers that the general manager does not like Kurtz because he fears that Kurtz will replace him. Marlow has been waiting for Central Station for months because his ship was destroyed and he is repairing himself. Marlow sees the hard treatment and enslavement in Africa while he is in the central station. When the ship was finally repaired, Marlow, another African character named Mfumu, and other crew members set sail on Marlow's steamer for Mr. Kurtz. <br /> <br /> Along the Congo River, they are attacked by African natives in the wilderness. While Marlow's crew is attacked by native Africans, they end up shooting and killing Mfumu. When Marlow arrives at Kurtz station, he meets a Russian who explains Kurtz's strength and glory. Marlow is then taken to Kurtz's home. There, he sees many maps and images that Kurtz has painted. Eventually, Kurtz enters the room and starts telling Marlow everything he did in Africa and talks about his lover. Marlow soon discovers that Kurtz is mad about power because Africans acclaim him as a god. Marlow gets angry with the hardness and slavery he sees in Africa. After Marlow finally meets Kurtz, Kurtz begins to die. While Kurtz was on his deathbed, he called Marlow into his room. Kurtz's life begins to flash before his eyes, and his last words were "Horror, horror". When Marlow returns to Europe to see Kurtz's boyfriend, Marlow tells her that Kurtz's last words were his name to hide the darkness in Kurtz's life. <br /> <br /> Heart of Darkness was well directed and turned into an adventurous movie. I recommend everyone to watch this film because it is full of action and mystery. The film is slow at times, but in all, it's really interesting. Heart of Darkness will really enlarge your mind and teach you a lot about how to interpret different scenes.
