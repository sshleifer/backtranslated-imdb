Ghilli is the best vijay film and one of the greatest successes of his career .... As I hadn't seen the Telegu movie to enjoy this movie even more. The story is about a girl who wants to escape the clutches of a local goon who wants to forcibly marry her. Since it is a goon then no body is ready to help heroin. Vijay, who had come to play Kabaddi, sees this and decides to help her. The rest of the film is the way in which vijay helps her and how the girl eventually escapes the enemy's clutches and the goon's father's political friends. The film has a lot of leeway at the moments of the seat thriller and will keep the viewer busy until the end. Vijay is very good as usual in the role of kabaddi player. Trisha, Ashish Vidyarthi, the group of vijay friends have done their job competently. A special mention must be made for the villain of the film Prakashraj. The villain's character was duly recorded and Prakashraj interpreted it very well. Surprisingly, for the first time, I felt sympathy for the villain in the end. The "Hello Chellam" dialogue has really captured the masses. Vidyasagar's music is brilliant and the song 'apadi podu' is a real rage. Dharani must be credited with a masala film so beautiful that it will be appreciated not only by the tough vijay fans, but also by the general public of the Tamil film around the world.
