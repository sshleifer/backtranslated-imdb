Darr is a great movie! Shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to win over his woman who in this case is Juhi Chawla. Juhi does not know that in the film Shahrukh has a crush on her MAJOR and constantly pursues her. I have to admit that some of the things he did in this movie were pretty scary ... like the threatening phone calls. Never in my life will I forget the joke, "I love you K..k..k..Kiran!" <br /> <br /> It's just a pity that Shahrukh and Juhi weren't exactly "together" in the film. But Juhi and Sunny make a pretty good pair in the movie. Although the role of Shahrukh was rather psychotic, I still think he did a great job interpreting it and can't imagine anyone else doing that role. No wonder he received an award for Darr in '94! Juhi ... what can I say ??? You look particularly amazing in this movie! It's not that it's not always extraordinary in his other films, but Darr gave the audience a wonderful image of her! <br /> <br /> As for the music ... it was excellent! Especially "Jaadu Teri Nazar", one of my favorite songs of all time. I also thought that "Tu Mere Samne" was also beautiful. <br /> <br /> To see for everyone! Overall Darr deserves a 9/10!
