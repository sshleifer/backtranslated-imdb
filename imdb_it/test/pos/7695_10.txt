I was 13 when I saw this movie very underrated at the ADAMS theater in Newark, New Jersey, I bought the program, and later I bought the soundtrack ... I still have both ... I'm now 55+ years old. and I haven't seen it since (maybe once on the TV network, in the '60s ???) one of the biggest casts ever assembled, great soundtrack and production, please let another generation see this great movie ... It was my introduction to the work, and helped with my understanding of tolerance. Please, family of Gerswhins or Preminger, release this classic soon !!
