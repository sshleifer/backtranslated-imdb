The film is a joy to watch, not only for the compelling storyline, but also for the superb performances of the actors, Deneuve and Belmondo. Although considered a "flop" on its first release, it has become a critical success, and it is clear why. Deneuve's acting style brilliantly suited the film. constantly gives the impression that she is holding back or hiding something, and her character in this film is. I don't want to ruin it by saying what, even if it's divulged pretty soon. Belmondo is as amiable as the tobacconist who is kind enough but in love. I would recommend this film to all Truffaut or Deneuve fans. He is a brilliant Hitchcockian-style thriller with interesting twists and interesting relationships and characters that develop like the film. The film lasts about 2 hours, so you feel you have not been sold shortly. Deneuve steals the show in this film, and it is clear that at the time of making the film Truffaut was very impressed with her. A definite must see for every filmmaker or moviefan. 10/10
