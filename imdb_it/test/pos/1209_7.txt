* AHEAD SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Great WrestleManias were still a few years away. But this was certainly good, with many good games and a great game. <br /> <br /> The demolition was always at its best at WrestleMania. I'm glad their last Wora Hoorah (I refuse to include the other version) was a victory on the Colossal Connection. I liked Andre's gag that he never entered. <br /> <br /> Few fans know that this was the first time someone beat Mr. Perfect. For some reason, Brutus Beefcake's enterprise was never recognized. Or the fact that he did it easily enough. <br /> <br /> The Hart Foundation's victory over the Bolsheviks was the shortest in WM history, including the 24/9 second match between King Kong Bundy and S.D. Jones. <br /> <br /> I'm happy that Jake and DiBiase have to fight at WrestleMania. This compensated for the fact that the feud had to be put on hold for so long. <br /> <br /> I expected the Big Bossman-Akeem feud to overheat, but the Bossman just took it out. As Bossman was a heel, it was just as fantastic as a face. He was always intense and obviously loved his job. <br /> <br /> If the Warrior had only a better work ethic and perhaps tried to learn to fight, he would have been a great WWF champion. <br /> <br /> It's worth looking at, especially since boring games are too short to complain. And the tag team matches are all very exciting.
