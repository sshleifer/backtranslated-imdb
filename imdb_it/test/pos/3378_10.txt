I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos' role as Williams for the entire show was worthy Emmy. It was strange how he had done well. And to be a quick, casual and creative fire like Robin Williams really is ... WOW. There were scenes in which Diamantopoulos had to say probably 20 lines of rapid fire and make 15 different characters while providing those lines, all while playing as ROBIN WILLIAMS that makes those characters ..... well, that my friends are extraordinary actors . His only thing is to do a representation of Robin Williams for a couple of minutes. The other is to do it for an entire TV movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know how I felt about the whole show, and I don't know how much they played with the facts, but I know it was Chris Diamantopoulos who made me watch. So for this, I give him a 10.
