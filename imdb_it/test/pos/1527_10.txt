This is a fantastic film and is very adept at using the few actors and sets. It is also very shocking - physical and psychological torture (both explicit and implicit) is mixed with calm and even humorous traits. So the horror is always unexpected and brutal. I'm not sweet, but this should be the most shocking movie I've ever seen. The message of this film is definitely delivered with a hammer. This is the movie so I will always remember both actors.
