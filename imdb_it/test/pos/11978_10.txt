All the people who voted for a poor 1 in this film, that's all I have to say: you guys aren't mature enough to enjoy a movie like this. It takes a certain amount of dedication to reach that level of appreciation. And this is the segment of people to whom this film has been addressed. You are not an ordinary person in movies by accident! . Return to the film. This was a real gem and certainly an inclusion in the Bollywood hall of fame. I would give an absolute rank of n. 2, surpassed only by the legendary Gunda of Kanti Shah. This film has an impeccable plot and has created a beautiful blend of fantasy and science fiction. Pan's Labyrinth would in fact be ashamed of the balance created between the parallel stories. And now I really need to mention the stellar cast and also the stellar-er interpretations (which is a word of NOW) from them (a special mention goes to Mr. Nigam for the best ever debut in any film on this earth). Every actor in this film has been chosen very carefully and the role has been tailor-made for them (and also for their age, I must add). Manisha Koirala still seems to be 18 and wow man, with that figure I would have also raped her. Wondering where this rape thing suddenly came from? Yes, a rape is what the premises of this film are based on. And it's not like your average Bollywood movies. If you are an atheist or an agnostic by chance, this film is again a must for you. Because this film can heal your faith. I don't think it would be too much to say that this film can cure cancer. Only the people who need it most appreciate its power, charm and immortal beauty. Tchch, so unlucky! <br /> <br /> The only flaw in this film: In your dreams, baby! This was impeccable. <br /> <br /> Only minor complaints: the director could not even play Mithun Da. <br /> <br /> I don't want to ruin it for you anymore. Go and watch it. TODAY. And if you like it, here are some other recommendations from me. Gunda, Desh Drohi, Aparichit, the old horror films of Ramsay Brothers, Loha, Indra the tiger and Sivaji.
