Previous commentators have noted the similarity in appearance between this film and The Third Man, the noir film by director Carol Reed with Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten. This similarity almost immediately affects the viewer. It is, indeed, a great praise to be compared to the winning cinematography of Robert Krasker's academy in The Third Man. <br /> <br /> Even the plot of Stolen Identity was outlined quite accurately but in rather ordinary terms. I found it very creative and fun. As is common as the "Mistaken - or Stolen - Identity" device is both in the theater and in the cinema, it is only a device and should not be confused with the plot itself. As a result, while the viewer may have seen this device "a thousand times", the Stolen Identity plot is full of surprises and twists based on this device. These are the unexpected turns that make this film much fresher, more original and more compelling than a synopsis plot could convey. Stolen Identity is not based on the kind of suspense that characterizes most films noire, because there is no real mystery here. Instead, it is based on increasingly small surprises. In short, the Mistaken Identity device is quite common; but this plot is not. <br /> <br /> Finally, although I was not familiar with the cast, I found the acting to be uniformly good, sometimes exceptional. I would have easily imagined that other actors would transform this film into a melodrama, with explosions, exaggerated gestures and obvious facial expressions. The acting is always more sober and subtle. Donald Buka is particularly sober and credible, not "blowing his cover" with an obvious facial expression, as we often see in films that depend on maintaining subterfuge to sustain dramatic tension. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment in this otherwise beautiful film was the very weak development of the sub-plot of the love story. As it stands, it seems like an afterthought - a slight surprise, in fact - attached to the end. Or perhaps during their shared ordeal, the actors simply could not convey a palpable level of chemistry that I could appreciate. This subplot should have been made more evident as the plot unfolded. All in all, I thought this film was a gem, and I wondered why I had never seen it before. Try it, you'll like it.
