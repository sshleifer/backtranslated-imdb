I just finished watching this (last weekend) and found it absolutely hilly, some of the scenes just couldn't stop laughing! Dennis is so incredibly often at times, and he only says the most mushy things ... but at the same time he is just making her pussy to impress his girlfriend (who is arrested anyway!) The scenery of the beach is very peaceful ... until when Robbie Coltrane arrives ...! It's not the biggest movie ever made, but definitely something to think about renting on Saturday night when you don't have much else to do (like I did). You may need to go around this though - I was lucky, as my local video store has it.
