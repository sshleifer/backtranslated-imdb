Now, guys, I LOVED THIS FILM, even if it's not quite like FAREWELL TO THE KING, another beloved epic of John Milius. It was fun, much more than if it was based on a Tennessee Williams drama. It is a great yarn, with a touch of political correctness. I love this film because of its beautiful photography, its humor and its mitigating criticisms of Bad Guys (Berbers) and Veri Bad Guys, the spear-bearers for the "civilized" world, with their repetitive rifles, artillery and large gunboats out there in the harbor. <br /> <br /> The highlight is the Berber encampment with blue-gray smoke from the fires that light up in the cold desert air. It is visually eloquent, very evocative. <br /> <br /> Set in 1904 in Morocco, WIND presents a defenseless American woman (Candace Bergen) who is taken hostage by a Berber bandit, even if immodest, (Sean Connery - the same model as a Muslim Scottish nomad ). The exciting story is based on some historical facts. The photograph is beautiful Milius, punctuated by the exceptional score of Jerry Goldsmith. <br /> <br /> Mrs Pedicaris and the Raisuli conduct prolonged foreplay and bounce in the desert between the oases. Although Raisuli proudly traces his lineage to the monkeys, he is a perfect gentleman - he even lets her hold her head after she beat him at chess! A naval detachment makes the palace of Bashaw rustle, extinguishing the fires of hegemonies competing with gasoline. Don't joke with the Body, Abdul. <br /> <br /> There are many fun stereotypes: <br /> <br /> Despicable Sultan - it looks like a dissipated ferret. Definitely not a liberal. <br /> <br /> Cruel German officer - a large, warlike dachshund wearing a monocle. He gallantly chooses to fight the Raisuli with swords instead of shooting him down like an Indiana Jones. Noblesse oblige, because of Von Clausewitz? <br /> <br /> Dashing Marine Officer: kicks the Bashaw army from Tangier and rustles his palace while chewing tobacco. His speech is slightly aphasic. The Bashaw asked him not to breathe on him. <br /> <br /> The Berbers - a horde of licentious demons driven by a fascinating megalomaniac. None of them take a bath, except perhaps in camel urine. <br /> <br /> President Teddy Roosevelt is immortalized and immortalized in guns, toys and stuffed grizzly bears. <br /> <br /> Beautiful American widow - gives men a lesson in courage, like her two sons do. Evidently he has a huge amount of clean and starched clothes and he rarely has his hair out of place. <br /> <br /> The Raisuli sends a message to Teddy Roosevelt, thanking him for the gift of a Remington repeating rifle, declaring, <br /> <br /> "MEESTER ROOSEVELT, YOU ARE THE LION AND THE IAO ARE THE WIND BREAKING. "<br /> <br /> How true it is. <br /> <br /> Please don't take my bitter remarks to mean that I didn't like the movie. I had almost as much fun writing this as I watched from Pitcher.
