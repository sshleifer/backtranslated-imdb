(Some spoilers) Facing a mid-life crisis and fed up with his marriage to Cindy, Teddi Siddall, who seemed to have more say in what he did and where the Air Force then stayed, the USAF Red elite Beret Sgt. Major Davis Bay, Gary Cole, decided one morning to get away from everyone and start a new life as a civilian. <br /> <br /> David had this idea for the first time when he met at a sweet and adoring Halloween party Alyson, Karen Sillas. Keeping his past a secret from her by telling Alyson that he is in a top secret military suit was the perfect cover for him. Back to Jackson AFB outside Austin Tex. David starts to review his life options with Cindy and the USAF and decides to change his identity by running away from it. David then calls Alyson, who only met him once, and makes an appointment with her. Before you know it David, who now uses the name Haywood, is engaged to her. <br /> <br /> Pretending his death in a bicycle accident Dave intentionally leaves his wife and children in the cold and deserted his army obligation to his country. It didn't take long for Dave to find out that he doesn't like civil life. It is now too late for Dave to return to his first wife Cindy and his two boys with him in front of the brig and a military martial court if he returns to the USAF. Dave accepts the only job he could do to support him and Alyson and their eldest son Chris: using his skills learned in the Red Berets to rob banks. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story "Lies He Said" has Dave Bay / Haywood living three, not two, different lives. One of a family man who works hard as a ruthless bank robber and the other as a dead and highly decorated, from the President of the United States and Prime Misnister Of GB, the All-American hero. Gary Cole is very effective both as a master sergeant. David Bay and her husband David Haywood. Davids' actions are, although unforgivable, understandable in the case of his depression over his marriage to Cindy. Her pressure of torment came to the point where she just wanted to get lost and get away from her and the children. But he would have to seek professional advice from the American Aviation, which he would have gladly provided, instead of choosing the easiest route. Which eventually leads him directly to Levenworth Ferderal prison. It could have been that the excessively macho Dave thought it would be a bad sign in his career, as well as his ego, to get help for his problems. <br /> <br /> Karen Sillas as Alyson is the glue that holds the film with her at first going with her new explanation of the husbands of her frequent disappearances, some for two weeks while he did secret actions to keep the country safe from domestic and foreign terrorists. The real reasons for his long absences were the result of the fact that he had devalued the planing and robbed banks. What was the only way he knew how to make a living from what he had learned, in subversive actions, all those years in the Red Berets elites. <br /> <br /> Alyson tracks Dave's mother Carolyn Bay (Linda Goranson), who told her he had died since he was a kid, in Portland discovers the truth about the double or triple life that has been in his head since he married her. This led Alyson to discover her marriage to Linda and the two children she had with her and her fake death, and now AWOL, from the USAF. Being a true story, the ending was everything you would have imagined it was in a standard Hollywood, or made for TV, the movie. This is what makes the movie "Lies he Told, much better than you'd expect it to be.
