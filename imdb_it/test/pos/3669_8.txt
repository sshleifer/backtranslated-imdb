Ignore everyone else's comments for this movie and watch it on the payment cable (as I did) or rent it. You owe it to yourself. This film is what all the movies are (should be). Difficult to classify (and God knows how a "high concept" has been defined!), But this is one for the angels. Check it out. What do you have to lose?
