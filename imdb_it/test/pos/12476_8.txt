A nice film about a man and his wife getting involved in the murder and the cop investigating the case. Start wonderfully, but at a certain moment it hits a wall. We are sure to know what happened, so a thread of plot that seems at first like a red herring that gets up and disappoints. However, Clouzot's direction is excellent and the acting is quite good. Louis Jouvet, who also starred in the film Drôle de Drame by Marcel Carné, offers the best interpretation of intelligent detective. I wonder if the Coen brothers were influenced by this film when they wrote Fargo. Just like that movie, the police officer does not appear almost halfway, and therefore becomes almost the focal point of the film. There is also a lot of comedy that surrounds him (although his methods sometimes seem fascist).
