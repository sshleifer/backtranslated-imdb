(Very delicate spoilers, a basic plot, no real details) <br /> <br /> IF you go into this movie with sufficiently low expectations. I saw this movie at a free screening a few days ago in Maryland, and the only reason I agreed to go ... was because it was free. I expected some laughter, but since I've never been a huge Tenacious D fan, not much more. <br /> <br /> The first ten minutes of the film are hilarious, given that we are given a look at the humble Christian origins of Jack Black in a city in the American Midwest. The film then takes us years into the future, at the first meeting between JB and Kyle Gass, the second half of Tenacious D. We see the formation of the band and the genesis of its name. Finally, as the title suggests, the second part of the film describes their quest to get the fabulous "Pick of Destiny". Once again, the beginning of the film was laughing out loud, and most of the film at least kept a smile on my face. That said, there have been times when it has seemed a little long; it's only 100 minutes, but it seemed like it should have been a little shorter. The story is as absurd as it seems, and this is not a movie you see if you want a real storyline. Which is fine, except that it means that many of the lines are very well chosen ... and when they are missing, they are missing. Same thing with songs; it's a musical, but many of the songs have lost their appeal after the first minute or so ... then they kept going anyway. <br /> <br /> I will say that the R-rating has really saved this film from bombing; D's humor simply could not work without curses, sex and drug references. But unless you are a true fan of the band, or at least know that you appreciate their comedy style, I would advise you to save some money and rent. "Pick" will make you laugh a little ... but is it worth $ 9? I don't think so. I was tempted to rate it at 6, but since I think many will have fun enough to justify seeing it in theaters, a 7 seems more appropriate. Make sure it's your style.
