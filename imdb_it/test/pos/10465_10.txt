This is one of those movies that improve with every vision. I watched it three times and actually registered on IMDb because I wanted to comment on it. "Food" movies have already been made before, some are really good - like, for example, a certain Japanese comedy that fans of Asian cinema will know anyway. But this is really in his own league. At the center there is a Protestant Christian parable that symbolizes the ideal of kindness but, far from being dogmatic, it also deals with the "good" in each of us, regardless of our religious beliefs or lack thereof. There is an underestimation and pervading sophistication in the Feast of Babette, but this makes the film's message, if possible, stronger, not at all weaker. If you cannot participate in the extraordinary physical banquet offered by Babette, you are still welcome in this feast of the soul. Highly recommended!!
