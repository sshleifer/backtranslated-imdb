"Imaginary Heroes" is a 2004 film featuring Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels, Emile Hirsch, Michelle Williams and Kip Pardue. <br /> <br /> The story concerns a dysfunctional family that becomes even more dysfunctional when the eldest son (Pardue) commits suicide. <br /> <br /> "Ordinary People" has been mentioned often in connection with this film; it's kind of "ordinary people" with a role reversal. The mother in this case, Sandy Travis (Weaver) is more accessible than her father, Ben (Daniels) who is clearly devastated and unable to cope. As "Ordinary People", the younger son Tim (Hirsch) is at the center of the film. <br /> <br /> For me, the film was absorbent enough to keep watching but has a curious detachment. There have been some wonderful interactions - mother and son, mother and neighbor, brother and sister (Williams) and some good unusual moments. What he never clicked was that Ben was part of that family or had no connection with Sandy. This seems to have been the goal of director / writer Dan Harris. In a scene in a grocery store, the child checking in assumes that Sandy has "about 30" and gives her his phone number. In almost the next scene, Daniels asks Sandy if he wants a plastic surgery for his birthday. Weaver was 55 years old when this film was actually made, probably 54, and it looks phenomenal. So what is Ben looking at? However, there is something wrong about Ben's complete detachment because the viewer does not really see how Daniels was ever assigned to that family. <br /> <br /> The end has a couple of twists and also some very moving scenes. Everyone is very good, as Weaver and Hirsch are the best. <br /> <br /> There is not a huge amount of dialogue in this film and many looks. The script could have been sharper. But "Imaginary Heroes" is a good effort.
