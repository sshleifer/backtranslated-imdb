Like any good art, this film could mean different things to different people. For me it means that not being able to open your heart to others could deprive you of happiness and leave you with an empty life. The convenience of selfishness is like junk food: it is beautiful, but in the end it could make you sick. <br /> <br /> Almost everything I see in the United States is a mass commercial production of waste action, superficial dramas and stupid comedies, and this sensitive, deep and poetic film really moved me. Thanks, Nuri Bilge Ceylan (and everyone else in the cast)! <br /> <br /> Ivan Yanachkov
