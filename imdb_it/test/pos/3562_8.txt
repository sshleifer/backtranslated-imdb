This fun Euro-western opens with a scene that precedes a similar scene that Sergio Leone wanted to shoot for "Once upon a time the West" but he couldn't convince Clint Eastwood to appear. Three tough-looking gunslingers enter a city. One is dressed like the nameless man in a poncho. Another is dressed as Colonel Mortimer from "For a Few Dollars More", and the third is dressed as Django, except he rides a horse instead of throwing a coffin behind him with a machine gun. Our hero meets them on Main Street behind a wagon loaded with three coffins. "Any Gun Can Play" is a spaghetti western with a spaghetti western joke because the hero here wipes out the three murderers. Apart from a little too much comedy, especially in the acrobatic fight sequences, this is an above average oater. <br /> <br /> The well-known Mexican outlaw Montero (Gilbert Roland of "Barbarosa") and his trigger band the happy gunslingers rob an army train carrying $ 300,000 in gold coins over the border. The director Enzo G. Castellari of "Inglorious Bastards" stages the take from a variety of camera angles that push you to the forefront of the action. The bandits grab the locomotive along with the carriage that carries the gold and separate it from the rest of the train that houses the US cavalry. While Montero and his armed men keep the cavalry blocked, Pajondo (Pedro Sanchez of "Sabata") requisitions the locomotive, kills the engineer and his crew and drags him away, leaving the other gunmen to defend themselves. Essentially, Pajondo crosses Montero twice and steals gold for himself. Later, Montero reaches Pajondo at the Rio Grande. Before the bandit could reveal the fate of the loot in Montero, however, a cavalry sergeant shoots dead Pajondo. Before dying, Pajondo tells Montero about a medallion that serves as a clue as to where he hid the treasure. The irate captain Cavalry (Ivano Staccioli of "Commandos") imprisons Montero, but he cannot undo the bandit's language even after using his whip on him. Enraged by Montero's reticence, the captain threatens to have the Mexican coup if he does not speak. Meanwhile, the jailers let a priest speak in Montero, but in reality he is not a priest. The six-cannon Stranger (George Hilton of "The Ruthless Four") masquerades as a cloth man and saves Montero from a firing squad. Unfortunately, before Montero is saved, Clayton (Edd Byrnes of the "77 Sunset Strip" TV) removes the medallion from him and keeps it to himself. Clayton is the bank representative who was sent to safeguard the gold. He is horrified that the Captain wants to shoot Montero. Clayton's bank career depends on his ability to recover gold. The Stranger stages a fire at the fort to distract the firing squad and Montero takes the Captain as a hostage and tries to escape, but the Stranger shoots him from his horse. Before the authorities can verify that Montero is dead, the Stranger claims the body for the beautiful reward he will receive and rides with the Captain's thanks. As soon as they left the fort, Montero's men presented themselves to save him from the stranger. From this point on, the Stranger, Montero and Clayton forge short-lived alliances with one another as they seek gold. Castellari and screenwriter Tito Carpi, who wrote several spaghetti westerns like "A Few Dollars For Django" and another oasis of Castellari "Seven Winchesters for a Massacre", are based on intelligent humor and surprise reversals to keep the action fresh and fast-paced. An interesting scene has Clayton sitting at a table about to eat his meal when he hears suspicious sounds behind him. Clayton pours his drink on the table and sees the armed men behind him with a six-pistol holster. <br /> <br /> "Any Gun Can Play" lives up to its title. In fact, many weapons play, and at least twenty or more corpses accumulate before fading. This western is not so much a parody as a knock-off of "The good, the bad and the bad" by Sergio Leone. Mind you, the bad guys and the good guys frequently fall like ten pins in a bowling alley, but their death is not represented in the brutal manner of a Leo western. "Any Gun Can Play" does not take itself seriously as Leone's masterpiece. The three lead jockey back and forth for supremacy. Everyone has a piece of the puzzle that will lead them to the treasure, but they will refuse to share their information until the end of the shoot'em up. Lenser Giovanni Bergamini's widescreen color photography is spectacular, in particular the train's opening strokes that run on railway tracks with mountain peaks that rise dramatically in the background. Another big blow occurs when Montero tests the stranger's imperturbable calm. This scene happens after the stranger saved Montero and the Mexican minions arrive to save their boss's bacon. Confiscating the Stranger's six-gun pistol, Montero takes aim at the tough guy from the poncho and empties the revolver, placing his well-aimed bullets harmlessly in and around the relentless gunman. Bergamini, who photographed Castellari's WWII thriller "Inglorious Bastards", frames the scene with the stranger in the background and his gun in Montero's hand in the foreground for a pleasant three-dimensional shot. Meanwhile, the lively orchestral soundtrack by Francesco De Masi is memorable for his idiosyncratic melodies such as the soundtracks of Ennio Morricone were for Leone's westerns. The opening song is reminiscent of a Hollywood 50s western with its catchy lyrics and guitar riffs. Although it is not one of the most important spaghetti westerns, "Any Gun Can Play" is always meaningless fun with interesting twists and good performances, especially the tireless Gilbert Roland who was 62 years old at the time!
