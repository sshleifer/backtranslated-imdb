We went to see Manna from the sky, my husband, two friends and me and we enjoyed the movie. The characters are fun, the story is fun and very similar to real life. I think that's what I liked the most, just seeing something believable, no murders, no science fiction, just good clean fun. It's something you can bring your kids or elderly parents to and don't worry about it. How many of those are around anymore !!
