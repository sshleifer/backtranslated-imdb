I recently bought it on DVD because I hadn't heard of it and as robert carlyle. <br /> <br /> Obviously this film will not have Hollywood special effects, saying that the special effects were pretty decent and the acting was also fine. <br /> <br /> I found the film amusing and I don't regret having bought it, for almost 2 hours it's just the right length for this type of film. <br /> <br /> Don't expect an exciting explosive action from start to finish though, it's a pretty well balanced film with a pretty decent plot!
