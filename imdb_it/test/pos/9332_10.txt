I'm not a big fan of music videos. I think the music videos take away personal feelings about a particular song .. Any song. In other words, creative thinking comes out of the window. Likewise, personal feelings aside regarding MJ, they stand aside. This was the best music video ever. Just wonderful. It was a movie. Yes people were. Brilliant! You had a fantastic acting, a fantastic choreography and a fantastic song. This was spectacular. Simply a plot of a beautiful young lady coming out of a man, but he was a man or something sinister. Vincent Price did his part by adding to the song and video. MJ was MJ, he said enough about it. This song was for the video, what the Jaguars are for cars. Top of the list, PERFECTO. What was even better than this is that we got the real MJ without a thousand facelifts. Although ironically enough, there was more than enough makeup and costumes to go around. People go on Youtube. Take 14 minutes. out of your life and see for yourself what a wonderful artwork this video really is.
