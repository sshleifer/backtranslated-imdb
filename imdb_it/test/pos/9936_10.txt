"Opera" is a great film with some fantastic and imaginative images. An opera singer (Cristina Marsillach) is chased by a killer who forces her to see him kill everyone she knows by tying her and tightening the needles under his eyes. This idea of ​​needles comes from the fact that Silver doesn't like it when people cover their eyes while watching his films. "For years I have been bothered by the people who covered their eyes during the best moments in my films. I want people to see them and not avoid the positive confrontation of their fears by looking elsewhere. I thought to myself" How would it be possible to achieve this goal and force someone to look at the most gruesome murder and make sure they can't avoid their eyes? "The answer I found is the core of what" Opera "is." - says Argento. More suspense, wonderful cinematography and brutal and bloody murderers. A boy is stabbed in the throat with a knife that causes an injured trigger, Daria Nicolodi is hit in the eyes while I ooking through the peephole, etc. For those who haven't taken this yet, try it. Highly recommended.
