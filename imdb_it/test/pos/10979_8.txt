I saw the movie last night without knowing anything (nothing else seemed interesting and I had a Buffalo connection for this film - UB grad). It was a very funny movie. Liked the rhythm (resumed after a slow start) and the story. Well written plot and development and good character relationships. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves watching movies that have interesting stories. I found myself talking about this movie after a few beers - most discussions don't last more than a few minutes.
