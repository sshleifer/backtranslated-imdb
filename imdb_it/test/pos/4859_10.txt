This film packs a punch. There are some from time to time that make me think deeply and bother me a lot. I could see myself in this same situation - let things passively happen around me, without defending the right and decent thing, just trying to avoid trouble. How often do we avoid making waves or attacking our necks? How often our inaction condones the bad deeds of others. We will never join them, we tell ourselves, we recognize that what they are doing is bad, but do we do something about it? <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman (William H. Macey) is a low-key nerd office worker who paid for his home in Brooklyn, NY, in the waning days of World War II. He rarely engages in what is happening around him, has never married, rarely socializes, only goes to work and cares for his disabled mother. Then a series of events in his small "white" neighborhood take him out of his complacent shell in a whirlwind of events. The rape of a Puerto Rican girl from her neighbor's son begins as a witness from her bedroom window. Immediately afterwards he takes his glasses because of poor vision. Now that he is more able to see, he becomes less able to cope with the circumstances of his life. The only bright spot is a new love in his life, and he gets married, hoping to continue in his normalcy. Then the virulent anti-Semitism on that road catches him, despite his credentials as a Presbyterian WASP. As things get out of hand, he finds that he has to make an important decision - he takes a position or simply leaves. <br /> <br /> I can't see how anyone can see this movie without being influenced and have a lot of thinking about themselves and what they really represent. Post-war anti-Semitism is the setting here, but there is injustice at all times and everywhere. It is up to the individual to decide where he is.
