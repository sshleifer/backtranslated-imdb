Excellent cast, plot, performance. Totally credible. I am aware of the close-knit group that exemplifies the Marine Corps. But this film brought fear to my heart. The marines make the principles damned. It seems that this film was based on real-life incidents. It shows how difficult it is to go against the establishment. Anne Heche was absolutely convincing. Sam Shepard's portrait of a Marine gung ho was making you think. And Eric Stoltz as his lawyer was so adept at balancing his loyalty with the Corp, but also his loyalty to his client while he was high on his rope. He knew what his true course of action should be. But it was dismembered from its immersion in the marine tradition, loyalty to the Body above all else. I was pinned to the TV screen. All in all, I give this a resounding 9 out of 10.
