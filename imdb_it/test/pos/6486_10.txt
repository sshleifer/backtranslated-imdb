Of all the leading actresses of the 1930s, Miriam Hopkins was the most bizarrely neglected and undervalued. His series of excellent films from the 1930s and 1940s is quite impressive, but is often referred to as "stagy" or "fragile". Yet he had a great sense of humor and was memorable in several comedies, including this film, Old Knowledge (with Bette Davis) and The Smiling Lieutenant (with Maurice Chevalier and Claudette Colbert). Hopkins was famous for his dislike of Hollywood, and the result was a bad representative - undeserved. <br /> <br /> In Wise Girl she plays an heiress who tries to save her dead sister's children from their tutor - her sister's brother-in-law (Ray Milland). The film offers several hilarious scenes as Hopkins bathing is a warehouse, Hopkins joins Milland and Guinn Williams in a restaurant in Greenwich Village for $ 3 each to act like a "bohemian" and Hopkins going into the front row during one of the fights of Williams. Milland is also excellent and very funny. <br /> <br /> Hopkins and Milland are a fantastic couple. The film also boasts solid support from Williams, Walter Abel, Henry Stephenson, James Finlayson, Margaret Dumont, Grace Hayle, Leonid Kinskey and Inez Palange. The two girls are OK. <br /> <br /> But Hopkins, drunk on a "slice of wine" and wearing a double spiked suit of his is exhilarating as he blows with stray hairs while he smokes .... A scream.
