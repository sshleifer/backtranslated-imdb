Cuba Gooding Jr. is back on top! Jesus, he did a great job in this movie! I really enjoyed this movie. It's one of those good movies that make you want to run outside and volunteer on a mission or something. Anyway, I'd recommend seeing this movie in the blink of an eye! It is worth the admission price. And as for Cuba Gooding Jr., give him his next Oscar right now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
