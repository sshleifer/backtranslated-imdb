I just saw "Everything is Illuminated" at the Telluride Film Festival. This is a truly remarkable film. Very emotional, fun sometimes and warm the heart. Bring your handkerchiefs! For those of you who love a movie that brings tears to my eyes, the conclusions of "Babette's Feast" and "The Notebook" come to mind. The stories were completely different but they had the same emotional power to bring tears to my eyes, just like this film did. <br /> <br /> No spoilers here. The summary is, as IMDb describes, the journey of a young man to Ukraine to follow his roots and find the village where his father grew up. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is in English and Ukrainian (and also in Russian, I believe). This allows you to have wonderfully linguistic moments as a character interprets, more or less faithfully, for the English speaker of the group, depending on the circumstances. <br /> <br /> The scenery is wonderful and the score is a treat with wonderful Eastern European influences. Make sure you respect the credits for the final song. <br /> <br /> This is Lieve Schreiber's directorial debut and is well done. I give this film a 9, one of the best films I've seen in a long time. I highly recommend it.
