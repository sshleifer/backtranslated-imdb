I would say that "Bride of Chucky" is a "return to greatness", but the series has never been truly exceptional. # 1 Very good, # 2-3 have been eliminated, and I think this fourth installment is the same or even better than the first movie. And it contains the best subtitle / tagline: "Chucky gets lucky". So he does, as Jennifer Tilly, who completely rejuvenated this series as Jeri Ryan did for "Star Trek: Voyager". Tilly has not only created a presence; added humor, background, drama, tension and a great help / game for Chucky. And as much as I liked in the film, he can't get all the credit: the props (see the first 1-2 minutes for the horror-giveaways), the script, the internal jokes (again, the opening + Pinhead) and Chucky's lines were great ("In fact, if (this) was a movie, it would take 3-4 sequels just to make it justice", among others.) Fortunately, Chucky and the series gave up Andy " Hide "the search for the Soul and have just established a new way to get out of his body. He joins with his ex (Tilly) who transfers to a "Sposa" doll and a couple of boys from Bonnie & Clyde (Really, Heigl?) To regain this pendant buried with Chucky's body. This is for all Chucky fans, the slasher-horror fans of the 80s or even for those who have never seen any of the previous "Child's Play" movies. Is it funny, dark, harmless, bloody ?? but not over the top and despite Tilly's literal 20 minutes, it's always nice to see her. After all, you barely see her playing poker. (Side note: of course, I took the reference of Superman Hackensack, NJ.)
