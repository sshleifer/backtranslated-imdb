One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Bechard has a way of looking at things that are completely unique and this film does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> This movie has guessed you for everything, and with the seemingly taboo topics addressed it keeps you glued to the screen. There are no bad or good guys, Bechard makes sure this. The characters are so perfectly complex that you feel for each of them, you care about what they have gone through. <br /> <br /> Bechard's attention to detail is unparalleled in this world of "FAST FOOD MOVIES" and while some of the topics might make it a bit uncomfortable - you like the feeling it gives you. <br /> <br /> I've heard too often that there are NO NEW stories to tell. Thank you Gorman Bechard for proving that it is false. <br /> <br /> Run, don't walk, to see this movie.
