"Any Gun Can Play" (1967), directed by Enzo G. Castellari, is an excellent mess of Spaghetti Western, in particular of Leone. The first half is great, which, apart from the opening which is a direct nod to "For a few dollars more," with Monco, the columns Douglas Mortimer and El Indio creep into a ghost town and then promptly killed by a bounty hunter called "The Stranger", is completely serious, with great firefights (especially the robber scene), fast and furious action and beautiful performances by Gilbert Roland, George Hilton and (who handles well, considering that it is very misplaced) Edd Byrnes. But then, when the film reaches half way, there's a joke between Hilton and Byrnes. It's not very funny, and it's the weakest part of the film, but it throws everything you've seen before into a new light. You realize that in reality the whole is a parody of the Spaghetti Western conventions, and in retrospect, the first half is so well made that you completely miss this subspecies. What follows is now a more obvious parody, with even some acrobatic jump from Brynes that precedes all those seventies of the Circus Western. The ending, a complete transmission of the climax "The good, the bad and the bad", is very well done, as in other hands it could have been very silly. So, a fun Spaghetti Western, which doesn't take itself too seriously. I would recommend it to anyone who loves spaghetti westerns.
