Patricia Arquette plays American doctor Laura Bowman, who goes on vacation to Burma in an attempt to heal her spirit after the murders of her husband and her son. She is left behind in Rangoon during a military repression and leaves the city with an elderly man who works as a "tour guide". But it is not a simple tourist guide; she is a professor who introduces her to life outside tourist traps ... the two of them get caught up in political upheavals and Laura sees with her own eyes how the government betrays and oppresses her own people. <br /> <br /> This film is one of my favorites because of its themes. First of all, it is informative (describing some of the injustices that occur in Burma). Secondly, it is a woman's struggle to find meaning in life after an incredible loss. Thirdly, it is a matter of compassion and sacrifice and of people who unite - without even knowing each other - to endure pain and fear. <br /> <br /> Almost every beautiful scene in this film is important; nothing is wasted here. It is a serious and moving film. There is also a very emotional soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer that completes the scenes perfectly. <br /> <br /> Precise advice, especially to the people who deal with human rights ... and to people who want to know, "What purpose can I serve?" <br /> <br />
