I generally like this movie a lot. Animation is supreme: it means that they have taken the trouble to animate their hair and fur on animals and people. And being an amateur of graphics and animation (self-taught myself through books. For those who are curious about the same subject, I use the Discma Gmax program. It's a free high quality program that can be downloaded from the internet) the animation shown here is of a high standard. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film is good. Although this film lacks character development, this story is still understandable. In general, I think this film should be watched mainly by people who are fans of the game as the plot closely follows the game. As for me, I don't play so I don't have the wowing effect that it probably does on fans of the game. <br /> <br /> For those of you who like the game, I suggest this movie and if you haven't played yet, I still recommend this movie.
