A group of young adults run aground in the back of the afterlife, where the only place nearby is a museum full of wax mannequins, and the only form of help is Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors). At nightfall, children are picked up in record time. <br /> <br /> A strange and extravagant B movie that combines the gruesome backwoods setting with the plot device of over-realistic mannequins (making this a good update of the "bodies in the wax museum" genre), this is a intense shock festival along the lines of "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre". (It should therefore not be surprising that the art director of TCSM Robert A. Burns repeats this duty here, and his eye for decorating large sets is always useful.) Pino Donaggios's score is decidedly chilling; accompanied by the murky photograph of Nicholas von Sternberg, he infuses the film in an oppressive atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The twists vary in terms of success; there was one I saw coming a mile away, and one that actually took me by surprise, and for me I was even happier. One of the best moments is shared with us almost in the foreground, as the first victim of chump is trapped in a room with objects flying over him of his own accord. The capper is a large pipe impalement with blood dripping from the end. <br /> <br /> Star Connors offers an engaging performance like our down-home boy antagonist, while the younger co-stars predictably can't perform at the same level, even though Jocelyn Jones is a pretty woman nice and certainly attractive that has enough appeal to be considered a nice damsel in distress. Co-star Tanya Roberts (a brunette in this film) is in place as support. (If I had a problem with this movie, it's just that the victims are a bit too stupid.) Once again, this doesn't make this much different from many horror films of the 1980s.) The future major names among the credits are the future directors Ted Nicolaou, who was the editor here, Ron Underwood (who made a great debut almost twelve years later with "Tremors") as assistant director and veteran makeup Ve Neill, who has made many films and has won three Oscars since then. <br /> <br /> Although some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of nudity and sexual elements, this is still a nice little surprise that debut director David Schmoeller offers with conviction and taste. Recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
