It is particularly difficult for a director to capture films without being precious, unnatural, overly dramatic or all three. Breillat deftly demonstrates the instinctive methods of the brain-lizard of a female author in extracting from two "cattle" (like Hitchcock called actors) a scene of love of burning intimacy. His main battle is with his protagonist ("an actor is really a woman", she opines), although, of course, she is the protagonist who will steal the show. I do not agree that this is Breillat's first play. 'Romance' was hilarious at various points, but I accept that the sense of French humor can be elusive for foreigners; in fact, dozens of IMDb reviewers haven't detected any comedy in Romance. In contrast, Sex Is Comedy raises a lot of laughter, mainly using the prop of an actor that dates back thousands of years to Plautus and the ancient Greeks. We asked ourselves, leaving the theater, if Roxane's "beard" was a wig. A beautiful performance by Anne Parillaud as Breillat struggling with her script, at the age of ten years younger than her age.
