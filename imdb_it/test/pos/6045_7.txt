Jack Webb's film "The D.I" was born from the investigation into the real life of the deaths of several trainees in a swamp on the Isle of Paris in the 1950s. As always, Webb, being the patriot he is, came to the defense very similar to all the rest of his shows. Actually, I found this film tamed by 1957 standards. I served in the army and I can understand the intensity of training in Parris Island (some Death's Camp), so this movie can never come close as Full Metal Jacket . I think this is a good movie that is more patriotic than it actually is. But again, think about the time period in which it was created (1957) and what could be allowed and said in the cinema at that time. I have always found Jack Webb clean and very faithful. I know that many have criticized the film as unilateral and government propaganda. If you feel this way, look at "Full Metal Jacket" with R Lee Ermey. I'm a Webb fan and I enjoy the film for its merit, not to be precise. As I said, Webb believed in this country and kept the institutions at high moral standards (LAPD-Dragnet, Adam 12, Emergency etc.). Sit down and enjoy this episode of a very severe moral time in this country. Don't judge Mr. Webb too much. Mark Lockwood Lubbock Texas ..
