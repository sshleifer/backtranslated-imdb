I just saw this movie for the first time after finishing the book last week. What is the problem here? People admit that the performances are great - I mean, Lange is stellar! - and that the film is good-looking, but has less than a "6"! I don't understand Dai! Writing is not so bad! <br /> <br /> After reading many Pulitzer winning novels and seeing many of the movies based on them, I think a better job than was done was to bring the script together. I thought that the reduction of all the dialogues of the novel was performed almost perfectly. This story has had quite a number of dialogues and the story has come to the screen despite the fact that only part of it was used. <br /> <br /> ** BOOK SPOILER PART ** I was however, a little disappointed by the subplot of Ginny-seek-to-kill-Rose being omitted. I thought it was one of the most exciting parts of the book, but it was probably a good bet to leave it out. The film-goers, more than greedy readers, I think they tend to be less lenient towards the protagonists who throw antagonistic arguments. It's easy to confuse Johnny Lunchpail and Joe Sixpack. <br /> <br /> If you love the book, you will like the movie. If you hated the book, you'll probably hate the movie. <br /> <br /> ******** <br /> <br /> Rog
