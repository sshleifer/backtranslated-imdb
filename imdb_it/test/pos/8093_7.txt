Most of this film is an alternately hilarious and brutal satire on Nazism and fascism, made at the peak of the success of those movements. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in the final moments of the film, Chaplin abandons any pretense of making art (not to mention comedy) and completely turns to propaganda. Nor the anti-Nazi propaganda, but some of the most labyrinthine and idiotic "progressive" propaganda ever released from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> It does not matter that nothing we have seen so far indicates that the barber is also capable of giving the speech we see him give (delivered, ironically, with a disquieting wild-eyed fanaticism); such platitudes must not be allowed to interfere with the message.
