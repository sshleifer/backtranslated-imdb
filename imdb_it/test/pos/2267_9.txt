2005 was one of the best years for films. We have had so many wonderful films, like Batman Begins, Sin City, Corpse Bride, A History of Violence ..... Coming we also have Brokeback Mountain, King Kong .... But if this year the only great film that is Come out it was all lit up, so we wouldn't miss it all this year brought. The first film as director of the talented Liev Schreiber is a delightful, touching, touching drama, which also brings one of Elijah Wood's best roles. He is as perfect as Jonathan, a curious man who goes to Ukraine to find the woman who saved his grandfather in World War II. Liev Schreiber, who also writes the film, leads a masterpiece, with memorable scenes and (many) funny quotes. This is a real mix of Comedy with Drama, bringing a film that will be commented on years later. A serious Oscar nominee, Everything is Illuminated is a powerful, original and, why not, enlightened film. But there is one thing you should remember while entering the movie: left behind. This is special .------ 9/10
