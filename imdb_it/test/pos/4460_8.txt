DO NOT TORTURE A DUCKLING (Lucio Fulci - Italy 1972). Definitely an ideal candidate for the most crazy movie title ever conceived and this is a nice result in yellow-earth. Originally, the film was titled even more absurdly, "Do not Torture Donald Duck", literally translated from its Italian title. A small figure of Donald Duck appears briefly as a toy, but barely enough to make a title like this, but, apparently, has been modified for fear of legal ramifications from Disney. I railed against Fulci's previous LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN (1971), but here are all the right ingredients. A surprisingly effective mystery, a good cast and an imaginative shot against an unusual rural environment. Everything just clicks. I think it's rightly considered one of the director's most important goals. <br /> <br /> The story is set against the backdrop of a small mountain town in Sicily, where someone is killing young teenagers. Among the suspects, the most obvious is a young woman, Maciara (Florinda Balkan), a self-proclaimed witch who is suspiciously unearthed the skeleton of a child and taps pins in effigies. Guiseppe, even the village idiot is under suspicion, since he made a weak attempt to take advantage of the disappearance of one of the boys and walked straight into their trap. When a new super-cool (Tomas Milian) arrives from Milan to cover up the murders, she immediately starts questioning the authorities' hypotheses, when she meets two other potential suspects: Don Alberto, the local priest (Marc Porel) with a caring attitude, and Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet), a young woman bored by the city with a troubled past of drug crimes, who also thinks of having sex with the young boys of the city. Talk about your first red herring. <br /> <br /> Fulci pleasantly contrasts modernity and tradition with the newly built elevated highway that winds through the Sicilian hills, beyond the old cities where life is still firmly rooted in tradition and superstition. One could argue about the political position of the film as The North versus the South, or as a comment on the virtues of small towns - the conventions of society in general - which are too often dangerously close to falling into moral disintegration, chaos and - ultimately - self-justice by the population. The film has often been criticized for its anti-Catholic tone, but here is not an important element, except for obvious reasons related to the plot, which would give too much. In reality it is rather domesticated compared to a film like that of Joël Seria "NON CONSEGNAMI DAL MALE" (1971). Probably, the rather unflattering portrayal of the Sicilian values ​​of small towns (when another boy is killed, the local population is depicted as a delayed lynching) could cause some offense in Sicily, but - considering the problematic relationship of Sicily with the rest of Italy - difficult for other Italians, I would think. The film ended up in darkness too quickly to still have a big impact. <br /> <br /> When you talk about Fulci, the amount of blood is usually a major topic of discussion. Even if there are missing eyes-creaking scenes, the film contains two very graphic scenes. In the disgusting finale, the murderer falls on a cliff, splitting his face along the rocks on the way down with macabre results (though not very realistic). And the chain sequence with Florinda Balkan in the cemetery shows Fulci's passion for sadistic violence and, typically, does not hold back from graphically showing what most filmmakers would just like to mention. Surely, one of the most terrifying scenes in Fulci's repertoire. <br /> <br /> Above all, this is a small mystery well written, effective, well cared for by Fulci, with a cast of renowned artists such as Barbara Bouchet, Marc Porel (not very convincing as a priest), Tomas Milian and Florinda Balkan (the bubbly mouth like the witch of the city). <br /> <br /> Darkroom --- 8/10
