Topless touch football !! A race of wet t-shirts !! A jockstrap raid !! This "SheAnimal House" has it all. Except a plot and good actors. The film consists of several jokes and clashes between H.O.T.S. girls and the bitch of the PIs. The dialouge is a scream and the soundtrack is sublimely brilliant. In the last two months all the cable has come out, so do yourself a favor and pay attention. H.O.T.S. it's so bad it's okay!
