Murder Over New York is one of the best mysteries of Chan and I saw it for the first time. <br /> <br /> In this, Charlie Chan is visiting New York to attend a police convention. At the same time, the people involved with the aeronautical plants are killed and decides to help with the investigations, together with the son number 2. These murders turn out to be the result of the sabotage in the aeronautical plants and Chan helps to identify the killer ... <br /> <br /> Charlie Chan is played well by Sidney Toler and the rest of the cast includes Sen Yung as his son number 2 and Marjorie Weaver. <br /> <br /> I liked this mystery and it's worth having if you like this kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.
