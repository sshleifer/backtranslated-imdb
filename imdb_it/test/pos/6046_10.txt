Hey there Army Sgt. I'm sorry, buddy, but being an SGT in the army and being part of the Army National Guard doesn't make you qualified to comment on a Marine movie. You're not a Marine and just because you're wearing a uniform doesn't mean you can relate to being a Marine. We are simply the best, we have the hardest training, yes, we have a big head on us, but hey when you are the best, you like to cheer on your stuff. I was in the invasion of Iraq and in Falluja. I fought alongside the soldiers. You are not "qualified" to say something about my Marine Corps. I hate being the one who starts the whole "which branch is best", but you don't have the right to say you're qualified to judge a Marine movie. Oh yes ... we are Drill Instructors ....... not SGT's Drill. This is the biggest clue that you have no idea what you're talking about. Yes, we don't "curse" recruits anymore. Tell me, how are you cursing someone to make them a better Marine? How am I going to hit someone to make Marine a better marine? Yes, it's a kinder boot camp from what I've been through. But we are dealing with different times and people. We are training people who are smarter than the recruits of our generation. We want smarter recruits, no longer petty. And anyone who signs up to be a marine in the first place, has a dedication to be the best his country has to offer. We don't have to reinforce it in Bootcamp. The marines come to Bootcamp who want to be murderers. We don't need to teach them that by demoralizing them by blaspheming and beating them. At least that's how I feel. And yes, I'm "qualified" to say it. I have been on the field numerous times and have trained Marines and Recruits who eventually ended up on the battlefield. But then again, what do I know. I was there, done, I got my shirt. SGT of the Army ....... take a clue!
