This is the story of a guy who went to see a play and turned out to be a horror movie. The real story of a guy who is infatuated with photos and got scared when he unexpectedly identified himself with one of them. The incredible story of a boy who became scarier when the woman hero was deluding himself, besides the scoundrel. Damn, is this what life has made us be? Do people deceive themselves on the perfect face by imagining how that face should be perfect inside? "Toto, I think we're not in Kansas anymore."
