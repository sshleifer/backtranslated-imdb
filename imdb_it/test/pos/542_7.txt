Anywhere But this is not exactly anything new here, but the excellent performances of both leading actresses have been worth it. Sarandon and Portman are a mother and daughter who move from rural Wisconsin to sunny Beverly Hills, California, looking for a better life. The main conflict stems from the fact that Natalie would prefer to stay in Wisconsin with all her friends and family, and felt that she was forced to go to California with her overbearing mother. <br /> <br /> (spoiler) While it is true that the film as a whole is disappointingly discounted, Susan Sarandon and in particular Natalie Portman offer performances so good as to make the material almost new. Everywhere Ma Here does not cover any new terrain, but has the rare quality of being able to deal with abused topics and make it interesting enough again. Also seen in this film is the most heartbreaking facial expression seen for years, seen on Natalie Portman's face when her mother drops her on the side of the road and she watches the car fade into the distance. Particularly noteworthy is the ironic under-plot on Natalie's mother that drives her to become an actress, as well as a very convincing performance by Shawn Hatosy as one of Natalie's very close cousins ​​from home. His death is a tragic cliché almost always seen in films like this, but the rest of the film compensates for numerous weaknesses like this. Not great, but everywhere but here is definitely worth a look.
