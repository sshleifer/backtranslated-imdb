I saw this film when it was released and being very young and not too much in cinema was one of the most fascinating cinematic experiences I've ever had and it really left a mark inside me. At first I did not understand the story well and probably failed to make the necessary correlations between past and present while the film presents them to the viewer. Years after seeing for the first time I managed to watch it again and this was the moment when I fell in love with 'The English Patient', it touched me so deeply and for me it became the best film ever made. <br /> <br /> Anthony Minghella has made an absolutely incredible film, all locations are incredible and through his camera he manages to create incredible emotions inside you. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film's music is such an important part of the characters' entire emotional journey and the film wouldn't be the same without it. <br /> <br /> But personally the best thing was the fragile performance that Ralph Fiennes gave is a masterpiece. He plays so well the man who falls in love slowly but so deeply with Katherine Clifton, opens his heart and dives into this forbidden story. <br /> <br /> The most timeless scene for me will always be the one where Katherine is dragged by Almasy to the Swimmer's Cave and wears the thimble that bought it. He says "I've always worn it. I've always loved you" and at that moment he starts crying with such pain flowing from within him. <br /> <br /> Even Juliette Binoche is extraordinary for her performance and really deserved the Oscar she won. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a film that anyone who claims to be a movie lover should look into their lives.
