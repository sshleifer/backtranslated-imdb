This film is George C. Scott at his best, Bernard Hughes at his best and Diana Rigg at his best, and of course Paddy Chaevsky who writes about warp "masterpiece"! There are also short fragments of future biggies like Susan Sarandon, Stockard Channing, etc., which have a sequence of scenes that are not necessarily seen until the fifth or sixth time to watch. Nancy Marchand as a nursing supervisor from young to middle age is also superb, as is virtually every "face" in Hollywood in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> It is one of the few films that gets better the more you see it. Watch the "surprise" wing "Wait until Dark" scene! This is one of the few movies I've ever bought on DVD. Is magnificent.
