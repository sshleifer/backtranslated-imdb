Sony Pictures Classics, I'm watching you! Sony has the rights to Harry Records - you need to distribute the film and you will get a radical increase in sales of your rear catalog! However, this is a great studio of a fascinating, sadly unknown musician, full of great stories, bigger music, and could have been longer than 3 hours and I would have liked it even more. I saw him at the American Cinemateque Mods & Rockers Festival at the Santa Monica Aero Theater, where he played in a house full of people. They were pushing people away from the door! I went to many of the films in the Mods & Rockers festival, and I assure you that no other film has even come close to the sale, let alone divert people. Watch it at the theater, buy the DVD and make sure some slow-on-the-uptake companies [* cough SONY cough *] pick it up as soon as possible!
