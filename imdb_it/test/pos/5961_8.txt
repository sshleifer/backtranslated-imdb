Excellent exercise on several levels: <br /> <br /> - shows the colonial spirit not yet concluded in France <br /> <br /> - more generally the boring mentality of superiority of all Western peoples <br /> <br /> - a renewal of espionage and thriller movies: OSS 117 is uncultivated and stupid! <br /> <br /> The good idea is that, despite all these messages, it is a funny film, full of jokes and gags, very light and sparkling. <br /> <br /> Special mention to Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing. I wonder how it will be appreciated in the United States? <br /> <br /> Seems to be a hit in France, so probably a next version will come.
