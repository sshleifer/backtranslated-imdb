I had the pleasure of seeing this film when I was 10, (having an already existing interest in Egyptology). I know there are subtle errors in the art direction and in the costumes, but above all this is the best film, to date with the appearance of the XVIII dynasty. <br /> <br /> The film only comes close to Mika Walteri "The Egyptian", in the plot. A good part of the text has never been able to film, since we have to consider the duration of the race. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful !!! Performance as follows. The late Edmond Purdom gave an excellent performance as an orphan child adopted by his parents after their years as a child. He claims to keep for himself, has the best education available, and lets him face a rather emotionally distant person, given his education and his intellect. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons looks good as a humble tavern tavern; honest loving and sincere. Bella Darvi, people complained about her accent, well she's a Babylonian. It's not so obvious in the film about why Sinhue is so madly obsessed with Nefer Nefer Nefer. His correct name. In the book Sinhue is enjoying its carnal fruits and gets its revenge at the beginning of the plot leaving the drugged body of Nefer Nefer Nefer with the workers of the "House of the Dead". <br /> <br /> Gene Tierney as Baketaten, it's brilliant! When he tells Sinhue he is a pharaoh, it seems he could devour him (in his weakness). It is intense, bright and beautiful. <br /> <br /> Michael Wilding is deeply tragic in his mission to bring all people to know his one God. I believe we are looking at Ankhnaten through the lens of the Egyptologist A. Weigall. A vision at the time that had a pre-Messian feeling about the vocation of Ankhnaten. Has its monotheism influenced the Jewish people? Note Psalm 104. and other images of Egyption in the psalms? <br /> <br /> Peter Ustinov supplied the alter ego to Sinhue. He is a street expert and a cunning survivor. Excellent acting as always. <br /> <br /> Mature never thought much about his personal acting, his Horemheb goes well as an ambitious "super-patriot" who eventually killed Sinhue more than one person in his quest for power, (Walteri's book). <br /> <br /> I felt that the end of The Egyptian was confused as Sinhue's personality changes too easily. He has a living son (Toth dies in the novel), power is handed to him thanks to half sister Baketaten, who is now familiar with the world and has a grip on international affairs. So he became enlightened? He could have changed the Amon Priesthood as he was able. <br /> <br /> But NO! Sinhue renounces everything, everything including his son's future to become a ragged beggar who preaches monotheistic love? <br /> <br /> This change was too immediate and the main flaw in the script! <br /> <br /> the appearance of the film, the color, most of the costumes (the golden dress by Nefer Nefer Nefer was too exaggerated because it is more richly dressed than the royal family), the music is beautiful . <br /> <br /> I will watch this movie again easily. <br /> <br /> PS I know you probably know that Horemheb did not directly pass Ankhnaten, but I could not resist stating this.
