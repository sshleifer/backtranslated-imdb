Like many big-screen stars when their careers ran out, so many turned to television where they probably secured posterity their reputation. Donna Reed is an example. <br /> <br /> I don't think Donna Reed ever thought that Donna Stone was something challenging, not for a woman who had won an Oscar to play a very different kind in From Here to eternity. She was certainly more prepared to play wife, mother and housewife Donna Stone after playing Mary Bailey in It's A Wonderful Life. <br /> <br /> Donna has always been beautiful and wise and always available with the problems of her children and her husband. Carl Betz was not an idiot, he was a pediatrician who had his office attached to the house. We are talking about a man who is always ready for a crisis. <br /> <br /> Although it was Donna Reed's show because Donna's husband Tony Owen produced it at the time. Yet it lasted as long as the popularity of the two sons, Shelley Fabares and Paul Petersen. Fabares had the best-selling teen album, Johnny Angel, which he presented on the show. He successfully transitioned to an adult star, best known for his role in Coach as wife of Craig T. Nelson. <br /> <br /> But Petersen was a bubblegum teen idol during the day. Donna Reed's show dares to say that she had most of her viewers because of her. Now he is forgotten, but Petersen also had a hit album, My Father. He didn't do half of Johnny Angel. <br /> <br /> Now Paul Petersen runs a support group for former girls like him. So many of them end up so tragically, it's a good job he's doing. <br /> <br /> The Stone family was the quintessence of Central America. They lived in a suburb near Chicago, leading a healthy life. Mom and Dad were always there for the kids. Obviously the problems they had were usually nothing more than breaking the curfew. <br /> <br /> It is this series that I believe was the model for the television city of Pleasantville in which Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are sucked. <br /> <br /> I have pleasant memories of The Woman Reed Show. Easy to take, but not too seriously.
