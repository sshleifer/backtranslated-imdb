"Family Guy" is probably the bravest sitcom ever produced. It relentlessly taps everything it can think of, from television shows to family drama. Best of all, it's one of the few TV shows today that is really fun. <br /> <br /> The show revolves around the Griffins: Peter, the obese father whose schemes are limited by his lack of intelligence. Lois, the mother who is more or less the breadwinner, even though Peter considers himself such. Chris, the fat teenage son who has only a few brains like his father. Meg, the black sheep of the family that is the ma of everybody's jokes. Stewie, the little girl who plans to kill her mother and take over the world. And Brian, the family dog, which is often the voice of reason, but is often corrupt. <br /> <br /> "Family Guy" employs many tactics to get laughter from the public. The most notable are the frequent splits that falsify what has just been said. They are effective because of flawless timing and the way they play. "Family Guy" also uses parody to get humor, most commonly from TV shows of the 80s. What makes the show so beautiful is that a person should not be familiar with what is spoofing. I'm sure it would help, but the material is quite fun in itself. But the show does not stop there. Not only does he spoof almost everything, but he pokes his own bad words! The show is full of off-color humor. The only reason people are not in love with the show is probably because it makes fun of every race, sex, and other generality in the same way. There is nothing sacred here, and no one and nothing is immune from the satirical blows of "The Family Guy". <br /> <br /> Putting up musical numbers in a movie requires a lot of time and effort, and it's a very big risk. But "Family Guy" contains some great songs. All well written and interpreted, and of course they are hilarious (perhaps the most famous, "The Freakin 'FCC" is both catchy and hysterical because it hits the board where it hurts). <br /> <br /> The vocal characterizations are correct. Seth McFarlane is tremendously talented. Provides voices for Peter, Brian (which is his own natural voice) and Stewie. Not only are the voices consistent and creative, but it can also alter the tone at will, so it really seems to be spoken by three different actors. Alex Borstein brings to Lois a perfect nasal drawl for the character. Seth Green is unrecognizable as Chris (if I hadn't looked on IMDb, I would never have known it was him). Lacey Chabert gave birth to the character of Meg, and while she was good, Mila Kunis really elevated the character with her high-pitched voice. Kunis offers Meg a new, clearer advantage that he did not have with Chabert. <br /> <br /> "Family Guy" has been compared to "The Simpsons", and this is completely understandable (and not just because they are produced by FOX). Both are blue collar life satires, while "The Simpsons" is good, "Family Guy" contains a sharper side. The show is absolutely fearless. There is no real sacred cow. The show illuminates handicaps (physical and mental), ethnicities, TV shows and films, celebrities, politicians, religion (especially Catholicism), drug use and drug addiction, sexual humor of all kinds (including S & M), and something that beyond the description. Not all "Family Guy" throws on the public, but overall the show is always fun and often hilarious. <br /> <br /> If there is any flaw with "Family Guy", it is that the jokes run too long sometimes Sometimes with the "embarrassing moment" jokes, the sequences are stretched for so long that not only does it stop becoming fun, it becomes so irritating (and long) that a rapid advance button is guaranteed. These can be effective at around 10-15 seconds, but the show sometimes extends them to over two minutes. It could be argued that the show rewrites its rules to adapt to the plot, and often it does (for example, Brian often behaves like a person, but still behaves like a dog when the story requires it). But this is not a problem because the show still works. <br /> <br /> Some people have claimed that the show has stopped being fun. While I agree that he's not as edgy as he used to be, I think it's the fault of FOX, not McFarlane and his crew. The show was born with FOX, but after some lackluster evaluations and audience attendance, it was canceled. However, DVD sales were large enough to be picked up by Adult Swim. The show became an immediate success, and once again it was bought by FOX. However, since the show is so big now, FOX is afraid to allow writers to experiment and try new things. While it is still fun, the humor is not so fresh and edgy. <br /> <br /> Definitely check out this show. It's wonderful.
