A highly politically charged drama that, although biased, is extremely well managed and one of the smartest films ever made. It contains almost no preaching, but rather follows a naive television journalist who gradually realizes the threat posed by nuclear power plants, not because of an intrinsic danger, but because suppliers are more interested in the bottom line than in the safety of many they hated the film because they saw it as a political treatise made by ultra-liberals like Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas, but if you consider it simply as a drama, it's compelling, exciting, full of well-developed and distinctive characters and ultimately , a suspenseful contemporary thriller that hits close to home. <br /> <br /> Historical note: for some, especially those in the energy sector and the residents of Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania subway area, it struck maybe a little too close to home, like less than a week after this movie was released, the devastating explosion at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant occurred. <br /> <br /> Update, 04/08/2007: In almost a decade since I wrote this criticism for the first time, I have heard many comments about the film. One thing that I think is really worth noting is that this film is not the "ultra-liberal" anti-nuclear tirade that is often labeled as. <br /> <br /> While the creators and stars are (or were) liberal "Hollywood" notables, what this film attacks is not the very idea of ​​nuclear energy, but rather the idea of ​​human greed, of corruption and fallibility that question the potential risks of something that nature has already made dangerous. <br /> <br /> No one who accepts reality can argue that human exposure to nuclear radiation is at least quite likely to be fatal. My closest friends who have been working at a nuclear power plant for several years have even told me their employer's official policy on the highest "safe" exposure levels that his employees could handle. <br /> <br /> You must not believe that corporations are inherently bad for accepting that individuals, in search of wealth and power, are greedy and often corrupt. And even if this assertion is refuted, it cannot be disputed that all human beings are prone to make mistakes. When it comes to exposing innocent people to nuclear radiation, we can't afford mistakes, and this, more than anything else, is the argument this film tries to make. Condemn him if you have to, but try to get a little perspective. At the moment we are engaged in a war whose ongoing results are very different from those initially foreseen, an incredibly expensive war with no end in sight. And if you think the war is necessary to fight global terrorism, you cannot dispute the reality that the length, the financial cost and, above all, the loss of human life have far exceeded the levels that the "experts" have assured of new in 2003. So, although no one involved is greedy or corrupt, "mistakes were made" and errors of a rather serious scale, to boot. The same kind of serious errors, if allowed to the nuclear industry, could make most of the earth's surface uninhabitable.
