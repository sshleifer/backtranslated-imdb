This film failed miserably in the UK, and did not deserve. The trailer for this film is slightly misleading, and I imagine it could mislead critics and the public into thinking it was "Atonement: Part 2". While the film was marketed that way to capitalize on the previous success of Joe Wright's BAFTA-winning film, it is very different in tone. He focuses on a genre imagination of the life of the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas during the Second World War as author of propaganda films for the war effort and his subsequent return to Wales. Director John Maybury quickly introduces Dylan's childhood friend (Matthew Ryhs) Vera Phillips, played by Keira Knightley. It was Dylan's first love in their homeland, but the moment has passed and the singer Vera only wants it as a nice memory. Or her? Vera unexpectedly reaches a close bond with the other woman in Dylan's life, "Queen of Ireland, love of my life, mother of my son" Caitlin Thomas (Sienna Miller). The three form a sort of menage a trois in war-torn London, but Vera falls in love with a precipitous soldier, William Killick (Cillian Murphy). They get married quickly, with Killick leaving for the war. A frightened Vera convinces Thomas to bring her back to Wales, but the three are faced with the realism of the birth of Vera's son, William's jealousy and shock after returning home, and Caitlin realizes he can't share Dylan with his best friend. <br /> <br /> Shot on a low budget, this is more of a mood mood than anything else. It works best as a realization that some memories and feelings must be appreciated but not renewed. Sienna Miller's performance is particularly exaggerated (unfortunately the absurdities of the paparazzi distract the fact that she is a real talent), and Knightley and Murphy are once again very good. The delirium is Rhys as Dylan, who, while the Welsh poet himself was not a bed of roses, lacks charisma and makes us ask what these women see in Dylan. The writing is very moving, some beautiful moments interspersed with sloppiness. It is certainly worth looking at, however.
