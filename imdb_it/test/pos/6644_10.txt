A grueling watch, but one of Bergman's best films. Interesting to compare with The Hour of the Wolf, as both have the same main actors as artists (or an artist and his wife) who have taken refuge on an island. In the previous film, most of the inner demons lead to von Sydows disintegrating the personality (at least that's the way I read it) while here there are many circumstances beyond his control. <br /> <br /> Much has been written about the central non-sympathetic characters, particularly those of von Sydow. For me there are flashes of a good (if imperfect) man at the beginning of the film, but one that tackles adversity badly. The defects become all that remains as his humanity is gradually eroded by one horror after another. <br /> <br /> I saw a Passion (Ullmann and von Sydow on their island again) soon after, and was amazed to recognize many of the same positions. And then there's a dream sequence ...
