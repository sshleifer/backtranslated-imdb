After searching for 6 months, I finally found this DVD. All I can say is that it was worth the wait! "Rush in Rio" could be the biggest existing rock DVD. I'm not kidding. It's incredible! All the commotion for the sound is disgusting, but it doesn't make the concert unwatchable. I find it makes you feel like you're really in Rio watching the concert from the audience. This is one of the reasons I love this DVD. It makes you feel like you're really there. Moreover, Geddy, Alex and Neil have never been in better shape! Geddy's voice is impeccable, Alex's guitar is still incredible and Neil - absolutely no words to say. The camera work on this concert was very good, I have to say. They gave us a good look at everything that was happening on stage and in the audience. Congratulations to the cameramen! However, enough of my delirium! Go watch "Rush in Rio" for yourself. You will be amazed. I guarantee it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
