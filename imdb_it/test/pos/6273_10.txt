Expectacular THE ATOR's second part !! Quickly directed by JOE D'AMATO, specialist in all types of exploitation subkinds, and reinterpreted by MILES O'KEEFFE. the budget of the debut film is negligible or minimal. Although it is not a better film than its non-entertained antopsies, ATOR 2 also has something, something that makes it interesting. His presentation that propi explains the origin of ATOR with images of the first part. The script is incredible, it's like every comic by the brilliant ROY THOMAS. has such fantastic elements in the dle world of the SWORD and such FANTASY as invisible men, black gentlemen, cannibals - monkeys ... the role of the villain played by this brilliant. The final this fight very well. Violence and blood are lacking, but this is good. It never gets boring. It has everything that was missing ATOR 1. Let yourself be enchanted by my !! 4/5
