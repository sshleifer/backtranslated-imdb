Until I did a web search on "What Alice Found", I didn't realize that the name of the film was engraved in the title of one of Lewis Carroll's books. The full title of the book is "Through the mirror (and what Alice has found)". <br /> <br /> The film's Alice comes from a very different background than that of Lewis Carroll's Alice. Its fresh and decisive character, however, is similar. The film Alice begins as a young woman in New Hampshire who steals money from her boss who takes the piss and leaves for Miami, vaguely planning to study marine biology and play with dolphins. He meets a middle-aged couple in a camper (her husband is retired from the military) who saves her from a strange man at the roadside stop and from the collapse of her car (perhaps caused by their mechanization). <br /> <br /> Apparently, the couple is heavily involved in prostitution for trucks and sees sweet young Alice as a promising recruit. The wife (played by Judith Ivey in a show worthy of a grand prize) buys Alice sexy and shows her how to apply hot makeup. Initially, Alice passively accepts her care and, with the couple's instructions, does several tricks. The meeting shown in detail is very different from most movie sex, but it can be typical of what happens most often in real life. The man is shy and deferential and apologizes for "ending" too quickly. <br /> <br /> What is wonderful about Alice (and different from her prototypes from Clarissa to Sister Carrie) is that she learns from her experiences and asserts herself. Here's how things really are. Prostitution is everywhere. People are neither good nor bad. Alice leaves the camper with her deserved money and a feeling of mutual respect.
