The Black Castle is one of those films that found its way into a collection by Boris Karloff and is supposed to be a real horror movie. While some horror elements exist in Nathan Juran's film, this is indeed a multi-genre piece that is strictly produced and effectively portrayed. Joining Karloff, in what is a small but critical role, are Richard Greene, Stephen McNally, Lon Chaney Jr, Rita Corday, John Hoyt and Michael Pate. It is produced, without surprises, by Universal International Pictures. The plot sees the English gentleman of Greene going to the house of the castle of the left Conte von Bruno {McNally}. He is following an investigation into the disappearance of two friends, an investigation that is fraught with dangers and surprises at every turn. <br /> <br /> This has everything the fans of the old dark house / castle sub-genre could want. Genuine good and bad, a beautiful maiden, dark corners for dark deeds, diabolical traps, the ticking of the final clock and we also got a good old-fashioned cloak-and-dagger. The cast is turning into effective performances, in particular Greene and the wonderful mockery McNally. While the screenplay by Jerry Sackheim is streamlined and devoid of the useless filler that has so often bogged similar films of this kind. A highly recommended film provided that Karloff fans understand that it is not a Karloff film, and perhaps more importantly, that horror fans do not expect blood to be the order of the day. A beautiful atmospheric story with a sense of terror, The Black Castle is a beautiful visual experience. 7/10
