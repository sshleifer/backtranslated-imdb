The story told by The Cranes Flying is not, let's face it, all that is original. The young lovers are separated by war; bad things happen to both. We have already seen this many times. <br /> <br /> However, we have not seen it filmed well, with bold shots that take liberties to emphasize separation, destruction or despair. Even more remarkable from the Soviet Union, and reason to conclude that Tarkovsky is not the last word in Soviet cinema of the modern era. <br /> <br /> I was reading Chekhov's "Three Sisters" the other day, and I fell over what the meaning of this film's title may be. In Act 2, Masha objects to the idea that we must live our lives without meaning or understanding: <br /> <br /> "MASHA: Surely humanity must believe in something, or at least seek the truth, otherwise life it's just Empty, empty To live and not know why cranes fly, why babies are born, why there are stars in the sky, or you have to know why you're alive, or everything is trivial - senseless senseless. " has difficulty believing that the war, and the suffering of her and of others, have been useless. Better to give meaning, to live as if one's life were meaningful, and not to give in to despair. It is perhaps this way of thinking that pushes her to her final act in the film. <br /> <br /> BTW as a small correction to another comment here - there may be a V model in the film, although I didn't notice them myself. But the first letter of Veronika's name is not a further example of this; in the Cyrillic alphabet, its name begins with a letter that looks like an English "B".
