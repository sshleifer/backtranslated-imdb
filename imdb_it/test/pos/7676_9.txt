I've been looking for this film for years. I have great memories of acting and singing first quality in this film. I never knew that the reason the film could not be found was because of the actions of the Gershwin family - SHAME ON THEM for trying to suppress American Classic !! I can only hope that they yield and allow this film to be distributed and appreciated by the American public. <br /> <br /> Sammy Davis, Jr. is at his absolute best in this film. The only other show of this is that it is the same as "Anna Lucasta" - another fantastic film that I would like to see released on DVD. <br /> <br /> Porgy & Bess contained a top-quality, die-cast all-star. I hope you will see yourself one day.
