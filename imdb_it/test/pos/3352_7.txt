Alice enters a world of wonder ... but not the kind of wonder you remember as a child. The Mad Hatter, the White Rabbit, the Queen and others (also Tweedledee and Tweedledum) show Alice some things about her body - and the body of other people - that could be wonderful. A story of love and lust you've never seen. <br /> <br /> Kristine DeBell looks like Alice. I must say, by the standards of the 70s, that this could be the most attractive adult actress of her time. I think this is his only film before turning to mainstream work, but it was the best possible (my love for all things, Alice is no secret). Even better than "Fairy Tales" (which in reality is not pornography, therefore, much). <br /> <br /> The songs are poor, but they fit the theme of the movie. A song, "What's a Girl Like You Doing on a Knight Like This?" it was pretty funny, and the others had similar themes going on. The process towards the end was well scripted and fits very well into the world of Alice. Logic and humor have certainly been taken into consideration. <br /> <br /> What else can you say about a movie like this? All I know is, for people who are used to adult movies where it's only a 30 second lead-in to sex, this will overload you with plot and music. But, personally, I think there's something very special about this movie and I hope you get a nice DVD version with things done and special features (if possible). I can see this being a cult movie.
