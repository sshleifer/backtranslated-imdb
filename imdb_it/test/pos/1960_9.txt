I've seen this movie a number of times and find it very compelling and sad. The lack of real emotions from most characters is very disturbing. They look empty, hopeless. The story is based on a real event. <br /> <br /> A teenage girl is killed by her boyfriend for no apparent reason - apparently he just felt that way. Then he brags about it with his friends and since they don't believe him he leads them to see the body - a number of times. No one reports the murder. There are two strong lines: Keanu Reeves and Crispen Glover - The character of Crispen Glovers is seriously annoying. <br /> <br /> The character of Keanu, Matt, seems to be the only one to have a sense of right and wrong. This is Keanu at its best - a flawless and very credible performance - anyone who thinks this man can't act should watch this movie. Matt's little brother is almost the most disturbing character in the film. Only twelve and no compassion or love factor in his life. It is very sad to think that there are children out there in this way. Makes you really grateful for what you have. 9/10.
