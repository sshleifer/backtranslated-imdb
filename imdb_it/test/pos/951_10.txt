if you haven't seen Vijay in "Ghillli", "Gilly" or "Ghillie". go watch it Wow. it's terribly hilarious. I don't know if Dharani (the brilliant director) was serious or not. There are a lot of sexy guys in this, looking for someone to call Velu "Maacha". The one with the brilliant braids, devastatingly hot. His teeth are also brilliant. Vijay rocks. Trisha cries every 5 seconds. It's very deep. Watch it, you won't regret it. There are some great laughs in this. If you don't speak Tamil, learn. So you will get all the inside lines. It's one for the whole family, except maybe the violent bits should be skipped. I saw this movie about eleven times .... and counting. <br /> <br /> Wow!
