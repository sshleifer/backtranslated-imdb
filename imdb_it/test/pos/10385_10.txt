looks like the betting movie I've ever seen. not too much for intelligent perception but so rich for sensitive perception. Antonioni is comparable to his film. Malkovich is so organic, the roles are so real, the situations are so real. I changed my view of the world after this cinema. I'm a beginner scholar in Russia - Tolstoy and Dostoevsky's country - and I'm pretty sure that watching Antonioni is nice and fun for the russkies, because I and we understand his point of view. so I don't understand his minor attacks on IMDb. I'm sure that, speaking from Russia and our people, we like Antonioni for his romantic soul and the positive feeling of the surrounding reality
