One of Alfred Hitchcock's three biggest films, along with "Psycho" and "The 39 Steps", "Strangers on a Train" is brilliantly out of control like a Metcalf carousel, and almost as lethal. It's the kind of movie you really enjoy watching, you can't even feel guilty until you have time to catch your breath. <br /> <br /> The contender for top amateur tennis Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets a strangely strange and curious stranger named Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train. Thanks to the gossip pages, Bruno knows everything about Guy's problems with his non-wife Miriam, and rather happily suggests doing each other a favor: Bruno will kill Miriam and Guy will kill Bruno's father, who wants to put Bruno in an institution . Guy laughs, but Bruno is not joking, as Guy finds out at his own risk. <br /> <br /> It's a big premise for a story of murders, and Hitchcock gives "Strangers On A Train" a run for everyone's worth, with Walker's help in perhaps the biggest performance in any Hitchcock films, including Anthony Perkins in "Psycho". While Perkins makes his mark playing playfully against the grain, Walker as Anthony is perfectly at ease either buttering old ladies at a surprise dinner or strangling a young woman in an amusement park. <br /> <br /> What drives Bruno? Many commentators suggest that his apparent homosexuality finds a correspondence in the handsome boy. Yes, Bruno turns on the old gay-dar, but Guy looks happy enough for the bounce of love with the socialite Anne Morton (Ruth Roman). Bruno's interest in Guy could easily be envy, because someone makes a sign in the world while living at home, letting Mommy give him his nails. <br /> <br /> "Oh, I certainly admire people who do things," Bruno purrs, looking like a cat watching a mouse. "You know, it must be pretty exciting to be so important." <br /> <br /> Later, Bruno calls himself a "tramp", quite precise except for our radical interest in him, even if he destroys Guy's life with his murderous interference. It is the perverse perverse story. There is a sense of integrity towards Bruno, in his obstinate dedication, which commands our respect and which Hitchcock interprets so brilliantly. When Bruno moves away from the scene of his great crime, am I the only sick person in the world who is really happy for him? I think not, yet Hitchcock keeps the story on a path just enough to make us understand how low we have fallen. We don't want Bruno to win, exactly, but we like his momentum as he tries. <br /> <br /> Everything else is so perfect, or at least close enough, to make every shot memorable. Hitchcock has always managed at least 2-3 good sequences per film; here you get about twenty at the amusement park alone. ("20 Great Shows" says the neon side at the entrance, and they're not kidding.) Script, working with the camera, a compelling tennis match, the staggering figure of Ruth Roman, it's too much for a movie that must to contain . Granger also does his young-student stuff here with more plausible plausibility than Gregory Peck has ever handled. <br /> <br /> You can call it a clinic in the cinema, but the "clinic" seems too boring. "Strangers On A Train" is a pretty bad fun, all the way down, leaving you with a nice sting to the tail while you realize that you were cheering for the foreigner always wrong. Hell, I'll take that trip back in a second!
