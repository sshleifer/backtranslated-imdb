For those of you who have wondered what a monster art film could be like, don't ask for more. The DAIMAJIN trilogy, circa 1966, was just such a series. More epics of vintage samurai than anything else, these three films are also characterized by one of the most (literally) monstrous deux et machinas of all time. There is not a single aspect of these gems that is not polished, from the scenario (s) to the performances for the art of the director. Even the special effects are managed with skills well above the average and are integrated (in most cases) almost without interruption in the films. If you are a GOJIRA fan or a fan of samurai movies or one of us who likes a good movie regardless of genre, I highly recommend the DAIMAJIN trilogy.
