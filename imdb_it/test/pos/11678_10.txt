THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILER! The Decline of Western Civilization ...... what a beautiful title eh? And a great movie. This is the best concert film I've ever seen. The second is the Talking Heads movie "Stop Making Sense". I heard about this film for the first time when Waynes World was released in 1992. I looked at the name of director Penelope Spheeris and thought a nice name, what else did you direct? I thought the first name was pronounced like an envelope. After some time looking at the film guides I came across the acclaimed decline and realized that Penelope was a woman ..... my mother corrected me. I spent 8 years of my life trying to track it down. I finally saw it on VHS in Vancouver, where I currently reside. It was worth the wait. This captures LA's punk movement very well. This is a painful thing for best friends. My favorite is the band the Germs who need subtitles for the lyrics, because Darby Crash sings so crazy, you can't understand it. I laughed when I saw this. The band Black Flag lives in an abandoned church and the band X is a very clever group. Even laughing at the letter an idiot writes about Slash Magazine about how we don't need to save whales, there are countless miles of ocean to get us toxins! I became a big fan of Penelope Spheeris after this, and I saw all his punk-Dudes movies was OK, and Suburbia is a cult classic! I have both on VHS. She's a real underground filmmaker and I love her stuff. I would have liked to have seen this film in 1994, when grunge was so popular. I was a big fan of Nirvana then, but unfortunately I saw it in 2002 and at that point I grew up from grunge and now I listen to Crystal Method / Fatboy Slim. A nice change of pace, I know, but what can you do? But if you want a true representation of the punk movement, it captures it better than anything else. Much better than 1991: The Year Punk Broke. This is a difficult film to track down, but if you get your hands on it, rent it, even if you don't like music, it's an excellent job. Nowadays it might be easier to find it with such popular DVDs. Among other things, Penelope has produced a little-known film by Albert Brooks entitled "Real Life" which I too own. Very funny stuff in today's craptacular reality TV! Rent Decline ...... Highly recommended! Thank you!
