I have been a fan of Mario for as long as I can remember, I have very fond memories of playing Super Mario World as a child, this game brought back many of those memories by adding something new. Super Mario Galaxy is the latest installment of the fantastic Mario franchise. There is a lot of this game very different from any other Mario before it, while keeping Mario's greatest elements intact, the first obvious difference is that the story takes place in space. <br /> <br /> The story begins like any other Mario game, Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to a party at his castle in the Mushroom Kingdom. Upon arrival at Peach Castle, Mario finds Bowser and his son (Bowser Jr.) attacking the castle with their airships. Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and then raises her castle in space. In the middle of the castle that is raised in space, Mario falls and lands on an unknown planet. Mario is found by a talking star named Luma and is taken back to the house of Luma, a floating space station, here Mario meets many other Lumas and also meets their leader, a woman named Rosalina. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser has taken away the stars of the space station's power and scattered them across the universe, it's up to Mario to help the Lumas find them and save Peach, so the adventure begins. <br /> <br /> you play the game by flying from the space station to other galaxies, each galaxy is made up of multiple planets that Mario travels through the levels through these shooting stars to retrieve the stars of power. Mario can often walk on all the planets without losing gravity, some planets are small and others large, many planets are similar to the classic environments of Mario. The best thing about the game is the controls, all the things like jumping and it's always the same, but the Wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game. By shaking the remote control, Mario will perform a lap that will be used as the main attack in the game and will also activate shooting stars. You can also point the remote on the screen and use the pointer to shoot star points at enemies or objects in the environment. Then there's the graphics, these are by far the best graphics on the Wii, it's so hard to describe how good this game is, you could almost say it looks as good as some 360 ​​games. <br /> <br /> My the only drawback is that the upside down effect takes some time to get used to, and the story is also quite weak. The worst part is that you lose all your lives when you shut down the game, no matter how many you had when you stopped starting anew with 4 lives. Apart from these minor problems, it is a superb game that is very fun and very challenging. This is the kind of game we've been waiting for on the Wii. <br /> <br /> A perfect 10 out of 10!
