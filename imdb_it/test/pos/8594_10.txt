I feel very fortunate to have the opportunity not only to watch this film, but also to learn more about this fascinating person and time. Lumumba is an exceptional portrait, which gives a full sense of history without falling into the usual plots of Hollywood - yes, it is shown with his wife and children, but the essence of history is his politics and those of the independent Congo still emerging. The film is brilliantly realized, moving at a constantly engaging pace. I can't wait to see more Raoul Peck films, as well as others by Eric Ebouaney!
