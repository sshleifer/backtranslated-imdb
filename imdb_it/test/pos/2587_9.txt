Working in a cinema as a projectionist, I have the opportunity to watch virtually all the movies that come out. When I first saw the trailer for "Black Snake Moan" I laughed and thought, "Fantastic, another Samuel L Jackson film on Snakes on a Plane". But of course I wanted to see him for the laughing factor. Many people have judged this film too quickly based on the insinuations in the title, the images on the promotional announcements and the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the film. I personally loved every second of this film. It tells the story of an older man and a young woman who are going through difficult times and are able to reach each other. The story is really touching and sends a great message about life and how we live. Of course, I don't recommend it to a young audience due to some graphic material, but if you're looking for a great story and a genuine acting by Sam Jackson, Christina Ricci and, yes, even by Justin Timberlake, I encourage you to see "Black Snake Moan '.
