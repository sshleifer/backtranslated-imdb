I liked 'Den brysomme mannen' http://ow.ly/PTTp (my wife didn't do it, so I watched it in a few days.) <br /> <br /> The reviewers mostly got confused - most agree is allegorical but not of what; "Paradise", "Hell", "Socialism", "Capitalism"? <br /> <br /> That many people do not wish to escape, and it is essentially forbidden to go with most of these options. <br /> <br /> So, presumably, you should project your favorite worry / prejudice / fear on it. <br /> <br /> So I would say that it is an epicurean life. A desaturated live of colors, literally in the film, figuratively in the interpretation.
