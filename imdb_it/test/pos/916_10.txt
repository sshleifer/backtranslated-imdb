"Rouge" is part of a trilogy, but stands out on its own. It is not a sequel of any kind. The end, which I won't divulge, ties the three films together, but not seeing the other two doesn't make it too confusing. <br /> <br /> This film amazes me because it's so gaunt, so thin and simple, but it's just as effective, emotionally and intellectually, as any big-budget show or star melodrama. Here Kieslowski investigates the phenomenon of chance and destiny. Both themes are woven together in the story. The film is really a puzzle, but the message is quite simple: everything happens for a reason. Love is in all our destinies as long as we open ourselves to it. The title "Red" refers to the French flag, where red represents "fraternity" or brotherhood. The color dominates the graphics of the film. I tend to think of it as representing love or passion or the blood of life. It's great when a movie gives you the freedom to do it;)
