Being relatively young, I didn't know how bad anti-Semitism was in Brooklyn, where my family comes from. This film has absolutely shocked me. I have seen many films on prejudice, racism and anti-Semitism, but this has struck me most of all. <br /> <br /> This was definitely one of the best indie movies I've ever seen. I had to travel 45 minutes to see it, and it was worth it. Almost everything about the film was great. Sometimes it was a bit slow, but that didn't bother me because the film was very impressive. It took place in the 1940s, and it really felt like it was the 40s. The acting was great ... William H. Macy as always was wonderful, as was Laura Dern, and I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of Meatloaf, playing the violent anti-Semitic neighbor. <br /> <br /> 9/10
