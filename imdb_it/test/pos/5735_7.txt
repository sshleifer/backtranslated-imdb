A bit of a curate's egg, this one. I started to hate him, with his predictable script of "Old Dark House", are constant references to the recent horrors of the United States and regular journeys up and down corridors poorly lit. <br /> <br /> But it goes on and has moments of originality. <br /> <br /> I started wondering, once the killing started, how they could last with a cast of six, but then we received flashbacks for a previous visit to the building and a lot of bloody killings that it is quite effective. <br /> <br /> Naschy is fine and in the end it was a pretty funny movie. Simply don't jump on and grab one, strong enough.
