in a period of predictable films, in which violence, economic romanticism and melodrama abound, it is amazingly surprising to find such a strange film. the plot itself is compelling and the actors are excellent, especially Alan Rickman. If you want to see a movie that doesn't provide all the answers before asking the questions, a film that will surprise you (for better or for worse), Dark Harbor is for you. And if you're not convinced, believe me Alan Rickman's performance is worth it ... especially in the end, sir ...
