Witchery, or Witchcraft as it is commonly known in Europe, beings with Jane Brooks (Linda Blair) who wakes up from a nightmare involving a witch. Jane's Mother & Father Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) are interested in buying an old desert hotel on an island about 50 miles from Boston, renovating and reopening it. Together with Jane and their young son Tommy (Michael Manchester) Rose & Freddie are planning to go to the island with an architect named Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) to check the amount of work they have to do, but they also encounter the agent Jerry Giordano (Rick Farnsworth) and hire a local fisherman named Sam (George Stevens) to take them to the island. Once they arrive, they enter the hotel and begin to inspect the property as they return to the boat, Sam is killed and the boat is left free to set sail in the distance. They discover two unexpected guests in the form of a photographer named Gary (David Hasselhoff) and his virgin girlfriend Leslie (Leslie Cumming) who is looking for a book that is writing about the gruesome legends and superstitions surrounding the infamous island and hotel. As the night attracts a raging storm outside it isolates them from the mainland while a mysterious 'lady in black' (Hildegard Knef) continues to sprout while the ancient evil that resides in the hotel seeks new victims for demonic possession, human sacrifices and rites satanic ... <br /> <br /> The director of this film is a bit shrouded in mystery as the IMD lists Fabrizio Laurenti as Martin Newlin but there are rumors that Joe D'Amato has honored, in either case to be honest, despite his bad reputation, I found Witchery quite funny in a poor and so good way. The script attributed to Harry Spalding and Daniele Stroppa on IMDb is again confused because the real merit of the film is Daniel Davis, however anyone who has written this thing has done a decent job, please stop laughing. In the end it is a horror of a haunted house, but adds some bloody death and a surreal feeling to everything. The different character sets have reasonable motivations and they didn't give me so much nerve as I thought they could, it's not very well drawn, it doesn't make much sense and the dialogue isn't exactly high-level stuff but overall Witchery entertained me for its duration of 95 minutes, simple and simple. It's reasonable enough, a little slow to go on, but there's a lot of surreal, bizarre and macabre deaths to keep you amused. A part of Witchery that destroys part of its credibility is this so-called storm, there is no storm in sight and the sea is probably calm enough to swim in, the supposed final 'twist' of Witchery did not work for me even controls stupid expression on Cummings face on that final still image. The hotel offers a good secluded location and adds a certain atmosphere to the film which has the essential horror imprint of everything, the economic horror in this. Technically Witchery is not bad at all, it was obviously shot outdoors, so it looks good and, although it's not exactly the pinnacle of the film's finesse, its overall production values ​​are slightly better than expected. Violence and blood are typical exemplary clarity, a woman has her lips sewn and hung inside a fireplace so that she cannot scream while others light it, someone is crucified and then burned alive, impaled on a swordfish , the veins expand & pop & a woman is raped by a man without lips. Witchery was shot in English so there is no dubbing, as for the acting David Hasselhoff and Linda Blair in the same movie what else can I say?! Yes, the Hasselhoff ladies take off their shirts and for the Cummings boys take them off. Both Hasselhoff and Blair are excited to see this, but the child is very annoying and cannot act. I'm sure most movie goers won't agree with my opinions, but I still like the fact that I liked it and would look at it again happily, Witchery is a lot of fun and definitely deserves a watch if it's movies "bad guys" or horror fans in general.
