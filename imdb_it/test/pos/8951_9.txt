A very beautiful love story between Brenda Blethyn and Alfred Molina. The whole story is very bizarre and funny. A gravedigger (A. Molina) loves a married woman (B.Blethyn). They try to pretend his death to escape from her husband and the village. Start a scenario of strange situations. Good as SAVINGS GRACE and LONG LIVE NED DEVINE.
