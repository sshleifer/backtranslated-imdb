How do the bear's paw, the elephant's trunk or the monkey's brain go to dinner? Let Tsui Hark tell you in this wonderful and carefree comedy about the art of cooking the traditional (?) Chinese way. <br /> <br /> This film shares the common structure of an American sports film, but instead of focusing on baseball it focuses on the kitchen, which makes it even more interesting. I also think that the character of Leslie Cheung looks a lot like Charlie Sheen in the Major League ... <br /> <br /> This film also contains some Zhao Wen Zhao versus Xiong Xin Xin fighting (the love that sees it more after The Blade) and a rather amusing in-joke about a pop song by Leon Lai ... <br /> <br /> Maybe it's not the ideal movie for the strict vegetarian.
