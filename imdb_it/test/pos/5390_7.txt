Gary Cooper is a fashionable guy. I've always liked his easy level characters. As some others have commented, there are some quirks in the script, like a US Marshall who got his job and can't even hit a barn with a gun. A farmer with thirty hands, but he seems unable to keep his cattle at bay. <br /> <br /> But there is a lot of thinking, shooting Cooper directly to keep you entertained. <br /> <This film was made in 1950. People in their 20s and 30s have difficulty understanding that those films were made for entertainment and not for the Oscars. <br /> <br /> Wait for Oscar's material to do this injustice of the film. It's about good guys who find a way to gather the bad guys. <br /> <br /> So rent, borrow or buy this movie, make some corn and enjoy the Coop again.
