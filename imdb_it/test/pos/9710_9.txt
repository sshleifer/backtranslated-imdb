Yes. Bam cried a couple of times and so did Englund. And most likely you will too. The entire cast is back in action and Knoxville has stepped up to become the real leader of this band of retarded messengers (I mean this in the best way). I thought for the first time, maybe Bam or Steve-O were the main ones to go to ... guys, no, the main man is now Johnny. Don't get me wrong, everyone, and I want to say that everyone is great in this movie! From the beginning you're laughing, and believe me, don't think about putting your smile away. Personally, I think the film certainly has better moments than the first. You know when you go to a theater, and you don't want to have high expectations for this ... well, this movie erases all expectations. If you love Jackass, you can enter this with gigantic expectations. No matter what your ass will laugh at. If you're not laughing, the reason is probably that someone has a gun in your face telling you if you're laughing or maybe you're embarrassed by the sound of your laughter or the highest probability is you were eating Jack Sh! T for breakfast and Jack left the city. All I have to say is, get ready to have a sore face after the movie. :)
