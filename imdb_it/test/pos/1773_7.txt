This is one of the many maritime yarns of the time, which has the added distinction (although not unique in itself) of a female buccaneer in the center. At the beginning, both protagonists - Jean Peters and Louis Jourdan - may seem uncomfortable, but eventually they will grow pleasantly in their roles, thanks without doubt to talented players (Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez and James Robertson Justice) who support them. Marshall's velvety voice is unusually cast as the philosophical obligation of a doctor's ship, and Gomez is suitably larger than the life of Blackbeard The Pirate. <br /> <br /> The cast is completed by Debra Paget as Jourdan's wife, who incurs the jealous rage of the titanic and tomboyish character in which Jourdan instills the first pangs of love (which, however, does not spare him flogging occasional or sword wound); Incidentally, the film was Jourdan and Paget's second exotic team in a year, after Delir Daves' BIRD OF PARADISE. The direct result of this unexpected softening of Anne's character is her fall with Blackbeard's crew, and her unlikely climate sacrifice to save the lives of the asphalt Jourdan, Paget and Marshall. <br /> <br /> While the film is not an exceptional example of its kind, the energetic direction of Jacques Tourneur and the grandiose score of Franz Waxman ensure an above-average effort that proceeds at a steady pace; By the way, Tourneur had already done the service in the genre with the superior vehicle Burt Lancaster, THE FLAME AND THE ARROW (1950). As usual with vintage Technicolor productions, cinematography gives the film a sumptuousness that is invigorating. By the way, for this film there are different execution times (81 or 87 minutes) and, for the record, the version I looked at was the shortest.
