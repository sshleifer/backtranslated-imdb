many people said that this film was not a good movie, in a horror perspective I agree, it wasn't very scary, it had some macabre ways of torture yes (the hooks go where they shouldn't) but not scary. but it was a nice comedy film, I thought it was hilarious, such a bad dee snider acting with his stupid theological questions and every second word he said came up as "what is____, define______", so the crowd angry at his home with one of them holding a sign saying "we won't make it" (which is a song by his twisted band sister) but I think the part that made me laugh the most was the wife of a guy who was dead and dee snider held her in his arms and making her dance, when I saw that I was bursting into tears ... so I wouldn't recommend it to horror fans, but for those who love horror for his comedy I recommend this 100% film
