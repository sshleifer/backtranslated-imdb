I remember capturing this film in a C4 screening a year ago and was completely amazed by the whole thing. I thought the film could represent such a diversity of genres; the supernatural, a love story, the intrigue of crime and many others. <br /> <br /> I was fascinated by the whole thing after about a minute and was really worried about the characters. It made me feel terrified a second for Jimmy, and then he made me laugh at the gangsters in the next ... and all the time I crossed my fingers that things would work for Jimbo! <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger and Rose Bryne are superb, Bryan Brown is of absolute quality and made me bend, along with David Field, who was fun as well as being an evil idiot. <br /> <br /> Since I saw this movie I was able to order it on DVD and as a result, every person to whom I show it was hooked in much the same way. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect for a Sunday afternoon or a lazy evening, and it's one you can really enjoy with your friends around.
