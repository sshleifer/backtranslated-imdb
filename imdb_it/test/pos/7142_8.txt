The 90s movie with Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger is rightly awash with praise, and I liked it a lot, but this original TV is just as good, and somehow, more appropriate. Claire Bloom is not a brazen Joy, but she is still confident and launches her cap to her favorite author (played by Joss Ackland in one of her best performances). <br /> <br /> More calm, calmer and less emotional than the Attenborough film could be, but it does justice to what is a wonderful game full of meaningful dialogues. You will still cry at this version, but perhaps you will not have the musical instructions to make you escape. <br /> <br /> There is room for both - and having seen this on stage, I would say that the Ackland / Bloom one is slightly more faithful. But they are both excellent.
