In this story of a wounded Christian family that has three of its four members "reborn" after a car accident caused by a cake, what stands out is its majority, where there is so much potential to overcome at the top, and how much most of the acting is truly inspired. Where most of the film's moments, especially its frank and "innocent" discussions of sexuality after three of the four family members removed guilt and shame, are hilarious, it's also inspiring and the characters stay with you. <Br /> <br /> How many times, for example, does a character in a comedy run from almost caricature to being full-bodied during a scene? How many times do we see a cast that can pull back from the sentence in the middle of showboating, to show some of humanity under the character's skin? Even many of the "bad guys" in this film have moments of sincere honesty, although much of what they do can be absolutely ridiculous and terrifying. There is truth and history behind even the most questionable actions in this film, which is a difficult task in satire. <br /> <br /> How refreshing it is to see a dark comedy that can dare to be humanist. How nice to see actors so fully engaged with the character that they can dare to be ridiculous and sublime. <br /> <br /> And as a gay person, I don't think I've ever been so touched by a heterosexual sex scene as I was since the first sexual encounter between the parents of this family after their accident. <br /> <br /> Bravo. Good boy. One of my favorites at Outfest this year.
