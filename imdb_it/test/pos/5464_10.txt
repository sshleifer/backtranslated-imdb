Captivating tale of stabs behind the curtains. The film follows the difficult situation of David Letterman and Jay Leno as they fight for the elusive Tonight Show spot. Letterman guided by his desire for the coveted time slot and Leno led by his agent and little devil-on-the-shoulder, Helen Kushnick. <br /> <br /> Kathy Bates (Kushnick) is excellent in this film, alienating herself from dogs like Bob Wright, Warren Littlefield and Howard Stringer. Towards the end of the film you are so entranced by the way it handles every situation from guest bookings to late registration, which you find yourself wanting more. <br /> <br /> John Michael Higgins (Letterman) plays his part in the tee. Sometimes I found myself wondering if he had any relationship with the real Letterman. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in entertainment or the world of business negotiations.
