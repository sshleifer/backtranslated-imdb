I thought it was brilliant! It was nice to watch the presenter track down each one of them. Dwight Schultz still looked the same, he had hardly changed his appearance, nor did Dirk Benedict still look so brazen! I thought Mr. T looked thinner, but it was still nice to see how he took care of him all this time. I thought it took some time to track down the other cast members, like the one who played Decker, and the woman who played Amy. It was just a pity that Mr. T couldn't make the real meeting. It was also a pity that George Peppard died, leaving a void so to speak. I just hope now that I recorded it to keep it. We hope they repeat it again.
