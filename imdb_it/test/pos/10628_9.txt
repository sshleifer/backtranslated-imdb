Isabelle Huppert portrays a talented female piano teacher who is posed, hostile and distant in public, and bitter towards her students. In private, she boils with violence and frustration, and her sex life is lonely and perverse. He lives with his overbearing mother, who drives her obsessively to be noticed (and thus progress in life) as a talented pianist. The key to the characters of mother and daughter is "obsession". These characters cannot change their impulses any more than a rabbit caught in headlights can avoid death. <br /> <br /> The piano teacher meets a young, attractive and talented pianist who is attracted to her from the beginning. They start a relationship in the most unconventional way, but from the beginning she makes perverse and violent terms that she has to perform on her, which annoys him enough to want to interrupt the relationship before it really started. <br /> <br /> The film is linked to the female protagonist. Isabelle Huppert amazes with a brutal and completely convincing performance as a piano teacher. He skillfully shows a woman attracted by beauty and perversion, but his violence is fueled by his perverse impulses. Like a movie that is so driven by the characters, you know it wouldn't have worked half-way if it had acted badly. <br /> <br /> This is powerful, intelligently recited and intelligently and sensitively adapted from the novel. Camera work is also suitable for the film. There is what I can only think of calling, framing shots in which the director holds a scene and forces the eye to dart. This is done extremely effectively against a white bathroom wall, and is further evidence of the director's mastery. <br /> <br /> Expect to be disturbed and disgusted by this movie. But be brave: have the courage to go and see it. This is a very private look in a person's life, but don't expect to be entertained in the sense of Hollywood ... there are no car chases in this movie!
