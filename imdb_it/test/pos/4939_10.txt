BONJOUR, MONSIEUR SHLOMI is simply a wonderful film! Screenwriter / director Shemi Zarhin created a story unlike any other and cast it with actors so consistently consistent that it remains an enigma to me that this film has not become the favorite audience worldwide. He is intelligent, emotional, uplifting and warm, funny, and in all categories he is a winner. Slomi (Oshri Cohen, in a brilliantly undervalued performance) is a 16-year-old boy who takes care of her highly dysfunctional family: her mother ( Esti Zakheim) is disgusting as a toporosa never invented and in a constant state of bad temper due to the betrayal of her husband, and because she is stuck in double shifts to support her sick father-in-law (Ariek Elias, who like Shlomi's grandfather is a brilliant old man , fun, wise and loving that takes great care of Shlomi); a married sister Ziva (Rotem Abuhab) who periodically returns home due to constant gaiters with her husband who does not help her take care of twin children; his brother Sasi (Assi Cohen) whose life is strong electric guitars, braggadocio on female conquests and the favorite son of his mother. Mix this mixture and the result is the penultimate dysfunctional family unit. Shlomi cooks gourmet meals for them, stores, cleans the house, runs errands, takes a bath and takes care of this grandfather and generally leads a life of submission to a family that sees it as a "retard". Sonnomi wants a girlfriend and practically fails his school due to his lack of time devoted to looking after his family and lack of concentration. Surely his mathematics teacher Begin (Nisso Keavia) notices his natural mathematical genius on a discarded test, and with the help of the principal (Yigal Nair) the two encourage him to try and discover that he is a genius (? With dyslexia? ) and arrange for him to try for a special school in Haifa. Shlomi's mother will not hear any of this, but between clashes with Shlomi's absent father (Albert Iluz) and clashes with the teacher and the principal finally agree to his school tests. Meanwhile Shlomi discovers a girl of her age Rona (Aya Koren) who has moved next door and gradually the two intertwine in a physical and intellectual relationship. Still in the background is the support of Shlomi's grandfather, and when his grandfather dies, Shlomi sets off on the journey to live his life for himself, to realize his gifts, to find his happiness. The way in which the family faces this is the peak of the film and it is not necessary to reveal it in order to lose the power of the message. The film is beautifully photographed, the soundtrack is creatively beautiful and the end result is one of exaltation of the human spirit. Highly recommended on all levels. In Hebrew with English subtitles.
