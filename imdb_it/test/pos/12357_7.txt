I thought it would be a more fantastic story. But the subject is rather down to earth than the story on the carriage of Death that I expected. In reality there is much more than a social drama. As usual in the "European authors' films". <br /> <br /> The actors are interesting, not exaggerated as in the medium silent film. The images are not so good as to remain in your mind as in Bergman's Smultronstället. <br /> <br /> This is true, the comparison between the two films is the main point here. Smultronstället begins with the vision of a carriage of death in which the character of Sjöström can see his own body. There are watches without hands. He is forced to look back on what he did wrong. There is a vision of his happy family in the country. In Körkarlen's wife Sjöström does not betray him before his eyes but she wants to run away with the small children because he would never have been better with him. In the end, the Edit confession is a kind of live judgment. <br /> <br /> Well, I would just like to add that Sjöström destroyed the door with an ax because his wife closed it and plans to leave with the children who reminded me of brilliant. Which was more than just a fantasy story with Death lying around.
