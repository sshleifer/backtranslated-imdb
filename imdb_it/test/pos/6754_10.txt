I still can't believe that this film was made in 1934 tonight. The animation is simply perfect, and what is surprising, with all the advanced technology we have today, there are few animation studios that are able to produce a jewel like this one. it has it all: a beautiful story, beautiful chracters (although this is a morbid kind of beauty in some cases), special effects ... well, it's definitely not a children's movie, but it's a must for anyone seriously interested in animation .
