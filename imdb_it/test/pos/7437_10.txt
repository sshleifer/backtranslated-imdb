I can't believe how perfect this movie is. Great CG graphics, good storyline, and fights, oh the fights !!! This movie was awesome !! Characters. They seem real enough to be considered real. They certainly look like the ones in the game perfectly. The scene where ... well, all the scenes made my jaw come. Fantastic graphics 10/10 The plot. Also perfectly explained, the way Aeris comes to help Cloud in many different times in the film. They explain it very well and make your jaw come out of how perfect it is. But repetitive fights take away some stories, but this is only a secondary thing. History 9.5 / 10 Everything else, fantastic. The film was simply fantastic. I really don't know what else I can say except that this movie was pretty much perfect. LOVED IT !!!
