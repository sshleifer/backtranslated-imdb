Rififi is a great film that is overlooked. It's a criminal drama in which a man gets out of prison and plans another job. It's a story too used but this one is different from the others. They collect the usual suspects for the job. This film takes a look at how the family is destroyed over time. The current robbery scene is one of the best I've ever seen. Instead of a suspenseful soundtrack, the director decided to follow the silence, about thirty minutes of silence. This fits the mood perfectly and is often copied these days. Of course things get out of hand and people die and end up in a fantastic ending that accumulates suspense. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for a great film noir that not many people talk about this is a great shot.
