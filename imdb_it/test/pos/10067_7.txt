I am very sad that this film has had many negative criticisms. I think it's a good comedy and really fun. The humor in this film is kind and innocent and I like it. I also like the character of Madonna and I don't agree that she played herself. You have created a character and a nice one. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes were the fighting scene on top of the sinking car and where Madonna climbs over the fence in a costume to claim her love. The humor in the film has a slightly unrealistic touch and maybe it's not everyone's cup of tea. But it's their problem, not the movie. <br /> <br /> I found this film healthy and sunny. In fact, the day I saw it for the first time I was incredibly sad for some reason and this movie brightened my day. And Madonna can act. Take off the glasses of negative thoughts.
