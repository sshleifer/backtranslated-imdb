Well, I'm not going to add to the diatribe that was "preached" about this movie. <br /> <br /> All I can add is that at no time does it pretend to be a "historical" picture. Unlike "Braveheart", "Titanic" or "The Patriot" which all have very credible and serious historical amendments, purely for theatrical effect (the worst apology possible). <br /> <br /> Has everyone got a sense of humor? <br /> <br /> All I can add is a paraphrase of good Captain Macleane: "It looked fantastic <br /> <br /> and we have a damn good laugh". <br /> <br /> - One last point. What amazes me is that there are comments relating to "modern music" in a historical context. I wonder if the same people have made the same judgment on Moulin Rouge. I suggest no
