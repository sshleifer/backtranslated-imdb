Ok guys, here's the deal with this movie. it's not the best, but for all of you 80s kids out there it will bring back fond memories of your childhood. Personally, I love this movie. I still love the rainbow brite and the care bears. so, in my opinion, if you are not a child or you are a child who has loved and / or loves the rainbow brite, you will not like this film at all.
