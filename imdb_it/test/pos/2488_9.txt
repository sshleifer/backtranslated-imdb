Contains Spoilers <br /> <br /> This is a film by Peter Watkins. If one has seen his BBC masterpieces "Cullodden" and "The War Game", one will recognize the style (and his voice) a few seconds after the start. Built in 1971, it is set in the very near future, when the Vietnam war has increased even more and now seems to involve China. Nixon is still president and civil disobedience and the protest is handled with violence using drum courts (outwardly civil with "ordinary citizens" as judges). Since "the construction of the prison cannot keep up", an alternative is introduced: The Punishment Park. Delinquents can choose between severe prison sentences and a manhunt in a hostile environment, in this case an 85 km journey through the Californian desert at 100 Â° F. If they reach an American flag at the end without being captured by the National Guard or by the riot police, they will be released, or they will have to serve their sentence (or be dead, as we shall see). The film is made in a completely documentary style with three European teams covering a court and the course of two groups already convicted. The scenes jump between the court tent, the hunting troops and those sentenced to death. Watkin's poor commentary provides us with basic information (time, temperature, etc.). The courtroom scenes show a kangaroo court on one side and a wide range of other personalities ranging from the real terrorists to the "undesirables" to the clearly innocent (for example a total pacifist who can't even hurt flies). The defense lawyer (who takes his job seriously) must be abused by both parties. What makes these scenes particularly disturbing is their resemblance to the rhetoric of today's retail administration. Meanwhile, some unfortunate events in the desert make it clear that the "rules of the game" do not actually apply. The question remains open, whether it is rigged from the beginning or arbitrariness on the part of the troops due to those events that lead to the result (I suspect it is both). In the end we are back to the starting point with the next group going to "Punishment Park". This description could indicate a heavily distorted (or even demagogic) propaganda film, but it would be misleading. The behavior (all the participants were non-professionals as usual with Watkins) seems real and real (the court scenes can even contain text material from actual contemporary evidence). I would say that this could be sold as the 'real thing' without problems. With "The Forgotten Faces" by Watkins the reaction was "We cannot send it or anyone will believe our real newsreels anymore (because this is indistinguishable from the truth)". With "Punishment Park" it should be the same. Effectively banned in the US, as far as I know, this is a must see that has not lost its power or its relevance (especially today).
