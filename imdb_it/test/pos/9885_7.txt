In "Checking Out", Peter Falk plays an elderly New Yorker who calls his sons home so they can stay with him before he plans to commit suicide. As the film progresses, we can see the flaws of all and other problems. While some people might interpret it as a "moving" film, I especially liked the character of Peter Falk who didn't let anything destroy him, and also that he got agitated in a little obscenity from time to time. <br /> <br /> So, it may not be the best film ever, but it's still worth seeing. I have long thought that Peter Falk has the perfect look to play this kind of role, with his glass eye and all the rest. She also starred Laura San Giacomo, David Paymer, Judge Reinhold and Shera Danese (Falk's wife).
