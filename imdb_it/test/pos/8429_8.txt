I'm a big fan of the 1995 version, which I've seen many times and I consider it a thin and excellent film. This 1971 version I bought yesterday, a little hesitant, but now that I've seen it I'm glad I did, because it's more true for the book and for Austen's insights. The 1995 version has a more dramatic power in large part because it refines many of the characters - in the 1995 version Lady Russell is more snobbish, more manipulative, less really looking for Anne; Sir Walter is even more vain and vapid; Elizabeth is worse; Maria is more unbearable; Mr. Elliot is more smiling; Lady Dalrymple is much more stupid - but I think the features of this 1971 version are closer to the book, to Austen's vision and to the real people of the time. The 1971 version also includes many of the key lines and scenes from the book, including in particular the key scene in the field where Anne listens to Wentworth talking to Louisa (or is it Henrietta?) About the importance of character strength. I found the most subtle and evocative acting of many of the critics here, but the acting in the 1995 version is more powerful. I agree with the criticism that the actress who plays Anne is too old for the part; I searched for her voice on IMDb and she was 38 at the time of filming, when her character should have been 28 years old. I thought his acting was subtle and effective, however. Wentworth is the right age and I found it very convincing. In particular, this 1971 version of Wentworth has much more than its sense of humor and mockery; that of 1995, much more than the sense of power that a sea captain would have and more passion. The admiral in the 1971 version lacks the stormy presence and human warmth of that in the 1995 version and lacks any feeling of power that an admiral would certainly convey; I found it the only really weak element in production. I agree with the others that the setting up of the "falling" scene was too wooden, and did not seem convincing that it would have been so hurt by such a fall. However, it could be that he slammed the back of his head onto the edge of the stone step, which, in that case, would actually produce a very dangerous injury, and make the scene more convincing than the scene in the 1995 version, where she it falls farther, but is devoid of any sharp edges that can plausibly cause an important head injury. As for the costumes that some have criticized, I'm not an expert and I can't answer, but I'll note that none of the Navy characters (Wentworth, Admiral Croft, Benwick, Harville) in the 1971 version wears their uniforms, while in the All 1995 versions constantly wear their imaginative uniforms. I suspect that the 1971 version is accurate and has always bothered me a bit in the 1995 version, since the officers are always in uniform when the nation is clearly at peace and the officers are detached from the active service. My father and grandfather were captains of the American navy in career who commanded aircraft carriers and submarines, and they didn't pass every day in license or in their blue dress. I doubt it was any different 180 years ago. The uniforms give the 1995 version a lot of zing, and I prefer it, but I doubt that historically it is accurate that these officers wore their uniforms so frequently. Finally, it is true, the production values ​​of the 1971 version are much lower than the 1995 version, but given the year (1971), the TV format and the budget, we cannot blame the artists for this. Contemporary viewers who can grant a mental allowance to lower production values ​​can find this version that deserves their time.
