I had the privilege of being one of Still's photographers on the set of "Grand Champion" and enjoyed every minute of the 42 days I worked on the film. I have been in the photography business for 25 years and have worked on 16 films and I can't think of a time when I liked the most to provide my job. The children were wonderful to work with and little Emma Roberts has so much energy that it's a real journey. He even took one of my cameras during rehearsals and started shooting. Some of his images have been used for public relations. I could have made more money working for a production with a bigger budget, but I doubt I would have enjoyed it and I would have been around as many great actors and great people as West I was.
