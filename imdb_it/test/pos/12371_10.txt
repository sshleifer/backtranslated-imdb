Victor Sjostrom's silent film The Phantom Carriage was recently released on DVD with a new soundtrack recorded by KTL. The duo, composed by the American guitarist Stephen O'Malley and the Austrian laptop Peter Rehberg, evoked an extraordinary sound collection to accompany and accentuate the original 1921 movie. A threatening sound introduces each Act and a medley of drones, guitar chords and the feedback passes and diminishes as the dark drama unfolds. <br /> <br /> As impressive as the new soundtrack is, the film remains the real star with its timeless rendering of a dark and dystopian fairy tale. According to this story the last person to die before the stroke of New Year's midnight is condemned to spend a year behind the reins of the eponymous ghost cart, gathering the souls of the dead. This is the fate of the film's anti-hero, David Holm, who has moved on to the painful scrutiny of his life after his untimely death and subsequent meeting with the carriage driver. <br /> <br /> This film is often referred to as a horror film and although this is a suitable label, the real horror here is not in the supernatural elements, but rather in the representation of human suffering in the hands of others. Sjostrom gives a remarkable performance like the Olm, drunk, spiteful and threatening in life, and the miserable and frightened Holm who looks back from the land of the dead and withdraws from his past actions. <br /> <br /> Impressive images abound all over the world. Phantom Carriage and more that compensates for the inevitably limited dialogue. The ominous appearance of midnight is powerfully illustrated through the image of a quadrant that hovers alone in the dark night sky like a second moon. Similarly, the dead are depicted through pioneering semi-transparent images and the ghost carriage scenes on land and sea remain chilling to watch. <br /> <br /> Sjostrom's film deserves its place as one of the most stable silent films of all time and the new KTL soundtrack is a superb accentuation of its themes. This is a must see.
