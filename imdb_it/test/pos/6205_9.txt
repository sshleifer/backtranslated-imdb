This is an extremely addictive series that is well thought out and portrays a sensitive subject with great splendor. We follow Michael Ealy as the FBI undercover agent Darwyn, set to infiltrate a terrified cell led by Farik (Oder Fehr). The series is very well written, and has enough twists to keep you sitting on the edge of your seat waiting for what happens next. <br /> <br /> Michael Ealy is by definition one of the best actors I've ever seen portray an undercover agent. Icy cold outside, but still a good human being below to do his best to keep his head afloat in a thrilling roller coaster ride that the FBI took him on. On the other hand, Oder Fehr has a boy who could adapt to any social scenario. Big and strong, but capable of disappearing into the gray mass if necessary. Highly authoritative and extremely clever. The way the two communicate on the screen is nothing short of spectacular. <br /> <br /> The way the story develops and the level of detail that the script offers makes the whole story extremely believable, and also very true to life. imagine. It's so great that you have the feeling of being insecure, not knowing what could happen in real life. We read about terror every day, and here we are given a nice surprise in an underground world that most of us don't know much about. <br /> <br /> It's a series that will surely come back for more, sitting there on the edge of your seat waiting for next week's episode. He is a sure winner in my eyes, and I have no problems stating that this series is on my list of all-time best.
