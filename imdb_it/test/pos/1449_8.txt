I've never been so surprised by a movie that was so old. Only "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" holds up well, as far as performance is concerned. As someone who saw first-hand heroin addiction, I was shocked at how realistic this film was. Frank Sinatra's performance is absolutely intransigent, realistic and heartbreaking. The director of Otto Preminger is perfect for the film, with long shots and a very mobile camera. <br /> <br /> The performance of Kim Novak is good, as is that of Eleanor Parker. In fact, the entire support cast works very well, with decent performance, as befits the style of this film. The documentary style is part of what keeps this movie updated. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8.0 out of 10
