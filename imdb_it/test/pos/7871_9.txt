I saw this short film on HBO the other day and I loved it. Eight different characters, eight different points of view. At first I was confused by the way the story went on, but then I realized that it was just a scene that was shown over and over, just to show us the different perspectives of the characters. <br /> <br /> At first, you think the clerks are screaming at the teenager for stealing. They speak in their language, which I (and Chris the teenager, played convincingly by Eleonore Hendricks) cannot understand. Employee perspective dispels this vision. I didn't realize how wonderful the short is to the last two scenes. <br /> <br /> Excellent short film. I hope director James Cox can turn the short into a feature film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new movie. <br /> <br />
