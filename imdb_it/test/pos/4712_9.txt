I always wanted to see this movie and when I finally arrived I knew I had a nice surprise when John Boorman's name appeared on the screen. Known above all for his epic films (he directed the first Conan and written Apocalypse Now) put together in the classic Hollywood structure, this fits his catalog perfectly. <br /> <br /> I also cannot express how perfect timing was considering that Myanmar (Burma) is once again experiencing a revolt by monks and students against the military government of the "junta" which is the same (there is It has been a change of leadership since it is basically the same) depicted in the 1988 film. Now more than ever this film needs to be broadcast on television (taken on IFC) due to recent events.
