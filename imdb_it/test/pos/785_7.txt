Well, I'm a big fan of Italian horror and I love the films of directors like Argento, Fulci, Bava Sr and Bava Jr, just to mention the most famous. "The villa of the cursed souls" is one of the most unknown films of this genre, shot when this kind of cinema started its crisis that continues today, and the director Carlo Ausino seems totally new to my ears (even if he directed six film .. this is the price that Italian directors have to pay for not working in Rome ...). But the film is not so bad. And it is absolutely not correct to speak of "junk". OK, the plot is not so original; reminds me of things like the Amytville series (the year is the same as "Amityville Possession" by Damiano Damiani) or "Shock", the last work by Mario Bava. But you have to think that this is a film by a filmmaker (like Mario Bava's films); so the most important thing is the atmosphere, not the story or the characters; atmosphere very well created by the use of light and camera movement. The rest remains in the background. I think the film works; not so good, but it works; it's definitely better than many Hollywood productions like "the Haunting" that have a bigger budget, but not bigger ideas ...
