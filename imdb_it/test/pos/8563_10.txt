This photo was published in May 1979 with Playboy Playmate Susan Kiger as Honey Shayne, Playboy Playmate Lisa London as O'Hara and Playboy Playmate Pamela Jean Bryant as Terri Lynn. In one of the most delightful comedies in the history of the drive-in, a handful of bouncing young lovers unite in a story of sisters-in-bikini battles that will stop at nothing to discover everything. So, what does H.O.T.S actually mean? You will have to watch the movie to get the answer. You see, the girls are having problems with the girls of the society on campus who make them out to be nothing more than sex-thirsty maniacs. Therefore, the girls decided to discredit the girls of society, no matter what they have to do to get the job done. Also, cutting into this mess is the dean of the college who wants to dismantle the group of girls before they get out of control. I loved this movie in particular Lisa London. I thought her acting was fantastic and I'm disappointed that she didn't have any other acting jobs. Based only on the three playmates, I give this movie 10 weasel stars.
