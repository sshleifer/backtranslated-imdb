This film is very good and the whole family would enjoy watching it. When Susie Q is on her big night at the dance, she dies in a fatal car accident while going to the drunken and upbeat children's dance. Susie's house is sold and a family moves into the house she loves. Like the boy who now lives at home, he sees Susie and is the only one who can. The two teams together with her little sister and try to save Susie's parents from Being at the green. Staring Amy Jo Johnson as Susie Q. This movie will hit your heart with comedy, sadness and laughter. I hope you see this film because it is very beautiful. But no one seems to have it on DVD or VH and no longer comes on TV.
