This is certainly one of the greatest cult classics, and is a must see for all psychotronic fans. Why? It has everything a great exploitative film of the 70s should have. Exaggerated dialogue, bad acting, enthusiasm, sex, sleaze, political inaccuracy, violence and many other elements of a good cult classic are included. In other words, Dolemite is a must see. <br /> <br /> As in many of these films, the plot does not make much sense. From what I got out of it, the pimple dolemite was framed for stealing furs and half a million dollars of narcotics. While he was doing his time, his archenemy Willie Green (the same man who framed him) took his nightclub. However, the sympathetic guardian (the only white character in the entire film who is not completely evil or incompetent) decides to get him out free to stop the evil Willie Green and his drug trafficking. Fortunately, he knows kung-fu, as does about 50-75% of the characters in this film. And even more fortunately, while she was locked up, Signora Ape Regina sent all her "hoes" to the kung fu school. With this army of kung fu fighting "hoes" (his words, not mine) on his side, he intends to take back the nightclub from Willie Green. However, two white racist policemen try to frame him again and send him back to prison. <br /> <br /> As I said before, don't try to follow the plot. I've seen this movie about five times and there are many elements that seem to have no connection with anything else. The supporting characters wander in and out of the film. I'm still trying to figure out what the Reverend Gibbs, the Mayor and the Hamburger Pimp have done. Who cares in the end? The scenes with these characters are priceless. As for dialogue, it's horrible with an even worse delivery. Since Rudy Ray Moore was originally a comedian, I begin to wonder if this film was to be a serious parody or action movie. It seems he could not decide which one. Lines like "Yes, I'm so bad, I kick my ass twice a day" I ask for further investigation. In any case, the film is hilarious and the plot has more holes than a Swiss cheese factory. Another hilarious element is some of the no longer erotic uses of sex and nudity of all time in cinema. Actors you would never want to see naked naked (including the Mayor and the Ape Regina). Not to mention the fact that the boom microphone seems to appear in every other scene. <br /> <br /> Above all, Moore shows incredible enthusiasm. It seems to have a generally good time and is certainly charismatic. His rap comedies have proven to be a huge influence on the gangsta rap of the last days, including Dr. Dre who tried it on his 1992 album "The Chronic". Technically inept as the film, it is culturally influential. More importantly, it's a beautiful moment. The biggest crime an exploit film can commit is boring, and for all its flaws, it's fast and fun. In other words, if you dig this type of film, you will love "Dolemite". If you don't dig it, you're a "no-business, born insecure, with jock-f *** a jaw!" (7/10)
