Once again, I read all the comments posted here and I agree with the many intelligent, but I totally disagree with those who think it is / is a hokum. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think nuclear is the only energy left to us, unless our governments (federal and state) increase the subsidies thinking that homeowners will use photocells on their roofs . Many attractive and expensive homes in southern California are designed and built to harness the cleanest energy around, the sun. I live in a loft, which is exposed to total sunlight on the roof for the whole day. I barely use air conditioning - I'm sure it would consume too much electricity to convert the intense heat in the attic to about five degrees colder. We are blessed with "dry" heat in this part of the country. I come from the Gulf coast of the United States, so I know the humidity ....... <br /> <br /> That said, I found "the China syndrome" as a convincing film about what could go wrong, if the industry is not involved in the regulation and inspection of nuclear power plants. I think there are enough comments published here to enlighten those who still fear him like the plague: they are safe. TMI is still online .... <br /> <br /> Director James Bridges carefully guides this plot (by Mike Gray-T S Cook) to build suspense and a thoughtfully interesting film. All roles have been well interpreted: Jane Fonda ("Kimberly Wells"), Jack Lemmon (Jack Godell ") and producer Michael Douglas (" Richard Adams ") are all excellent in their roles, in addition to the rest of the cast. I also loved that there was no score, it was so interesting to have a realistic look at the background of the TV industry - it shouldn't be surprising. Currently, Dan Rather is suing CBS, and I hope he wins, you can believe Donald Trump have you said "is a loser?" Trump - who cares? "Tiberius1234" posted a very good comment here - I agree, the spill is much better than living in a world that has been wasted and becomes "Blade Runner" and / or "Solyent Green." Come away from your video games for a couple of hours and watch this "dated" movie (actually it's not 't), and get some nuclear energy education. the whole family ....
