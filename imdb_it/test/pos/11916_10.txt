This film is a perfect example of great escape! I loved this movie and was sucked in from the beginning. Sure, it's just an action movie, but isn't it fun to know what movies are watching? <br /> <br /> The cast of this film is very strong with cute characters. The friendship between the boys is so realistic and engaging, it's warm and fun to see a group of teenagers interact - especially this group of guys !! Sean Astin is a great rebel, successfully avoiding being a precocious teenager. <br /> <br /> If you want to have fun, watch this movie! I loved it even though I was watching it on a very dirty and old VHS that was of very poor quality (go to DVD!)
