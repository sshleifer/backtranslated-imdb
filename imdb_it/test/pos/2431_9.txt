Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna was a two-part film with historical paintings on T.V. based on the book by Peter Kurth, Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson. It is historically enough, the names have changed etc. But it sticks quite well to the true story. Omar Sharif and Claire Bloom do quite well as the Russian royals, Tsar Nicholas and Tsarina Alexandra. What remained in my mind were the too short portraits of Rex Harrison and Olivia De Havilland. All in all it was a pretty classy production with some acting. I was very impressed by the production values ​​when it was first broadcast at NBC at the end of 1986. The good German actor Jan Niklas, who had already starred in NBC's epic Russian film "Peter the Great" was also featured. <br /> <br /> I heard that the second part left out some important details of Anna Anderson's trip to America. It is also important to know that in 1986 less was known about the story of Anna Anderson. At that time it was not yet known whether his claim to be the Grand Duchess Anastasia was genuine. By the late 1990s, more was known and Anna Anderson is now considered a scam. <br /> <br /> Too bad the networks don't make films made for television like this anymore.
