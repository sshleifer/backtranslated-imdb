A film rarely captures such intense drama and emotion. What makes this film so disturbing is that the drama seems so real, it's almost hard to remember that it's just a movie. This is by far the performance of Madeline Stowe and Alan Rickman of their careers. The film looks almost like a theatrical production as it is staged and illuminated. The only negative thing about this film is that it is very difficult to obtain a copy. I have yet to see it different from Laserdisc. This truly powerful film deserves a digitally remastered transfer and special DVD edition treatment. It's really so beautiful.
