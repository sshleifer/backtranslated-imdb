I don't know which movie or version Jeff saw, but the whole movie was fantastic, not just Poitier and Going. The story was compelling, full of suspense and engaging. And for the guy who complains about historical accuracy, it becomes real. Yes, there were some deputy black marshals in the Indian territory, but they had no authority to arrest the whites outside the Indian territory. As a rule, they did not "patrol", but only mandated criminals. I found it strange that Corby didn't seem to have "any" Indian friends, I know their number had decreased, but it still seems strange. Even when Corby has returned to his people, his Indian cohorts remain faceless and nameless.
