Even if you are a fan of the idiosyncratic body of work of Jean Rollin, you will be caught off guard by this exceptional incursion into the territory of science fiction. For once, there is not a single diaphanously dressed vampire girl in sight! True to tradition, the budget was too narrow to fully realize the director's vision. However, this is largely offset by his obvious love for genre cinema, his dedication to his craft and his ingenuity. The atmospheric cinematography of Jean-Claude Couty takes full advantage of the disturbing positions and Philippe Bréjean (a / k / a "Gary Sandeur") contributes with a surprising soundtrack that fortunately does not resemble any of the mushy things that he composed for the hardcore . <Br /> <br /> Filmed in and around an office in Paris before and after working hours, the film was mostly made up of regular pornini customers that Rollin already knew from his "Michel Gentil" collecting funds for XXX, in particular French f * the sovereignty of the Czech film Brigitte Lahaie is driving demanding. Playing Elisabeth (pretty well, I might add), she went up to roam a nearby highway one night at Robert (Vincent Gardère), returning home at the end of a long day's work. Barely able to reconstruct the series of events that brought her there, Elisabeth seems to lose her memories moments after the events, even forgetting Robert's name and the hero's heroic role before their night flight ends in his apartment. Before making love, she rightly defines herself as a virgin (a further merit of the theatrical gifts of Brigitte who manages the line so convincingly, after all she is one of the most active actresses of the 70s) because she can't remember a single touch preceding his. Because of this nifile context, the relatively long sexual scene that follows completely avoids the gratuitousness of other "commercial" interludes. Rollin had to include in other work to secure the funding. <br /> <br /> When Robert leaves for work, he is inevitably obliterated by Elisabeth's weak mind. A mysterious doctor (comedian Bernard Papineau interprets effectively against the guy) and his menacing assistant Solange (who hits porn star Rachel Mhas) move on to her while her protector is absent and take her back to the place she appears to have escaped . Here we get one of the strongest scenes in the film as it is reintroduced into her roommate Catherine (the late Cathérine Greiner a / k / a hardcore actress "Cathy Stewart" in a quietly devastating turn), both girls desperately providing "memories" shared fictitious. one for the other in an attempt to overcome their inevitable destiny. That deterioration is not only limited to the mind it becomes painfully clear when lunch is served and Catherine is unable to control her movements in an attempt to eat a tablespoon of soup. It is also Catherine who succeeds in giving voice to the filmmaker's compromise with the demands of commerce while urging Elisabeth to remain naked and hold her because sex is all that is left now that both the mind and the physical faculties have abandoned them. <br /> <br /> Several rather explicit - if not hardcore - sex scenes make up the central part of the film and French porn lovers should recognize characters like Alain Plumey (a / k / a "Cyril Val") , Jacques Gateau and Elodie Delage, along with a blink of an eye and a pinch of shit from the future porn princess Marilyn Jess whose rape on her hands, mouth and Plumey's member was present only in the rarely projected XXX version of FILLES TRAQUEES. The crucial part of Véronique, a girl who seems almost to remember and with whom she tries to escape, is splendidly managed by the exquisite Dominique Journet - in her unforgettable debut - who would have continued to play in a considerable supporting role in LA by Franco Zeffirelli TRAVIATA. The six feet underground reveal that the deteriorating condition is the result of a nuclear spill, the "patients" quarantined ultimately leave an empty shell barely breathable, unceremoniously, arranged in a fiery furnace. The final shot offers a particularly heart-rending variation on Chaplin's MODERN TIMES as Elisabeth, who is approaching complete fusion by now, and a wounded Robert stumbles along the railroad bridge, clumsily clasping his hands outstretched each other.
