Post-war England, the dawn of the "atomic age". However, the concerns of a young schoolboy who wishes to try his first "kiss" cannot be derailed by something as irrelevant as BOMB. This was a delightful, if not educational, look at the young love from the perspective of a teenage male and his 1940s world. Free from political correctness and preaching messages, this film exposes the viewer to the world that only the mind (and hormones) of a young teenager can create. Wonderful subplots <br /> <br /> keep the interest in the character "Gregory's Girl", and many well-blocked <br /> shots help keep the images of this era. This is a very good story for anyone, young or old, who has ever been in love, or ever wanted to be. Have you ever had your wish? Look at it and look.
