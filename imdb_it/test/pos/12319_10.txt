Easily one of my three or four favorite movies. Definitely one for the desert island. There is nothing "brilliant" about this film. Rather, it is warm and welcoming. The public is invited to a party and, like any good party, the joy comes in the interaction of the guests, and what is learned as one proceeds from one to the other. With excuses to Joyce, the film's title evokes a series of ideas that distance the public. The film is not horrible. It is not depressing. It is a beautiful look in a time that has passed, in which people grow, and others that are shrinking. Some are frustrated and others are peaceful. And all around, always present throughout the evening, are the people and parts of the people who have been buried. The words to which these wonderful actors are given to speak are perfection and, based on the music of Irish brogue, they are an auditory feast, especially for us flat-faced Americans. Regarding the lack of brilliance I mentioned above, I will resume. There is no other word to describe the final scene between Anjelica Huston and Donal McCann. Speak quiet volumes about ?? well, everything. Some nice snowy night, rent this movie and let it happen before you. No gunfights, no car chases, no dinosaurs ?? only film in its most sublime form.
