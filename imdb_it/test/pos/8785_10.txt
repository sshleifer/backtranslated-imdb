I really like this movie. It is a look back in time when this nation was really at risk of nations that attacked or delarated the war against us, namely the Japanese and the Germans. Robert Cummings and Pricilla Lane were excellent in the lead roles. Even the supporting cast ... Otto Kruger, Alan Baxter, Clem Bevins and Norman Lloyd were exceptional. The direction, rhythm and ending held and continue to arouse my interest. So much so that I bought my copy. Thankfully for Turner Classic Movies, they show so many of the truly classic movies, including this one. Robert Cummings was certainly not a lightweight actor and although I am a big fan of Gary Cooper and Joel McCrea, two of my favorite actors, who were the first to offer the lead role, I don't see what they would bring to the role passed the performance of Bob Cummings. <br /> <br /> This is a film that I like to watch repeatedly and urge others to see.
