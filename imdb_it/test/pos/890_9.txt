With all due respect to Joel Fabiani and Rosemary Nicolls and their characters, Department S will forever be associated with Jason King by Peter Wyngarde. <br /> <br /> Most people remember it as this enchanting, spooky, womanizing detective camp in the Austin Powers motto but that will do a bad service to the character: it's much more nuanced than that. <br /> <br /> Jason King is lazy (he often leaves Stewart to fight all the bad guys and only chips in the end), he is selfish (his appreciation for people is based on whether they read his novels or not) , many of his investigative works are speculations without facts to support them and he pouts whenever Annabelle is right ... and she often is. He is clearly a man who has a mid-life crisis and drink driving but ....... Jason King is brilliant. If Wyngarde had portrayed him as a pure hero, it wouldn't have worked, but he often showed King as a paper tiger, driven by his libido, love of refinement and prone to magnanimity (and hinders his detective work sometimes) but it has some of the best lines and puts down in TV history. And not interpreting it as whiter than white, the chemistry and the interactions between the three protagonists are far better. <br /> <br /> Looking at it again on DVD recently, you can see how much Wyngarde depth put into Jason King.
