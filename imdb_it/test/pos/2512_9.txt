This film appears quite often on premium cable channels and, I find that I keep watching it over and over again. The performances are wonderful and the material is happening so much that there is always something new to take away from the film. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm too distracted when I watch movies at home, you know the drill, the dogs bark, the phone rings, the popcorn ends up during the credits. But this film is about people and what motivates us, what drives us, what causes us to break and what inspires us. <br /> <br /> For me, they are films like The Love Letter that make me take a chance on new movies. Frankly, I'm surprised the film is no longer known. I'd like to see Blythe Danner and Geraldine McEwan in many other roles. They are a pleasure to watch. Kate Capshaw is wonderful and I had no idea she would be. Ellen DeGeneres plays a much more complex role than simple comic relief. <br /> <br /> This film offers interesting images as a suitable background for the characters and their interactions. I find it refreshing every time I take the time to watch it.
