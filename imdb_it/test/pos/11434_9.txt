Like a modern Marco Polo, from Venice to China, here we are again Amelio, taking on the task of rendering us the gray area between two solid-color worlds. Eroded by the collateral damage of globalization, Europe's pessimistic vision is reciprocal with China. <br /> <br /> The vision of that fascinating but puzzling country is treated from below, without any pretense of learning or imposing opinions. The reality, however, is hard. Abandoned and exploited children, beehive houses, backward areas is the OTHER we ignore. Vincenzo (Castellitto), a technician from a steel factory, is one of us. His journey to China is a pretext to understand, to learn from within a country where progress and problems of the third world coexist in an infamous balance. It is not exactly clear if Vincenzo knew for the first time that the mechanical component had already been solved, I think so; however it is a minor aspect. Liu, the Chinese girl, is the key to the whole film. It brings with it many difficulties, it has the strength to overcome, but how could it fight with little money and little help? <br /> <br /> The girl's realistic and impartial view of the facts, rejecting Vincenzo's money, touched me a lot. A bundle of bills cannot get back her husband, her child (forced to treat as a stranger by law), protect her with contempt. Liu knew that his intentions were benign and kind, far from a cold act of charity. Their friendship is beautifully narrated, the way it grows step by step, dignified and formative, unique. An invaluable legacy to maintain. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are stunning, both for the acting (Vincenzo crying on the ferry) and for the dialogues (at the restaurant, on the railways). In addition to careless editing and a rather lazy start, "La Stella che non c'Ã¨" is brilliant and sharp only because it tells the untold truths. <br /> <br /> In competition at the 63rd Venice Film Festival, an abundant bet on Tai Ling for the Mastroianni prize, dedicated to emerging stars. He certainly deserved this award. <br /> <br /> [8/10]
