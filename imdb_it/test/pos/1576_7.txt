I just finished this incredibly nutty story and while I can't say how good it was as I had exaggerated in my mind, it was still an effective and at the same time rather ugly piece of deformed brain and misogyny powered by J-trash. His story tells of a poor girl in search of her sister who ends up being raped and drugged by poachers Yakuza, and by the useful doctor who is preparing to avenge her, doing so in a bizarre and macabre way after such a rape and drug attack . Oh yes, there is also a bit of direct sex, unfortunately it is all soft core, as for the Japanese disapproval of under the nudity of the belt, but the minimization is minimal, in fact only appreciable in a hilarious scene. Although the writer / director Kazuo "Gaira" Komizu fails to create a particularly compelling story, this is at least a pretty scimitar, diving right into the dirt pit with a rather shocking rape (made worse by the fact that the girl looks a little young , although I'm pretty sure he was of age). Moreover, for the most part this is professional looking stuff, maybe not elegant, but it has a certain style and the content is managed quite well, with particular compliments to avoid in large part having to employ a lot of pixellation. Things are mostly sex / rape based on about two-thirds of the running time and its pretty observable if you can do it, it becomes a bit callous after a while, but women are easy to the eye and it's reasonably hard sometimes. The music, by YÃ´ichi Takahashi, is occasionally effective, although barely a key part of the show does it in places to complete the action in an orderly fashion, in any case enough to get me noticed. More important are the effects of Nobuaki Koga, which make up an impressive handful of sketches when they appear, aided by the moody nature of climate cheating. Things also come to a curiously interesting ending, of course it's not a cry or anything, but for such a guttural movie for most of its running time it's relatively touching. Overall this is a fun diversion for mediocre junk fans, especially those with a taste for kidnapped adventures. I could really have done with a longer and more gore revenge section, maybe even more than a point / brain, but hey, he kept an eye on me and is pretty well stocked with memorable wtf moments. So if you dig this degenerate stuff, it's probably worth it, maybe don't expect the second coming.
