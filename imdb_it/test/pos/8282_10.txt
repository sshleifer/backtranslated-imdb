I loved this movie and I never knew it was so old that it came out the day I was born and now I'm 19 now I still love this movie, especially the songs like "My Mother" and "Boys and Girls of Rock N" Roll "and I remember as a child I think I have 5 n my sister was 6 years old and my cousin (boy) was 6, we used to pretend to be the characters in the movie I was Eloner and Janette and my sister was British and my cousin was Alvin Simon and Theodore those were good times and I miss it and having this movie reminds me of the good times since my cousin is old for this stuff and so is my sister and I are not going to forget the chipmunk and the chipmunk movie I still remember the songs and words by heart even though I haven't seen this film in 12 years but now I like to start loving ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS AND CHIPETTES <3 <3 <3 <3
