Yes, the non-Singaporeans cannot see what the big problem of this film is. Some of the references in this film fly right over the head of foreign viewers and mostly Singaporeans are the ones who actually "take" it. But I beg you, stranger, look at the other crap that has been baked in Singapore and compare it with this movie. It is like comparing the pieces of diarhea of ​​a mule to a small diamond. This film is the first to show a little the petty side of Singapore, something that forces, pretends, does not exist. And there is a part in the film where a gangster (ah-beng in our exclusive colloquial "ingris" curses in 4 languages, namely Tamil English Malay and Hokkien). Well, the truth is that many of us can do it and always do it. The sad thing is that viewers from foreign countries will have an easier time getting their little claws on this gem, in its home country, it was initially banned, just to be given and R-rating, and even with around 20 cuts to it. It's nice to know that one of the best, creative, edgy and original films ever created would have been easier for you to get without being modified, without censorship; halfway through the world than in your country.
