I went to see this film with my family who was expecting a very specific story like "Mr. and Mr" and they came home completely disappointed. So this is a warning to all 'lovers of the final story' 'stay away. 15 Park Avenue does not try to answer questions or provide moral solutions on how to treat the mentally disabled. His intention is strong and clear. It questions the sense of reality of every human being, healthy or not. In reality, even for me, it raises doubts about my sense of sanity, for granted. The security, the slavery, the satisfaction that I find in my present, is really what I am or really creates an illusion that we all desperately and sometimes ignorant cling to only to falsely console the neglected "meethi" that exists in all of us in a way or another? so why is anjali so maniacally able to show his mental strength when he's really tormented by the knowledge that he's becoming a monster? Aren't we all those who think we are "normal", really monstrous and helplessly vulnerable in it? Isn't it better to be happy even madly, rather than creating the impression of "normality" while suppressing one's fragility? meethi bravely, madly, frankly it does. And society calls it "schizophrenic", the end confused me at the beginning, but then you realize that meethi's courage and sincere conviction have taken her where she wanted to go. he was searching, not worrying about what the company had to comment on his research. and it is the seemingly "real" people - anjali, psychiatrist and jojo - who never reach anywhere. My family thinks that I too am schizophrenic in trying to make sense of a film that is largely "crazy" for the rest of the world. someone else willing to believe in my sense of reality ...........?
