A warmly sentimental story by the author of The Waltons. If someone had given me the material, I would probably reject it as too corny. But the dramatization here runs a tear without the expected embarrassment. No one in the 1950s was better at Arthur Hunnicutt's lovely lawns. His appeal here is intended for use consumed as a mountain man stubbornly loyal to a loyal hunting hound. Their destinies are bound together inseparably like any human bond. Good. I see a subtle environmental message here. All the animals go to heaven, because how can we condemn any poor devil who simply follows the instinct to stay alive. There is no deception in the animal kingdom, yet with how much cruelty we treat them often. A strangely satisfying episode that confirms this important message.
