This film has "tormented me" since I saw it when I was about 8 years old. I didn't know what his name was, so I'm so glad I finally found him. I remember being scared, because I had just been to a tin mine in Cornwall when I looked at it, so I could imagine it all. Fortunately I didn't see any ghosts of dead children there, but I found this movie really scary and scary when I was much younger. I certainly never forgot it, even though I couldn't find it anywhere. I seem to remember that the Children's Film Foundation's films are generally good, but they don't show them at all anymore. I also remember programs like The Children Of Green Knowe in the same era as the BBC, equally disturbing in its own way.
