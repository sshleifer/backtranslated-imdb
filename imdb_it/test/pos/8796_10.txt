Hi everyone, all I have to say is that Human Traffic and all its characters are so real that it's fun. I live in Australia (Melbourne) and I'm finally out of clubbing and I'm off all the weekend lifestyle. This film explains all that is currently going on in the world. So exactly that I can't stop watching him .... I was exactly like Moff, so my friends said and I hadn't even seen the movie .. I left the weekend to celebrate behind about 3 months ago after 4 years of intense celebrating to change my life around. I was in a DVD store when I saw Human Traffic and I remember that my old friends were part of it, so I bought it to see what it was. I was so taken it I looked at it four times in a row because I couldn't believe that someone had made a film that explained everything to a T. However this film is by far the best and funniest film I've ever seen .. It's funny because he is so truthful in everything that happens in the film .. And Moff is a legend !!! That's all I have to say .. :) Enjoying 11/10 blew my socks off of what was real, that's exactly what's going on in the world .. hr rm i jabber very <br /> <br /> take care of me all ...
