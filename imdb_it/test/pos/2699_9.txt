When this show first aired, I saw it once or twice and thought it was another "fat, skinny and crazy" show that seemed popular in the networks at the time. It was just "okay" at first sight and I didn't look at it again; however, once in syndication, I captured several episodes (simply because it was twice a night), and I tell you, the more you watch this show, the more fun it is. Once you see how all the supporting characters are connected, this show makes you laugh out loud. Every new episode I watch is more creative than the previous one - people who watch this only a couple of times won't notice it. The lines of writing and history are much more sophisticated than they appear at the beginning (this is far from "According to Jim"). First of all, Kevin James is an incredibly charming and talented hysterical comedian, as well as the supporting cast. Leah Remini has excellent timing, and Spence of Patton Oswalt is one of the most entertaining characters on the show. And of course, Jerry Stiller is as brilliant as Arthur. I was shocked to read the comments that it was the worst part of the show - it's a gigantic part of why this show is so big - its delivery of these ridiculous patterns (to complete daddy's crazy character) is hilarious. And the scream - the best episode is when they show it as a child screaming "Lemon Icee !!" That incident, during which Carrie takes him to a therapist in hopes of being medicated (to make Doug less stressed), guest star William Hurt decides that Arthur screams because he's never been validated. The last part of the episode where Doug beats his childhood in a therapy session is extremely fun, it's one of the most creative scenes I've seen on a sitcom. I feel the strange need to defend this show, because it is severely underestimated - while "Friends" is sometimes fun, and "Raymond" has some great episodes and characters, both lacked the "King of Queens" creative touch. In an age when most sitcoms have jokes and are on the whole mediocre, "King of Queens" continues to push the sitcom envelope and shows a true comic genius. The critics of this show obviously don't understand it - or haven't watched the show enough to give it a chance, because anyone with a real comic and creative sensibility has to laugh loudly while watching. He is certainly on a par with my other two favorites, "Seinfeld" and "The Office" in his ridiculous tone. They are the Arthurs, Kramers and Michael Scotts of TV who keep an eye on us and laugh out loud.
