I didn't expect to enjoy it. in truth I looked at him because a friend knew that a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but was not credited. knowing Dylan Thomas, and really appreciating his poetry, but aware and rather bewildered by man, I didn't feel I had to see an adaptation of his lame bohemian life laid bare. and this was not it. he was critical and yet grateful. you made me cry. Kiera Knightley was superb, even with that slightly tense Welsh accent, and it's a sad story they tell. Dylan thomas is not the hero as unfortunately he has not been for all his life and not even the so-called "gritty woman" of the speech. the film's william is cillian. a man who leaves the woman he loves to fight a war they ignore. his challenge to re-connect to that indifference is what is of real interest to this film and what a beautiful performance by that actor. I think this film is undervalued because it was so badly marketed. Dylan Thomas fans expect something more from their unreliable hero and receive less, and so it was marketed. it's not a film about Dylan thomas and it's much more interesting for that.
