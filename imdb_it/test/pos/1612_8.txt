Thomas Mann's controversial novel is the basis of the film "A Death in Venice". Although in the book the hero is an author, in the film the director Luchino Visconti, who also wrote the script, turns it into a composer. As such, the author / composer, Gustav Von Aschebach (Dirk Bogarde) on the verge of mental exhaustion is a burned artisan. After a long and successful career, he is now looking for the peace and tranquility of a less hectic life. He decides to go on vacation to Venice, where he hopes to rejuvenate his declining ambition. However, staying in the picturesque seaside resort, he captures the attention of a beautiful young teenager, Tadzio (Björn Andrésen) who observes him with curious interest and is immediately struck by him. Although Gustav is fascinated by the wonderful youth, he must however find a private time away from the boy's housekeeper (Nora Ricci), while facing a plague of invasion that seems to have infested the city. The dialogue of the film, like the novel, remains subtle as are the brief encounters between the boy and the artist. At the end. the public unlike the book is hindered by innumerable and imaginative fantasies. Their affair is never given wing, substance or opportunity and if it were not for the brief resolution of the book, the film only allows the possibility of "what happens if". However, one can sympathize with the hero and wish him a moment of peace to obtain what is forbidden, elusive but decidedly criticized by prying eyes. Great story and a Bogarde classic. ****
