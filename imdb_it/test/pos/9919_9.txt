Title: Opera (1987) Director: Dario Argento Cast: Cristina Masillach, Ian Charleson, Urbano Barberini, Daria Nicolodi Rassegna: The only other Argento film I had seen was Suspiria and that shocked me with its style, colors and spectral texture. Later I decided to go with Opera as I was told it was one of his best. Friend, I think I'm discovering what eventually will be one of my favorite horror directors. <br /> <br /> The work is about a young opera singer who gets her big chance when the main protagonist of a scary and modern opera comes across Mc Beth is hit by a car. Betty is the interpreter and therefore she plays the part herself. Too bad for her there is a psycho after her who shows her the brutal murders of her friends and colleagues. <br /> <br /> Wow, Id heard positive things about this movie here, but I wasn't prepared for the level of greatness that this movie would bring me. Yes, the film has its flaws to which Ill arrive later. But for the most part the film shocked me. <br /> <br /> First of all, this film is not full of colors like Suspiria. I expected it to be a bit like Suspiria in that department, but no, to my surprise it looked and looked like it. The film is somewhat colorless. It has a lot of colors in certain scenes (like the masterful kitchen / living room sequence) where Argento fills the screen with lush greens and blues, but for the most part the film has a gray, black tone for everything else and I liked that had its own distinctive appearance. <br /> <br /> The real protagonists of this show are the incredibly well-orchestrated death sequences. Wow. Every scene of death was like a work of art. Beauty in destruction. These are not just your typical strafing and cutting sequences, these deaths have been carefully constructed to shock and get the most out of his situations. Loved every second of them, there is a lot of blood and chaos here, but in style. It won't ruin you anyway. <br /> <br /> Then there is the direction. Friend, there are some really original and beautiful shots on this. I loved the inventive use of the camera on this. You thought the tarantins turned into Kill Bill vol. 1 where did we see the bullet coming out of the gun chamber was original? Well, this is the movie from which it was raised! I honestly believe that Tarantino was strongly influenced by this specific film with some scenes in Kill Bill Vol. 1. In describing the film, he says that the whole scene with Beatrix in the hospital and Elle Driver arriving to kill her was influenced by Italian Giallos, and here my friends are proof of this. Whatever it is, Tarantino's references aside, this film has some amazing camera shots, like those crows scenes flying through the crowd in the opera house ... great things. And one of the main reasons why Argentos has become one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The acting of most of the cast went well, but by far the best was Cristina Marsillach as the young opera singer Betty. The looks in his eyes while the murders were committed were great. The rest of the cast was a bit of wood and stiff, but nothing that could deter your enjoyment of the film. <br /> <br /> There were a few things I didn't like about this movie. The first logic was thrown out of the window in some scenes. Especially those that involve Bettys reactions after seeing the murders. It seems to me that you have been talking about your business for a long time, without telling anyone at all. Not even the police. I mean if you see someone brutally killing a loved one in front of your eyes ... don't leave the scene of the murder and continue with your life. Someone would link her to the murders. It might even have become suspicious ... but no. Even the finish is a bit anti-climatic. You should see this to understand, but the way the movie ended is a bit pointless, it seemed like it could have ended earlier. He would not have felt so redundant. But that's all, they are not really big problems for me since I was enjoying the rest of this beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> I still have a lot of Silver territory to cover ... but I'm devouring every step of the way like I'm eating a plate of the most expensive caviar. This guys really good. I think of his films as works of art and I've only seen two! I look forward to discovering the rest of his films. Silver, you man! <br /> <br /> Rating: 41/2 out of 5
