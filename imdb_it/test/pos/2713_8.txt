The songs are the best aspect of this film for television, which has decidedly better than average production values, but a very superficial and slightly altered biography. Dramatize Richard's discovery of "We Only Only Begun" and Karen's marital difficulties admirably (the editing of "Superstar" was a nice touch), yet leaves out the disagreement with Neil Sedaka, the contribution of guitar solos by Tony Peluso, etc. he is sweet in his character Karen, but does not include the masculine and gritty sides of the true Carpenter's personality. Anderson is in excellent shape as creative and responsible for Richard, and Fletcher stands out as the loving but overpowering Agnes. The most disturbing moment of the original broadcast is the use of "Goodbye to Love" against the background of an advertisement for an anorexia hotline.
