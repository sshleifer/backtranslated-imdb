Rajkumar Santoshi tries his hands at the comedy and succeeds. One of the few good movies that involves Salman Khan. A very funny film from beginning to end. All the characters contribute to the film and believe me, there are many. Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Raveena Tandon, Karishma Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Viju Khote, Jagdip, Deven Verma, Shakti Kapoor, Harish Patel, Tiku Talsania and more. The direction, the editing, the sound are not up to par, but that doesn't matter, because the actors more than compensate for that part.
