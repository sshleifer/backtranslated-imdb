"I'm ... proud of 'Head'," said Mike Nesmith. It should be, because this film, which has been mocked by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors, works on many levels. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is not conventional. For many, frustrating. It's almost as if the producers gave you the film and tried: "You understand." You probably already know that The Monkees TV show was a runaway marketing success that depended on business acumen and not just public deception service. TV shows speak before they sell soap and toothpaste, which they entertain. The fact that The Monkees came out of the box for a short period of time to make "Head" is a testament to the group's popularity and importance in pop culture, despite your head. Get one thing clear: "Head" is not the TV show The Monkees. <br /> <br /> So what we have here is a "psychedelic documentary" on Western pop culture from a source that has authority on the subject. "Head" is a film that could only come from those "inside the box". In 1968, the cast and crew of The Monkees were seasoned and tired professionals who had seen their share of promises and disappointments. The film was a deliberate attempt to reposition the market. So he did three things: make a movie the way The Monkees imagined. The most important thing is to reinvent the group into one that is not submissive to its old leaders - and yes, faster than before. Make a film that exposes American attitudes to information dissemination. <br /> <br /> "Head", therefore, is really about media manipulation and its net result: deception. The media should inform us, educate us about events in the world at large, and eventually ask us to form opinions on these events that can transform thought into positive action. So we assume that the information we absorb is complete and impartial - otherwise, how can we establish a valuable conclusion on any idea presented by a book, newspaper or television program? In one of the interviews in "Testa", a boy admits: "I haven't watched a newspaper or TV for years". Is he less or better man? Even the drug parallels are a soft veil of "Things are not as they seem". Remember the old joke, "Everything you know is wrong"? The screenplay begins with the public admission of The Monkees of his "image produced" and runs with football - literally. Is the football scene in the film a visual manifestation of the whole idea behind "Head"? Is the film an exercise in the flow of consciousness? Is the film the culmination of smoking marathons? There are too many coincidences that occur in the film that suggest otherwise. My hypothesis is that "Head" is the culmination of motivations between intentions and unintentional. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the "Head" insiders seem to enjoy the revelations that occur in the film, but there is anger - anger at the chaos that characterized the late 1960s and anger at the way the media, especially television, has changed culture in a negative way. Drugs and violence were strong negative forces in the late 1960s and still are, but "Chief" producers want you to know that "poor" information is a much greater danger. <br /> <br /> Wars have been attributed to hoaxes and lies. What perfect way to spread misinformation than through TV? Repeatedly, the mysterious black box is seen as an obstacle for The Monkees and apparently also for all of us. In one scene, Peter is sitting gloomily in a saloon holding an ice cream cone in his hand, and is asked by another Monkey, "What's wrong?" "I bought this ice cream cone and I don't want it." The film suggests that the first purpose of the media is NOT to inform, but to massively blindly sell. "Head" goes further: put some ideas in someone's head, and go cheerfully. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers know this and the danger is real. "Head" is a film that is created "as we go along", or is a deliberate statement. Maybe, maybe not. Maybe it's just "Pot meets advertising", as critics criticized in 1968. The lines are on The Monkees and us. Pay attention to what you ask, you could have it. <br /> <br /> Cheers: a real guilty pleasure. Very funny. Intelligent. Please the fans. Find the substance, it's there. Honestly weird. Bizarre collection of characters. Good tuning Length is appropriate. A lot of big lines, including my prophetic favorite of all time: "The tragedy of your times, my young friends, is that you could get exactly what you want." <br /> <br /> Caveat: Dated. Drug. No plot No linear delivery of any particular thought. At least twenty-five stories that intertwine in stop-and-go fashion. Thus, it can easily frustrate. It may seem pretentious to some. People who can't stand The Monkees don't need to look, even if this in itself is not a reason to avoid it. Psychedelic special effects can kill your sickly tube or burned eyeballs. <br /> <br /> Match, size.
