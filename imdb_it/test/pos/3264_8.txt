Based on his current IMDb rating and several plot summaries, I didn't expect much from "Two Hands". But how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, you have been deeply absorbed by a genre that has been continuously non-original for some time. Also in terms of staging and cinematography, the director excels and creates a film of great imagination. If you are looking for a film that is not only fun, but also provocative, compelling and truly extraordinary, then make this the next movie you watch. <br /> <br /> I hope that the tragic death of Heath Ledger has led more people to choose this film. He was an incredible talent, and his performance in this is one not to be missed. Don't make the mistake of judging and discarding this fantastic movie before you've seen it.
