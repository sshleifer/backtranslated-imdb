A comment said it was not a comedy ... Error! It was a delightful comedy from a historical period that does not easily lend itself to that genre. Very busy ... and active film from start to finish. Often the shots outside the window of the train or car were simply beautiful. A nice way to spend a couple of hours in a theater. All French historical figures, such as Charles de Gaulle and Petain and some of the people involved in the French Resistance were included in the script, which could send those who are not familiar with the collapse of France during the German invasion may wish to do research. The characters were engaging and the actors portraying them were excellent. I recommend it, 9 out of 10.
