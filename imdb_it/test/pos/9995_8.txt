As you know, "The best game ever played" is about golf. I used to chuckle at the overly dramatic title, but through the large visual display credited to director Bill Paxton (best known for his acting in Twister and the hilarious secondary roles in Aliens and True Lies) we find that this has much more meaning than a game. <br /> <br /> Although the film is about golf, it seems that sport is just the picture of what's really going on. What is really happening is a story of people who have said that they cannot fulfill their dreams, be it age or social status. A conflict between the desires of a child and the demands of a father. An English golf legend who tries to bring the title back home with the country blowing on his neck. <br /> <br /> Shia LaBeouf (Even Stevens) plays Francis Ouimet, a caddy with a God-given talent who has never been allowed to play golf in the first place. Despite the resentment of the "gentlemen" of the upper class, it was undeniable that Francis had a gift. What represented a greater threat was the discouragement of his father played by Elias Koteas (Sugartime, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) who felt that playing a simple game would never improve their poor living conditions. With the continued support of his mother, Francis eventually finds himself face to face with his idol, golf legend Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane). <br /> <br /> More impressive than the game itself, it was the film's film success. This showed that the narrative succeeds through pure cinema. The entire film could have been told without dialogue. There are scenes in the film that create a strong suspense and a powerful emotion with only images. In a particular scene, Francis Ouimet swings and the whole crowd turns his head to watch the ball fly in the distance, all but the face of Harry Vardon who looks intensely at Ouimet without a start. The ways in which golfers view the course offer greater aesthetic pleasure. <br /> <br /> A pleasant supporting cast completes the whole. Peyton List plays the love interest and seems to be worth playing, and Josh Flitter plays an amiable corpse that keeps Ouimet in focus while the pressure bogs him down. Golf enthusiasts or not, you'll appreciate the film for its beauty and its reminder that cinema can be a great way to tell any story.
