I love this movie ...! I saw it 1000 x on DVD and I can't say it enough. It has everything, comedy, fantastic action and incredible stunts / fx. Samuel Jackson steals the show here big time. I don't think there's a time when he's not funny! "Everyone knows that when you make a hypothesis, you make an ass out of you and umption" !! The f / x are fantastic! The explosion of the bridge / truck is incredible, even if the sound is not that great! When Samuel runs away from the truck, the sound goes off a little, and what he says is priceless !!! For those of you who own it on DVD, put the audio in French !!! It's half !!! Even the emotional moments are great when the villain discovers that Sam / Charlie's daughter is his, it's great ... This is a great movie that no action fan can do without ... I also recommend Cutthroat Island ... Apart from all the negative publicity, it kicks !!!!
