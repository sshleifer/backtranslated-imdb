This was one of my favorite ones as a child. My family had the 8-track soundtrack! It took years (until I was 20) to get us a video of the movie (my dad recorded it on HBO or something). Every summer when we go to the beach (my mother, my brother, my sister and me) we lie on the beach and sing all the songs in this movie !!! I LOVE!!!
