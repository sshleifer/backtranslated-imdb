Two years after the success of "Airplane", Jim Abrahams and Jerry & David Zucker created this brilliant sit-com starring the great Leslie Nielsen as detective "Frank Drebin". The cast also included Alan North as "Captain Ed Hocken", Ed Williams as "Ted Olsen" and William Duell as "Johnny The Shoe Shine Boy". 'Police squad!' it presented shamelessly banal lines and intelligent visual gags that played in the background. Each episode would end with a fictitious block frame in which the characters in the frame are completely immobile. One of the best "still image" sequences saw one of the characters pour coffee into a cup while standing still, causing the cup to overflow! The guest stars were killed in the opening credits, one of which included Georg Stanford Brown crushed by a falling safe! Despite having received positive reviews and many critical acclaim, "Team!" only lasted six episodes before being canceled. This didn't mean the end though, five years later the show was moved to the big screen for the first in the 'Naked Gun' movie trilogy.
