The first reviewer is right - In this film we see ourselves, huddled by the majority, being nice, trying to stay out of trouble, just trying to live our lives, and we see how easily these very human traits, so fundamental to the functioning of society, can lead us to become an accomplice of a great evil. <br /> <br /> The story is set during the Second World War, with radio, newspapers and films reminding us of Hitler's attacks on Jews to highlight the irony of the same kind of violent anti-Semitism that takes place in America . Sometimes it seemed a little too heavy. <br /> <br /> It looks more like a comedy than a movie, but it's so inspiring that such quibbles mean little. Perhaps less trivial is the fact that the whole plot is based on a single small fact that seems rather unlikely to me. Larry lived a life without incident until middle age; yet all it takes is his start to wear a pair of glasses for everyone - ALL - to, at first glance, take him for a Jew. I willingly suspended the disbelief because the plot kept me going, but the implausibility bothered me throughout the film. (And frankly, I didn't understand why his wife was also taken for a Jew. Larry seemed to think so because his name was "Hart". Later when he married her, I don't know why his neighbors assumed he was Jewish.) For the first part of the film, I wondered if there were fancy elements. Larry's modesty seemed exaggerated, almost to the point of being grotesque. Why not call the police to see the rape, even if the attacker was a neighbor? And I thought the lighting seemed to suggest something slightly unreal - the red of the houses seemed too red, Gertrude's entrance seemed deliberately overexposed, generally the colors were almost pastel as in their intensity. <br /> <br /> I see it was shot on Campbell Avenue and Wallace Avenue in Toronto, so I'm going to drive over there (near Bloor & Dufferin) today to check the colors. Really :) It was nice to remember that the clergy at that time was often leading the evil of racism. (Do you remember how the pope refused to speak against Hitler, seeking only to gain protection for the Church? It was the same pope, by the way, that when Rome was about to be freed by American troops, he asked that the first soldiers enter the city not be black. Check your story.) I don't remember ever hearing this movie before. It's a shame. Certainly it is of great interest to every thinking person, to anyone interested in American history or racism; it's one of the clearest illustrations I've ever seen of Bertrand Russell's saying: "Don't go with a crowd to do evil".
