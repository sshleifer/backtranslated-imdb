Hi To read the entire plot of "OZ" just look at IMDb here to find it. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ATTENTION WITHIN THIS REVIEW! ** Oz is a series that not only moved me but also shows a little. Of the American prison system, but I have to say (judging on the prison discovery program) is not very realistic. <br /> <br /> Even if I have to say, there is no shyness, rape, shanking (stabbing) happens. Yet it is television, so for you who think everything is wrong. <br /> <br /> There is a good degree of violence in it, and some here and there exaggerated scenes (plot on the plot on the plot) that can get quite boring. But remember that the series is now almost ancient. So times change and I think I should judge this in the timeline as it came out. <br /> <br /> Since the season lasted until season 5, it was pretty good! Until one of the cons wins a $ 2 million lottery ticket, because he talked to God struck me as "ok this is getting to the point that I don't want to see this series no more" I still proceeded! And now I've just seen episode 3 of the sixth season. This was the cereal that made his brain disappear and then his "mother" keeps it after, while drooling. Then see also O Reilly crying and seeing his brother like that (RL BROTHERS as well) Now is the best scene of the whole "OZ" series, which was real for me! I still haven't read this wrong I'm trying to block it and burn it. It's really a beautiful series! And even now 2010 is worth a watch! I give a 7 because of the plot that weakens with the season. But still a gold glove.
