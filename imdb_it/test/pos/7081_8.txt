This film started to get confused and became one of the best movies I've seen ... The acting was absolutely superb and when I wasn't wiping my tears I liked Meryl Streep, whose performance was extraordinary. The film addresses the difficulties of a distant family that faces a mother who develops terminal cancer. The film was very difficult to watch and heartbreaking. The soundtrack adapts to this film to a tee. Good Bette Midler !! Out of 5 stars, I give this 4 1/2.
