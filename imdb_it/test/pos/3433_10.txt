First of all - I almost never watch Swedish films, and this is the second time in my life that I watch a Swedish film about cinema! So, I think it's one of the best Swedish films ever! The combination of thrill and humor is OUTSTANDING, and sometimes you don't even know if you should be terrified or just laugh! The plot is about this man, a writer who wants to go to Germany after the Second World War and help the Germans to start over. On the way to Germany, he is trying to help his friends on the train, which is still a bad idea. What a bumbling fool! And poor Robert Gustafsson - the wounded soldier - always interferes ... OUCH !!! But he still has his excellent mood. A positive boy. Robert Gustafsson has made some less beautiful films in recent years, and this is indeed a relief. He's great in this movie. After all, this is one of the best Swedish films ever and Peter Dalle has done an excellent job! Congratulations!
