I really wanted to write a title for this review that didn't turn out to be trivial or exciting, but it still described my feelings for this show. I can see now that it's not possible. "American Family" is one of the best shows I've ever had the pleasure of watching on television. Several reviewers here on IMDb have mentioned the word "handsome" when describing this show. Never has a word been more suitable. The cinematography of this show is stunning. Every scene and shot looks like a masterpiece. The lighting, the camera movements, the composition of the scene and the colors ... I must remember that I am watching a TV show and not a cinematic masterpiece. Lee Holdridge and Nathan Wang's soundtrack brings tears to my eyes. And above all, the acting of the cast of the whole world is honest and sincere. I don't seem to see any shows ... I seem to be witnessing real life. If only real life could be so beautiful. <br /> <br /> The "American family" has actually raised the bar for quality entertainment on television. I highly recommend this show to anyone who is willing to watch it. I could easily blame CBS for broadcasting this show, but I have to say that I don't care who sent it. I'm just glad it's out there for everyone to see. So I thank PBS for not allowing this show to disappear into thin air. <br /> <br /> I have to give special recognition to the way the end of each season has ended. The first was pure creative genius and moved me to tears. I was waiting to see if even the second season would have ended creatively, and it certainly was. Again, tears. <br /> <br /> My thanks to everyone involved. You have really made a special work of art with this show, and I say it sincerely. It is a pity that we have only two seasons, but a miracle we have achieved something.
