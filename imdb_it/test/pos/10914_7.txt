Hollywood movies from the 1930s have treated gays like lepers. In condemning homosexuality, the film industry has only reflected on what the repressive society of its time has embraced as an ideology. For example, in the melodrama Otto Preminger of 1962 "Advise and Consent", the straight actor Don Murray was chosen as a queer deputy who commits suicide rather than confess his alternative lifestyle. The characters of gay films have covered a lot of ground from "Advice and consensus". In the 1997 film "In & Out," (** 1/2 on ****), the heterosexual actor Kevin Kline is chosen as a homosexual teacher who comes out on his wedding day. While the conservative Hollywood of the past stipulated that the congressional gay in "Notices and Consent" was to commit suicide, today's liberal Hollywood demands that the gay English teacher should be embraced rather than maced. <br /> <br /> Basically, "In & Out" preaches good citizenship as a politically correct comedy. Director Frank Oz and screenwriter Scott Rudnick endorse honesty as the best policy, because honesty always guarantees happiness. High school professor Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline of "The Big Chill") will be happy only after leaving the closet, just as his ex-fat-but-now-thin girlfriend Emily (Joan Cusack) will only feel happy when she can abandon her diet. Ultimately, the film claims that heterosexual society will accept gays when homosexuals can act more honestly and frankly towards themselves. The gay tabloid journalist happily played by the famous actor Tom Selleck here effectively dramatizes this open-minded comment. <br /> <br /> Rudnick's light script embellishes the real accident of life that occurred at the Oscars when Tom Hanks paid tribute to a high school teacher. In "In & Out", Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), a blond Brad Pitt type actor, wins the Oscar for impersonating a fruity soldier. Drake honors his mentor Howard Brackett during his acceptance speech. Don't contend to stop there, white Cameron reveals to a live television audience that Howard is gay! Suspicion, paranoia and horror take place as the media descend on the sleeping city of Green Leaf, Indiana. (When the sexual deviance of the English teacher of the unnamed high school would arouse such great media concern?) Among those journalists is Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck of "High Road to China"), and wants to do an exclusive week on Howard . Howard, however, wants nothing to do with the witch-hunt media, especially with the annoying Peter Malloy. Howard denies Drake's gay allegations to everyone, including his girlfriend and his mother. Malloy lingers because he smells a scoop. The revelation turned Green Leaf upside down. The headmaster of the high school Tom Halliwell (Bob Newhart) agitates nervously with all the media coverage. Halliwell warns Howard that his marriage is not imminent, he should have given him a pink slip. Meanwhile, Peter bets to Howard that his marriage to Emily will fall at the last moment and be there to record the result to the camera. <br /> <br /> Howard uses audio tapes on macho men. Fight to reform himself. But Howard's efforts are useless. The guilt swells inside him. And then there's Peter Malloy, who forces him to talk about his homosexuality. Finally, on the altar in front of God, Howard breaks out. Of course, the betrothed Emily Montgomery is flaunted by Howard's gay confession. Predictably, the school fires Howard, but shows up for graduation. Drake also shows up and rushes to Brackett's defense. Not only did the school strip Howard of his work, he also awarded someone else's teacher of the year award. Drake appeals to the principal and wins Howard's unanimous support from the community. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in the script invented by Rudnick is Howard himself. Rudnick created a character too chaste to be true, both for gray and straight standards. Howard Brackett appears more like a saint than a sinner. Help a student gain admission to college, and train the athletic team. How often do you hear of an English teacher who is also a coach? Everyone in his high school loves Howard. He has no medium bone in his body. Furthermore, Rudnick and Oz ask us to believe that no one else in Green Leaf is gay. Where are Howard's gay friends? Are they too scared to come to his defense? No, "In & Out" is not strictly aimed at the homosexual public. Oz, whose cinematographic works include funny comedies such as "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" and "House Sitter", as well as Rudnick who moves on a tight politically correct string. "In & Out" is not a gay recruitment film. The directors show no interest in what prompted both Howard and Peter Malloy to prefer the gay lifestyle. Instead, Oz and Rudnick are only interested in focusing on a subtle premise: is he or is he not gay? They enrich it to involve the community's response to the response. In the end, when Howard admits he is gay, the filmmakers dedicate the rest of the films to show how a conservative, like Norman Rockwell, can accept him despite his difference. <br /> <br /> The most shocking scenes in "In & Out" is probably when tabloid journalist Malloy makes a lip on Howard. Heterosexual boys kissing in a movie about a homosexual identity crisis are hilarious as well as false. Kline and Selleck run their faces together in what looks more like a frontal collision than a closed mouth kiss. Not at all like the controversial 1994 British film "Priest", "In & Out" emerges as an engaging but laborious piece of social propaganda with its okay-to-be-act message. If "Ellen" were not the TV equivalent, "In & Out" would probably go to TV as a new sitcom. Looking at "In & Out" is not so much the way to deal with the problem of the gay or the straight, but as being a decent person in the last days of the 20th century. What makes "In & Out" a tolerable comedy about sexual intolerance is its equal opportunity that applauds and jokes to queer and steer.
