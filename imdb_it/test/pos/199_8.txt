While watching this movie recently, I had to constantly remind myself that it was made in 1957 .......... and in the USSR! This makes it even more remarkable. Many of the film effects in the film look like clich√©s in 2002, but by 1957 they were quite original. I saw this film for the first time in 1963, when it was first released in the United States, and I was struck by its originality. Now, having seen it 40 years later, I have no reason to change my mind.
