They were alternatives before there was an alternative, the Residents are a band like no other, and I love them for it. This has all their classics, from 'Hello Skinny', 'Third Reich and Roll' to their tribute to the great James Brown with a 'This is a Man's Man's World' version. But this is only the beginning. As a bonus, he also has Renaldo & the Loafs "The Songs for Swinging Larvae" and also the covers of The Residents. Needless to say, I highly recommend buying this DVD, I would also recommend buying their latest album "Demons Dance Alone", it's fantastic. <br /> <br /> Uncle Willie Eyeball Buddy # 502
