Along with almost all the images of the Republic ever made, "The murder in the music room" seems to have immersed itself in oblivion. A pity, because this suspiciously produced, expertly directed and suspiciously produced suspenseful article runs a thrilling whodunnit thriller against the setting of Radio City Music Hall. A murder in one of the building's neighboring attic apartments arouse suspicion on the succulent Rockette - including Vera Ralston (who besides offering a seductive interpretation of subtlety and vulnerability, offers some dazzling ice skating production numbers), Helen Walker Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop, and many other lovely stars from the B movie of the 1940s. Tall, blond and handsome, William Marshall (usually in musicals) hunts down the killer while the complex and increasingly gruesome plot unfolds, against the more mushy settings you'll see in a film noir. The ending is as much a surprise as this sadly forgotten class murder mystery. Cable TV, VHS or DVD is worth restoring and reactivating. The Republic has amassed a heavy budget in this Grade-A production, and "Murder in the Music Hall" is as elegant, nerve-racking and immensely fun as the films of the major studios of its era. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Pay attention to the rhapsodic song composed by the victim shortly before his death. Then, among the incessant chatter of showgirls in their dressing rooms, he tries to identify the one who hums that fatal melody. You'll find out who the murderer is like William Marshall. Great fun, the kind of films that really don't make any more and what a loss - both for movies and actors.
