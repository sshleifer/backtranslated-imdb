This is a case where the script plays with the audience in a way that only serves to extend this story to 90 minutes. The story begins in 1969, when a girl named Faith (Cameron Diaz) travels to Europe with her boyfriend Wolf (Christopher Eccleston) but dies in mysterious circumstances. Then in 1976, Faith's sister, Phoebe (Jordana Brewster), decided to travel to Europe and try to find out what happened to her sister. In France she looks for Wolf who has remained there and wants him to help her retrace her sister's steps and answer some questions. He is reluctant but decides to travel with her. Along the way he fills the gaps in the events and tells Phoebe that Faith has joined the Red Army which is an extremist group involved in terrorism. Phoebe and Wolf get engaged in a love story and this complicates the trip to Portugal where Faith died. There are several things wrong with this film and everything has to do with the script. First of all, the love story between Wolf and Phoebe is completely wrong and does nothing for the story. It sounds completely false and appears forced. It seems strange that Wolf entertains himself in a love story with the sister of his dead friends. Second, Wolf knows perfectly well what happened to Faith, but only releases small bits of information about every 15 minutes. Wolf will look at Phoebe every 15 minutes and say "There's something I didn't tell you"! Damn, thanks a lot Wolf! If Wolf had come clean the first time he talked to Phoebe, the movie would have ended in about 30 minutes. Another thing that bothered me is that I don't think this movie recreated the 60s. Diaz wears hippie clothes, but the period doesn't seem real. I liked some things like the authentic locations in which the film was shot. It is a very beautiful film and the scenery is beautiful. The performances are all good especially from Brewster and Diaz. Besides "The Fast and the Furious" I had never seen Brewster in anything. But after seeing his performance in this film, I came out very impressed. She's very good here and I hope the best roles come her way. The script is told in a very elaborate way and the film never seems credible.
