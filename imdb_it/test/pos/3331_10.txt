Come on. Anyone who does not understand the magnitude of this cartoon should be hunted by any group of critics. They should not be allowed to be heard, because they obviously have no sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Anyone who does not love this animated cartoon directed by Tex Avery should be chained to a chair and forced to watch episodes of "Huckleberry Hound" for 20 consecutive years! <br /> <br /> Wolf's take and double-takes in this comic are the best examples of this important comedy past that was never captured in a movie. <br /> <br /> Tex Avery should receive a posthumous Academy Award for this cartoon. Is the best.
