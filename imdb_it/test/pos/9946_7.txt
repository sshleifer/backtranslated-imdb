Four or five episodes of Johnnie Socko and his flying robot mounted together. Funny giant robot that fights giant monsters aimed directly at children. Parents will naturally go crazy when the action is violent with the robot / monster battles that resemble professional wrestling and the human being on human violence the kind of things that are found in the school of Al Capone St. Valentine's Day and Gangster Training Academy. I liked it, but then again I grew up in the series. If there is any problem, in addition to the variety of effects "man in jacket" is that the film plays like a series of episodes sewn together, with a climax that comes every 20 minutes. Recommended for those who are short of Ultraman or Godzilla
