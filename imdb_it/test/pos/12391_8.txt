Emilio is a successful businessman, a perfect father and a good husband. Or is that what everyone thinks. The perfect plot that he has carefully constructed over the years will suddenly close around him. Will he be able to keep up with his own lies? <br /> <br /> This is a very well defined drama, with great acting and directing. Even if the plot is pushed to the limit to increase tension, the film explores some of our worst fears ... Do we really know the people we are dealing with? Can we be so sure? <br /> <br /> The story unfolds at a faster and faster pace when it reaches the point where Emilio no longer has control over his lies. A good part of Spanish films have interesting stories but are far from technical skill. The perfect rhythm and the well-turned scenes make the actors so believable, we enter into Emilio, and we hate him, and we suffer for him, given that his situation becomes increasingly desperate. There is no need for any Spanish folklore, nor is it an attempt to create a Hollywood-style film. This is the real Spain of 2002 and, regardless of the obvious improbability of Emilio's life that exists in reality, there is a good chance that someone we know does not look like the person he claims to be. Not just a great commercial product, it will allow you to ask where lies can go. Can we keep up? <br /> <br /> Well done.
