Normally I'm not a drama type, but once I saw the "Radio" trailer, I couldn't resist. Not only is this a great movie, but it also has acting. Cuba Gooding Jr. did a great job playing James Robert Kennedy, a.k.a. "Radio". Ed Harris also did a great job as Coach Jones. I was pleasantly surprised to see even some comedy. So for a great story, great acting and a small comedy, I give "Radio" at 10 out of 10!
