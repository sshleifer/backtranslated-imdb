Ali G Indahouse has become one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and Cohen's portrait of an English gangsta is hilarious. This film has a cult classic written everywhere, and has some really great lines. Ali G Indahouse is a good party movie that will literally leave the viewer laughing from start to finish. Definitely rate Ali G and keep it real.
