The film is partly a thriller and partly a public service announcement to see events through the perspectives of politicians, terrorists and, of course, victims. In this astute drama lessons are given on the contamination and the chaos survived, while in the meantime the backstage observes how the crisis is managed pushes the spectators not to trust the guardians and to be frightened by the attackers. The film, originally broadcast by the BBC, manages to raise doubts about the official preparation. The performances are correct, sober but never exceptional. The film is just a beginning, a provocative beginning that leads to a wider discussion, but in my opinion it works, giving the right thrill and making the audience think and asking questions.
