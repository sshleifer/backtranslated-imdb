I have some of the old Dr. Who videos and DVDs. I played them again and again. I love each of the "doctors" for several reasons. But because of a man in the BBC hierarchy, Dr. Who was canceled, although he was still one of the pillars of the BBC line-up. With the departure of Sylvester McCoy, the Doctor remained alive through the fans. The BBC has kindly allowed fans to write books and cartoons. Dr. Who's momentum was constant even after 1989. Then they took the opportunity with Paul McGann. The film was imperfect, but it gave the BBC an idea of ​​what we wanted. In 1999, the "man" was gone and the newcomers to the BBC felt it was time to bring the doctor back. It was a complete success. Here in America, the science fiction channel took the opportunity and also became a complete success, although the authors had to start over and explain Dr. Who's mythology for new viewers. It's incredible for me to have done it. In Season 1, watching Christopher Eccleston with Russell T. Davis as lead writer and Phil Collinson as a producer, the Doctor returned to us and in each episode we learn more about who the Doctor is. The Doctor Who universe has always had to do with "Choice", "Love" and "Sacrifice". This is what they provided. It makes me want more and it saddens me that Mr. Eccleston chose to leave the show. My first doctor was the doctor no. 3, Jon Pertwee's Doctor. Mr. Eccleston doesn't have to worry about his position in the Dr. Who universe. It's solid like the rest. He is the ninth doctor. I didn't know Mr. Eccleston before his performance in Dr. Who, but I do it now. I wish there was a way, he could know, there's a push in the Dr. Who fan community to find his other work and enjoy it. We have already seen that he is a great actor.
