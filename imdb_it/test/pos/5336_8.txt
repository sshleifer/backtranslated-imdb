Although not the funniest half of "Chicken Run", the new Wallace and Gromit comedy "The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" (*** on ****) produces more laughter than most action comedies live. British director Nick Park, who created the characters of Wallace and Gromit, and co-director Steve Box rely on the old-fashioned, stop-motion animation method - better known as claymation - to create different visually adorable characters of enough scenes split on a monstrously mutant hare to devour every vegetable in sight. Funny as its extravagant plot, the heart of hilarity lies in the imaginative way in which Park and company have painstakingly built characters and gags from a plasticine brand called Plasticine. In essence, every shot you see in "The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" required patient souls to make slight alterations in the clay characters for a series of single shots that merged into a real montage of joy. Hollywood has pioneered claymation as a form of animation since the silent films of the 1920s, before the industry turned its back on the complicated process. The Aardman Studio animators were able to create only three seconds of usable video per day. For the record, "The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" took five years. The lumpy-looking characters, with their fingerprints clearly visible in their respective clay complexions, look incredibly funny with ping-pong ball eyes and mouths to bite. It is interesting to note that Gromit emerges as the funniest character, a lovable bastard without a mouth but an expressively inexpressive face that says more than most talking characters. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit are master and master respectively. Like the human half of the duo, Wallace is an umbrella moron without a clue that somehow manages to build machines that do pretty incredible things. One of the funniest scenes shows master and dog woken up by a system of slides, hatches and spring-loaded gadgets that dress them and feed them. Meanwhile, Gromit is the animal half. The joke is that Gromit shows more sense than his master genius. However good his ideas and inventions may be, Wallace could not do it without the loyal Gromit helping him. Our heroes manage a pest protection activity called "Anti-Pesto". Essentially, they have to protect every vegetable garden for miles around using a graceless-looking device called Bun-Van 6000 that literally sucks rabbits from the ground and into a huge glass container. No, Wallace and Gromit don't kill creatures. Instead, do they keep them as pets, and does Wallace experience an invention? Mind-O-Matic - designed to convert hares into carrot haters. This "Frankenstein" approach meets "The Fly" plunges poor Wallace into deep trouble when he exchanges fragments of his brain with that of a rabbit. Not long after, a mysterious and terrifying terror chases the vegetable fields on full moon nights and creates chaos for everyone, approaching the 517th annual vegetable contest. <br /> <br /> Initially, Wallace and Gromit appeared in the Oscar nominations for Park, a film project "A Grand Day Out" (1989). Since then Aardman has released ten more animated short films, including "Wallace and Gromit: A Close Shave" (1993) and Wallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousers (1995), Oscar winner. "The curse of the werewolf rabbit" differs not only because it represents the duo's big screen debut, but also works for 85 minutes: the first two thirds of "Were-Rabbit" contain better gags than the last third, but Park and the societies never lose the chance to slip into a joke for adults that children won't get but they will appreciate the more attentive adults. "Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" is a fun breeding moose.
