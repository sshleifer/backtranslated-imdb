I always thought Batman Returns was a great sequel to Batman. The story was interesting and Danny Devito, Christopher Walken and Micheal Keaton gave great shows. Also, Tim Burton was a genius and made the comic book character more fair than Joel Screwmacher ever did. <br /> <br /> Plot: Oswald Cobblepot also knows how The Penguin (played by Danny Devito) is abandoned by his parents as a child to be deformed. He uses it as an excuse to mask a sinister plot to kidnap Gotham's firstborn with the help of his henchmen (Red Triangle Gang) and a shady Max Shreck (played by Christopher Walken). Max Shreck later makes Penguin the mayor of Gotham. Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) is pushed out of a window by Max Shreck and is revived by the cats. He then develops cat qualities and tries to destroy Max Shreck and Batman. His reasons for wanting to destroy the dark knight are not explained. <br /> <br /> Opinion: Batman Returns is a classic. It looks darker in terms of atmosphere. Tim Burton has always had the ability to make the dark background attractive. Michael Keaton is still keen as Batman. Danny Devito steals the show as Oswald Cobblepot / The Penguin. When you think about it, he would have made a better violinist for John Leguizamo's Spawn. Michelle Pfeiffer gave Catwoman more personality than Halle Berry ever had. Max Shreck is one of Christopher Walken's best roles. The main reason why I like Batman Returns is that it's fun. It's not just creative but it's fun too. These days there is a lot of big budget movies that miss a lot. The Batman series goes to the dogs after Tim Burton has decided to do nothing else. You don't believe me, look at Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Thank God, Christopher Nolan has revived the Batman Begins series.
