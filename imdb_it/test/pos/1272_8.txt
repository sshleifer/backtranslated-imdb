The great British director Christopher Nolan (Momento, Insomnia), directs this strange film about a struggling writer obsessed by the people who follow. This turns out to be harmless at first, but soon becomes dangerous after bringing the game a step further after meeting a man with the same mentality that shows him the details of breaking and entering. The two men soon take the lead in a strange world involving the mafia and prostitution. Jeremy Theobald plays the writer and Alex Haw the friend who thinks the same way. Both are great shows. This low-budget film was shot in total guerrilla style without permits for any location and without big stars, but it has what many films with huge budgets don't have, which is a clever script and creative direction. An impressive debut by one of the best directors of today. Good stuff!
