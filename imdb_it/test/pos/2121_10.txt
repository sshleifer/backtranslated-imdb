I went to the "Grand Champion" preview involvement today (Dallas / Fort Worth, Austin, Snyder and a couple of other Texas cities). There are so few films suitable for young children ... but this is, and it's great. Although the plot is a bit "Hokey" (also the name of the beef in the film), it is a wonderful story for children. And I liked it too. <br /> <br /> The film pretty well represents the family life of the western Texas ranch, albeit a little exaggerated. The director / author Barry Tubb should have done it well since he grew up in that environment. He called the film his "love letter in Texas". <br /> <br /> Joey Lauren Adams plays the single mother of Buddy (Jacob Fisher) and Sister 'Blow' (Emma Roberts). Watch Emma Roberts (nephew of Julia Roberts); she is very good and I think it will be in other films. There are also cameo appearances by Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis, musicians George Strait, Charlie Robison, Robert Earl Keen, Joe Ely and rodeo legends Larry Mahan and Tuff Hedeman. <br /> <br /> If you have small children or simply want to see a movie in a good mood, check "Grand Champion" when it comes to your city (presumably after this month). You'll appreciate it and make you feel good. <br /> <br /> I think that since I'm from West Texas, I might be a little biased ... nah, I'm impartial. The film is excellent!
