I was very disappointed when this show was canceled. Even if I can't vote. I live on the island of Aruba. I sat down to watch the show on Tuesday. And he was very surprised that it was not transmitted. The next day I read on the Internet that it had been canceled. <br /> <br /> It is true that not everyone was as talented as the other. But there were talented people singing. <br /> <br /> I find it very sad for them. <br /> <br /> That they worked so hard and the dreams fell there. <br /> <br /> It's a shame <br /> <br /> Arlette Croes
