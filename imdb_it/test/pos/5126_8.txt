In "Hoot", a new baby arrives in Florida from Montana. First he faces the usual problems of mixing and facing the local bully. Soon, however, he realizes a bigger problem: a chain of franchised restaurants is trying to build a site in the city, right where a number of burrowing owls live. This film looks like a family movie, but it is much more radical than it looks, as it shows with sympathy how Roy and a couple of friends do not avoid the violation of the law (including the vandalism of private property and briefly kidnap restaurant chain manager) in the name of environmentalism (to save the owls, not less). Now, one could agree or disagree with those actions, but at least the film has the courage not to distance itself from its convictions. A good film, solid, all things considered.
