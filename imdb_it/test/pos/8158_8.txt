Latter Days is a very, VERY independent film. And compared to many of today's most modern films, it is lacking in many parts. Sometimes the shootings seem quite amateurish, the dialogues can be a bit broken and the characters are not particularly complex. So, don't have too much hope for this film, because, as I said, it's very independent. But all that is missing in the concrete aspects of the film can be overlooked because of the charm of history! I can't say that the plot is extraordinarily original, but the story is still beautiful and warms the heart in many ways! It's not about being gay against being straight, it's about faith, and how you decide to manage your life! It's a silly story, which makes you want to cry and smile at the same time! So to be honest, Latter Days is far from perfect, but I really loved the movie and I highly recommend it! He is very critical of the religious aspects of our society, and homosexuality is involved, but he approaches us with an open mind, and I'm pretty sure that most people will enjoy it as much as I do!
