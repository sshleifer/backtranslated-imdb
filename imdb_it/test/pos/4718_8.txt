It was time to shoot a film about the situation in a largely ignored Asian country like Myanmar and Beyond Rangoon is Hollywood's answer. Initially I thought that Hollywood would have dramatized the events of the 8888 uprising and added to the traditionally Hollywood spice of Titanic love between the heroine protagonist and the male Burmese protagonist who appears to be an old man. Fortunately, nothing of the sort was in place - which could also explain why the film was not financially successful. <br /> <br /> However, the film was honest with God and I was happy with the accuracy of the events portrayed. Apart from the fact that the shooting was done outside of Myanmar in Malaysia and Thailand and that I missed the exotic Burmese locals, I didn't find many flaws in the film. <br /> <br /> You cannot blame the film for the desperation of the people and the consequent oppressive actions. After all, they are real events of a civil war. The music of Hans Zimmer is certainly the USP of an otherwise adventurous tragedy for people who have no connection with it. <br /> <br /> I was only one year in Rangoon (now Yangon) during this tumultuous time. When I heard a film about my real life experience that I was too young to absorb, I had to take the DVD and, needless to say, I could hardly complain because it's a wonder that opens my eyes.
