I must say that one of the reasons why I thought the Aristocats was so big is because I love cats !!!! I like cats, which probably gave this film a great score from me, but not only, it was definitely a good movie like well, and I love where they set the film. This is one of my favorite animal films, even if it's animated, and I really like the way the actors and actresses didn't seem so unprofessional behind the animals' voice. For me this film seems like a classic to me, but I think that IMDb isn't, because it has, I think, I think it's too low to evaluate. Take a look at all the other Disney "ORIGINAL" films and have a much higher rating than this, but anyway AristoCats is one of the best animated films there is and I could enjoy it over and over again !!
