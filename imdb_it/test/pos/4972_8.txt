Brian Keith as Cole Wlikerson and Richard Jaeckel as Wade Matlock are excellent villains. They just love to intimidate the locals in the most brutal way possible, and to sneer sexually at every suggestion that there may be a more humane way to achieve their goals. It is a pity that the good Glenn Ford gets in their way.
