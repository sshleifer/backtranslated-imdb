Spoiler: this film has its problems, but in the end the message arrives. I liked it because it ends as things actually do. The good guy tries and tries, he breaks his heart several times, but in the end there isn't a typical Hollywood ending. End the way such things always end, or at least always in my and my friends' experiences. Anyone who thinks that the end of this is not how it happens, as the first comment seemed, believing that the girl would come around, realized she was going out with an asshole who treats her badly because he doesn't care about her at all or is naive lives in a world more perfect than me. I give them 7/10, extra points simply because they weren't afraid of ending up on a negative note, not giving a real resolution, only the main character left heartbroken, confused and alone like so many men of countless generations have been before.
