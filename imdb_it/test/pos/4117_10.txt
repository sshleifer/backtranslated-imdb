It was a fantastic movie! I like watching it again and again. The actors were fantastic. The film kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I would like Lifetime to put this movie on DVD. I would definitely buy a copy. This film simply shows that you should be very careful about who you are involved with. You might think you know someone, but you'll never know. My daughter watched the movie with me. He thought it was great. All I know is that I will watch this movie whenever life puts it on the air. It's the kind of movie that keeps you glued to t.v. I wish Lifetime would do the movie again, but use the same actors and bring it to the big screen.
