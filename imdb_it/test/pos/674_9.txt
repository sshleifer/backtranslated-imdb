The topic is World War II and Robert Ryan is a rejected soldier that Lupino takes on as a handyman. She is a war widow. <br /> <br /> The set is limited but the acting compensates for this. Robert Ryan is in conflict: a moment seems nice, so confused about where he lives. At first Lupino tries to help him. He looks upset but nothing more dangerous. But how do we know it? The suspense develops. I really like movies like this, which are based on the human element of suspense. What is this man capable of? There are some scenes with O.Z. Whitehead and Dee Pollock are an annoying shopping guy who sees something wrong. We continue to think that she will be helped, so Ryan's personality turns again. Become like a Jekyll / Hyde character and eventually chases Lupino with a knife. <br /> <br /> It is worth looking at these two superb actors. 9/10.
