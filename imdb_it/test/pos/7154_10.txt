Wow, I just took this movie from Blockbuster and I love finding gems like this. While it was definitely shot with a budget and it is a bit lacking in clumsy editing (ie incident, hospital scenes, penultimate scenes), for a first directorial effort, I give this 10 stars! I absolutely loved the stimulating concepts suggested and if you are a free thinker and open to ideas outside the box, I highly recommend this film. I think the director and writer, Jay Floyd, should receive attention and more opportunities in the film industry. Based on his credits, it could be another Quentin Tarantino.
