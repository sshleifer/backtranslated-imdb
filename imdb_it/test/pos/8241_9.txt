A really good Australian film. Beautifully recreates the appearance of Sydney as it was in the 1950s. This film impressed me a lot when I first saw it during its first film release and it continues to hold up very well. Excellent work by Phil Noyce, excellent work with the camera, weighted lighting and some excellent performances across the board. An absolute "must see" for all the students of the Australian cinema of the 70s. One outside the box!
