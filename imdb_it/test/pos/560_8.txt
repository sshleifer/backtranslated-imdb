This is an extraordinary film. As a court drama, it is convincing, as an accusation on the American judicial system, it is appalling. For Brenton Butler the consequences of this system could be devastating. This film highlights the fundamental defects of the legal process, which is not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, it is about who looks better in court. In reality, the implications of this case go beyond the possibility that an innocent person is found guilty or that a guilty man is free. Every citizen has the right to justice, whether it is an author or a victim. But do they understand? The film is well structured, undervalued and one of the best court documentaries I've ever seen.
