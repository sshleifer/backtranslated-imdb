I remember a university professor who commented on how disturbing this film was, reflecting adolescent apathy (this was before Generation "X"). <br /> <br /> In a sense, many of us are products of the same consumer culture; these high school kids spend their time drinking, getting up and wondering what to do with the body left on a river bank. <br /> <br /> What would they do today? Would things be different? Some very important questions. There are some excellent scenes with Keanu Reeves and the dysfunctional family he lives with; the eleven-year-old brother who goes to get spoiled; the mother has no idea what to do - she spends her time drinking with her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> This film was a little ahead of its time as it addresses the problems of the lower class American society; these children had no outlet; What is available to them in this city of dirty water? . All in all, some interesting social comments are presented and there are no solutions. 9/10.
