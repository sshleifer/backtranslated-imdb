Le Cercle Rouge by Jean-Pierre Melville follows the vicissitudes of two criminals: Vogel (Gian Maria Volontè), a murderer who lifts the police while being transferred from one city to another by train; and Corey (Allain Delon), a thief just released from prison. Fate decides to join these two men to pull off a spectacular robbery. In the background is Matei (André Bourvil), detective Vogel escapes from, relentless in his search and sometimes ruthless in his methods. Along the film, the viewer meets other minor but fascinating characters, the best of whom is Jansen (Yves Montand), a disgraced ex-policeman and an excellent marksman. <br /> <br /> Melville has such a unique style that it doesn't have to watch many of his movies to capture. Le Samourai, Un Flic and Le Cercle Rouge are clearly made with the same fabric: symmetrical corners; long shots; the silences; coats, hats and cigars; the quotation marks at the beginning; the incredible blows, the fatalism; the unglorious and inglorious criminal life. Everything that is beautiful in Melville is present here in top form. <br /> <br /> And his shortcomings didn't bother me so much this time: the illogical and bewildering behavior of his characters and the confusing narrative, which hurt my other films, are almost invisible here. Since Le Cercle Rouge preceded Un Flic, this does not mean that it has improved over time; maybe I'm just getting used to and reaching a mindset that doesn't bother me anymore. <br /> <br /> Melville has made unique crime films. As old as they may seem, they show more ingenuity, realism and grace than modern techno-thrillers in which cold thieves use computer systems and James Bond tools to snatch impossible crimes. Melville criminals are not cold: they are alone, socially awkward and probably aware that they are not good for much more than planning for attacks. They are unwanted people in society, they live in the night, always one step ahead of the police in a game that they know they eventually lose. There is nothing romantic about them. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly for a film of this type, the cops are not even complete idiots. Matei is intelligent, astute, patient and even compassionate. It's not an inexplicable villain or a cliché, it's just an old man who does his job and does it the right way. Knows when to use force and when to use your brain. Many movies could learn from him. <br /> <br /> It is this sober and non-romantic style that makes Melville's films so happy to watch and places it on a special pedestal as one of the great masters of cinema crime.
