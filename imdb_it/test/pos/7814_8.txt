I took it for the first time a few nights ago on television. I expected to tune in for just a few minutes, but I found myself intrigued by the movie. I ended up looking at everything and found it surprisingly compelling. The acting of the three American protagonists was quite good, especially that of Alex Cord. He plays a gunslinger with some degree of vulnerability. Very different from how many of them are portrayed in westerns. He ended up in different situations where he was at the mercy of bounty hunters. The final shooting between the three protagonists and the villains was very good, as was the scene in which the doctor digs a bullet from Clay McCord. Quite creepy, but realistic. I must admit that, despite my initial doubts in watching a "spaghetti western", I ended up enjoying this movie a little. I would recommend it to anyone who loves westerns.
