USA The film is like this: take a nap in a long, hot Sunday afternoon. It's nice to close your eyes and let your worries go away. Soon you will get lost in one of those intense lucid dreams where you know you are dreaming but you still can't wake up, not what you want. You go with the flow and soon you'll find yourself in a kind of strange story of Alice in Wonderland, with characters you didn't think you could imagine. They are telling you all kinds of crazy things about war and peace as they take you on a journey into the past and even into the future. <br /> <br /> The dream starts to get heavier and you feel like you're following a path you can't control. Maybe you want to wake up, so try to open your eyes, but you can't. Now there is destruction, sadness, confusion and frightening voices that tell you what the truth could be or could be lies. You are seeing images that flicker and change and then become clear, but do you also want to see what you are creating for yourself? <br /> <br /> Finally you are lost in a world of myths and you realize that the end has come. The end of the world and the end of the dream. It's over. What did you wake up? What do you do next? <br /> <br /> Maybe you would write that dream because you know you dream like they don't happen too often ... and when you do watch out. <br /> <br /> Or maybe you'll create a beer and forget everything. Bad idea. Do not forget
