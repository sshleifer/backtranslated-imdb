I was expecting a lot from this film and I can say I was not disappointed. First of all, this film, like a world tour of wine production, allows the viewer to enjoy beautiful places. The people interviewed are really interesting and fun, especially Hubert de Montille. Shooting can be confusing, the camera is always unstable and often focuses on secondary elements in the backgrounds. You might not like it, but I don't consider it a flaw. <br /> <br /> Even the issues raised in the film can be a bit confusing, since globalization is not the only issue discussed. But Nossiter managed to give the film a consistent consistency. A great success of this film is revealing all the characters involved in the wine industry as they are, avoiding a clich√© "Good against evil". This could be the main difference between the "Mondovino" and Michael Moore documentaries; Nossiter's point of view appears subtly, through the opinions expressed by his favorite characters. The richness of this documentary is mainly based on the characters, on the history of long-standing wine-producing families, such as the De Montilles, Mondavis, Antinori and Frescobaldi. Nossiter lets the viewer discover that wine is somehow linked to families, rather than just being a business and an industry. This film does not make you want to drink wine, but it certainly makes you want to discover vineyards and wine producers. <br /> <br /> I saw this film as a student in Oenology, and we see that there are many ways to learn. I give this documentary 10 out of 10, despite its technical peculiarities.
