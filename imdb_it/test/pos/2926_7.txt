Although this episode was offensive to the Tourette Syndrome Association, others thought it was funny, while others thought it was a bad way to start the new season. <br /> <br /> This episode was fun and simply shocking. South Park has made history its first episode with the most beautiful words, unless you consider the film as an episode. <br /> <br /> I liked how they made fun of Chris Hansen and his TV show, at Catch a Predatore. I didn't like the idea of ​​how they thought Chris Hansen would do a tourettes show and let a guy talk and hit the Jews. <br /> <br /> One thing I didn't like is how South Park thought that people with tourettes syndrome would make such a bad language. I have seen people on television with Tourettes syndrome and not only have they come up with bad words. Unless it's correct.
