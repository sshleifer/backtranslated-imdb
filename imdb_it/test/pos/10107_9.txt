I love horror movies, but I think they work a lot better when they hide a dramatic impact behind it (The Devil's Backbone, The Exorcist, for example). This is that kind of film, and it's not just scary and terrifying when it has to be, it's also very beautiful. A story of two sisters starts very slowly, so if you are in a hurry to see the ghosts in the first 20 minutes you will be disappointed. In reality this is not a ghost story, although there are some. It's something more complex, and it's done in such a way as to beat Ringu and The Grudge out of the ring without sweat. A story?? it is a much smarter film than those great cultural successes, because it really cares about its characters, and the direction is impeccable. Every detail in this film will leave you breathless if you are the kind of person who likes to pay attention to details while watching a movie. The acting is superb, especially by the stepmother and the main girl. Those two are worth only the ticket price. Do yourself a favor and watch this fantastic movie.
