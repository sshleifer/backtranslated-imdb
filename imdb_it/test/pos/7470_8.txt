I saw the film yesterday and for me it was an extraordinary combination of films like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The best of the best. It has never been boring and always moving, every hour there is another character who is worried (trying to kill him). You never know what's next. In a word TERRIFIC !!!
