I have seen so many negative reviews on Supervitientes de los Andes that I felt obliged to support it (or at least I'll try). First of all, of course, it looks dated, it was made in the seventies with a very low budget, but it's part of its appeal. I like contemporary films, but I also write old ones for what they are worth. I'm not the one who feels the urge to see or appreciate films with modern treatments and effects; moreover, almost every movie lover loves old-fashioned movies (who doesn't like El Santo or Plan 9 movies from outer space, regardless of the overall quality?). In the rhythm aspect, it's just a tool to cover (again) it's low cost, and I think the constant dialogues are in order of character development and better situations. Of course, Alive has a better FX, but I won't despise the old one just for that, and I don't feel quite attracted to the British taking part in an event involving people from Uruguay and for me, which gives Supervivientes de los Andes an advantage. It is as if also Canoa, from the seventies and based on a real event, had a better remake thanks to the advancement of technology, but I think I would stick to the one based on the emotions it offers regardless of the date of production. <br /> <br /> All this is based on the impact it had on me because the first time I saw it was on TV, and nowadays I don't think it has lost any of its primary strength. Sure, it's been a long time and I've seen tons of better films in every aspect of cinema, but that doesn't diminish its true value. It's not a bad movie, and I put it on Alive without hesitation. Just give it a break.
