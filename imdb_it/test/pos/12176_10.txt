I was watching the TV guide for the films that came from Germany and I found one called The Bunnyguards, so I looked at it and giggled! I wanted the DVD but it's not available here (I could order it from Germany but it doesn't have subtitles) It was played again, so I recorded it and watched it from time to time. <br /> <br /> In any case, I searched for information about it and discovered that its real name is Erkan & Stefan, but I know from its Australian title: The Bunnyguards. <br /> <br /> Some people I know from Germany don't like Erkan & Stefan because of their accents, but not being German myself, I didn't notice anything. The jokes are good, but some Germans may find their accents discouraged. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is fun and if the DVD had English subtitles on all the extras (having a 2-disc version with only the subtitle function would be bad) I would buy it in a moment ! <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh and a good story.
