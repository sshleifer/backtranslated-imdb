This film is superb, has the same feeling as the first low-cost movie of "Pi" and "Clerks", but has the style of "Memento" (also by writer / director Christopher Nolan). The soundtrack, sound effects, photography and editing are almost "Memento" prototypes and the story shows that Christopher Nolan is the best when he writes and directs. Do not be discouraged by the low budget aspect, by acting, or even by the short duration of the film, and watch it!
