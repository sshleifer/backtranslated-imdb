I was very impressed with Martha's narrative and the way she attracted the audience's emotional strings and how it must have had an impact on the family. The back-and-forth movement of the plot was well done, and normally I don't like movies with flash-back / flash-forward effects. During the whole evolution of the film I heard that "Tommy certainly did it". It leaves you with the feeling of how these people lived their lives almost totally devoid of each other and the consequences of not having any desire to answer the question "are 10. Are you aware where your children are?" And also: "What the hell are they doing?" !! Or "Do I care?" !! Cries, spoiled brats who literally end up in murder. Or so they thought .......
