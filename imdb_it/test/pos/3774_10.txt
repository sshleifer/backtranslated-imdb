I loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More classic sci-fi / horror movies should be redone at this comic level, which is at the top of the line in my opinion. A film no drink, you laugh so hard that you'll pour it all over yourself. Can we expect more? Let's hope. I would like to suggest many films for this type of remake. Mel Brookes has made some remakes of classic films. He made some very strong contributions. A picture of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion. I hope some producer or director can get into the idea and bring us a new comedy on our screens. we need a good comedy uprising to keep our level of laughter higher than ever. A good FIX comedy.
