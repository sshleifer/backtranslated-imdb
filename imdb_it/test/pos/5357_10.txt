When Wallace and Gromit came on the scene in their Academy Award-winning short film, "A Grand Day Out", they created a new look for Claymation. After two more short films, Aardman's dynamic pair is back for this fun and entertaining movie. He has an excellent vocal cast, humorous jokes and good animation, as only Aardman could do! <br /> <br /> In this film, Wallace and Gromit run "Anti-Pesto", a rabbit removal company. When the word is spread about a "werewolf-rabbit" that eats all the vegetables in the city, a frenzy arises. Obviously, Victor Quartermaine, the handsome toupee brand hunter from the city, wants to get his hands on the rabbit to impress the beautiful Lady Tottington ... but will our favorite Aardman duo save the day before chaos follows? <br /> <br /> The jokes, I should say, were hilarious. One point, the villain, Victor Quartermaine's, his crack-booty was showing, prompting a character to shout: "ATTENTION ... THE MOON !!!" Vintage Aardman! <br /> <br /> The characters are sharp and fun. Our favorite Man and Dog team Aardman entertains us as only they could do, earning their second Oscar (remember "A Grand Day Out?"). Helena Bonham Carter was as exceptional as the lovely Lady Tottington, Wallace's love interest. Ralph Fiennes was particularly amusing and conceited as the wily Victor Quartermaine hairpiece. But what really stole the show was the priest, whose antics turned out to be an exhilarating comic relief. An affectionate greeting to Aardman for creating another masterpiece by Wallace and Gromit!
