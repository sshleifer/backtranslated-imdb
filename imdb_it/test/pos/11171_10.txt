This is a very well written suspenseful film to the end! The setting is beautiful in contrast to the terrifying action that takes place there! It's not your typical suspense movie, but a well-made film with interesting twists and surprises that will leave you wanting and hoping for a sequel. I recommend this movie to all lovers of suspense!
