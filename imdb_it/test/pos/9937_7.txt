Opera (the title of the United States is the terror of the opera) is a bit of a disappointment after some of Dario's other films like Phenomena, Tenebre and Suspiria. (I still can't find Hell anywhere.) It's one of those movies that has a great first half but halfway it's like someone started slowly letting air out of the script and logic. <br /> <br /> plot involves a beautiful opera singer who is haunted by a fan obsessed with derangs. this killer starts by killing people close to her in a very unique way. he ties her and torments her and puts thin pins under her eyelids so that if he tries to close his eyes he tears her eyes. this forces her to watch as the murderer kills his acquaintances in a typically brutal and bloody manner Silver. <br /> <br /> unfortunately, in the middle of the film it becomes lazy and illogical. (this is particularly directed towards the motivations of the murderer, I have not yet fully understood why he is so crazy.) The final in particular leaves the left field in the worst possible sense. <br /> <br /> but for about the first hour or so they are some of Dario's best films and the work with the camera is breathtaking. pity that he could not keep it until the end. <br /> <br /> evaluation: 7
