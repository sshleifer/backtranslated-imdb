I really think this movie deserves the Oscars! I really don't care what people can say bad about this movie ... because it's a very well played part by Samuel L. Jackson, and mostly by Christina Ricci !! I am a big fan of his, since I saw her in the Addams family ... I tried to look at all the things she creates, and this is absolutely one of the best parts she has played !! I love his appearance (even if people say he is not pretty ... I think he is ... and I love his eyes) !! The film is about many things ... people say it's religious ... people say it's racism ... people say it's drugs ... people say it's nymphomania ... ... well ... maybe it's a bit of all this !! But what I really feel is that this movie has a high level of eye-opening for what the blues is ... what it represents ... and mainly came from: life ... heart ... pain ... pain ... and above all ... spontaneous feelings !! I hope you can see it ... if you're the kind of person who likes a film not just from the images or the story it tells ... this is a good movie to see ... if your not ... well ... I see it anyway ... it doesn't hurt so much, and you see Christina Ricci acting so excited !! She is a fox !!
