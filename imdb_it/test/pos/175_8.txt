Interesting cardboard, included on the DVD of "The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra". I especially like the way color was used in background art - very artistic for Columbia, whose cartoon department generally had a very low budget (and the results looked like this!) <br /> <br /> I wonder, however, like a certain ... um, finger gesture ... he never passed the censors. Of course, the gesture in question was seen much less frequently in 1937 than it is today. You would think that someone, apart from the animators, would have noticed it, especially because it is seen three times in the scene in question! And based on the context, I suspect his inclusion was intentional, something the animators have slipped just to see if the censors NOTICE!
