I took this movie on TV yesterday. I had some curiosity, being directed by Emilio Estevez and played by him and his dad, Martin Sheen. I like to see a film about a father-son relationship involving a father and a child in real life. Of course, there is an instant chemistry between Sheen and Estevez, and their conflict scenes are even more intense, knowing that they are actually related. Of course, it helps that both are both terrifying actors. I saw Martin Sheen in intense roles before, but I think this is Emilio's most intense role - being that I remember him above all from the "Mighty Ducks" series - and I was very impressed. Talent REALLY works in that family. And Kathy Bates steals the film in an Oscar performance. He pulled my heart strings with every word of dialogue. Kimberly Williams - the beautiful actress of the films "Father of the Bride" - is also very good, and is the master of a group of talented veteran actors. <br /> <br /> The film is a bit theatrical, with dialogues clearly oriented towards the stage, but this didn't bother me. This is not meant to be an action movie; this is a study of the character. And for a film based on a play, it never becomes too claustrophobic. When the character of Emilio, Jeremy, remembers his days in Vietnam, we really see his heart-rending memories coming to life. <br /> <br /> The film is extremely powerful and realistic, without being sentimental. In the end, I expected all conflicts to be resolved and the family became hunky-dory, but it is not. The ending made me cry, without resorting to the standard Hollywood melodrama. This shows that reality is far more compelling than anything Hollywood can evoke. <br /> <br /> If you are in the mood for a beautiful and powerful drama with extraordinary performances that will leave you speechless ... please check out this underrated gem. I hope that one day Martin and Emilio will join Charlie, and together they will make a great film. <br /> <br /> My score: 9 (out of 10)
