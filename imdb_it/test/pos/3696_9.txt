Jenny Lewis plays an awkward girl called Jade. She smokes and drinks. He doesn't have many friends and has an annoying mother (Beverly D'Angelo). Jade finds herself getting closer to her mother's boyfriend, Billy (Rob Estes), maybe she is attracted to him. Of course, I don't need to tell you what happens next. <br /> <br /> This is probably my favorite TV movie. This film shows that sometimes everyone is to blame. This film also has the best acting I've seen in TV movies. Beverly D'Angelo does a really nice job as a sweet and loving but careless and blind mother. He couldn't see what was happening under his own roof. Rob Estes is at his best here as the sleazeball. Jenny Lewis is the protagonist. He seems to be exactly like his character. <br /> <br /> Everyone seems to love this movie!
