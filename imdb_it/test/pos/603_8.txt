You know, it's very interesting to see this ... half of the people involved are now dead ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a long time since I've seen anything about Muppet, but this stuff is golden pure. I'm a big fan of word games, and this movie has put them pretty well, but one of the amazing aspects is its rhythm: it's not really the rhythm of high-speed children where the directors randomly decide to move the story without giving depth to the character, it's just a kind of moves along with the characters where they want to go. <br /> <br /> Kermit the Frog is just a fantastic character. His voice and the expressions on his puppet are fantastic. But above all, he underlines why he is popular - "he can also sing and make jokes!" - but more appropriately because it is so captivating - he effortlessly inspires everyone to look for their dreams. Meanwhile, he also has to do with himself, which is an uncommon theme in family movies. <br /> <br /> It also contains a nice group of comedians who make appearances here and there, some with great effect, others for a little less (I think the part of Mel Brook was a bit exaggerated, true ?). Some parts of the film are just a little weird. But it is very imaginative and takes you to the same destination from a very different direction. <br /> <br /> Moving along ... <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
