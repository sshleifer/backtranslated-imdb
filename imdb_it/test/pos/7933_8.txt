Of so many excellent and so on in Nevskij, a particularly compact zing has tickled them so much that it ended up being the decisive moment of the film for me. <br /> <br /> Or at least the one that tends to push annoying people to watch the film, brandishing the disc in hand to emphasize. <br /> <br /> The current vague abstract recognition of the fairly simple and concrete guilt involved in the guilty pleasure of this can really gel and incites me to pay the intellectual bill in the end. <br /> <br /> Until then ... <br /> <br /> The disappearance of the organist was so right.
