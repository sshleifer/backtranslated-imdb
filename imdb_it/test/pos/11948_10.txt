I saw this movie for the first time in 1988 when it was on HBO and I loved it !! It was so funny that I saw it too many times to count. I love the Stork brothers and the pitiful and ugly dog, Bosco! My favorite quote from the movie is "It's so ugly, it should be put to sleep". I liked it a lot even when the little sister slaps the girls on the back and their faces stick in that way. I also love John Cusack and Demi Moore in this film. They were fantastic. This film reminds me of my university days when I saw it for the first time. I rented the movie countless times and watched it over and over again. My college roommate and I can't get enough. Who couldn't love this crazy movie ?! I want to buy a copy on DVD, does anyone know where I can find it?
