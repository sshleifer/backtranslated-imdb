This is a very funny drama with an excellent cast. Garfield is as good as a boxer hiding from the police with that heterogeneous group of Dead End Kids. The most notable of these is the beautiful Billy Halop who has some very moving moments. Gloria Dickson, who in real life died very young in a fire, is as strong and very attractive as Halop's sister, and in the early scenes Ann Sheridan, on the brink of celebrity, is a knock-out. May Robson is very funny as an old crusty granny, but Claude Rains shows here that even a great actor can ride if in crisis (who thought to make him a tough New York cop?) <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley shows here that he was a good director with or without musical numbers. The film moves at an incredible pace and the sequence of the water tower is very suspenseful and well photographed. The finish is artificial, and the plot is nothing surprising or original, but I still found a very pleasant experience.
