Written, recited and produced in a fantastic way! I enjoyed seeing this brilliant and talented cast, each of them, giving such a great interpretation. This film has thoroughly warmed the clams of my heart! Great storytelling! <br /> <br /> This is a great movie for the month of black history. Packed with an accurate portrait of recent history and very real characters who have endured incredible pain - with dignity and confidence in a better future. It is so easy to see how these different adults have all affected this child and contributed to the fertile imagination that would eventually fuel the talent of his adult age. The next time you are in the company of a child who listens and watches, remember; show or could be a writer-in-the-making!
