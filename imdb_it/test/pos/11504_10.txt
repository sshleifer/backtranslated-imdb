If this film is not selected for an Oscar nominated for best foreign film, I will stop waking up at the evenings during the event. Fridrik Thor Fridriksson has shown that money is not the key to making a good film but originality. From a cold country comes a hot but inspiring film about a mentally ill and his struggle against a crazy world. After an intuition like this, you wonder if the man is crazy or the world he lives in.
