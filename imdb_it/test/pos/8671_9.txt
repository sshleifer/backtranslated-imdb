Andreas arrives in a strange, inhuman place, where everything seems perfect. He did a good job, everyone is nice to him and everyone, and he doesn't even worry too much about finding a beautiful girl. But in this nameless city, Andreas soon finds that a perfect commercial world is not really a paradise. Really one of the best movies I've seen this year. The attractive texture is perfectly supported by an intelligent direction in which every single component (cold desaturated photo, cold symmetrical design, non-emotional action, slow and controlled movements of the camera) helps to create a unique strange atmosphere that will keep the audience suspended until end. A sarcastic, ironic, bitter comedy that made me laugh and think, as only the best films can do. Nothing new, probably, in the analysis of the modern dehumanizing civilization, but in reality an intelligent work with great surprising ideas that will hardly be forgotten by those who have been lucky enough to see it. Simply the incredible subway scene.
