Has the proliferation of relatively high quality shows on proliferating television networks allowed people to produce, direct, finance and / or act in their own films that they otherwise would not have been able to do? Is this a good thing? <br /> <br /> This film does not answer this last question either way, but it seems that without Curb, Jeff Garlin would not have been able to make anyone eat cheese. <br /> <br /> Like most new producers / directors, Jeff Garlin's independent piece emits a much more sensitive sigh than the vehicle for which it is primarily known (Curb). Still, is it a sensitive film? He is not really a sensitive boy. Nice, sure. Reliable, really. <br /> <br /> What this movie really is about is a little hard to say, I can only report what I took away. I rented the film because of the trailers, in particular the scene of a consultant played by Amy Sedaris informing James Aaron (Garlin) that a particular woman is interested in him mainly because he is a "chubby pursuer". "I almost fell out of my seat. Based on that scene alone, I ran to my computer to write a note to myself about renting this movie. The reason - I thought the school counselor (Sedaris) talked about Beth, played by "Sarah Silverman. I imagined a light romantic comedy between the foxy Silverman and the fat Garlin. I didn't think the story would be something original, but that the dialogue would be snappy and that the scenes would move at a satisfying pace. In short , I thought it would be a comedy. <br /> <br /> It was interesting that the film started that way, but then it took a much more realistic turn when Beth gave James the panting because " I've never really been with a fat guy before. "That's how we live life brutally, and it was completely realistic. I applaud the decision. It just meant that Beth now left the building and with her, the only snappy person. el film. <br /> <br /> Even James's relationship with his mother was interesting. That part made me think whether the whole concept started as a game. He had that tangled feeling. (The whole movie "Marty" in a movie was completely lost on me because I never saw that movie.) There were serious doubts about the character of James Aaron, though. Is it really possible that at 39 he had not had a serious relationship? And is he an actor? It wasn't really in line with me. For me, his character was less actor-y, and more corporate. Not even I could really buy his ordinariness. No doubt he was extremely disappointed that things with Beth didn't work. We heard it. But then, did he really care? <br /> <br /> Another thing: how in the world can he and his mother afford to go out at the same time? Didn't you just lose your job? The last one he had? This was one of the reasons it didn't seem normal. Where does the funding for his life come from? <br /> <br /> Still, I read reviews that talk about the realistic representation of urban solitude, so there isn't. Yes, it is very realistic, the way we must be satisfied with what we have because it is all we have. The way they disappear from ourselves and each other in interactions (James and Stella), a kind of self-abandonment that takes place only to move on to the next moment. This, in contrast to the possibility of defining ourselves through our moments, our thoughts as James had with Beth, is really overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Very well done.
