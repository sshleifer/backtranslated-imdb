I must confess that I know some of those involved, I was in the precursor of The Planet, Evil Unleased, but this was over 10 years ago and I had lost contact with them since. I happened to watch BBC Scotland News and a piece about Scottish cinema, this one mentioned and showed clips from The Planet and comments from its director Mark Stirton, which prompted me to order a copy of the film on DVD. <br /> <br /> Now at the film, the level of acting, writing, directing and sfx is up there with some of the best around, OK is not Star Wars but I have seen many Hollywood products that are far inferior. It is very strange to watch a film pronounced in my local accent in the north east of Scotland, but that has passed quickly. <br /> <br /> ^ Slight spoiler ^ <br /> <br /> The planet is based on several science fiction classics; Star Wars, Alien, Pitch Black, Forbidden Planet and Predator, a handful of the mercantile crew of a deep space transport ship survives their boats attacked and destroyed by unknown ships, fleeing a desert desert, one by one they are killed by invisible attackers, only passenger ships, a mysterious prisoner also arrives on the planet, a battle ensues while the crew struggles to survive. <br /> <br /> The Planet is a brilliant piece of science fiction film that certainly hides its limited budget, well done for Mark, Mike and all those involved, I can't wait for your next job to start .
