The best part of this movie is that you can watch it over and over again and still not be happy to watch it. I've seen this movie at least 10 times in the last 12 years and it still makes me laugh like I'm watching it for the first time. I really like good comics like Orgazmo, Cheech n chong, the Monty Python series and many others, but this in Hindi is one of my favorite favorite movies. Some of them recently in Hindi are Golmaal, Munnabhai and Herapheri series. So all I can say is that the Hind play is finally evolving. But Andaaz Apna Apna is quite different from the films I mentioned above. It is what I call the Hindi-Tune comedy and very few of the kind found in 1994 in Hindi cinema. Cheers to Rajkumar Santoshi for the brilliant film
