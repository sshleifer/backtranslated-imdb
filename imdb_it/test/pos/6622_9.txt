My skateboarding career ended in 1974, when my two-for-four steel-wheeled skateboard skateboard hit a rock and I fell, for days seemed, on the sidewalk outside my parents' home in Boston. When the cast took my arm away, the summer was gone. <br /> <br /> But I've always admired the types of X-games and surfers in particular. I think I spent the first month after moving to Southern California, to the beaches and docks, watching the surfers, complaining that I had lost my call. It's the kind of thing you should learn young, before the horrible feelings of self-preservation and self-awareness creep in. Or else, at best, you'll be so worried about not hurting yourself or laughing, you'll find yourself looking like a trained bear. <br /> <br /> I have always admired how a good surfer does not worry about anything except that moment, that wave, that experience. One with the forces of nature. A good surfer makes it seem like there's nothing but that wave right there, and the way you interact with it. There is a lot of Zen in this film. <br /> <br /> This documentary describes how some young people took the concepts of surfing and extended them to skateboarding. Ramps, downgrades, minimal curves as they interact with concrete waves under their feet. In their day and time, this was all new. radical. Before the Zephyr Skate team the idea was apparently to go faster than you could in a straight line on a skateboard, so my long "Evel Knievel at Caesers Palace" like a fall along the front walk. <br /> <br /> This film is a look back in time, in an America before EVERYTHING was labeled, tagged, marketed and caged in the throat as "Extreme". (Seriously, what's so "extreme" in an "extreme value meal" at Taco Bell? Except that it's an extreme danger to your colon ...) <br /> <br /> Watch this film and watch the film birth of "extreme sports". Before there was an X-game, before Boom-boom Huck-Jam, before Crusty Demons, before the ASA ... there were these young street kids who created "extreme sports" without really trying. They were doing it only for purity, pure pleasure, skateboarding in the sun with friends. <br /> <br /> I hope they get an "extreme" money cut out there. God knows they don't get the credit they deserve. Maybe this movie can correct it. <br /> <br /> Excellent film with a great soundtrack, a portrait of Southern California, indeed an America that no longer exists. <br /> <br /> I don't care Sean Penn but he does a decent job narrating.
