The problem with the film is simply this, Conrad's prose is powerfully verbose and cannot be adapted to a film. Marlow's narrative in the novel fascinates you from the first sentence and you "see" only what Conrad writes. In the film, it's different, you see the visual, but the description and reflection that really makes the novel, is frighteningly missing. But although an unsuitable book has been adapted, it is of a good standard. There are the same identical scenes, which are identified quite ingeniously, but they never have the same effect as the novel. The film's plot has been improved and works very well to make it more interesting. References to Ancient Egypt have been carefully inserted. My advice, read the book and keep it that way, there are better films out there.
