Reading some of the other reviews of this film, I was reminded of both the good and the less good aspects of it. But overall, I have to say that it's one of the best films I've seen recently from any number of genres or countries. More than anything else, he avoided many trappings typical of the most recent international cinema, such as taking beautiful landscape photos or being "hip", "funny" or imitating American films like pulp fiction. The film is unique in many ways. First, it's a film about relationships in which sex has no role (unusual, especially for foreign films). It is also a film about the relationship between two men (also unusual - not a "friendly film", no homosexual tension, no ego / phallic competition). Use a little dialogue, but communicate an enormous amount. It is a simple story, but full of complex details that are easily understood by any human being and universal in their relevance. I did not find the film obscure or depressing (everything would seem this way if you watch Hollywood movies that end in a good mood all the time), but rather a true reflection of human emotions. For example, in the scene where Mahmut realizes that his cousin is gone, you can see both his sense of relief, that his cousin has disappeared and, despite this, he regretted having dismissed him. Who has not experienced this ambivalence - when he loses a friend or a lover, or in some other situation? It is rare for this type of real human emotion to appear on the film in an unconventional way. As far as culture is concerned, or if it is a Turkish film, I feel that it is in the difficult balance between being a "Turkish" film - on the realities that apply most to that place (the biggest struggle to do it in a Turkish city against a European one, the greatest contrast between country and city) and a universal human history that did not necessarily have to be set in Turkey. On this day when people all over the world are consuming the culture and fetishizing it, this film does not try to entice us as "Turks", nor does it try to communicate it as a "harsh reality", or "that's how Turkey / Istanbul IS '. Yet the cultural elements are there. I think the comparison with' lost in translation 'that someone did is good enough. Everyone, at least in the United States, was excited about that movie, I personally thought it was mediocre at best. It was put well by someone as a vague story that supposedly would have faced the "disorientation" that happens to people living or traveling abroad. Even if the film was to be fun, the characters and their motivations or crises were not never clear (even for a film or a "lighter" comedy, this is necessary.) And I found myself being treated to a typically "orientalist" story of the alienated America from overseas. But it concerns the idea that it is a bad acting, or too slow, or that it has no plot, I am sorry but whoever says this does not know anything about the cinema and perhaps nothing about the human being, without offense. You don't have to be a movie fan or cultural connoisseur to enjoy this movie. This film will be two hours of your time well spent!
