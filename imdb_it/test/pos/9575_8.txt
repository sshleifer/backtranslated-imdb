You know, this movie reminded me of so many people I know, I think that's why I loved this movie so much. I was just laughing because this looked so serious and documented, but the dialogue is so fun that you can't help but have fun. Basically, the film is about these crazy dog ​​owners who participate in a large dog show to see who is the best of the best. It seems that dogs should take this competition seriously, but owners are just as crazy. Megan, one of the dog owners, passes almost like a psychological serial killer to the hotel manager because he can't find the special shrill bee toy for his dog. <br /> <br /> There is another couple that is simply fantastic, Gerry and Cookie, this nerd suit and attractive woman who are so lovely. At the beginning of the film, Gerry describes how many boyfriends had Cookies. Throughout the film, her "lovers" see her and hit her even in front of Gerry! It was nice and fun to look at Gerry's appearance. The whole movie is just a hoot, and you can't stop with the recognizable faces that keep popping up. It's a fantastic film, it's simply fun to watch, I highly recommend it! Now, I have to find a nice way to show this to my friends who are like these couples to see the mirror image of themselves. : D <br /> <br /> 8/10
