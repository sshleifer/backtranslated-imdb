I think it certainly is. The writing is of such a quality that beginner students of the English language should model their conversations after his dialogue. For example, the exchange between Paul Kersey (Bronson) and Mrs. Kathryn Davis (Deborah Raffin) (more on this character later) is extremely clear and clear: Mrs Davis says: "I hope you like chicken. What can I do , "to which Kersey cleverly replies," Chicken is good, I like chicken. "If it's not English grammar 101, I don't know what it is. <br /> <br /> Another thing about this Mrs Davis character: Kersey sleeps with her on the second date after she practically throws herself at him and tells her she wants to see him "one last time" (this is only the fourth time they met) before moving to his sister's home in Binghamton, New York to escape the shivers; then in reality he doesn't even beat an eye while his corpse burns on the street only a few minutes later. Kersey never says his name for the duration of the film. Not once. Never a "Get over here, Katy" or "That's a nice dress you wearing, Kathryn" or "Be careful, Katie, or the chills will catch you!" <br /> <br /> And while this 'love' is developing between the two, Fraker (Gavan O'Herlihy) keeps his eyes always alert on them. It's almost as if Kersey was using it as a bait to get to Fraker, as much as using the camera or the car. Sure enough, when Fraker bites, Kersey bites hard ... in the most incredible sequence of events ever seen in the movie! The last fifteen minutes are perhaps rivaled only by the last thirty minutes of the Delta Force in their splendor. And that gives Delta Force a lot of credit. In what other movie you can see Ed Lauter eliminating Alex Winter to get the back of Charles Bronson, a troubled band leader who apparently calls a toll-free number to call neo-Nazi bikers to come to his aid, and agile Broadway dancers they wear knitted nipples pretending to be crazy on the street, all based on a soundtrack written by none other than Jimmy Page. If this is not the highest comedy, then nothing is fun. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there are a thousand ways to affirm the involuntary comedy of Death Wish 3, but the only way to truly understand it is to look at it and judge yourself.
