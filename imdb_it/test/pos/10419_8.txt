I put this film in a queue on a whim after a recent trip to New York, and I couldn't believe I had never heard of it anywhere! It has all the ingredients of a cult classic, starting with the characters. They are archetypal roles that we recognize from every part of everyday life, but they were so blurred and fully realized by the actors who played them (the performances of Peter Stormare and Bai Ling were particularly strong). Their interactions are intense and rooted, but at the same time they are full of a subtle and bizarre humor that is (unfortunately) too rare in American films these days. Writer / director Ramin Niami does a wonderful job of weaving these scenes together in a fun and moving portrait of a city from the past. Highly recommended!
