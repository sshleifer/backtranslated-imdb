I was in the movie right away. I saw Coen's other films, with the exception of Raising Arizona, and I noticed that each of their films has a color. Fargo is gray / white, Lebowski is bright orange, and this film is a pleasant yellow. <br /> <br /> The brilliant pleasing qualities of this film begin immediately. Soon the look is accompanied by great, great music. It's the sound of old people, the kind of music that was written during a time when music was appreciated as part of everyday life. Enjoyed by everyone, gang bands, church choirs and even prison escapees. <br /> <br /> Now, about the prison escapees. I don't know what crime their characters might have committed, since they are a very friendly group of boys. Clooney is fantastic, completely nailed to his role. <br /> <br /> Go see it soon. I think it can be appreciated by anyone at a certain level. For some reason, the theater I was in was full of old and old ladies, and they loved it. <br /> <br /> You will love it too, I promise. I was forced to get my hands on the soundtrack immediately.
