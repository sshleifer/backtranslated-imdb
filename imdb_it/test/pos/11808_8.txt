The teachers of middle and high schools will find "The Cure" an excellent teaching tool, both as a guide for "Huckleberry Finn" and as a stand-alone lesson. Although AIDS should be the main theme, the strong sup-text of friendship and love as they evolve between Eric and Dexter is a powerful message for teenagers. Writing suggestions focused on the symbolism of the tennis shoe are particularly effective. I also suggest a direct class discussion on how Eric evolves from a manipulative user to a loving lover.
