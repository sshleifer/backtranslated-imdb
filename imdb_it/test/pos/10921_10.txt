Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is a teacher who is getting married. Then, one of his former students wins an Oscar for a film in which he plays a gay soldier and thanks Howard in his acceptance speech, calling him gay too! This film follows the consequences as journalists descend on Howard village and try to convince everyone that he is straight. <br /> <br /> I love this movie! Kevin Kline is wonderful, he has some really hilarious moments and he always makes me feel good with a huge smile on my face. Consequently, it is a film that I like to watch as often as possible. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out!
