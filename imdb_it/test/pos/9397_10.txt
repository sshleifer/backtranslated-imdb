It's really quite simple. The name of the film is Death Bed, the bed that eats. If you're like me, you already know if you'll like this movie. I came across this gem at Best Buy the other day and got it for ten dollars. I got ten dollars of enjoyment for the title and the box alone. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of B-series movies. This is in my opinion one of the biggest B movies I've ever seen. Now, it's not for everyone. <br /> <br /> Granted, it is not even for most people. In fact, I suspect theirs will be just some of us who really love this movie. <br /> <br /> For those of you who love B movies, this film is a diamond in the rough. It has a great premise, a bed ... that eats people. Does not walk, does not move, does not have a siren call to attract people. Basically it is based on people who wander and sit on it. <br /> <br /> I loved every inch of this movie and I've seen it three times in the few weeks I've owned it. <br /> <br /> As I said, after reading the title of the film, you already know if you will like it. If you laugh or smile, then try it. it's worth it.
