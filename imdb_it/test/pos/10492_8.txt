Of the approximately 600 Spaghetti Westerns, this had to be among the top twenty somewhere. I can't believe this didn't receive any reviews! Gemma is excellent at this. Even Van Johnson is good even though his dubbed voice is a little crazy, but this is the charm of Italian style. Beautiful photographs and some well-organized actions. All supporting characters are well played. The severity of the racist series in the villains is rather harsh even by today's standards that create an emotional depth for the Gemmas character in some of the situations that occur. Absolutely FANTASTIC score by Luis Bacalov. See this is in the wonderful wide screen DVD from Japan. A spaghetti must have.
