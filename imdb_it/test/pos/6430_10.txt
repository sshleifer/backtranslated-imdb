this haunting piece of work. it's only about ten minutes long, but before going to see I'd like to pay ten dollars for the movie rather than seeing the complete movie that the film is making. it is a simple piece of reflection of a man. A young man arrived in this place and was enchanted by a room and the music came from it ... and now here he is sitting, dying in old age in this place that connects so affectionately to his youth. the music is brilliant, the guitars have that jazzy sound like the music of Neil Young in dead man. if you get the chance, watch this movie. It's worth it. If Rutger Hauer has made more films like this, I think he would get more respect than he gets. The moment you hear him put phrases like "everyone's favorite psychopath". of course that is not what the rutger would like to be remembered as an actor. He also directed this film, so in this show he is a very artistic actor / director. A change from the b-grade films he has made since the early years. I hope to see more of this rutger hauer as he is one of my favorite actors.
