It's been a long time since such an original, rather amusing black comedy was born. If "Eating Raoul" is on your top 100 list, do yourself a favor and find "Undertaking Betty" immediately. The subject of death was fun before (see Paul Bartel and Mary Woronov in "Mortuary Academy"). While that film has some brilliant moments in the black comedy, "Undertaking Betty" is much more consistent, with a better cast. Who could imagine that the business of the company could be fertile ground for an original, uplifting and heartfelt comedy? I was surprised and you will be too. I highly recommend seeing "Undertaking Betty" - MERK
