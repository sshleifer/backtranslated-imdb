The funniest performance was by Shalom Harlow, the top model girl from Matt Dillon. It was more interesting to me than all the main actors. This film has it all wrong; even the most reliable actress of the century, Joan Cusask, was not able to stand up for the ridiculousness of the plot. I enjoyed listening to "Macho Man" from the Village People in the credits. The rest of the film could have been tolerable if it were to reach that level of energy.
