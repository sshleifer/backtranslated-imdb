The Priest, in profound love and suffering, did not show the result of love, but the process of love and salvation has an elevated beauty of the human (or vampire?). http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/confuoco/diary/200911290000/ <br /> <br /> And the love of Femme fatale is not known, but it is adorable in taking responsible death as a vampire. He did not continue to fall into the lost paradise, but decided to leave the man alone. Delicate fatal female, but adorable! This film made me think of the suffering between human and vampire, which goes far beyond the priest and salvation. I also thought of love. Adam was not so responsible for Eve but this Adam (priest), sacrificial and responsible for choosing Eve from the paradise of dreams, the world of vampires. Another symphonic poem of Adam and Eve, Paradise Lost.
