The distinguished Czech actor Vlastimil Brodský, best known in North America for his starring role in Jacob's original Franco-Czech production of Jacob the Liar (Jakob, der Lügner 1974) gives us one last brilliant performance as an eighty-year-old prankster who refuses admit he is going to die. <br /> <br /> The screenplay by Jirí Hubac is exquisite. Fun, moving and well developed. It explores both the theme of advanced old age and the motivations of characters who are precariously strong and fragile, happy and uncertain. <br /> <br /> Frantisek (Vlastimil Brodský) and his best friend Eda (Stanislav Zindulka) are up to all kinds of cheaters and are making sure to make the most of their death days. Meanwhile, Frantisek's wife is preparing for their death, saving money for funerals and punishing Frantisek for his endless childhood and irresponsible attitude. Their son is about to take their apartment and put them in a nursing home, but Frantisek does not want to hear about it. He wants to enjoy life and make people around him laugh. Want to help, love and give ... but at what price? <br /> <br /> Sure to fascinate adults of all ages, this beautiful film by the talented director Vladimír Michálek is both moving and fun. It makes you think about how we live our lives and why we live our lives. It brings up the simple story of a fascinating stubborn old man and allows us to reflect and feel what life is. <br /> <br /> After an active career spanning over 40 years, it is a bit grim to know that Vlastimil Brodsk died in April 2002, no longer suffering from terminal cancer. It is however edifying to think of having the possibility of being part of such a moving script and being the catalyst for this ode for a joyful old age that has not even begun to make the waves it is about to create in the North American cinema repertoire. <br /> <br /> After the international success of "Divided We Fall (2000)" by Jan Hrebejk, it begins to be clear that Czech cinema really has something to offer the world. At least this film is a must see.
