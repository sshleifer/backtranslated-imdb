Sonny Chiba, as everyone knows, is the man. In this film, he plays Mas Oyama (1923-1994), a true martial artist who has fought over 50 bulls with bare hands and won (an interesting guy looks up). However, Chiba only kills one bull in the film, but it's a memorable scene and as the liner notes say, right there with the zombie scene against the shark in Zombies! The film also offers a lot of melee combat and a decent storyline to start, although I don't think everything is true. This film is the first of Chiba's Oyama trilogy and is recommended for martial arts enthusiasts. Finally, three small nibbles ordered; part of the opening theme was used in Kill Bill Volume 1, Oyama himself appears in the opening sequences, which is why he trained Chiba in real life for five years!
