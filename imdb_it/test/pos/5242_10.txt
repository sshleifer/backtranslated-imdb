I really have nothing to add to all the other comments, except this: for me the film looked like a silent film that slowly adapted to the sound. The text tables that brought the story strengthened that impression, I suppose. Along the way the actors were allowed to leave the acting in theatrical style; Marguerite Churchill looks a lot like a typical silent movie heroine at the beginning of the film, but a finer expression is allowed in the end. Gus, the Swede?, Reminded me of the comic characters from Shakespeare's comedies, and Windy looked like an old Donald Duck. <br /> <br /> It really surprised me that it was shot outdoors, on the spot, and even though the dust of all the carts, horses and cattle obscured the view, it actually had to be like that the real settlers! It was also clear to me that many of those Indians had to be real, and I didn't find any clear racism against them. And John Wayne looks so incredibly young! As someone who became a true Wayne fan through John Ford's cavalry trilogy, and thought Stage Coach was Wayne's first star as the protagonist, this film was a revelation. The plot is very simple, it still reminds me of a silent film, but the grit is really very real! An incredible film made with this technique and in those conditions in 1930.
