Thanks to the availability of a colleague, a member of IMDb, I have just managed to see this film for the second time in almost twenty years, and I can honestly say that it has lost none of its football. I can't believe that Channel 4 has let this vanish without a trace, as it is an extremely powerful, moving and moralistic grip on the consequences of misplaced loyalty. <br /> <br /> Focuses on a clique of friends over the course of ten years and on their relationship with two "strangers" from school; in particular how they use one and mercilessly torment the other. As the events of the past and present take place, the tension gradually thickens, not unlike Shane Meadows' excellent revenge cooler, Dead Man's Shoes. Acting, writing and directing are very audacious for 1983 and even today they come across a wallop despite the accents of the upper crust of the central characters. Yes, it could be set in public schools, but it's worlds different from anything issued by the Merchant Ivory; I have a state education and I can still draw several parables from history. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you will long remember if you see it, except you probably won't, because Channel 4 (or FilmFour) has chosen to bury it. On their official website they describe it as "a gem inexplicably neglected by the early days of Channel 4" - overlooked by whom? This was one of the first Channel 4 movies (which would later become FilmFour thanks to the success of films like Trainspotting), so somewhere someone still has to have the main press. In these days where you can get DVDs with an extended collector number pretty much anything is a little moody that they can't give such a good movie the promotion it deserves. <br /> <br /> So, if one of the Channel 4 production fans is reading this, stop making programs that show people humbling themselves in hopes of getting a scandal deal, chasing this movie and solving a beautiful anniversary special edition disc or something, please!
