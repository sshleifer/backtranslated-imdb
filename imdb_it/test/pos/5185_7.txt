Excellent special effects make this catastrophe very plausible. You can see that the producers got in trouble to get the displays on the computer screens correctly - which makes it very convincing. The sets are also very authentic. A good choice of music completes the film well. <br /> <br /> Acting is beautiful and the presence of David Suchet adds some weight to the cast, of course. Compared to other films of this genre, Flood is right there with the best of them. Fortunately, the "human drama" aspect was not exaggerated, as often happens with this type of film. Human suffering is portrayed in perfect balance with the flood scenes. <br /> <br /> And of course, the film confirms what many of us suspect anyway: meteorologists often don't do it well! :)
