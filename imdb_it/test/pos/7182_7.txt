Cleopatra (the delicious Monica Bellucci) is challenged by Cesar (Alain Chabat): to prove that the Egyptians are better than the Romans, he promises to build a luxury castle for Cesar in a period of three months, without delay. He calls the architect on a numerobis arm (Jamel Debbuzi) and offers him two options: to be covered in gold if he fulfills his mission, or to become a crocodile if he fails. Numerobis will ask for help from Panoramix (Claude Rich), Asterix (Christian Clavier) and Obelix (Geraard Depardieu) (with Ideiafix). This film is a lot of fun, especially the parts where Obelix and the Pirates led by Red Beard participate. However, the writer and director should have noticed that French is not a universal language as English is. Therefore, jokes with words (as in the Austin Powers films, for example) do not work well for strange people in the French language. The French and the people who speak the French language fluently will certainly appreciate these jokes, but for me they make no sense, they don't speak French. My vote is seven.
