This television adaptation of the Sarah Waters novel was made with so much love that I can hardly find the words to appreciate it. Not since "Tipping the Velvet" (also highly recommended) I have seen a similar performance by leading actresses, this time by Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy. They acted with their souls, and this is what attracts the public! Even the secondary actors were well chosen, they made a great ensemble. <br /> <br /> For those who think history is just a lesbian relationship - no, this is only a part. The other main theme is the betrayal of the person you love. And the plot has further surprising twists. So the film should be interesting for straight people or guys like me.
