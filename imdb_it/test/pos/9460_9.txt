I took this film right in my eyes when I was passing through a poster room in the nearby cinema. The line of demarcation was a bit confusing and immediately after reading it, I thought about the possibility that it was similar to National Lampoon's Dorm Daze. I liked that movie, besides having a huge collection of similar genres, I decided to go to the movies right after my exams for a tension releaser. <br /> <br /> Delightfully, I came out smiling from one cheek to a cheek and had a huge amount of bitter laughter and points in the movie. Amanda Bynes certainly kicked off better than Keira Knightley in Bend it Like Beckham. Being both a male actor and a female actor is certainly not so easy especially having to face the similarities of life, combined with the reactions to which the actress has to respond. This film requires a lot of confusion to confuse ourselves and us viewers at the same time. The only way to get it out is through this movie. <br /> <br /> The principal is obviously seriously hilariously serious, the girls are equally sexy and beautiful and so are the actors. I would recommend this film to all those who need a weekend of relaxation and don't worry, you will get laughter throughout the film. It is a certain guarantee
