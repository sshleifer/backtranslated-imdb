Watch this movie only to see Shahrukh Khan say "I love you, K-k-Kiran ..." It is both heartbreaking and scary when it says this, from beginning to end. This film made him famous, and I highly recommend him: D It's very funny, the music is evil and you laugh together with Shahrukh here ... You'll feel really scared about the hero and the heroine and strangely you would identify yourself with at least one of the characters. You will feel sad and happy, relieved and frightened at the same time. Go see this classic Bollywood movie with your good friends and delicious food and enjoy a day. And after watching the movie, make sure the songs and scenery play in your mind ... forever.
