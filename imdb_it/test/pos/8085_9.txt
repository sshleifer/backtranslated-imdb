Yes, I'm sentimental, and yes, I love movies where children are the best men. True, Klatret√∏sen has some logical or even plot defect. These are more than compensated by the great acting of the boys (the role of Julias' first film!) And the charm of a Dogma film (I liked this kind of film art long before Dogma, from Herz aus Glas of Herzog) Well, I cried in the last fifteen minutes which is a higher tear factor than what Bambi or Fly had for me.
