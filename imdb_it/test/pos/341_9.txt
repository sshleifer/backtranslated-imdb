In Sri Lanka, a country divided by religion and language, the civil war between the pro-Sinhalese government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist organization, has killed some 68,000 people since 1983. Groups for human rights they said that, following the war, over a million people have been displaced, homeless or living in the camps. The impact on children and families caught in the conflict is dramatized by the famous director Tamil Mani Ratnam in his 2002 film A Peck on the Cheek, winner of numerous awards at the National Film Awards in India. While the civil war is only the background to the story of a young girl's journey of discovery, the cost of human warfare is made quite clear and Ratnam gives the fighting a universal context, pointing the finger at global arms traffickers as a source of offenses. <br /> <br /> Beautifully photographed in Southern India by director of photography Ravi K Chandran in a setting that reflects the Sri Lankan terrain, the film tells a moving story of a adopted 9-year-old girl who aims to find his real mother in the middle of the fighting in Sri Lanka. Played with profound feeling and expressiveness of P.S. Keerthana in a memorable performance, Amudha grew up from a loving middle class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents Shyama (Nandita Das) and Dileepan (JD Chakravarthi) were forced to flee when the fighting broke out, leaving her in a Red Cross Field In a loving flashback, we see Amudha's adoptive parents, Father Thiru (Madhavan), a prominent Tamil writer, and mother Indra (Simran) a TV personality, married to facilitate the adoption of the most skinned child dark. <br /> <br /> The young Amudha has no idea that she was adopted until she suddenly arose on her ninth birthday, according to the parental consent. While playing, Thiru tells her almost in a tone of fact that "you're not our daughter" and the answer is predictable. Distraught, she wonders who her father was, what her mother's name was, why she abandoned her, and so on, but few answers are forthcoming. Amudha escapes several times until her parents agree to go to Sri Lanka to help her find her real mother, now a fighter for Tamil separatists. The immersion of the family in the reality of civil war leads to traumatic moments and difficult decisions, mostly managed with skill by Ratnam, even if a sequence in which the family was caught in a crossfire felt amateur. <br /> <br /> Peck on the Cheek is obviously a Bollywood-style film, which means tons of music and melodrama. The melodrama did not interfere due to the strong performances of the main actors; however, I found the musical dramatizations of A. R. Rahman's songs against the mood of the film with their mushy and high-production techniques and the fast-paced music video-style editing. Yet the irresistible nature of the plot and the honesty in which it is told transcend the limits of the film. Tamil cinema has been criticized by many, even within the country as too trivial and commercial, yet A Peck on the Cheek is both an entertainment film and one that deals with serious issues. That he managed to ride the line between art and commerce is not a waste, but a tribute.
