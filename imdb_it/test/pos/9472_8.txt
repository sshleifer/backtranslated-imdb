I saw this film today (it was inaugurated here yesterday) and was simply delighted. <br /> <br /> I saw a review that said something in the sense that the reviewer thought it would be just another teen movie, but then he discovered it was based on Shakespeare's twelfth night ... and then he started to try to justify the liking of this film on Shakespearean motifs. I really think he's going overboard: the only connections I could see with Twelfth Night are (a) the basic idea of ​​a girl disguised as a man; (b) the broad masculine-feminine humor resulting from this basic presumption; and (c) some of the names (including Viola and Duke). <br /> <br /> In addition to these names, the common themes (a & b) are really big themes for any script, and the script for this film is no exception. Beyond that, though, this is really a simply delicious and very contemporary / traditional action movie. And this is a perfectly legitimate genre even if the intellectuals have to find an excuse to like him ... like alluding to Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The film is brilliant, frantic, emotional, stylized, fun ... full of teenage hormones and youthful humor and male / female humor suitable for all ages. And this is really the best part of IMHO: in reality every male stereotype and every female stereotype is represented in an exaggeratedly captivating fun. These stereotypes are relentlessly but affectionately parodied, with such a complexity of invention that I am still a bit disoriented ... but in reality I don't feel disappointed about it at all, it's not that kind of film: things come at you fast and funny and you get a laugh and a groan and then move on to the next two-second event. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is really delicious as Viola / Sebastian; Channing Tatum makes a wonderful duke; David Cross has a magnificent Gold. All the acting and characterizations were good and focused. The cinematography was excellent. <br /> <br /> Wonderful shows from start to finish ... take a look!
