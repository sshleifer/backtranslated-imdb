"Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters" is a visually stunning production that handles complex problems with evocative ease. It is based on the life of the controversial Japanese author Yukio Mishima, who committed suicide in the 1970s. It is not really a biographical film - at least not one in the traditional sense - but an exploration of Mishima's iconoclastic work. The film manages to present abstract concepts in a non-acclaimed and totally engaging way. Paul Schrader makes you a part of Mishima without having to deconstruct him or his work. It doesn't solve the puzzle enough but it makes you understand. A further advantage: while we see Mishima's anger over the lack of tradition in a morally absent modern society, Schrader offers us an excellent demonstration of the dichotomy between thought and execution in cinema. John Bailey's cinematography is extraordinarily good. The grandeur of the work of the composer Philip Glass is perfectly suited to the project. "Mishima" is the best film I've seen this year so far.
