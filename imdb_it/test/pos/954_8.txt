Ghillie a remake of the Telugu "okkadu" is fortunately a clarified version of the original, which contains the same punch and Dharani faithful to its cinematic brilliance offers it with style and brio. A flamboyant Vijay career with the entry of Surya and Vikram into the fight, he got the much needed lift with this film, which could prove to be Vijay's best film, considering the choices he has made since then. The hard-working actor seems to have lost his way with the talented new talents that are accepted by both industry and the public. <br /> <br /> The rigorously compact script, flowing at, a neck-breaking speed revolves around Velu, a stubborn young man who aspires to make a mark in the game of Kabaddi (a game popular among boys in India ) The events that follow the chance encounter with Muthupandi, his rescue of the girl in difficulty and the way he juggles with the aspirations of his friends and his forms, the fulcrum and the end of the film. Vijay adapts as a "T" in the role and wise a submissive and credible representation of the boy next door. <br /> <br /> Trisha has more than one stereotypical Tamil heroine mantle to play. The role is much more complex than a girl in trouble. With limited dialogues, Trisha uses her occasional mutual expressions and subtle vulnerability to add color to the role. This is a classic case of a cover girl who becomes a professional actress. Trisha became my favorite after this movie. <br /> <br /> The film ends with predictable lines, although the director must be given credit for having induced the public to guess about many things, including the change in Trisha's decision to leave the country. Prakash Raj deserves a word of praise for providing the perfect counterweight to the role of Vijay. His almost indomitable stature in the role of a villain and the apparent fissures in the hero's armor form a perfect maneuver to keep the audience guessing. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a fantastic film that deserves at least a single vision. I give him a clear 8 out of 10.
