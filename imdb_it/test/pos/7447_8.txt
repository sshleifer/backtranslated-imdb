I just looked at it then. It's damn fantastic. The fights are fantastic and the magic is really fantastic! It is totally similar to a video game in parts, with some incredible melee fights. <br /> <br /> This film is for fans: "For those who loved this world once and spent time with their friends, they come together again and devote your time ..." Beyond at this threatening opening, the plot was not very difficult to follow, and I never played a Final Fantasy game. I think it is useful to be familiar with role-playing games in general; knowledge of the genre helps you better understand some of them. But I think that if you pay attention and accept what the film throws at you, it's pretty easy to understand. There are many things that are not explicitly explained, and if you ask what it should be then you will probably be confused and irritated. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie is like being dropped in the middle of some big saga and having to put as many puzzles as possible as possible. I like this approach; stay involved in the mystery and confusion that all the characters are going through. But as I said, accept only. If a strange red lion thing that speaks, gets up and starts to kick ass and take names, and the other characters say it's an old friend, accept it and go ahead; you don't need a biopic flashback or a sit-me-down. You are an observer here, of something that goes beyond your experience and undisputed. <br /> <br /> So: fantastic graphics and animation, great dubbing, videogame-style music, involving story and characters, and maybe some of the most fantastic fights you'll see in a while. It's worth seeing, and while it's for fans, it's perfectly accessible for people like me who have never played games.
