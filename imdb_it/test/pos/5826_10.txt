This show has everything you could want from a prison drama. There are twists and turns until the end of the season. The characters are very strong and give the show a lot of power. When you watch the show you try not only the prisoners, but also the prison staff. The actors playing the prisoners in this show did a great job of portraying a prisoner. Also, if you like law and order or the law and order of criminal intent there are many actors of this show that appear in those shows. The only problem with Oz is that it wasn't long enough. This show could easily have nine to ten seasons without aging. Even after the season finale I find myself watching Oz all the time on DVD. This show is easily one of the best shows on television. Don't be silly, go watch Oz.
