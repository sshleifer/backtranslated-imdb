The genuinely bizarre tale of Honore De Balzac on which this was freely inspired is a disturbing, though incredibly filmed, treatment here as a kind of love-love forbidden in a period of time between man and beast in the first part of the nineteenth century. The blond and thin British actor Ben Daniels plays the role of a young soldier during the Napoleonic wars that gets lost while escorting an exile (?) French painter through the harsh and dangerous landscapes of the Gobi desert. After literally turning round, the two men always give up trying to reach civilization again, so everyone decides (against a better judgment) to follow their separate paths with the promise of returning to the exact same point when and if a source water is actually found This is obviously the way Daniels' character meets the creature (a wild and untamed female leopard) and eventually forms an apparently indestructible bond, or rather love, with which they both save his life and they almost destroy it at the end of the film. The exquisite cinematography, the minimalist dialogue, a somewhat demented story, which unquestionably suggests a possible bestiality in about three scenes, are what eventually led professional critics to film the film as pretentious and too long garbage. Although it is a film that is not exactly for all tastes, I think it is a mix of subtle fantasy, but definitely on the left center, with a surreal and sumptuous atmosphere, underlined by the fact that for more than half of the film, the actor Ben Daniels is forced to perform in front of a wild animal (four leopards were actually used as opposed to the right one), whose simple common sense and a slight knowledge of theatricality dictate that it must have been an exasperating and very difficult job he managed to pull off quite brilliantly if you ask me! Overall, I think "Passion in the Desert" takes a while to warm up, but if you're a patient person who is willing to give it some time, in fact, cast its uniquely original spell on you, despite everything ; and unlike most platonic stories of human and animal relationships, a talking pig, a monkey or a tousled dog is not necessary to keep your interest alive.
