This is the kind of movie we used weekly. Nowadays it is rare to see a drama that depends on the cast that speaks to each other. <br /> <br /> There are no explosions, car chases or pursuits, there are implicit sexual situations. This is not a film for the younger audience, it's for those who appreciate people who talk to each other, they talk a lot because we have a married couple with middle-aged problems. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson are apparently very happy loving middle-aged man and wife. Now that he lives in this same small London suburb, beautiful, Rupert Everett returns home to visit his rich father. <br /> <br /> Of course he meets Emily Watson, it would be easy for anyone to be struck by Emily. I say no more, apart from the fact that at the beginning of the credits there is a fatal accident, the rest of the film talks about the repercussions of this incident and all the lies that the various characters tell .. <br /> <br / > The acting of this trio and the others are excellent. <br /> <br /> Julien Fellows wrote the screenplay based on a novel by Nigel Balchin. He also directed, this was his first attempt as a director and he did it very well. The entire production is top quality. <br /> <br /> The film had a month of theater performances at the end of 2005, it is under 80 cinemas. This is a pity for me, stupid comedies open on at least 2000 screens but real dramas like this and many others open only to a few. <br /> <br /> Among other things there are some very funny lines about certain situations. <br /> <br /> Classifications: *** 1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)
