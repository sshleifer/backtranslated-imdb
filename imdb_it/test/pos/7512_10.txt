This is one of the greatest films ever made. Brilliant acting by George C. Scott and Diane Riggs. This film is both disturbing and extremely profound. Don't be fooled by believing that this is just a comedy. It is a brilliant satire on the medical profession. It is not a beautiful image. Healthy patients are killed by incompetent surgeons, who spend all their time making money outside the hospital. Still, you really believe this is a hospital. The producers have been very careful to include real medical terminology and real medical cases. This movie really reveals how difficult it is to run a hospital, and how bad it was already in 1971. I love this movie. Post scriptum - I noticed that the incompetent, wheeled street dealer carried out the command of the company in Los Angeles. The young doctor played to Lou Grant. I also noticed that the registration nurse has since appeared in Becker and other shows.
