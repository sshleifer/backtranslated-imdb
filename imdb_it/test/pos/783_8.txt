A British turn on Harold and Maude, Driving Lessons includes an out of the ordinary Rupert Grint and Julie Walters. Although it is true that Grint has the face of stone like a red-haired Benjamin Braddock for the first half of the film, it does not discourage the bizarre family film - there are things that go beyond the experience of his character that would create a shocked reaction . The chemistry between Walters and Grint brings the film, though Laura Linney's hard work of making her human written stereotype is also remarkable. These performances combined with a fun soundtrack of poppies with artists like Sufjan Stevens, John Renbourn and Salsa Celtica make this children's popcorn movie worth a Saturday afternoon.
