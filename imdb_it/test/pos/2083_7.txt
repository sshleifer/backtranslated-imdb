Between the ages of 30 and 51, when he died of a brain tumor, Zachary Scott made 70 films. It was introduced in 1944 in "The Mask of Dimitrios" by Jean Negulesco, where he played Dimitrios. The following year, in 1945, he made three films, of which this is one. He is remembered by Cineastes as the protagonist of "The Southerner" by Jean Renoir, one of the films of 1945, in which he played a sympathetic role. However, he has often portrayed gruesome characters, and in this film he is a sociopathic killer of women for money. So what happens here? He lives in a house with three women, so watch out! Faye Emerson, who also appeared in "Dimitrios", plays the eldest of the two daughters at home. He falls in love with Scott and becomes secretly engaged. Then the "cute" younger sister (effectively played by Mona Freeman, who looks like Bonita Granville both in appearance and behavior) returns from the boarding school and casually reveals in a conversation with Scott who inherited an orderly sum, so Scott he turns on her instead, with all the icy jealousies that boiled in the house that was destined to arouse. Things get tense and then stiffen. Meanwhile, the plans for the murder are going on in the mind of Scott's calculation. But it turns out that he is not the only one with such intentions. He is also searched for his last kill, with which the film was opened, so that we know his story. James Wong Howe gives this story an actual noir cinematography, directed by the Frenchman Robert Florey who had moved to Hollywood some time before. The film is an effective psychopathic mystery in the home that can cause some wear on the edges of some seats, for those of that inclination.
