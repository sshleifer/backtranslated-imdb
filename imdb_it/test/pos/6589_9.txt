I was very lucky to see this film as part of the 2005 Melbourne International Film Festival just a few days ago. I have to admit that I am very partial in films that focus on human relationships and especially on those that focus on the tragic side of life. I also love most of the Scandinavian film offerings, there is often a particular quality in the way the story unfolds and the characters are drawn. The construction of the character in this film is extraordinary in its details and in its depth. This is despite the fact that we meet a number of characters all with personal situations and very special places within their community. The audience at the end of the screening was very silent and thoughtful. I'm still playing some of those scenes in my mind and I'm still amazed by their power and meaning.
