The incredibly sexy Rosie Holotik plays Charlotte Beale, a new nurse in one of those film-like mental hospitals where the current doctor has his unorthodox ways of treating detainees. The skilled Dr. Masters (Anne MacAdams, a.k.a Annabelle Weenick) takes her aboard. Inmates also do not take Charlotte too well. <br /> <br /> Part mystery, partial horror, this initial effort by director B-movie S.F. Brownrigg has an overwhelming atmosphere. These colorful psychoses, including a nymphomaniac without self-esteem, a gentle giant who has already had a lobotomy and a supposed "judge" who speaks in legal jargon, dominate the screen with their unnerving presence. <br /> <br /> It is an image that works quite well, establishing the gritty and gloomy atmosphere from the start. Some brief explosions of graphic violence also contribute to giving him that old-fashioned exploitative good quality. <br /> <br /> It intensifies as the heroin in danger struggles to maintain her sanity, offering one surreal encounter after another. Particularly effective is the old Mrs. Callingham poem, quoting poems. <br /> <br /> For the cheap cheese of the 70s, it is quite effective, with a particularly unpleasant climax. I really enjoyed watching it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
