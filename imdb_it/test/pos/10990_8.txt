Being from the Buffalo area, I was well aware that the film had read many articles in local publications. I was very impressed by the film, especially the clever storyline, acting and local scenes. It's nice to see so many older quality stars in the various roles. I feel that especially those of us over 50 will find the film excellent and you can leave the theater feeling that your time has been well spent.
