The film presents another exceptional collaboration between director William Wyler and cinematographer Gregg Toland, the first after Toland worked on Citizen Kane. But the talent of both these men was focused on achieving a perfectly realized film, understood in the good old American sense as a great story. The technical aspects of the film are treated in such a way that the viewer is absorbed by the action that takes place on the screen without submitting to the power of the image. The technique is seen as a vehicle of representation unlike Citizen Kane, where Welles' baroque style has almost attracted attention from history to the way the story was told. One of my favorite moves with deep focus in this film is the drama transmitted from Homer's and Al's homecoming. If Homer's girlfriend, Wilma comes close to him, Al goes to his wife in sharp focus. This is a brilliant move because it shows only through the use of the image the nature of these relationships as we will see them throughout the film: Wilma loves Homer and she accepts it as it is, Al's wife loves it too but she feels unprepared to completely welcome home. Moreover, later in the film we discover that their marriage has not always been a bed of roses. <br /> <br /> Wyler is a director whose strength lies in being faithful to his work without feeling the need to brag. He wanted to show his audience how difficult it was for American soldiers returning from war to adapt to a society that didn't understand them or treated them with contempt. With a perfect cast and an excellent dialogue, Goldwin and Wyler have produced a film that will forever be the model for any other homecoming film. The three hours that coincide with the "rough cut" because the test public has never tried for a moment that the action was slow and indeed every scene in the film seems perfectly justified. Everything is beautifully constructed, each character gets a fair amount of exposure, nothing is left to chance and it is rather painful that Hollywood never manages to bring so much conflict of characters to the screen. TBYOOL explores the depth of the American lifestyle, family and American society to such an extent that it makes other films look like "children's hours".
