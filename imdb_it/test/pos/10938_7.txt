I liked this movie, okay, it could have been a lot better. I expected more action than I got ... which was more of a comedy than anything else. Sure, it was serious in some parts and he had a good fighting scene here and there for the most part it was more romance and comedy with a little action and no horror. Which is hard to do with a vampire movie. A vampire hunter loses his mate and has to train another, his sister is experiencing a difficult break, but is haunted by a vampire of all things. Of course, this vampire is pretty cute and doesn't suck. So this is all there really is except for a plot of another vampire after certain real vampires so that you can get the maximum power. Some of the problems with this film are that the plot has gone here and there and the film has had a very erratic flow, and seems to have shifted the genres a little too much. A one-minute action, the next pure comedy. However, the girls were nice, there is a good deed, the comedy was worthy of a giggle or two and Jackie Chan makes it look pretty energetic or two. Probably this film needed only more development in some areas such as the villain, which in practice is not at all explored. So for a movie with some good fights and a laugh or two it's pretty good ... but why was it ranked R? I've seen things we've done that is PG-13 which is much worse than that.
