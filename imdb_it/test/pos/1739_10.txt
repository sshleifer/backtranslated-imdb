I remember being so excited Saturday night as a child, waiting for Dr. Who. I thought it was the best show ever made. Then, I grew up, Dr. Who came out of the air, and no one I knew had ever heard of it. Then I discovered that there would be a new series. I was a little nervous about it. Was he about to live up to the expectations I had brought around since I was a child? Would they ruin it? Would the doctor suck? Would his assistant suck? Would they have created a more intimate relationship with Dr. and his assistant? YES, NO, NO, NO, NO !!! This show is wonderful !! I love the new Dr. I love his assistant. I love the show. And I'm excited Friday night now, waiting for the "new" episode. I'm just seeing the 2005 episodes, since I live in the United States, so I'm a little behind all of you. I hope the next Dr. is as big as this!
