* Minor spoiler * <br /> <br /> Inhabited is not scary, but it is disturbing. It's an interesting "small" story with good acting and a great trick for special effects. <br /> <br /> Basic story: a little girl blames the strange things that happen in her family's new home and in her fairy friends' cottage. <br /> <br /> The film does not waste time moving, even if the ending could have been more challenging. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this film to those who expect / want a hardcore horror, but I recommend it to anyone who wants a cooler and not necessarily a thriller.
