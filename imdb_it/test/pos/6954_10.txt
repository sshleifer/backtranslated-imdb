I'm not sure how the "weighted average" of IMDb has produced such a low rating on this film. In my opinion and for all the other stories, a neglected gem of a film. Rip Torn is as fantastic as the tenacious Lord Noel, and Cardinal Tantoo is as superb as his roommate. Torn and Cardinal are both undervalued actors who are finally given a stage to work on. <br /> <br /> Their relationship is not always pleasant, but it is very real. This is NOT the "moving and moving love story", as advertised on the DVD cover. In the end it is a tragedy. Lord simply points too high and ignores all the advice to take the money offered by the power company to move. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic, as are the sets of the period.
