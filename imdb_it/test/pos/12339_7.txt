A group of sisterhood girls make a new commitment to spend the night in a creepy mausoleum. Obviously the deceased is not long dead and all hell is unleashed. "One Dark Night" is a pleasant 80s horror with some hideous dead bodies floating around being controlled by the spirit of a psychic dead Raymar. no gore and nudity, but the atmosphere of a mausoleum is very lugubrious. The acting is solid, but the script takes too long to develop the characters until the last 20 minutes that Raymar finally bursts from his grave. Cinematography is impressive and the mausoleum is an ideal place for climatic events. The film takes so long to move forward and this is its main flaw.7 out of 10.
