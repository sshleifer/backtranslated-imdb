This is the first film I ever owned on video, and 14 years later, I still have the same copy. Elizabeth Taylor was as radiant as twelve years later in life, Mickey Rooney gave Mi Taylor a true dimension, and Donald Crisp was solid as ever. The surprising Anne Revere, like Mrs. Brown, seemed to be the wisest woman in the world. After almost 60 years, the warmth, humor and excitement of this film still influence the viewer; we still laugh at the jokes, the root of The Pie and we love Velvet for the spirit and the ability to love that she shows. I love it as an adult just as I loved it as a child. A must for every family video collection.
