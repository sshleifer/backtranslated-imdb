"One True Thing" is a very quiet film, which was inaugurated in the fall of 1998 with exciting reviews but a noble box office. It tells the paralyzed story of Ellen (Renee Zellweger), a workaholic who is forced to move home to take care of her terminally ill mother (Meryl Streep), so that the detached father (William Hurt) can direct his academic department . These terms are only general. The strength of "One True Thing" lies in the way the actors elevate their characters above the clich√© territory of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Streep is Kate, the perfect housewife whose ability to light up a room with her charm is evident in her opening scenes at a costume party to celebrate Hurt's birthday. But Ellen has never been close to her mother, and since she graduated from Harvard University, she has a certain destain about her ... Ellen almost thinks her mother is a simplistic head of air. While on the other hand, he admires his father, who shares a special passion: writing. Ellen writes for an aggressive New York company, and is almost heartbroken when her last piece is shot down by Hurt, who appears to be a very lonely figure. <br /> <br /> To get to the point, while Kate gets sick Ellen's prospects change and she gets closer to her mother and further away from her father. Hurt continues to apologize for not being there when the family needs him most, and Ellen thinks she has a relationship. Meanwhile he left his desk at work to spend time doing craft activities with his mother's "cult" band, The Minnies, and also knowing that his mother is not as weak as he once thought. <br /> <br /> Without giving too far, "One True Thing" is a masterpiece in character study. Streep once again turns into a beautiful performance, this time working at a subtle level that begins slowly but ends with a brilliant speech about marriage vows. Streep got his eleventh Oscar nomination for this performance. Hurt is also as convincing as his father who brings a secret that is not revealed until the last moments. But it is Renee Zellweger who steals this film. Forget "Chicago", "Cold Mountain", "Bridget Jones's Diary" or anything else I've seen you do and rent this movie. She is remarkable in this. Working in the bitter resentment of his character for his parents' understanding, Zellweger runs a realistic representation of a young woman struggling to keep her lips high as she screams inside.
