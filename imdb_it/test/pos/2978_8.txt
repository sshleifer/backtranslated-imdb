This film grabbed me from the beginning, where a sweet teenage girl is shown visiting a tomb by herself, then Elton John's powerful song "Friends" starts playing as she is shown walking the streets of Paris alone , carrying a suitcase, naively unaware of the theft of cars and prostitution going on around her. The whole film is a beautiful, dreamy, romantic collection of scenes of young love, holding hands, living in the countryside, wild horses running freely, fields of wild flowers, sunsets, wine toasts, fire evenings, having fun, and general innocence, all set for Elton John's romantic music. It's magic. <br /> <br /> Somehow I missed seeing this movie when I was a kid. I'm sure he would have left a strong impression on me if I had seen him then. I remember the radio advertisement for the film in 1971, talking about how it was a special film with the music of Elton John, and with the chorus of the acronym "Friends" that played in the announcement ("Friends of Makin for the world to see .. . "), but I've never heard of it in those days, and I never could see it until I rented it 35 years later from a video store. At that point it was modified, censored and all kinds of unhappy people with angry political programs used all kinds of bad words to describe the film. What can I say? The world has become crazy since then. <br /> <br /> The story is that a 14-year-old girl is forced to move from her cousin to Paris after the death of both her parents. (It was their grave that he was visiting in the opening scene). One day, while visiting the zoo alone, he meets a 15-year-old boy, they fight and agree to meet the next day. The next day as he rides together, the boy accidentally drives his car into a lake in a bizarre solo accident. He was his father's car, he can't bear to go home to face his father's wrath, so the two teenagers start living in the French countryside together, with the mutual background that they both hated at home. They settle into an unoccupied cottage, the boy takes strange jobs to support himself, their supposed friendship turns into romance, the girl gets pregnant, and successfully have a baby at home. All the while the boy's father has the police trying to locate his missing son. On the first anniversary of the couple's escape together, the police finally find the boy's employer through a personal inquiry, and they are told that they can see the boy the next morning when he comes to work. The next morning the boy is shown leaving his home to go to work, saying a sweet goodbye to his girlfriend / wife, and happily doing the wheels as the scene freezes over his saluting girlfriend. At least that's how the video version I saw ends. It is an unexpected but well-planned ending, which presumably represents the last moments of happiness before the boy is taken back to his parents' home and his happy life with his wife and child is destroyed. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as the plot and the images are, the plot is terribly unrealistic and highly invented. I think it is better to enjoy the film as the fantasy of a young person's dream and not go further in the analysis, because all the logic and credibility disintegrate quickly when the story is examined in more depth. Why should a fully furnished and furnished cottage be left unattended with the door open and unvisited for a whole year? What did they intend to do when the owners returned? Why should a girl trust a car thief enough to get pregnant by him? Didn't they think it was immoral to use other people's homes and food? How could they ever hope to get dental care or other emergency medical care while living outside the company? How could the boy have a car accident on a country road with no collisions and no other cars around? Where are there places near civilization where wild horses are free? How come a teenager wouldn't have sex like the most important thing in his mind when he picks up a girl in a zoo? (The lyrics of Elton John's song are not good.) Why should they take off their clothes when they sleep outside at night when it's about to get cold? And so on. The wild horse scenes are designed to attract girls, such as the unrealistic theme of "friendship before romance" and all the back-washing and tickling scenes with their predictable results, the passage through the flower fields towards one the other, the haze filters, the scenes circled among the wild flowers in the foreground, the baby ducks and so on. It works, but it's definitely invented. <br /> <br /> Yet this is a film about youth and freedom, and that ideal hasn't changed since the 1970s. Today's young people are still treated as personal objects or as lost animals that must be recovered by the police instead of being treated as mature human beings who have the same needs for romantic love and freedom as the adult world and the ability to be responsible when freedom comes to them. Therefore the message is universal. It's clear why a sequel wouldn't work: this story is about a one-year magical respite from the real world. Such a situation could never have been extended to infinity, assuming it could also happen in the first place, and a story about real life would have been devoid of the magical charm of such an unreal state of existence. I really hope that no teenager took the film seriously to try such foolishness. But I hope equally well that the teenagers who were impressed by this film in the 1970s learned something about it, and have since tried to make such a magical world a reality more reachable for others, instead of perpetuating the various hatred and repressions of society, especially on their children.
