if the shoot is about vision and real life this film is perfect: NUOVOMONDO talks about immigration to the United States from Italy in the early 1900s, but it also speaks for now, when emigration / immigration is still a focal point. <br /> <br /> It doesn't have to be rich to be a visionary film. <br /> <br /> Acting at an extra level, Charlotte Gainsbourg is a star. A beautiful challenge for the Oscar 2007 <br /> <br /> After the first attempt at Crialese, "Respiro", an exciting but too intellectual film, this has learned the lesson of Fellini and Taviani, to name only two Italian masters . /> <br /> The plot is debating, directing accurately, maybe just a little less melodrama would be more effective. <br /> <br /> If VOLVER (challenging for the Academy Award next year) by Almodovar is a mature film by an always brilliant director, NUOVOMONDO deserves it more, for its great effort to be a European film for the American scene. <br /> <br /> And that's it!
