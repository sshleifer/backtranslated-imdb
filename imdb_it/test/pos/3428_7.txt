An interesting comedy, which takes place on a train from Stockholm to Berlin, December 1945. One cannot help but feel sorry for the poor writer / critic who leaves his job and jumps on the train to Berlin. His ambition is to make a difference and participate in the construction of the new unified Europe at the end of the war. <br /> <br /> I like the black and white format of the film, as well as the closed scenario of a moving train. <br /> <br /> Robert Gustafsson makes a classic "role of Gustafsson" in this film. If you are a fan of him, this movie is for you! <br /> <br /> The philosopher Wittgenstein, through his saying "You can never assume that everything is what it seems to be", is reported several times in the film.
