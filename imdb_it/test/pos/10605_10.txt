The Haggard movie is one of the most entertaining movies of all time. It features the cast of CKY (the films) and also has a GREAT soundtrack. If you saw CKY or Viva La Bam you will notice that everyone (from those two) is in it. Including Bam's parents and many other people. <br /> <br /> The story is about Ryan Dunn's girlfriend, Glauren (Jennifer Rivall), who betrayed him, and he was trying to get back to her. He does this by vandalizing the house of Valo (Bam) and Falcone (Dicamillo). There are many different characters with different stories. <br /> <br /> There is good music on the soundtrack. Groups like him and her, CKY, Gnar Kill, Daniel Lioneye. Iggy and the Stooges Pop and New Order. <br /> <br /> If you don't like Viva La Bam or CKY (the movies) I doubt you'll like it. If you like that stuff ... this movie is awesome.
