Having become familiar with "The Go-Between" by Hartley for quite a while, both in its original form of the book and in its disappointing film adaptation of Pinter-Losey, this was an interesting thing. "The Hireling" sometimes shows a mirror image; set in a period that is a little less distant for the main part, with a British Class System display, and containing a soccer game (boxing replaces cricket) which reveals quite a lot. <br /> <br /> This is renewed in its small-scale focus. You don't exactly get to "know" Lady Franklin and the Leadbitter in the sense of the novel, but this distance is interpreted appropriately in saying the language of the body and the inflection of the actors. Your distance from a total understanding of any true character reflects the dormant "difference" that condemns the central relationship. Miles and Shaw are wonderfully thin and we see more in their "less"; never once are these performances of actor and showy. They are aptly Stanislavskian interpretations that create the impression that these characters have life beyond the confines of the film. All the other parts are very satisfactorily managed, although in this film they are much smaller than I suppose in the novel and compare, in effect, with "The Go-Between", an incredible work on disillusionment. <br /> <br /> The disillusionment at the center of this film is transmitted so sadly and movingly in the last scenes where Shaw kisses Miles and is rejected, and then where a drunken Leadbord confronts Cantrip and Lady Franklin. It is a shameful shame that what would have been an incredibly tormenting conclusion of spoiled and desolate lives on both sides of the screen is "embellished" with a distinctly different tail. One is completely amazed by the jump in tone, while Shaw's Leadbitter goes mad and sings ironically "Rule Britannia" and "God Save the Queen" while crashing his car against things. The political point is heavily overtaken by this bombastic finale, rather shady and operatic. All the sense of subtlety, so effectively transmitted so far, is lost, since the implicit point is heavily and loudly done. Agit-prop certainly has no place in this delicate period drama. Overall, however, one cannot be too harsh. While this absurd final piece is a major flaw, the rest of the film must be praised as a sensitive, evocative film of sadness and detailed observation about the way British society was in the past. Hartley's languid but crystalline touch is very evident. It's just a pity we don't end up with the shocking conclusion of Shaw's drunken scene. The tragic illusory figure of Lady Franklin by Sarah Miles is suddenly denied in its place in the epicenter of the film, since the excellent human drama slips bizarrely into the realm of political scoring. Even Shaw - the drier yet profound feeling of the actors - is betrayed by the excess outside the character that closes the film. So; a nice triumph on a small scale is sabotaged; but we should remember the many good points. <br /> <br /> Evaluation: - *** 1/2 / *****
