I thought this movie was fantastic, if you didn't take it too seriously. Sit back and enjoy Hilary Swank in all its grandeur and laugh when the monks go to Boston, MA. I also think that this film has a great message about self-control and inner strength. Besides, Mr. Myagi was so sweet, I wish he could teach me karate!
