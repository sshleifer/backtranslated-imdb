Sex is Comedy, although not guided by a fantastically imaginative storyline, focuses effectively on the relationship between director and crew during the film making process, successfully addressing the dynamics of human relationships and more specifically the problems and problems encountered by the actors involved in filming sex scenes. The director, "Jeanne", plays a leading role all over the world, because it is she who carries on the plot, in place of a narrator, and offers us numerous small pearls of wisdom to think about. She is a social commentator, who relates to her assistant and others the problems she encounters with her new male protagonist, associating her with a male stereotype. Does their ambiguous relationship mean anything about human nature ?? the tendency to be fickle. On the one hand, the two seem close; when he is not in sight, he claims to hate him. Jeanne also addresses her male pride perhaps in a feminist version of things. <br /> <br /> The taboo of what constitutes obscenity is raised: the content of sex scenes is not considered obscene but beautiful, because it is a falsehood that constitutes obscenity - this is the director's justification. This is, however, doubly ironic, because the film we watch is in itself a construct within a construct. <br /> <br /> There's a lot more to this film than the reports, of course. Watching this movie is not simply a matter of analysis to make some sort of meaning. One can delight in the natural lighting that pervades the film. This makes it realistic and credible. Sometimes a static camera is used that takes on a heavy composition and sometimes the camera looks flickering like a home movie. If you are looking for something fun to watch on a Sunday afternoon that is not too heavy, but still leaves you thinking: it is so.
