I also found "Oppenheimer" a brilliant series and one of the best offers ever on the American PBS. David Suchet was particularly effective as Edward Teller, as a reminder, and the general conception was spectacular. The only reason the series does not rate a full 10/10 is for low budget production values ​​in some areas. The real content is absolutely first-rate in my memory. <br /> <br /> The miniseries Oppenheimer will be published in the UK on July 31st! It will be a Region 2 / PAL set, but it would seem that a Region 1 / NTSC set should be in sight soon. <br /> <br /> If you have a universal player in the United States, you can order series right now from Amazon UK. <br /> <br /> http://tinyurl.com/znyyq <br /> <br /> Huzzah !!
