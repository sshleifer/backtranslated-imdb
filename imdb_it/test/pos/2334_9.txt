I'm glad they finally released it on DVD. I bought the videocassette years ago and watch it at least once or twice a year. <br /> <br /> Grammer has an ironic intelligence about him that really makes this film a success. Its formula is certainly not original, but it is still a lot of fun. I am very surprised that he has not received higher scores in the classifications. <br /> <br /> It ranks as one of my favorite comedies of all time. It's just a little funny movie that makes you feel good. And sometimes, it's all that a movie is meant to be.
