The Regard of Flight, written and performed by Bill Irwin, is a true classic theater piece that has translated quite well on the small screen. Filled with quick and sparkling dialogues and some of the best physical comedies of the decade, it is the head and shoulders above 99% of the "Comedy", as presented today. I am sure that one day he will take his rightful place with great shows like "I Fantastici" and "Aspettando Godot". Because it is not yet available on DVD it is a mystery and a tragedy.
