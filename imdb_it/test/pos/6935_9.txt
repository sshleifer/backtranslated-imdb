Just finished with the first part of Zombie Bloodbath on the incredible DVD of the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy by CAMP Motion Pictures. Zombie Bloodbath 2: Rage of the Undead is next. Now this has left me a little perplexed due to some holes in the plot and some confusing twists here and there, but it's a better film on many levels. The director Todd Sheets really shows a great leap in style and talent between the two films. Once again, this is not for people who want Hollywood-style and glossy horror movies, this is for people who like their bloody, raw and shelled zombies. The story as far as I could tell was basically about two thieves who try and steal from an elderly couple in 1945 only to find out that the couple is a member of a cult. One boy is simply killed and the other, the one in charge, is practically transformed into a scarecrow and crucified and they stand next to him in the nearby field, still alive but dying. Cut to the present day and a van full of college kids break near a farm. At the same time, a group of prisoners flee from a nearby prison. Both groups end up in the same house. The house was where the paired elders lived and when one of the condemned men strikes the scarecrow and takes the jacket, he makes the scarecrow wake up and, in turn, reports the members of the cult again dead. Wow. And that's all in the first half hour. There is another plot going on in the city where a couple of serial killers have taken some workers into a hostage of the deli. This actually works even though, while the people trapped in the house finally escape and end up in the same Deli. Most twists work pretty well, but it's obvious that the film was too complex in some places for its sake. Everything ends in a great showdown with the remaining heroes who find a delivery van or something full of vials of meat-eating bacteria. Obviously they launch it against the undead and cause some melting and some heads to explode and then we have a strange and stimulating ending. First of all, let me say that, although it was not always easy to follow, I had a great time with this film. It was fun and the acting was really good for a limited budget effort. It was obvious that Todd Sheets was really trying to bring more to the table than a typical zombie movie and, in this respect, he succeeded. It had better special effects than the first film, a fantastic rhythm and interesting music and images, besides there is a real show of a shot from inside a mouth while a knife is blocked by it. Care has been taken here and shows. The weakness lies in the script and in some of the more lazy performances. Again, I recommend listening to the commentary track. It was even better than the first and I learned a lot. How to find out that some scenes were shot on Super 8 film by effect and that the film is ruined by the lab and could use it. And they had already edited the film when they filmed it, so part of the confusion comes from some scenes that aren't in the movie. Also, I learned that Todd Sheets really has a passion and love for making horror movies. Exhibition. The film is a good example of a cinema without a budget that could have used another rewrite, but it still shines with more style than most of the DV movies I see. Not quite as fun as the first film, although a technically better film. I really admire the Sheets as one of the true innovators and pioneers of the DV cinema industry ... and this is a great addition to the cheapo zombie genre!
