This 1931 comedy improves with every vision due to the comic talent of Marion Davies and the extraordinary interpretation of C. Aubrey Smith. Smith plays a grumpy old man who gathers his grown children (from his younger days as a rake) into his declining years. One is American (Davies), one English (Ray Milland who is 18), and one Italian (Nina Quartero). There are some surprises as the plot moves together with Ralph Forbes (he had no interest) for Davies. <br /> <br /> Davies and Smith are simply wonderful together and very touching. Even Davies does some dances and does some "big" entrances. And obviously Davies is simply beautiful. <br /> <br /> Halliwell Hobbes, Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray, Guinn Williams, Edgar Norton and David Torrence are the co-stars. If they had given their support to the Oscars in 1931, Smith could have been named. It is simply excellent in this gem.
