Victor Sjöström was the true master in this film, having acted, directed and even wrote the script! It's quite surprising. While few today have any idea who Sjöström was, it could be familiar to Ingmar Bergman fans as the protagonist of Bergman's most acclaimed films, WILD STRAWBERRIES. <br /> <br /> As for this film, it's a very mixed bag. On the one hand, you have to respect it because for 1921 it's a great film. The idea of ​​the Grim Reaper sitting with a dead man to discuss his wasted life is rather fanciful. Furthermore, the special effect of Phantom Carriage is quite convincing and technically speaking it is a well-made film. On the other hand, it's an incredibly dated and beloved film - more like something you'd expect to show at Sunday School instead of an honest and good theater. Furthermore, some of the elements of the story make no sense. Instead of going out as devoted or good, the dying soldier of the Salvation Army looks like a sap - a very sad and confused sap. Why is she "in love" with this man? I miss something? <br /> <br /> So, my recommendation is that if you are madly in love with silences (like me), then at all costs look at it. But if you are not a silent fan, this film could do nothing to convince you that this style film is brilliant because the story is so overly melodramatic and dated.
