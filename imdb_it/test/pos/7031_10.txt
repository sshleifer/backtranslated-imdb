This is an excellent film that I have watched since I was 6 with my older sister. it's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and laugh, smile and cry every time without ever getting bored like the other movies. is a film that will live forever through generations of family. i love it :) when you rate from 1 to 10 in my case i would rate it easily 9.9 each time. <br /> <br /> It is a film about the change of a girl (child) and her first boyfriend-friend (Johnny) their relationships within the family, the changes in Baby and Johnny's worldview during the their relationship. <br /> <br /> DIRTY DANCING WILL COME FOREVER IN CLASSIC LIVE. thanks sorry but only for the brief comment.
