I love this movie: the actors were wonderful and adapted to their roles. The story itself was great (and true, the setting was perfect and the message about the human response to war, danger and risk was exceptional. The person who wrote the soundtrack also made music for Life is Beautiful ( another of my favorites) - his comment apparently was that "... this was not an English film, it was like an Italian film." I think he is right! Callum Blue is perfect for the part of Eric Newby. film to all those who want to see a story that is true and morally uplifting and a beautiful love story.
