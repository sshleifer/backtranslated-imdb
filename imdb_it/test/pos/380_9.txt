Well, this is as good as them. There are discussions about whether Hitchcock was just a "master of commercial suspense" or perhaps a "compulsive technician" - or really "deep". No one knows precisely what terms mean, but it is legitimate to ask whether, at his best, he could not have all three at once. <br /> <br /> In this it seems to be at its peak. Almost nothing is accidental. It abounds with doubts, ambiguity and wit. And the story is compelling, Patricia Highsmith apparently has complexes similar to Hitchcock's. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the plot has been completely described elsewhere, so I won't go into it. I will only mention five episodes on screen, of which Hitchcock is undoubtedly responsible. <br /> <br /> Bruno Antony (Walker) followed Miriam (Laura Miller) and her two boyfriends at a carnival at night with the intent of killing her. He noticed her attention and is innocently flattered by this. <br /> <br /> 1. Laura and her two friends rent an electric boat to cross the Tunnel of Love and then an island in the middle of the lake. Walker is right behind them, smiling, in his boat - Pluto. "Pluto." It is not an allusion to the cartoon character of Walt Disney. It is a reference to Pluto, also called Hades, a god of the underworld in Greek and Roman mythology. This little touch cannot be an accident. And the "underworld" that Walker represents is not only a literal hell, but the underground world of the human mind. I hate to say it's a "Jungian" shadow, but that's what it is. (Carl Jung saw this movie? He was alive at the time of his release - but probably not.) 2. Now, this is a deadly serious sequence, right? Walker is a fool who is about to kill a woman he doesn't even know. Imagine how this would have been defined by most directors. On a night that passes through a crowded carnival, he steals from one shadow to another, the killer peeks from behind the canvas walls, and so on. What does Hitchcock show us? When Walker crosses the gates for the first time, concentrating on his victim, a boy in a cowboy dress, holding a ball, runs and shouts: "Bang! Bang! You're dead!" Walker shakes his head in surprise and looks at the indignant boy. And when the child starts to leave, Walker throws the cigarette at the ball and opens it, then continues his search without another look. This is one way in which Hitchcock treats imminent fate. <br /> <br /> 3. The famous strangulation is reflected in the fallen glasses, which has been scanned countless times. <br /> <br /> 4. Miriam and her friends stop at one of those devices that beat with a big hammer, sending a kind of hockey puck on the well to measure the strength of your shot. One of his boyfriends marks it and the record does not reach the bell above. Under Miriam's delighted and admiring gaze, Walker smiles and rubs his hands, then picks up the hammer, slams it, and the disc beats against the bell. She is thrilled. He puts down the bat, looks at it, grins, and shakes at her with his EYEBROWS like a ten-year showoff! 5. After the discovery of Miriam's body, while the whistles blow and the people scream, Walker leaves the carnival and meets a blind man waiting on the sidewalk. Walker takes the old man by the arm and guides him through the intersection, gravely raising his hand to stop the traffic. A macabre joke. <br /> <br /> These incidents and others all occur during the ten or fifteen minutes of the carnival visit. (Robert Walker's performance is exceptional in everything.) It is essentially a kind of invitation to be a noir. (Cf: "Ride the Pink Horse") But the threat of the scene is undercut by Hitchcock's insistence on irony and distance. Noir family techniques are not used. There is nothing really "disturbing" about it. And the murder itself is not wild at all. I don't think any director, apart from Hitchcock, would have handled him like him. It would have been all a threat and a shadow, hiding places, failed attempts, frowning instead of grins. <br /> <br /> It is not a completely flawless film. An impeccable film is not yet with us. Part of the middle section is a bit slow and Farley Granger, although a good boy, is dull, boring and rather stupid. His new girlfriend is simply boring. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock had to deal with the incorrect attribution of the blame with deadly seriousness in "The Wrong Man". I'm not sure Hitchcock ever thought about the difference between legal blame and moral guilt. The latter was imposed on him at an early age by his Catholic education. "Original sin" - you're born with it - and all the rest. In the filmed interviews, he always calmly explained his fear of the police and the authorities in general by telling a story about his father who took him to the police station to warn him after a few sins. We are justified in asking if it was only what psychoanalysis calls "screen memory". I hope you have the pun. I know I know. He is tense and inept, but I spent a good deal of precious time thinking about it.
