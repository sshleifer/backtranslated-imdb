This movie is for Infantry what Das Boot did for Submarines. If you enjoyed Das Boot, this is all you need to know. <br /> <br /> This is a well-made piece of cinema. On a par with Das Boot. Basically it follows a German elite infantry company "Stormtrooper" which leaves its garrison position in an idyllic Italian seaside resort and is immediately pushed into the chaos of the disintegrated Russian front. <br /> <br /> A good war movie illuminates both the senselessness and the brutality of the war and at the same time gives us an idea of ​​the experiences and essential humanity of those who fight. This movie does it. The film is full of drama and action and so it's fun even at that level.
