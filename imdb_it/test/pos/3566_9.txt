Leonard Maltin gave this film a fearsome BOMB evaluation in his 1995 Guide to movies and videos. What movie were you watching? Kid Vengeance or God's Gun are bombs. This film is a delight. Is fantastic. He is a scholar. It is well assembled It is beautifully photographed, making brilliant use of colors. From the first scene the film catches your attention and makes you understand that this film is a satire well done for the whole Spaghetti Western genre. The film is played for laughter from start to finish with tributes to Douglas Fairbanks, 77 Sunset Strip and the famous showdown in Good, Evil and Bad. Edd Byrnes, George Hilton and Gilbert Roland work brilliantly together to make satire work. Too bad that Mr. Maltin has rated this film as badly as it is undeserved. You can only guess his reason. I suspect that he missed the point of the film completely and expected something more serious than this movie. The Kudos belong to all those involved in this project. This film is a little gem waiting to be discovered by people who are interested in literary films and appreciate satire.
