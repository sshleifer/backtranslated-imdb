John Wayne is one of the few players in film history to have failed on his first big chance and then to win for the second time. Of course everyone knows that the second time was the classic Stagecoach directed by John Ford. <br /> <br /> But we're here to talk about The Big Trail. John Ford's colleague Raoul Walsh saw this tall boy on the set of one of Ford's films and thought he had potential. He wanted to take him to the head of a big Western budget that Fox was going to do. The film, as expected, would be a tribute to the famous western silent The Covered Wagon. <br /> <br /> In observing The Big Trail I was struck by the way Breck Coleman's character of Wayne is similar to that of Ringo Kid in Stagecoach. Both characters were nice young cowpokes, but both were also on a mission of revenge. And of course both films were shot on site and show the costs to make them. No studio products here with a backlot western set. <br /> <br /> Also, I don't think it was an accident that Wayne had this break at the beginning of the sound age. Raoul Walsh, I guess he looked around Hollywood and probably didn't think a lot of movie cowboys would keep the power in the sound. This is something else Walsh saw in Wayne. <br /> <br /> According to what I've read The Big Trail is flopped because after spending all that money to make the film in a big screen process, some Fox genius realized that their theaters weren't equipped with large screen to show it. And when the Great Depression hit there would be no money to expand those screens to the homes of Fox movies. So The Big Trail got a limited version, even in what we would call a formatted version, and lost big money on Fox movies. <br /> <br /> Marguerite Churchill is fine as the crinoline heroine that Duke wins, loses and wins again from Ian Keith. Keith, Charles Stevens and F. Tyrone Power are the trio of villains Wayne has to deal with. <br /> <br /> F. Tyrone Power is the father of the famous cinema legend Tyrone Power. He was a big burly man with a great background in classical roles on screen and on stage. I wouldn't be surprised if your son who was 15 at the time wasn't around the set. <br /> <br /> Also look for Ward Bond although you may have difficulty locating it under a large beard bush. <br /> <br /> Watching The Big Trail now it is interesting to assume where John Wayne's career would have gone if The Big Trail had been a great success.
