The powerhouse cast draws the crowd into the theater, despite the threatening title. Jake Gyllenhaal visited Conan O'Brien to promote the film and explained that "Rendition" was a euphemism for obtaining information through torture. Since 11 September, "extraordinary rendition" has allowed the government's intelligence agency to free people without equivocation and to use all the necessary means in exchange for information. <br /> <br /> Gyllenhaal plays the CIA analyst, Douglas Freeman, (irony) who is torn by his post which simply makes him an observer of unorthodox interrogation procedures in an underground detention facility beyond outside the United States. <br /> <br /> Omar Metwally plays the suspected terrorist Anwar El-Ibrahimi, an Egyptian citizen and bearer of green cards of the American Isabella Fields El-Ibrahimi (Reese Witherspoon). Isabella and her son are waiting for Anwar to come home from a scientific conference when he suddenly disappears from the passenger's airplane poster. He seeks help from his college friend who works in the government and learns that the Head of Intelligence, Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep) is behind it all. <br /> <br /> Rendition is directed by Hollywood neophyte Gavin Hood (who is ready to play X-Men Origins: Wolverine), and raises the question of whether this "extraordinary interpretation" is practiced in real life. The film was released locally in the wake of the explosion of Glorietta (bombing / accident?), And a fundamental scene in the film is when a bomb explodes in a public square, so it must have sent shivers to the spine of every spectator. Seeing the explosion of the tableau with a solitary red and yellow sign Aajala (Ayala?) In the upper right part of the screen, in addition to the effect of silence and slow moving images, it amplified the impact of the coincidence of the real life of the scene. <br /> <br /> There are lessons to be learned from this film and it all comes down to the personal decisions we make on a daily basis. We all have choices we can make at will, and often we don't always (like) see how they influence others, who can end up as unfortunate victims of circumstances. What "the greatest good" should not be a forced choice that our leaders must take if each of us already decides correctly at the source. This is a utopia that is worth building.
