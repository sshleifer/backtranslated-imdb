Batman Returns is more gothic and dark than its predecessor, and I like it a lot. Furthermore, the scenario is more obscure, and the whole environment is saddened along with the soul-chilling music composed by the talented Danny Elfman. <br /> <br /> However, I did not like the idea of ​​making the Penguin a monster, unlike comics, where it is human. Although he looks like a monster, he shows well that he possesses human dignity, and I felt very sorry for him when he saw the gravestones of his last parents. But anyway, he was a dangerous villain indeed, and he needed to be stopped. Michael Keaton made a "tour de force" with his return as a Dark Knight, and this time he is as powerful as in the original Batman. It is not difficult to understand why it is called Batman in public sometimes ... <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Michelle Pfeiffer is so sexy and well prepared in her role, and gave a faithful performance as the villain / criminal dress cat Actually, the actors did a masterful job with Batman Returns, which made it a hit movie. <br /> <br /> If you liked Batman, look at his fantastic sequel, because it is very worthy for the hard-core of all Dark Knight lovers. <br /> <br /> Steve Baillargeon
