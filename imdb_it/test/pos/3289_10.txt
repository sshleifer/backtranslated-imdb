I saw Chomps during the - about - 2 days of his release in theaters. It's a deliciously cute and funny film in the spirit of Benji, although much improved and focused more on actors than on dogs. The mere portrait of the difficulties of life in a humorous way, followed by the bullies and the bad guys who get their merits, is both understanding and moving. It is also thought stimulating. With shrewd subtlety this film influences the awareness of cruelty, personal behavior and bullying. Movies have different genres and different purposes. This film, which is delicious for all ages, offers an interesting humorous look into our experiences. Everyone will recognize the personality and behavior of themselves and others. Everyone will see humor. Humor makes the move enjoyable and brings understanding of life situations to a new level. <br /> <br /> For a carefree laugh and a "feel good" movie, Chomps is an excellent choice. Memorable.
