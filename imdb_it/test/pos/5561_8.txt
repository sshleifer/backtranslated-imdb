An astronaut gets lost in deep space and finds himself traveling through unknown territories aboard a living spaceship accompanied by a group of alien outlaws. This incredible television installation is as enjoyable as a birth fantasy. Individual characters, in conflict at the beginning of the series, must learn to get along and eventually evolve into a powerful group. Most of the action takes place inside the womb of Moia, the living spaceship (which becomes pregnant and gives birth to another ship!). While science fiction stories are usually interested in negative birth fantasies (watch 'Alien' movies for example, especially the fourth part 'Resurrection') this is a surprise. The absence of the military hierarchy on board the ship and the positive attitude towards sex and the human body (and alien) is also pleasant. One of the female characters that is actually a plant experiences "photogasms" while it is exposed to sunlight. The crew must also go to the bathroom. Wouldn't it be impossible in "Star Trek"?
