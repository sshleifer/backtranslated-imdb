This is apparently the first film with Gloria Swanson - the film that made her a must-have star. While she was good at the film, I can't understand how this particular show was so noteworthy at the time - but, anyway, it was a great film. <br /> <br /> Gloria plays the wife of a rich slob who always takes her for granted. He cares little for his care, eats onions and forgets their anniversary! And at the same time, a Lothario enters their lives and starts paying close attention to Gloria and her happy husband doesn't even notice that he gives her any reason NOT to cheat him. In the end, she divorces her husband and marries Romeo with an excellent gab. However, even if the film could have been a too exaggerated melodrama (they were quite common at that time), it takes some interesting twists and is an imaginative and fun movie. Although it is not the greatest silent film I have ever seen, it is a successful film and deserves to be remembered. <br /> <br /> By the way, the DVD version of Image Entertainment is surprisingly good, with decent print and music. This has not always been true for the other versions of Image (in particular as far as they managed the versions of Chaplin).
