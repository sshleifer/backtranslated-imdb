The questions and answers of the human spirit are all here in this masterfully realized historical documentary. The beauty of the cut and the horror of a man walk through life, are revealed in totality. Dieter and Herzog are combined and connected through a mental labyrinth that has been transformed into a single straight corridor that the walls have been plastered with images created by a mans that is characterized by the vibrations of its vocal cords. This film, for about 80 minutes, discovered a new dimension of storytelling. How I call this seemingly new meaning. Only God knows, after all, is not a MIRACLE something that God does for us, but chooses to remain ANONYMOUS? <br /> <br /> This is a requirement to be seen. If you like to experience the adorable horror of war, this documentary will clean your soul to the core.
