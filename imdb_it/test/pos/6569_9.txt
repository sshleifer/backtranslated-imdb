"Uzumaki" takes place in a small rural Japanese town, where people are going crazy. They go crazy for vortices and spirals. The crisis is getting worse because people are turning into snails and the whirlpools appear everywhere. "Uzumaki" must be one of the most bizarre and original horror films I've ever seen. The plot is really smart and the gore scenes are really fun since the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. "Uzumaki" is beautifully photographed and the use of colors is top notch The characters are funny and there are enough shocking surprises to satisfy the fans of Japanese horror. Despite some hilarious scenes, the general tone of this film is rather gloomy. "Uzumaki" is not as good as "Ringu", "Ju-on" "or" Audition ", but if you like Japanese horror movies you won't be disappointed.7 out of 10.
