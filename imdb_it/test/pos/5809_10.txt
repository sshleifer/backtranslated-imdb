Years ago, with "Ray of Light", Madonna reached a truly incredible level of musical art, and since then has sometimes even surpassed its own standards. This production of concerts, with its hypnotic montage, amazing dances, hallucinatory light effects and trance-inducing arrangements, sweep away all previous efforts. The apparent ambition of Madonna - to bring peace to the world alone through music and dance - may seem aberrant or absurd to some. But hell, someone has to do it! Thanks to its gathering of the remarkable talent of all those involved in this production, "Confessions Tour Live in London" places it back among the ten most famous artists working anywhere in the world by any means.
