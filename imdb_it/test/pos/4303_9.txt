What a cast of actors and actresses in this episode of Columbo, alongside Peter Falk, you have Julie Newmar, Jeannette Nolan, Martin Landau as twins. However, the old uncle mysteriously dies and looks like a heart attack to a bicycle discovered by his girlfriend, Julie Newmar, who plays the role so delightfully. Jeannette Nolan plays the other woman in the house, the housekeeper who prides herself on her talents and reproaches Columbo's sloppy and often typical behavior with his cigar. Martin Landau plays identical twins in this. Each accusing the other of killing his uncle for money. Well, you will only have to see and see the result, but I can assure you that it is always worth looking at this for the cast and crew.
