There have been very few comedy films in the history of Hindi cinema. Andaz Apna Apna seems to be one of them. The film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men (Aamir and Salman) who dream of getting rich by marrying the daughter of a millionaire (Raveena). Aamir and Salman Khan do their best to trick each other and woo Raveena. The plot thickens when Paresh Rawal & Co. plans to take over all the wealth. The film is well structured and very funny. Rarely do you encounter a Hindi comedy that is both fun and intelligent. This is one of the few films with Aamir and Salman together (probably the only movie!). Unfortunately he was not successful at the box office and we may never see a film of this caliber again. Aamir Khan is brilliant in the film and has demonstrated his versatility as an actor in this film. Salman Khan offers excellent performance as a weak. Raveena has a convincing role as a rich and confused girl, and even Karishma, who is Raveena's assistant / friend, is fun. Paresh Rawal, Junior Ajith, Shakti Kapoor, Deven Verma, Jagdeep and Tiku Talsania simply add the taste of the movie! All in all, the best Hindi comedy ever made and I would like them to make quality films like this. You would like to watch this movie several times. <br /> <br /> PS - For those of you who have seen this film, I also suggest Gol Maal, Chupke Chupke, Chhoti Si Baat, Naram Garam, Hera Pheri (old and new), etc.
