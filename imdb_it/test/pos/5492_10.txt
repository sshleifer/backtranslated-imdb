One of the best films I've seen ... Good script, original storyline of a man obsessed with the murder of JFK when he was assigned to protect him on that cold day in November 1963. Thirty years later another socialist madman wants to murder the current president. The secret service agent loses his partner along the way, towards the mad bandits who hold, lie and kill anyone who is on his way and who will oppose his mission. <br /> <br /> The film accompanies with a memorable soundtrack and a sober but significant love story between Russo and Eastwood ... which shows how difficult it is to have a romantic life in that kind of work. Malchovich is fantastic, sure that many other candidates could have played the role he played, but how many could have acted with such cunning and intellect that he showed in the film? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I thought this was a great movie ... every time I'm on TV I have to watch it ... and I own it on DVD! I'm a big fan of Eastwood, this has only increased his already fabulous career, and the best role of Malchovich to date! <br /> <br />
