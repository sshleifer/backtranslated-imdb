I didn't know what to expect from this hugely popular Swedish comedy and satire group, which released their first feature film. Wider satire? Well, we get four contemporary, exceptionally memorable stories of family pains, generational gaps and paternity, in particular. But it is dramatic, fortunately, and what a drama! Epic in its field, since each episode comes from carefully selected and geographically diverse parts of Sweden. But any story could take a whole movie seriously, if expanded separately. <br /> <br /> It is dark, distorted, excruciating, but extremely fun and performed in a breathtaking manner. The script, the acting and the cinematography are of absolute world level, since three hours seem to pass in the blink of an eye! They are four shades of mastery, and easily one of the best films in the history of national cinema. It's Sweden's answer to "Short cuts" or "Magnolia", if you want, and instantly on par with those! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 of Ozjeppe
