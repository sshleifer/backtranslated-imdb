This film was all but boring. It deals with reality. To people who think this film is boring, open your eyes to the real problems of our society. Our children are dying. The consequences of alcohol and drug abuse should not be ignored. I work in a correctional facility as a chemical dependency consultant and deal with these problems every day. People of all ages and from all walks of life are influenced by the consequences of their alcohol and drug abuse. It destroys families, injures people and leads to serious brain damage, all kinds of health problems and death. It's all preventable. This film should be shown in every high school in the world. If someone owns this movie and wants to sell it, or sell me a copy, send me an email to: Ottenbreit2@netzero.net thanks
