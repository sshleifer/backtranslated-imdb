This was my first Gaspar Noe movie that I saw and I must say that I was shocked. In general, I don't mind gore, but this isn't even gore, it's a real mess. For some of you, a couple of scenes might be impossible to see and I mean really disgusting. Leaving these aspects aside, the main ideas revealed here and the dialogue are quite brilliant. When you are given a strong argument against bringing a new life into the world and the way it is given, you can't stop and take a minute to think about it. The actors did their job well, representing the general masks of a hand picker that few found at the bottom of a sick society. The film is full of metaphors, but I will let you understand them. Don't look at it if you want to have a moment of relaxation and relaxation. I recommend this film to all of you who want something to think about or just look at something different from what you find in your average cinema.
