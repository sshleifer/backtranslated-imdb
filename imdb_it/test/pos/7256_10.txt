Plunkett & Macleane is part of my favorite genre of movies (historical action comedy adventure) which is probably why I rank it so highly. <br /> <br /> The action focuses on a bandit (Plunkett) and a "gentleman" around who gets caught up in him and his schemes (Macleane). This leads to all kinds of adventures and adventures that are all moved by comedy. There is also, of course, a love interest. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is made up of a number of lively, larger characters than life who add to the atmosphere of the film and show the excesses of the rich right now. <br /> <br /> This is a funny movie with a fairly simple but useful plot that offers lots of fun.
