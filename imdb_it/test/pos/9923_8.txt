'Opera' (1987) <br /> <br /> Director: Dario Argento (Deep Red, Suspiria) Screenplay: Dario Argento and Franco Ferrini (The Church, Sleepless, Demons) Photography: Ronnie Taylor (A Chorus Line, Sleepless) Music: Claudio Simonetti (Phenomena, 'Goblin') <br /> <br /> History: Betty (Cristina Marsillach) is the honored Lady Macbeth of a very stylized staging of Verdi's opera Macbeth. Betty's time to shine comes when the star of the diva breaks her leg before opening the night when she is hit by a car that escapes in a burst of anger. Macbeth's famous curse takes a more sinister and calculating turn when the body count begins to increase. It seems that Betty gets her first fan through a stalker who ties her and hooks her needles to her eyes to force her to witness the gruesome murders of the people around her. Story: 3 of 5 <br /> <br /> Acting: acting in many of these Italian films can sometimes be difficult to judge. English, Italian, French, German, Spanish can sometimes all be in the same film, as they usually speak their native languages ​​making dubbing an empirical rule and difficult to judge. Usually I cut some space in the area as a result. Acting: 4 out of 5 <br /> <br /> Direction: Giallo maestro Silver enters the genre again helping the pioneer. 'Opera' shows him at the top of his game with an exquisite mixture of cold blood, tension and beauty. Direction: 4 on 5 <br /> <br /> Visual: This must be one of the most beautiful films of Argento. Beautifully filmed by Taylor, "Opera" presents some fantastic and imaginative photographic shots that keep the film fast and hard and make your mouth water. The camera always seems to have in mind if it is a wonderful shot of the camera that climbs a spiral staircase or a sequence towards the end of a bird's eye view of that bird that surrounds the crowd at the theater of the Opera. Visual: 5 of 5 <br /> <br /> Audio: Frequent contributor Argento Simonetti (through his various bands Goblin, Demonian and soloist) compliments the screen with zeal while his soundtrack touches the classic (Verdi) at metal reflections (with a little help from Brian, Roger Eno and Bill Wyman) and lends prestige to the music for the bloody cartouche of the screen. The sound design offers you everything you need, from stabbing to shooting, from fire to screaming and masterfully remastered on the Anchor Bay record in glorious 6.1 for every crunch and chw. Audio: 5 of 5 <br /> <br /> Technical: editing keeps the film flowing and moving beautifully. Combined with the camera work, the editing aid keeps the flow of images surreal and dreamy. The exquisite opera house is one of the best and perfect places to stage the horror version of Macbeth. You can't finish a review of a Silver movie without having to comment on the killings. This time Silver unveils the characters in a captivating and brilliant sequence, the film in evidence of a gun exploding through a keyhole in the eye and out of the neck that once again sends Argento's former wife Daria Nicolodi to the morgue of the film. Priceless! Technician: 5 of 5 <br /> <br /> Wrap-up: an almost impeccable yellow that suffers from a somewhat pointless epilogue in Switzerland that offers all the visual thrills that Brahman Silver fans. <br /> <br />: 4 of 5
