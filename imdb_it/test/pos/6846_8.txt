I liked this movie !! Great acting of Carla Gugino. Interesting story of a kidnapping that goes terribly wrong (don't everyone do it?). Some surprising twists in the film and the plot were easy to follow without being so twisted as to be totally incomprehensible. It was a totally unexpected joy. More "Quentin-ish" than most movies try to be.
