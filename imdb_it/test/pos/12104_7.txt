Akin's 2004 winning film, Head-On / Gegen die Wand, depicted the fascinating and chaotic world of a self-destructive but dynamic Turkish-German rocker named Cahit (Birol Ünel). This documentary is a derivation of Head-On and explores the range of music that could be found today in Istanbul if it was as energetic and curious as the avant-garde German rock musician Alexander Hacke of the Einstuerzende Neubauten group (who arranged the soundtrack and made performed some of the music for Head-On) and had the assistance of a film crew and Turkish speakers provided by director Akin. Get everything from rap to the most traditional Turkish classical song, with rock, Kurdish music and Turkish pop in between. It is a chaotic and open world like that of Cahit, one in which the East is the East and the West is the West but the two somehow meet. <br /> <br /> Like Istanbul itself, which lies on the border between Europe and Asia and unites the two worlds while remaining sui generis, this is a mélange that includes Turkish pop, traditional Turkish songs, Kurdish laments, jazz musicians from Rome and a group of street artists (Siyasiyabend), lively and unusual shots of Istanbul street life and some talking to the synthesis camera and a personal and musical story of singers and musicians. Working outside the Grand Hotel de Londres in Istanbul's Beyoglu district, where Cahit remained at the end of Head-On while searching for his beloved, Hacke roams the city with crew and equipment to interview people and record his own music. <br /> <br /> Do you start with a strong rock from the "neo-psychedelic" band Baba Zula ?? these are the musicians he joined when he put together the soundtrack of Head-On and is here for the absent bass player - and for the Turkish rappers (including brave women) ?? thus causing some old people to come out of the theater and lose the mostly melodious and easy-to-hear sounds that make up most of the film. (The narrative excesses of Head-On have been moderated periodically by musical interludes performed by a traditional Turkish orchestra that is located outdoors on the other side of the Bosphorus.) Hacke gives us the opportunity to meet and listen to the performances of some of the best known living Turkish singers, including Müzeyyen Senar, a lady in her late eighties, whose elegant and refined musicians remember the way the great Egyptian singer Umm Kulsoum used to perform. The star of the film-songwriter Orhan Gencebay Hacke does a unique solo in the enud long neck on which she wrote all her songs, and convinces the now elusive Sezen Aksu. To perform a special performance of one of his most famous songs, "Memory of Istanbul." This is a coup, and so is the lament of a beautiful Kurdish singer Aynar recorded in a bathroom whose acoustics are spectacular, if only they could have lowered the heat ?? the faces of singers and musicians are full of sweat. There is also a young Canadian woman, Brenna MacCrimmon, fluent in Turkish, who sings traditional Turkish folk songs with expression and fervor. The audio mix is ​​high quality everywhere. One would like to see a sequel; many great examples of popular Turkish classical music have necessarily been excluded. <br /> <br /> The film was released in the summer of 2005 and was presented at festivals in 2005 and 2006. Opened at the Angelika Film Center in New York on June 9, 2006.
