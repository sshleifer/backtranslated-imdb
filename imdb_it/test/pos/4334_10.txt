The film is incredible, it has a soundtrack that sets the tone for the film. The lines of the film are fantastic, like "Nine for good friends" and "His collection is dedicated to the time of the Charlie collection". I can watch this movie again and again and still laugh because the lines and the action are unique. I feel that when I watch this movie I want to go out and shoot bad guys, if there's a movie you don't want to lose, this is it. "They killed the Giggler man, they killed the Giggler" "They had no right to do it, hes on our sick territory taking care of it." The jokes keep coming in the film. Deff. going out and not renting but buying this movie is worth it, trust me.
