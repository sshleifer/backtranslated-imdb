The people of my generation and the older ones know the Second World War (or as it is called in Russia - the Great Patriotic War) not only from school textbooks, but from witnesses and event participants. My grandfather was a soldier in Stalingrad and when I was a little girl I listened to his stories about how he had defeated the Germans. He also told me some anecdotes, not everything he told me was gloomy. But it was a long time ago, and not when I have a conscious interest in what happened there at the Battle of Stalingrad, I have to turn to books and films for information. Somehow most of the films I saw were made in the Soviet Union, only a few in present-day Russia. And "Stalingrad" is an exception. In the film the war is described from the opposite side, and the fact itself is interesting. Everything that is shown in the film is very different from what I am used to. <br /> <br /> The film reminds me of a great deal of "Zeit zu leben und Zeit zu sterben" by Remarque, because the war is shown through a perception of the ordinary German soldier. And this soldier or lieutenant is rather obsessed with repeating that he is not a fascist at all. The heroes of the film, from the clean and enthusiastic Europe, from the Italian coast arrive in the crowded snow-covered Soviet Union. They are doomed to die; is clear from the beginning. <br /> <br /> After the elite detachment had taken part in their first fight in Stalingrad, one of the soldiers said the phrase that reflected the whole idea for me; he said "If you start thinking, go crazy". And in my opinion it is also true for the spectators. On the one hand, one might think, OK, I will watch this film and it will not dissipate me, I don't need to be sorry for the people on the screen as if they were attacking my country and not vice versa. However sooner or later, but inevitably you start to sympathize with the characters. Probably when the lieutenant holds back his tears to see Kolya's execution. <br /> <br /> "Stalingrad" is hard to look at, all these legs frozen, dirt, executions, snow, famine, destruction of illusions. <br /> <As far as I know, Lieutenant Hans von Witzland is one of the few films in which Thomas Kretschmann played his leading roles. I saw a lot of Hollywood movies in which they were given unimportant parts of small fries, like "Next" or "Transsiberian" (why did he do that?!). And after seeing "Stalingrado", I can't distinguish the desire of European actors to appear in American films, even if second-rate at any cost. The fact leaves me deeply amazed. I believe that Thomas Kretschmann deserves better parts and much better screenplays than those given to him in Hollywood. And from what I've seen with him, "Stalingrad" is the best, beyond any doubt. <br /> <br /> In my opinion the worst drawback of "Stalingrad" is the way they speak Russian in the film. I mean of course those who should be Russian. Say, the guy who spent some time with the Germans or the girl they planned to run away with. Was it really that hard to find actors capable of uttering a couple of sentences without that horrible accent? Initially I started watching "Stalingrad" just to hear German native speakers because I'm studying the language. I didn't expect anything extraordinary in the film. But it impressed me, made me cry when I wasn't going to do it. I know I'm 15 years late to watch it, but "Stalingrad" is not a run-of-the-mill movie, and after 15 years it's still watchable and shocking.
