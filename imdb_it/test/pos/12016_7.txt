Former reporter Jacob Asch (Eric Roberts) is hired by an acquaintance (Raymond J. Barry) to find his ex-wife and son. Asch heads to Palm Springs and quickly locates former Laine (Beverly D'Angelo) with someone he believes to be his son (a young Johnny Depp). But things turn out to be a bit more complicated when Asch discovers the former white garbage Laine has finally married the millionaire Simon Fleischer (Dan Hedaya) and his first child is nowhere to be seen. <br /> <br /> The director / screenwriter Matthew Chapman is channeling BODY HEAT here and this neo-noir from the mid-80s is quite watchable thanks to a cast of famous actors and pretty locations. D'Angelo was still fine at this time, so he is a good femme fatale and not afraid to show some skin. However, the mystery is not very compelling in the end. Co-played by Dennis Lipscomb, Emily Longstreth and Henry Gibson. Chapman made several thrillers in the 1980s, but his "greatest" career success was co-author of the screenplay of the infamous COLOR OF THE NIGHT.
