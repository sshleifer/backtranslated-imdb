Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, left his wife, his son (an uncredited James Franco) who does not respect him and loses a patient he is operating on. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers that her husband has betrayed her. Both need to leave. She watches over a beautiful oceanfront inn in Rodanthe at the same time she books a room. They are all alone together. You can pretty much understand the rest. <br /> <br /> This is what is known as a film for children or for women. It is beautifully filmed with a romantic setting and many quiet scenes. There is tragedy, romance, more tragedy and an uplifting ending (sort of). Gere and Lane's great acting helps mask the fact that this film isn't really that much. Every single piece of the plot is predictable. I raised my eyes a lot to some of the events. It's also too short - I didn't believe the love story between Gere and Lane for a second. If it comes out of nowhere and moves VERY quickly. However the film works. The inn itself is absolutely gorgeous and I was in tears at the end along with most of the audience. So it's a predictable but beautiful movie with wonderful acting. It does not deserve all the criticism it is getting. I give him a 7.
