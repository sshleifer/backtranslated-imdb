I really liked this. I know, it's rampant with what are now the plots of clich√©s, and a lot of exaggerations, but it was really fun. <br /> <br /> In our search for horror cheese from the 70s and 80s, we come across many gestures that are so bad they are good. We also have some that are so "good" that they suck, and then we have some that are so bad that they are just bad. It's definitely so ugly that it's fine. <br /> <br /> Some traveling guys come across an oasis in the middle of nowhere, a forgotten slice of street America, and decide to "take a look". They go through every line of inappropriate until it is absurd and they pay it. They pay dearly. <br /> <br /> Normally I wouldn't give a film like this to 9, but the girls in this are the kind we have been missing since the 70s: Ditzy, dressed in a succinct fashion and FIT. These are not the broad anorexics of today's horrible horror; they are fantastic in booty shorts. <br /> <br /> I give him a 9 out of 10, kids.
