Kane is a murderer by the name of Jacob Goodnight, he lives in this burned out old hotel, where eight teenage inmates clean up. Many of them die except for 3 of them. In my case it was not the best writing or the best ever. I still thought the killing scenes were really well done. Like when a girl is eaten by hungry dogs. The best had to be when he pushed the phone towards the blonde girl's mouth. Kane was a great horror film actor, he had this serious aspect of the whole film and would never have changed. That was his only look in the whole movie. Great action and killing scenes, I don't think I could give him a total of 10 out of 10, but 6 looks good.
