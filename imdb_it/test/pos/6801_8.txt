"National Velvet" tells the story of Velvet Brown, a young English girl with the dream of competing with her beloved horse at the prestigious Grand National horse race. The film follows her as she trains her horse with the help of an ex jockey and the support of her parents. <br /> <br /> While "National Velvet" is a family film, this should not discourage anyone who usually sees such films with derision. The film is really one that caters to the whole family, not just to young people full of attention. He even managed to get five Oscar nominations, almost a sign of slowing down for a general audience. Anne Revere, in the part of Velvet's mother, won an Oscar for her performance. He was really excellent in the role, but it's twelve year old Elizabeth Taylor who steals the show. It is a fascinating presence and shows a talent beyond its years. On board also Oscar winner Donald Crisp in the role of Velvet's father, Mickey Rooney in the role of former jockey Mi Taylor and Angela Lansbury (in one of his first film roles) in Velvet's older sister. <br /> <br /> The film's brilliant Technicolor makes for a captivating visual experience while the editing ensured the second of the film's two Oscars. In addition, the film was nominated for his direction (by Clarence Brown), cinematography and art direction. Also noteworthy is the ten-fold soundtrack nominated for the Oscar Herbert Stothart, although it has been highlighted. <br /> <br /> Overall, "National Velvet" is a family film that deserves a higher score. I realize that the prospect of watching a movie about a girl and her horse certainly won't excite some people, but it's worth the risk.
