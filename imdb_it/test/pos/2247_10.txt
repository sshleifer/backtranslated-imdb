When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it would be a terrible upheaval, directed by first-time director Liev Schrieber. What I saw in the next 130 minutes completely changed my opinion. Based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, Everything is Illuminated tells the story of a young Jewish-American collector (masterfully played by Elijah Wood) who is trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis in World War II. He goes to Germany and enlisted with the help of a 20-something, a record that hits the club and his grandfather. This results in a rigid search throughout the country and they are determined to find what they are looking for. Filmed in some of the most beautiful countryside in the world, Everything Is Illuminated offers tension between the translator and his grandfather and the help that Jonathan needs to find his prey. There is also a lot of religious matter, since the grandfather refers to Jonathan as "The Jew". All in all, this is a film that deals with finding yourself and loving your family. I give this wonderful, if unlit movie, a 10 out of 10. - Arjun
