The films seem to fall into two categories: films that reinforce existing values ​​and social beliefs and those that challenge them. This film is a 180-degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in such offerings as "The Longest Day" and "The Green Berets" that seem more like Disney fantasies by comparison. The "Apocalypse Now!" resulting project, production and film, is "Heart of Darkness" updated in a psychological story of the horror of the post-modernist variety of the late 20th century. The cast and crew that worked on it probably could relate to the terrifying places that the human mind can reach. This is the drama of Joseph Conrad's original character, Kurtz, who entered the literary world in 1901 and was later nominated in the movie "The Hollow Men" by TS Eliot (Mistah Kurtz, dead). Although it is not a direct narrative of "Heart of Darkness" by Conrad (1901) nor a first-hand account of the Vietnam experience, "Apocalypse Now!" stands as a masterpiece that has pushed the envelope of cinema potential. "Apocalypse" is not just about the "horrors" of the war itself, like "Platoon" and "The Deer Hunter", but the darkest sensitivities of human nature revealed through the cruel and demeaning confrontations of violent conflict on a mass scale. Revelation now! it is not so much seen as lived. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is the journey of a trained secret murderer, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen in a tour-de-force representation), aboard an American army boat crossing a river unnamed in the heart of Vietnam and Cambodia where few Westerners would have ever walked. His mission is to terminate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a special forces officer in the career army who was the darling of the US military until he was absent and disowned by the deep unexplored jungles in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The official report is that the colonel has gone mad, but as the events manifest themselves, something else happened to him that is far more terrifying than mere madness. Sheen's mission is to terminate the colonel with the American public, no one wiser. <br /> <br /> The film is rather episodic. The journey along the river is composed of several vignettes, as Sheen and her crew encounter several autonomous "aspects" of the war at ground level. The American public of the 70s had probably never seen this type of film before, with the possible exception of "The Deer Hunter", published the previous year. The first, and one of the most notable, is a helicopter battalion led by Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall in an Oscar nominated performance) which is a cross between General Robert E Lee and Richard Wagner. He loves playing "Ride of the Valkyries" from "The Ring" by Wagner when he bombs defenseless villages. His phrase "I love the smell of Napalm in the morning" is one of those often mentioned in the annals of cinema. Other encounters include an amphitheater where enlisted inmates will be entertained by characters like Hugh Heffner and Playboy bunnies. Despite all the production disasters that prevented this film from being obtained in the can, the remarkable aspect of this film is its rhythm. The original version (not the next version of Redux) does a work fine until the viewer is emotionally prepared to face the clash between Willard and Kurtz. The strange speech between Willard and Kurtz is worth the price of admission alone. And some of Sheen and Brando's shots in some places are some of the crudest and most terrifying images ever produced in the film. Not even characters like Clive Barker, Wes Craven or David Cronenberg have anything on Coppola in terms of horrible images. Brando's Kurtz in a scene, in particular, is so terrifying that it makes most of the other horror films a comparison game, which comes from the recognition that horror does not come from the outside but from the inside. <br /> <br /> Without giving too much away, Coppola's solution at the climax stands as one of the most innovative film revelations. According to the documentary "Hearts of Darkness", Coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would fall into the melodrama and the darker atmosphere of the film would be compromised. He wasn't sure how he could make it work until his wife encouraged the director to witness the ceremonial sacrifice of an ox practiced by the natives with whom Coppola was using as extras in the scenes with Kurtz in "his" village. After watching, Coppola had its final, and is one of the most disturbing and beautiful sequences in the history of American cinema. Love it or hate it, no Western observer will be the same after seeing this scene. <br /> <br /> This film is not for everyone's taste, just as Conrad's original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on airplanes. It is not just the violence and uselessness of violence that are hard to absorb for most American spectators. It is the bare revelation of aspects of the human condition that seem so far removed from American suburban life that make this film difficult to handle for the media, which is how it should be. Coppola did not make a family portrait. However, if the viewer can understand his biggest point, there is a lot to get out of Apocalypse Now! If you're looking for a cinematic experience to reaffirm existing attitudes about American sensitivity and heroism, better stay with John Wayne. But if you are willing to be taken to places you have never been, even beyond the rhetoric of "war woes", "Apocalypse Now" will take you to a world you thought you had never visited before, and the disturbing part of it is that you could recognize it.
