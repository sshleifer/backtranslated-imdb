This film is one of my favorite movies of all time and that's what made me a Nicolas Cage fan for life. In the mid-80s I recorded this film (when the video recorders were impossible to do with !!) and I watched it again and again. Nicolas Cage is simply brilliant here. And it looks wonderful and has no effect on "acting-isms" (see "Peggy Sue Got Married" to know what I mean!). I measure all its performance against this. He was so perfect as the cool punk guy with sharp friends. The music was GREAT. The Plimsouls! The Psychodelic Furs! Modern English! Men at Work! Every time I listen to "Melt With You" I am taken back to the end of this film. <br /> <br /> What happened to her cute costar, Deborah Foreman? And his hysterical friend, Cameron Dye? He certainly took a different turn from Nicolas! It is interesting to note that the slutty friend (Elizabeth Daily) has become the voice of Tommy of the Rugrats (it is announced as E.G. Daily for that horrendous show)! Bizarre! <br /> <br /> If you want to make a nice trip in the 80s, watch this movie. It is certainly a classic. Like Totally!
