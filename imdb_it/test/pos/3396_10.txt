Perhaps one of the best films ever made. The friendship of Orry and Goerge is profound and the War puts a strain on their strong friendship. As a southerner, I can honestly say that this epic is as accurate as it is. Brother brothers fighters. Can you imagine what life must have lived in those times? The best part of the film, for me, was when The South surrenders; General Grant is urging President Lincoln to really attack him in the South, he says, "Mr. President, many people want the South to bleed on what they did ..." President Lincoln, turns to him and in a very tired voice he says: "The South has bled enough ... and so have we ..." I burst into tears and took a deep breath. What a President! It is like a father who says his son has been punished enough, and despite his anger he realizes that his point has been made. This war was a very dark period for our young country, and had to be fought. President Lincoln knew that. I'm urging everyone who reads this to watch this movie and add it to your DVD collection. So, thank God, our country has been preserved. As Jesus said, a "House divided into itself cannot stand".
