I can't see how some people can't find this funny movie I saw the end of it on Sky Movies in 2001, I thought I did it from the DVD since I laughed at my line balls like Rik Mayalls laughing "HAHAHAHAHAHAHA" and Eddies Hello night porter "when they never receive phone calls in general I think this movie is very funny.
