I registered the Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie Network and saw The Morrison Murders on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie Network and Courttv. Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett did a great job with Luke and Walker Morrison. I'm glad Walker convinced his brother Luke to confess that he killed his parents and his brother Bobby. I like to watch real stories on Lifetime, Lifetime Movie Network and Courttv. The Morrison Murders is a good movie to watch. The next time The Morrison Murders is on Lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork or Courttv, I'll watch The Morrrison Murders because my favorite actor John Corbbett is on The Morrison Murders. I give a ten to The Morrison Murders because it's a nice film about Walker trying to find out who killed his parents and his brother Bobby and eventually Walker finds out that his brother Luke murdered his parents and his brother Bobby.
