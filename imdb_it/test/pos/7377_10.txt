I would like to say that I absolutely loved Campfire Tales! For me, it was one of the original horror movies with a twisted ending. As if the film's content wasn't scary or weird, you have the ending. It's a fantastic film and I'm so happy that it will be released on DVD on August 30th. I will not hesitate to receive my copy on that day. I don't think the film received all the credit or recognition it should have, because all these other films came out shortly after and were recognized, but if it wasn't for my brother who told me about the film, I wouldn't have known. That stinks because I think it's much better than any "scream", "I know what you did last summer", or any other horror at that time. So I hope you can see the movie by yourself and at least be able to see the difference. I loved it, and being a horror film addict, Campfire Tales was a sweet to me!
