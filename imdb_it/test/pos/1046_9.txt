I discovered this movie by accident and it was really a nice surprise. A Christmas classic, it is also one of the best comedies of the 40s. The plot is simple: Elisabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) makes a living writing culinary columns for a magazine. At Christmas, her boss, Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet) asks her to invite a weakened young sailor to the Connecticut farm he writes. The only problem is: he has no farm and he can't cook. To get out of the jam, Elisabeth agrees to marry a rich friend (Reginald Gardiner, who has a farm) and flies to Connecticut with her wonderful cook Uncle Felix. <br /> <br /> There is a great director by Peter Godfrey and the cast is really wonderful: Stanwyck has never been better than this witty but romantic woman. Greenstreet, Gardiner and Sakall make funny and human characters. The only weak point is the protagonist, Dennis Morgan. It starts well but, while the film continues, it becomes really boring. One almost feels sorry for Elisabeht Lane to finish with him rather than with Gary Cooper or David Niven that both would have been better suited for the part. Anyway, this is a joyful Christmas movie with a refreshing soundtrack and I recommend it to anyone who likes to have fun and sweet vacations ... in Connecticut.
