'Hitch' is a nice surprise: a romantic comedy that actually has romance and comedy. The most romantic comedies for me range from mediocre to horrible because they are not fun or romantic. 'Hitch' brings actors like Will Smith, Kevin James and Eva Mendes on a fun and light journey like the one that made me laugh and, yes, a little "aww, what sweetness!". <br /> <br /> Meeting with Alex Hitchens (Will Smith), aka Hitch. He is a self-proclaimed "doctor of the date"; helps hopeless kids like Albert (Kevin James) win boys like Allegra (Amber Valletta). Unfortunately, Hitch has to do with Sarah (Eva Mendes), a gossip reporter who decided to break the Date Doctor ... <br /> <br /> 'Hitch' is actually quite funny, and it also makes it work standard slapstick scenes simply because the cast is so energetic and clearly fun. I have to ask myself why Will Smith didn't make more films like this. Its rapid and rapid delivery is perfect for this genre, and its chemistry with Mendes and James is wonderful. James is a real find; I've never seen his show 'The King of Queens', but it's funny and heartfelt, and it shows once again that white fats don't know how to dance hip-hop (Smith's answers to his attempts are hilarious). Mendes is hot and lively (not so, geez) as Smith's perfect match, and Amber Valletta is as sweet as Allegra. <br /> <br /> 'Hitch' is not perfect; it's a little too long, and things get too "dramatic" towards the end (though this is redeemed by the happy ending full of funny dances). But it is an excellent review from the romantic comedies of biscuits that continue to dirty the theaters.
