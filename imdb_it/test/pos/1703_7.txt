The title suggests that this film is a sequel to "An American Werewolf in London". None of the characters in the previous film come back and is not even mentioned in this film by name. So, as a sequel, AAwiP fails, one might say. <br /> <br /> I dare say the opposite. <br /> <br /> An American werewolf in Paris is a fascinating and effective horror film. It's one of the best werewolf movies I've seen in a long time. And I saw enough of my share, like an American werewolf in London, the Howling trilogy, Wolfen, The Wolfman and the Underworld. <br /> <br /> The story tells of three Americans visiting Paris on vacation. On top of the Eifel Tower one of them saves a woman who tries to commit suicide. What begins as a romantic relationship slowly turns into a nightmare when the dark secrets hidden in the city are revealed ... <br /> <br /> I really liked the acting in this film. Especially the two stars of the film: the woman who attempted suicide and the guy who saved her. They have a good chemistry together. But the other two Americans also play their roles well. I didn't find anything annoying for acting, so congratulations! <br /> <br /> The effects on werewolves are good. It doesn't seem too cheap or fake to me. Of course, opinions are divided on this topic. But let's say I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br /> There is also a good dose of humor in this film. There are some really fun scenes that you will probably remember for a long time. <br /> <br /> So to sum up, an American werewolf in Paris may not be a direct sequel to his predecessor, but it's still a fun movie. Perfect for werewolf fans! 7 stars out of 10!
