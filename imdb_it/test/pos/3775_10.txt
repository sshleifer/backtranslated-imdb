I saw this film for the first time in the early 1980s and used it on Betamax. As we all know, betamax did the same thing with the 8-trak tape, I sighed, it also had good image quality. Anyway, I'm glad I found it again, I've been looking for it for over 10 years! This film falls into the category of movies like Airplane: continuous jokes, oneliner, funny actions (bodylingua). Mark Blankfield is absolutely fun. His transformation from the shy Dr. Daniel Jekyll into the partyanimal partymanimal Mr. Hyde is unforgettable, complete with goldtooth, chesthair and goldchain. The part I liked best was when he hijacked the car from this poor boy and then drove to Mrs. Woo Woo. Totally psychedelic experience without drugs! If you need to laugh, this is the movie to do it. When I saw it for the first time, I had tears in my eyes and my belly hurt from constantly laughing. This is a movie I could see over and over again. I highly recommend it.
