I've always been a big fan of "Homicide: Life On The Street", so when I heard that a reunion was going on, I couldn't wait. <br /> <br /> Let me just say, I was not disappointed at all. It was one of the most powerful 2 hours of television I've ever seen. It was nice to see everyone again, but the greatest pleasure of all was having Andre Braugher back, because the relationship between Pembleton and Bayliss was always the strongest part of a great collective show.
