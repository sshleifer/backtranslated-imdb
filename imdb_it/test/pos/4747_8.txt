This is a pretty good film and you probably won't be disappointed, but it has Roy Scheider again, right after making "French Connection", playing a cop with the name "Buddy". They also use the same memorable wheelman from "Bullitt". At first you will think you saw the car chase first if you still have its face in your memory. Car chase is fantastic, but like in many car scenes, it has some technical and modification errors. Check "Puppet on a Chain" and "French Connection II" for other good, long and intense pursuits.
