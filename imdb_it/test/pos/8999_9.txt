I think many of the American baseball films are among the best films ever made. When this movie was in production and I heard it described as a rugby movie. I had read about the Highland team in the newspapers, but I didn't have high expectations for this film about a sport that didn't interest me. <br /> <br /> Last night I saw it "on-demand" and I liked it as much as my favorite baseball movies. Ryan Little and the cast and crew did a great job. Neil McDonough was particularly convincing. As a "bad dad" he showed an excellent range and a subtle but moving character. I also liked the Pacific Islander actors. I was lucky enough to meet many of these good people and this film captures their wonderful spirit and culture. A flashback showing that the Islander culture has become a key element of the Highland team would have been an excellent addition to the film. <br /> <br /> Some very vulgar films were shot recently in Utah. It's nice to see a quality film like this from the Beehive State.
