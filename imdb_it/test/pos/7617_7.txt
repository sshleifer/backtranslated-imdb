Very sadly, I can relate to this film, since I'm 17, and I still have to be kissed, so I really feel for Josie. It's been a while since I saw this movie, but to write this review I saw it again and remembered everything I liked. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is a great actress, and she enjoyed this role very well at the time. The chemistry between Sam and Josie was really good, and Michael Vartan was an excellent actor in this. <br /> <br /> I also loved the plot - as I said up there, I could refer, and it is rare to find a movie you can relate to completely. <br /> <br /> All over - I loved it. 7/10
