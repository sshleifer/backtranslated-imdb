After seeing NAKED CITY and NIGHT AND THE CITY (which is still my favorite Dassin) I was more than excited to see his "Masterpiece" (O-Word Criterion) REFIFER. <br /> <br /> Now I'm a little disappointed with the story. <br /> <br /> So I have at least these five questions in my mind: <br /> <br /> 1. In the last countdown Louis Grutter shot the main character Tony le St√©phanois from inside a house . He couldn't know if he was still alive or not, but he didn't care and immediately ran out of the house (with the money) to get to his car. So obviously Tony was not dead and he was shot. BIG QUESTIONMARK. <br /> <br /> 2. In another important scene the safes specialist Cesar gave a diamond ring (which was part of the robbery) directly after the robbery, a woman who was working for Louis Grutter in a night bar . Stupid, because this character was not so stupid before. And of course Louis knew directly that Tony had planned the robbery of precious stones. SMALL QUESTIONNAIRE. <br /> <br /> 3. After the gangsters behind the murder of Louis Grutter, Mario Ferrati and his wife, Tony and his best friend, Joe planned a revenge against Louis's band. At the same time, they don't care about the safety of Joe's wife and her five-year-old child. Obviously Louis's gang kidnapped his son. ECONOMIC and SIMPLE. <br /> <br /> 4. The perfect shot: of course this is the best 30min. long scene around the Plot, without any words spoken all the time, but was it a perfect robbery ?? Comparing with other films that manage this theme, I could only smile when, for example, Tony had taken a fire extinguisher to ban the alarm. Even too simple. <br /> <br /> 5. Grutter's band went to Mario's house, because they knew (however ...) that the jewels would be there. Then they kill Mario and his wife. And then? They are not looking for it! NO. They ran straight out of the apartment. And more. They don't look after the apartment so Tony can go after a while (which was the same day) to get the jewels. BIG QUESTIONMARK. <br /> <br /> Over all: it's a good movie. Because of the brilliant scene of the silent 30-minute robbery. Because of the very good cut (The final scene in the car through Paris is sensational). Because of an excellent actor called Jean Servais. Because of this Black / White fever you'll get when you look at it. For other reasons, he also wrote another user, but please don't tell me this is a fabulous story.
