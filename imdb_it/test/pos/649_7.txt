In August of '81 there was a buzz country in films, great hits like "Urban Cowboy", "Every Which Way But Loose", "Smokey and the Bandit" were all the rage. For this reason I suspect that the producers of this film have chosen "Honky Tonk Freeway" as a title hoping that it will help the box office revenue of the film by attracting the same crowd as "Urban Cowboy". Instead "Honky Tonk Freeway" bombed in theaters and I suspect that he does it partly being burdened by a poorly chosen title. That same problem now afflicts him on video and this is too bad because it is a rather good film and in a comic style before time. Whatever, probably someone who can remember 1981 will have fun. <br /> <br /> This film is too badly bombed. But I think he would still have it even if he hadn't been saddled with a bad title. It's a film ahead of its time. One could watch this movie now and see that it is clearly a father or * uncle anyway) to the type of comedy made today. For his day "Honky Tonk Freeway" was rather full of allusions and a kind of frankness about life that did not become popular in comedy until much later. Although he is clearly the son of "Airplane", he is more mature and, although he is certainly not "Knocked Up", he clearly points in that direction. The characters are more "mature-comedians" as they are low-key and never think that anything they do is anything other than serious. The jokes are in the choices about what to emphasize and the views of the camera and the way the view and their situations. <br /> <br /> But more than that, "Honky Tonk Freeway" is a real-time capsule. A great look at the early 80s. The people in this film are dressed and behave like the common people of 1981. It was clearly meant to reflect the times and be a joking commentary on the everyday life around them. <br /> <br /> I don't know if my review is helping you, but this is really a good, sometimes a bit excellent, film that is worth renting if you want to see how many faces that are familiar nowadays watched when they were 30 years younger. Beverly D'Angelo is so young that it's hard to realize sometimes. So are Beau Bridges and Terri Garr. Terry Garr was going to become the Hollywood toast like her next movie after this was "Tootsie" which eventually turned her into a star. Howard Hessmann was probably the biggest "current" star of the day this film was made. In 1981 Howard Hessmann was the protagonist of the great TV show "WKRP in Cinncinatti". He played his main character, the night DJ. Daniel Stern was about to burst out as the protagonist of the narrative voice of a child protagonist in the popular 1980s sitcom "The Wonder Years". There are also several faces that are gone these days, it's good to see them see Hume Crowyn and Jessica Tandy like an old married couple on a trip. Jessica Tandy would finally get her Oscar ten years later for "Driving Miss Daisy". There is also the great Geraldine Page in one of his final film appearances. Although she had a brilliant career, she didn't get her Oscar until four years after "Trip to Bountiful" in 1985, so she deserved it fully, and died very soon after receiving that award. <br /> <Also, there are many other faces in this film, actors who are not big stars but who have done a lot of support work. Many are familiar even if you can't think of their name. <br /> <br /> This film is a pleasant diversion. A group of people with a variety of problems start at various locations each for their own independent reasons that, in a vaguely Altmanian way, end up heading to Florida and unbeknownst to them a rendevoux in the small town of Ticlaw, La Florida, which is found to be a victim of the effects of being bypassed by the newly built interstate nearby that has not built an exit for Ticlaw that actually takes the city off the map. <br /> <br /> And this is also this film about the charm of the whole idea of ​​the interstate system, which has only recently been "completed". It had taken a generation to build, since it was authorized by Congress around 1960, for many years when several parts were built and then "went live" and by 1980 most of the system had finally been built and connected all and before the first time the promise of what the interstate system would be transformed into what it is. And the people were enchanted by it. Everyone in 1980 was practically a "veteran of the interstate highway" in the sense that by now everyone had used parts of it and knew how it worked and how it was different from other roads as it had no red lights or stop signs, only on and off ramps, and that went to places that were previously less accessible. In 1980 anyone could drive anywhere in comfort and without having to stop for anything except for eating and sleeping and a bathroom. And this was all new then. <br /> <br /> The ending is anti-climatic and is not satisfactory even if it is a spectacular moment. What makes it exceptional is the journey, not the destination that makes the Honky Tonk Freeway timeless despite being a product of its time. Forget his title; let me take you down into your memory.
