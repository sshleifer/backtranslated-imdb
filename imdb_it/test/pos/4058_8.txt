This is really fun. I loved it, even if it wasn't that original at all, Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy were great together! All the characters are fantastic, and the story is pretty good, in addition to Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy they are simply fantastic in this one! Rene Russo is excellent in his role, and there are a lot of laughs (especially when Deniro makes fun of the lines of Clint Eastwood and Danny Glover), plus the ending is simply fantastic. Yes, it's just another run of the "Buddy Buddy" crime movie, but it works thanks to the fantastic chemistry between De Niro and Murphy !, and it also had car chase scenes! It's nothing really nice, but I found it very funny and a perfect way to pass the time! However, the main villain was very weak and he wasn't good at all. This is far from being the best "Buddy" Buddy cop movie, however it is still a lot of fun, and I thought it was pretty well done and written! Moreover, the ending was pretty funny! , I loved it, even though it wasn't that original at all, Robrt De Niro and Eddie Murphy were great together, I highly recommend this! The management is very good. Tom Dey does a great job here with great camera work, cool corners and keeping the movie at a fast pace. Acting is a lot of fun! Robert Deniro is amazing as always and he's fantastic here, he's hilarious, very funny, he had a fantastic chemistry with Eddie Murhpy he did his usual fantastic things, pulled some really funny faces, he seemed to have fun, he had fun lines, and he had a really cool character! (De Niro Rules !!!!!!!). Eddie Murphy is also fantastic here, he is hilarious, as De Niro did his usual funny things, obviously he loved being in front of the camera, and while he can do this fed up in his sleep it was still a lot of fun to watch! (Murphy rules !!!!). Rene Russo is fantastic here, he had a nice character and, even though he didn't have much to do, he added a lot of presence on the screen and made his character always interesting, it was simply fantastic! (Russian rules !!!!). William Shatner is funny here surprisingly and has not exaggerated, and brought some nice laughs in the film. The main villain is OK, but a little weak and rather bland, however he did what he had to do properly. The rest of the cast is fine. Overall I highly recommend this!. *** 1/2 on 5
