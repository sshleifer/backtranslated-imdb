A few days ago, in Rome, a young Romanian with a criminal record attacked and tortured to death a middle-aged woman who was returning home after an afternoon of shopping. A Romanian girl, who had seen it all, reported what happened. <br /> <br /> Then, he started a debate on the too intense flow of immigrants from Romania, generalizing them as criminals, all, indiscriminately. > <br /> I am only 15 years old, but I thought: what idea of ​​affluence does Italy give to these poor people? Why do they consider us the land of abundance? Last night I finally saw NUOVOMONDO and my question was answered. When you have only one donkey and some goats, those propaganda postcards that show the United States as a land with rivers of milk and huge vegetables, make such an impression. <br /> <br /> NUOVOMONDO is truly a film not to be missed. It balances an ethereal symbolism (milk rivers, game of glances, hard and rocky mountains, the name and character Lucy / Luce) and a cruel realism (the mass of hopeful people on the ship, procedures at Ellis Island). There is a mixed cast, ranging from the angelic Charlotte Gainsbourg to the realist Vincenzo Amato, to a bitter and overwhelming Quattrocchi America as a mother. But was it really so difficult to enter the New World?
