Aaah ... The Thing. <br /> <br /> See a horror film in which not only each character is over thirty, but is decidedly attractive, makes a refreshing change and reminds me of those distant times when the actors were chosen for their talent and their ability to play realistic characters, rather than their teenage charm on a magazine cover. And Carpenter chooses a set designer and a cinematographer who can create realistic environments rather than supernatural parodies. And there is no final gimmicky twist, or the appearance of cameo or celebrity, or pseudo-romantic lame subplot. <br /> <br /> And I really miss the physical effects on the set; with all those 20-year-old kids trying out new crazy ideas with vats of blood and latex and early animatronics. In the 5 years between 1979 and 1984 we saw Alien, The Elephant Man, Poltergeist, The Howling, An American Werewolf in London, The Thing, The Wolf Company, A Nightmare on Elm Street ... what an era for effects horror! And don't let me start on the death of opaque painting. The opaque work in this film is beautiful and seamless. <br /> <br /> What do we have now? Third-rate CGI, former directors of music videos and professional stylists, which even makes horror movies "gritty" like glossy MTV videos. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to switch to Netflix "The Howling".
