This film is great from the beginning to the end of a group of general practitioners who unite and literally kill each other by stopping their hearts and then reviving. So they look for what happens from the "near death" experiences. As everyone goes through the experience, they become haunted by their deepest fears that seem to materialize as reality. This ranges from dead children with hockey sticks to dead fathers who seem to be upstairs. <br /> <br /> The cast is top notch and Oliver Platt is hilarious in one of the best roles of his career. I'm not a big fan of Keifer Sutherland, but he also does an excellent job. This is a movie that I can watch over and over again!
