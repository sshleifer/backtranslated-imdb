I found the story big enough of a thriller that henry's wonderful miss music didn't rock me. julie andrews was excellent and I certainly don't understand why this movie had box office problems when it came out because it makes me happy in the end to get everyone to sing. and I like the usual speeches after the end that I think you can say that this film has some traditional blake edwards humor ...
