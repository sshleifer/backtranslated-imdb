This is one of the best movies made on the 80 punk scene. I saw this a few years ago on a "bootleg" copy and was amazed. Very few of today's children know the true roots of punk and this film shows some punk legends of the 80s like The Germs and shows how it was then. Nowadays a lot of punk has become mainstream with MTV and radio and it's nice to see the real underground rebel movement of the original scene. Darby Crash (of The Germs) is one of my heroes and this film shows why. A must see for all the "punks" and all those who are curious about the punk scene of the 80s
