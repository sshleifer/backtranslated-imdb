... but you've probably seen it otherwise you wouldn't be here. It is so obscure that you probably came across it as I did because this little-known gem does not get word of mouth. <br /> <br /> From the beginning you know how the plot will develop but watching our innocent redheaded nurse put together the pieces of the puzzle is high quality entertainment. Most horror films bombard viewers with graphic displays of torture, but Do not Look in the Basement makes it subtle, which makes the suspense superior. Note to horror filmmakers: some of us love subtlety! The beautiful and housewife nurse Charlotte takes a job in a hospital, but she is dismayed when she discovers that the hiring chief has had a horrifying accident and is now the subordinate of a mysterious doctor, whom we all know is not a doctor at all . The suspense is built through undoing Charlotte's events with the assistance of many patients, but which patient can trust Charlotte? This is a gem and my absolute favorite TRUE HORROR film. I love Re-Animator and Evil Dead but they sound more for the HORROR-COMEDY crowd. VIOLENCE: $$$ (Quite meek for the standards of horror, but there is a fair sprinkling of blood throughout the film. The opening scene is classic, no other horror film starts better and eventually has a good one dose of blood. <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$$$ (Wanting to fall in love with Allyson (Betty Chandler) spends a good part of her time naked, trying to seduce half of the sanatorium's men, Betty Chandler is a knockout and I'm shocked that this is his only credit movie. <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ $$ (The story is well managed despite getting lots of miles in Hollywood. The script has a talent for build suspense and it never fails to put poor Charlotte in a precarious situation.) <br /> <br /> ATTACK: $$$$ (Betty Chandler does the best job here as Allyson, capturing dementia with ingenuity in one form ethereal. The judge was also splendid, weighing the facts before arriving at a verdict while Ro sie H olotik as Charlotte gives an authentic performance as you will feel for her character.
