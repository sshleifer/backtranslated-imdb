Even though I saw this movie about 4 years ago, long before I started commenting on IMDb, I decided to see it again now, which is unusual for me as of now I've often seen something again after seeing it. What can I say? Well, the best interpretation is that of the late Peter Boyle as a title character who, after discovering that a man is killing his daughter's drug addict, wants to bond with him even though he is a Madison Avenue executive who has nothing in common with the conservative Joe of the lower class. In fact, there are a lot of funny scenes from Joe at this guy's party that makes smart alecky remarks there. Oh, and it should be noted that the actress who plays the daughter they are looking for after she disappeared from the hospital after having overdosed on some drugs is none other than Susan Sarandon making her film debut! This was a pretty tough film for the time it was made (late 60s-early 70s) and was a gripping job by screenwriter Norman Wexler (later Saturday Night Fever) and director John G. Avildsen (later to save Tiger, Rocky and The Karate Kid). Surely the ending encloses itself even today after all these years! Highly recommended for anyone curious about the counterculture of that time. Postscript Among the cultural artefacts seen here are a Raggedy Ann doll, a box of Ritz crackers, a bottle of Heinz ketchup and, unique for its time, a Nixon poster that asked: "Would you buy a used machine from this man ? "
