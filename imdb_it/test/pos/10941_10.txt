The Twins Effect - Chinese Action / Comedy - (Charlene Choi, Gillian Chung) <br /> <br /> This vampire action comedy is one of my favorites for being thoroughly entertained throughout the film . First of all, the characters are memorable, contributing with a myriad of classic scenes. Charlene and Gillian are naturally cute, charismatic and witty. This film was my first exposure to them, and all I wanted to do was reach my TV screen and give them a real GREAT HUG. The remaining cast did well in supporting roles, including Jackie Chan, Karen Mok, "The Duke", Josie Ho, Edison Chen, Anthony Wong and the evil vampires (one of whom is strangely familiar to Will Ferrell). Even the abominable Ekin Cheng was good at it. Good characters are important, of course, because they avoid the feeling of boredom by keeping things interesting between the action sequences. <br /> <br /> And speaking of action, this film has plenty of it. More importantly, there is an emphasis on quality in combat choreography. An aspect that has contributed in this regard is the weapon in the foreground of the protagonists ?? a sword with a retractable spear rope. This weapon itself opened up a variety of moves that otherwise would have been impossible. Josie Ho and Gillian Chung, in particular, perform some evil aerial maneuvers using these devices. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the sword game is superb and is highlighted by two great sword fights ?? one that takes place during the opening train station sequence and the other that occurs at the end of the church. In fact, the maneuvers armed with the blade shown in this film have put a little shame on other highly overrated fans, and I am really sorry for those who would like to quote the horribly choreographed garbage from Ashes of Time, Storm Riders or A Man Called Hero with well-planned sequences and precisely performed in The Twins Effect. It's not even close. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why this film has caused much criticism. I'm sure the die-hard apologists for Hong Kong's "golden age" will hate it because they don't fit into their narrow vision of what Hong Kong's action should be. We should learn from the fall of John Woo - a pony who has never learned to reinvent himself. We don't need another clone. We need something different. The Twins Effect is a good example. <br /> <br /> This film was so beautiful that it actually prompted me to be disappointed by other Chinese films with the same actors and actresses. Is this especially true for Ekin Cheng, whose other films almost always suck? and yes, this includes the obscenely overvalued and exploitative shuxia crap mentioned in the previous paragraph. Even The Twins have never been able to match the value of this film when both were protagonists of a film, although they managed to get some good movies when one or the other takes on the main role (for example, Beyond Our Ken, Good Times Bed Times, House of Fury) or when one or both are in support roles (eg, Color of Truth, New Police Story, Just One Look). The Twins Effect 2 should have been a direct sequel, instead of a family fantasy. I am still anxious to see Charlene and Gillian team up and kick in another film, but the fact remains that The Twins Effect hits all cylinders, optimizing their charisma while avoiding a descent to annoyance (as in Protégé de the Rose Noire). <br /> <br /> All in all, this film has everything you need to be entertained. And can I remind the reader that this is it? FUN ?? which judges the magnitude of a film, rather than dramatic artistic elements or insignificant prizes from established academies of critics who usually have no idea what they are talking about. <br /> <br /> In the end, the Twins effect is a CLASSIC not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Rating = 5/5 stars <br /> <br /> PS ?? Hollywood executives decided to massacre this film when it was released in the United States, renaming it The Vampire Effect and cutting 20 minutes of footage, which includes parts of the action scenes. However, the final fight of the American version has a better soundtrack than the original version. Therefore, I purchased both versions, which allow me to first look at the original up to about the 1:20 mark, then to swap the disks to watch the final fight in the US version.
