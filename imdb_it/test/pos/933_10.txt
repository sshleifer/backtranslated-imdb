The final part of the Kieslowski trilogy based on the colors of the French flag finds the director at peace with the metaphysical and transcendent nature of the cinematographic image. In Red, the image is fundamental, as is the obvious but intelligent color coding. However, rather than adhering to empty aesthetic devices based on "cinema du look", the Red Kieslowski is a multi-layered and densely plotted meditation on the nature of destiny and love. In Red, love and destiny are intertwined but complex notions, dictated as much by the whims of human beings as by the invisible parallel associations that seem to pass by. You feel that Red is actually an allegory, a re-enactment of Prospero's omnipresent gestures in The Tempest, yet it is more than his story. Red requires innumerable visions, and in every vision one discovers something new that is intertwined in the already impeccably traced structure. <br /> <br /> Although Red is only a masterpiece of Kieslowski, it is better to see it as part of the trilogy. The blue and white elements are shown in red, which will please the spectators who know.
