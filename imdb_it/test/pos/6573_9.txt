When I first saw the poster for this film, I discarded it as another low-budget film aimed at young people. After a few days, when he finally arrived at the cinema, one of my friends told me that it's good. <br /> <br /> A year later, the first time I saw the commercial that Anand was going to air on television and the moment has finally arrived while I flipped the channels and for a moment stopped to watch and this is all. I ended up watching the whole movie. <br /> <br /> And 3 years later I would have seen the movie at least 7-8 times and I don't watch movies over and over again !! <br /> <br /> This film is fantastic because it tries to be different, when all the Telugu films were composed of 6 songs and 4 fights. <br /> <br /> It is a simple film, a bit slow but a compelling script, there are no outstanding parts in the film, very versed dialogues, which is really hard to find by. <br /> <br /> The music is both classic and relaxing, excellent performances by Radha Krishnan, some great kirtanas also arrive in the bgmusic, through the film. <br /> <br /> Cinematography deserves a quote. Editing is not fluid but adequate for a romantic like this. <br /> <br /> But what really makes you jump in this film are two things: 1. the way in which each scene was treated with the utmost respect, the now famous, Shekar Kammula. <br /> <br /> 2. Veturi's beautiful words. <br /> <br /> And another thing deserves a special mention, Kamalini, part of his success attributed to Sunitha, for giving her such a beautiful voice, in reality I tell you, the voice does wonders to me. <br /> <br /> The other actors are equally good, Raja in the title character and the child, and the way he screams when he gets a new dog. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, I can tell you that this film is about to become another classic with those old romantic classics, along with another classic-romantic piece by Kammula, Godavari.
