Tom Hanks returns as a symbologist to Dan Brown's Robert Langdon in his first adventure Angels & Demons, which Hollywood has decided to make after the Da Vinci Code, given the most controversial subject of the latter that strikes an open nerve of the faith itself. The Catholic Church was in love with the first film, but apparently careless about this. And it's not hard to see why, considering that Ron Howard chose to do a flat-out action piece that serves as a great tourist video of Rome and the Vatican City, and probably would increase the number of visitors given the many beautiful scenes on the place, save for Piazza San Pietro and Basilica which was a scale model used. <br /> <br /> So I guess that with most of the budget going to the sets, the ensemble cast has to be scaled down proportionally. Ayelet Zurer tried to enter the female void left by Audrey Tautou, but since the character of Tautou had much more interest in the film, the Zurer scientist, Vittoria, had far less to do than wait behind the scenes to change some batteries on a metal box full of anti-matter. In the book you are the course for Langdon of course to talk about his vast knowledge of the Vatican, of the Illuminati and of the great feud between the two, but here it is neither love interest, nor his intellectual equality. <br /> <br /> Ewan McGregor, on the other hand, chews every scene in which he finds himself as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, who temporarily takes care of the papal office while the other important cardinals are in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new Pope. And he plays Patrick with that glow in his eyes, with nuances that let you know there's more to it than it looks. There are no surprises here for the readers of the novel, but McGregor's performance here is one of the highlights of the film as Hanks plays well, Tom Hanks. <br /> <br /> The book itself is packed with content as questionable as ever, and had much more plot points on science against religion, and a wealth of information that Dan Brown researched and linked into a challenging piece of work fictional. While I was reading the book a few years ago, I thought that if a film was made, it is easy to expire and dwell more on the established action pieces. Unfortunately, this is what this Ron Howard film did, with a rhythm that does not allow for a temporary outlet. Unlike the first film in which the characters sat for a bit of "discussion time" over a cup of tea, this moved things so quickly, it's like re-reading the book from scratch, page after page skipped just to get there at the heart of the action. <br /> <br /> Catholic critics have called Angels and Demons innocent, because I suppose they do not dwell on its many controversies, unlike the Da Vinci Code which struck a nerve in the center of faith. And if nothing else, this film was a great promotional video on tourism with a beautiful showcase of the many tourist landmarks that attract many visitors around the world. Of course certain areas such as the catacombs under St. Peter's Basilica and the Vatican archives remain outside the limits, but the walk along the Path of Illumination is now almost free. <br /> <br /> Nothing new for those who have read a different book to see it become alive, but for those who have not done so, this film may simply force you to pick up the Dan Brown novel just to read a little more on the meaning of the monuments and characters like Galileo, Michelangelo and Bernini that are closely related to the plot, but many have not spoken. Satisfying popcorn entertainment that leaves you with nothing spectacular.
