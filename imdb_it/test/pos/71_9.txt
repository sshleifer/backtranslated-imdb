I've always loved this movie. Music, history and action. I especially like the opening and closing of the film. The music has remained with me over the years. The battles of the planes of the First World War were great and the comedy is typical of Blake Edwards. Slaptick is his forte 'after all. Julie's singing is fantastic and keeps me glued to the screen. Sets and scenes are wonderful. The characters are attractive. I love the scene with wounded soldiers and Julie singing for them. I wish he would sing me in Vietnam. I also liked the old cars of the period and the music of the First World War. I was happy when the DVD arrived. Now I can whistle in the dark watching it again and again.
