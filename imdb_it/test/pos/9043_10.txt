An unjustly overlooked classic, "Intruder in the Dust" is one of the great films of the 1940s that unfortunately slipped into darkness. Based on a story by William Faulker and filmed in his hometown of Oxford, Mississippi, "Intruder" tells the story of Lucas Beauchamp (played with great dignity by Juano Hernandez), a black unjustly accused of murdering a local white man and a white boy (Claude Jarman, Jr.) who uses this situation as an opportunity to pay off a previous debt to Beauchamp. A terrifying acting, especially by two great actors, Porter Hall (as the father of the dead) and Elizabeth Patterson (better known as Mrs. Trumbull in "I Love Lucy") as an old lady willing to stand against the inhabitants of the city ​​to see it well is done. This simple, tense and sincere study of racial bigotry deserves to be seen more.
