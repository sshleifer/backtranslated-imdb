I really saw this film only because it contained Rupert Grint (whom I knew as Ron from the Harry Potter films). I never really appreciated Rupert as an actor until this movie. I loved the whole movie. Rupert does a wonderful job in this hilarious and bizarre movie. I think the film could have gone well without sex, but it worked somehow. I look forward to seeing more Rupert films in the future. Julie Walters also did a great job. In the Harry Potter movies, he has a very small role, so I didn't even know what to expect from her. But she was as wonderful as Dame Evie. The part where she swallowed the key was absolutely fun. Overall, a fantastic film.
