An introspective look at the relationship between Hawking and the space / time contingent. This film exalts the Welsh and Newtonian laws and the relations with Einstein's theory of general relativity. <br /> <br /> The film is methodically direct, exposing the details of the man (Hawking) and his work (Black Holes). His family interviews are a bit too long, so unfortunately there is less development of his theories and ideas. <br /> <br /> A Philip Glass soundtrack superbly completes the film. Only another man could compose melodies of this disturbing genre (Jean Michel Jarre). Overall I highly recommend this film based on Hawking's "wisdom nuggets" and his adequate explanation of an event horizon!
