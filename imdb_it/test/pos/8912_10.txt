Alien Warrior (or King of The Streets) is one of the gems of the 80s where you come across by accident, then looks stunned, marveling at how wonderfully stupid and over the top. <br /> <br /> A rather large alien arrives on earth (LA to be precise) and stumbles into a world of corrupt drug traffickers, gangs and policemen. He falls in love with the beautiful blonde haired teacher who just wants to help the children in the neighborhoods to read. He also manages to anger a drug boss who sniffed cocaine who swears he will destroy it. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with this first-run movie ... of course it's a bit naive, silly and low-budget. But you can say that the directors have had their heart in the right place, and damn if it doesn't work! I just pray that it will soon be on DVD. <br /> <br /> It has a warm soundtrack, break dance, violence, nudity .... all with a positive and healthy message! Watch it.
