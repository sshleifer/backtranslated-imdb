The filmmakers made the story of a rather boring man interesting and complex, focusing on his wife at home. At the same time, we are exposed to a truly original existential French solitaire. <br /> <br /> The film is more than a documentary. I almost never feel that I have experienced something accidentally profound, which makes everything even more profound. <br /> <br /> The films have visually interesting inner moments. Absolutely loved the trip the filmmakers brought me. (A lot of Europeans in the credits). It is hoped that PBS will screen it to reach a wider audience in the United States.
