SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SPOILERS, YOU WERE WARNED <br /> <br /> I saw this movie yesterday at the Venice film festival, and I must admit that, being a fan, it was REALLY IMPRESSIVE. Excellent graphics, excellent music, excellent dubbing, excellent action sequences and so on ... BUT there is a but. ALL the movie was designed EXCLUSIVELY for the players who loved it, and therefore can enjoy every single reference, character, joke (you should see a joke with particularly comical winning music). A poor man not in the world of FF will obviously see the magnificence of the technical part, but CANNOT grasp the inner satisfaction of seeing, for example, Barret who appears and shoots in Bahamut TOTALLY OUTSIDE NOW. He will ask "Who is this guy?", And I can't blame him. He can't even understand what a player feels when the OPENING SEQUENCE has the opening music of the game, Nanaki running in the canyon with his two cubs, howling in the ruins of Midgar, and then "498 years ago ..." . Almost all the characters have made an appearance or a quote (including Reeve, Tseng and Elena), and Reno & Rude have been really stupid and comical to see, but the final impression the film left me was the last hardcore dream, but much less for a FILM fan ...
