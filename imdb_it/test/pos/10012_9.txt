My wife is a psychotherapist and we observed her from beginning to end. I'm the typical man and I can't stand my fingertips, but this movie is incredible. If you want to see what it's like for someone going through these kinds of battles, this is the movie for you. As I looked at him, I felt sorry for him and for others like him. <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers *** Besides the fact that all the people in the film, including the people in the mental institution, were real people in real life, they made it more real. <br /> A must see for someone in the mental health profession!
