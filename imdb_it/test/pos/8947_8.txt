Exhilarating from beginning to end, there must be great courage to manage the theme of death with a smile, especially when two funeral directors are fighting for market control: a classic and a revolutionary living room where every funeral is a show lead by Christopher Walken, a delight in the role of the American mortuary visionary. But the rest of the cast is also fantastic, and this is another success that only the UK can do. Surprising among the ensemble cast is Naomi Watts, which strikes another metamorphosis (including the accent). Always with a smile on his face, it seems a paradox that there can be so much comedy to be taken from a film that could be called "Four funerals and one marriage", but you will understand when you see it.
