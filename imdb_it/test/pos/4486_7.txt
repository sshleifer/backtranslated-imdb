I guess by the time I saw this episode, I saw enough Twilight Zones to have understood it ahead of time. There is this strange set of characters found at the bottom of a cylinder. They are fine until an overzealous soldier shows up in their midst. It's his first directive to escape and so he gains strength and puts them to work to reach the top of the cylinder. There is a lot of discussion about goals, reason and speculation about their past, but nobody can remember anything. They represent different jobs: a piper, a dancer, a clown, a man with a tattered hat. Why am I there? It leads to an adventure and in the end it is solved, but I think I had a good idea before everything happened.
