Unlike Bond and other detective films, Alfred Hitchcock's hero was a common man who would get into trouble and then with his wit and courage (and luck) he would come out of it. Jewel Thief is based on the same principle and therefore in a sense is the tribute of Vijay Anand to the master of suspense. The tribute can be, but it has its bases and founds Vijay Anand as a great director. <br /> <br /> It is the story of a common Vinay man who one day realizes he has a double called Amar who is actually a jewel thief. Suddenly Vinay finds himself in the middle of a hatching plan and to save himself he goes hunting for a wild goose to find this Amar that remains a step ahead of him. The suspense is almost killing for the whole film and while the plot crumbles, you're struck by the genius of the scheme. Just like Hitchcock's movies, Jewel Thief can boast of a great climax shot inside the great Sikkim palace. <br /> <br /> Everyone and I mean everyone; Dev Anand, Vijay Anand, Ashok Kumar, Vajyanti Mala, Tanuja, SD Burman, Kishore Kumar, Majrooh Sultanpuri etc. Etc. They are in their best forms. This is one of the best thrillers ever made in India.
