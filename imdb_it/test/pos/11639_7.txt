While it might not be his most amused film, MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE is one of Charley Chase's most beautiful comedies, twenty minutes of targeted gags, a well-choreographed physical comedy and funny jokes (made through the title card, of course) all based on an extravagant and wildly implausible premise. We are told above that this is "a story of familiar people - a wife with a face that would stop a clock - and her husband with a face that would resume it". Soon we meet Charley Moose and his wife Vivien, who has a huge nose. But it makes no sense to discuss plausibility when our conspiracy depends on a series of interconnected coincidences so blatantly far-fetched: that is, first, that Charley would correct his overbite the same day his wife would have her nose fixed, second, that each spouse would keep their respective cosmetic interventions secret from the other, and the third, that when they meet in public afterwards, Charley and Vivien do not recognize themselves. It looks a little stretched, doesn't it? More traits is more similar. Clearly, we are in the farce world here and we just have to roll with silly twists, so as long as you can relax and forget the plausibility you'll probably like this short one. <br /> <br /> MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE starts off in a relaxed way as the various complications of the story are established, but things start again when Charley and Vivien have "met" and set a date for a party together at the home of the Charley dentist. Each of them rushes home excited, enters separately and at the beginning does not notice the presence of the other. (Mr. & Mrs. Moose seems to be quite rich, by chance, since they live in a villa the size of a luxury hotel.) It follows a magnificently temporary sequence that somehow recalls Buster Keaton's THE NAVIGATOR in which husband and wife they throw themselves home without ever meeting enough face to face. And once they get to the party, the play really takes over while Charley is forced to dance with the clumsy Gale Henry wall. Henry, a reputable full-fledged player who has acted in many short comedies dating back to 1914, is as exhilarating as his dance partner who brings great vigor but little grace to his dance. There is also an elegant cinematic touch during this sequence, when the camera turns off to show us only the shoes of Charley, Gale, Vivien and Vivien's dance partner, yet we are able to follow precisely what happens between the princes watching their feet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Charley and Vivien the party they attend is raided, and from there the complications multiply when they manage to escape from the police and return home. When Charley realizes that his new wife was tempted to go out with another man, he solves a lesson for each of them. . . comfortably forgetting, of course, that he was trying to do the same thing. The last few minutes of this film offer some of Chase's most entertaining comedies, with a nice visual gag for the final punchline. MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE leaves the viewer with a warm light, and certainly fits with the most entertaining comedies produced by the prolific, sadly underrated Charley Chase.
