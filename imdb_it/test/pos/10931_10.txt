I just read what I think is an analysis of this film by an Irish lyric. Beautiful to read. <br /> <br /> However, a concise analysis of this film is that it is an intertwining of the seven deadly sins with the four types of justice. <br /> <br /> Envy, greed, pride, laziness, anger, etc. and justice in retribution, distribution, blind and divine forms. I could show three examples of each, one for each of the three protagonists; however, it's much more fun to write them down yourself. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent film. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it.
