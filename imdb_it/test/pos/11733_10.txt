The jazz soundtrack makes this a Clint Eastwood film. <br /> <br /> Actually all of this hits me like Burt doing Clint. The story is good and the film is full of a ship that I carry with me so far. (Reynolds a bad boy: I'll blow the chain on your friend, why are you at the top of my city and you want to know the worst part? to reel is a nice set for audiophiles! <br /> <br /> Charles Durning is unstuck as he listens to tapes of prostitutes who have (like) phone sex. (You should see it, trust me, it's fun.) Brian Keith plays against the guy like a tough guy. (And it does it well!) <br /> <br /> The attention of Bernie Casie for Zen. <br /> <br /> Rachel Ward. WOW! (Where did she go?) <br /> <br /> Doc Severinsen and the Tonight Show group are playing as usual. (Joe William's guests on the voice. Manhattan Transfer re-recorded "Route 66".) The soundtrack lends class to the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Do I need to add anything else? It could be the best Reynold movie ever. <br /> <br /> (Yes, he plays himself, as usual, but it works!) <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
