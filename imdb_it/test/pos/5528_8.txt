I saw Six of a Kind for W.C. Fields - is active for only about 10 minutes and has a long scene, the infamous billiards sequence that made him famous in vaudeville and in many other great moments. The remaining 55 minutes are also delicious, fortunately, especially for the exhilarating Charlie Ruggles in the role of the stormy banker J. Pinkham Whinney. He is the opposite of all. Stutter and stagger for our pleasure. Furthermore, his play, Mary Boland, plays his wife Flora. Joining the proceedings are George Burns and Gracie Allen. Boland is particularly fun at the beginning and near the end, but Gracie and Ruggles consume much of the image. Gracie is fun, enough, but it can also get tired. And poor George Burns has absolutely nothing to do but repeat Gracie all the time. I don't remember laughing at him once (though he has a great scene with Ruggles, where Ruggles desperately tries to convince George to take Gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while, and one with Fields, where he asks to Fields to sell him a sweater, that piece is exclusively Fields', though). The situation is always fun: the Whinneys are going to California, but to help them with the expenses, George and Gracie are recruited. 8/10.
