John Huston ended his extraordinary career with one of the most perfect and sensitive films I've ever seen. For his farewell, he decided to adapt the beautiful story by James Joyce, "The Dead", and not just one of the most faithful adaptations to literature, but he also made a film that over 20 years later still far surpasses much of contemporary cinema. <br /> <br /> When I saw this film a few years ago, as a student at the University, I watched the screen with admiration, marveling at every aspect of the film: acting, screenplay, direction, costumes, settings, music, cinematography. Thinking about it now, I still can't do anything for which I would criticize him. Huston only knew how to tell a good story. <br /> <br /> A good deal of credit should also go to Tony Huston. He knew better than to meddle in a text that is not only the perfection itself, but already visual enough for the cinema. Father and son let history breathe and savor in the long and fascinating conversations between characters and significant silences. Donal McCann also deserves the credit for his performance as Gabriel Conroy. I had never seen it before in movies, nor did I see it later, but it gave one of the most moving performances I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Overall, The Dead is a beautiful cinematic experience, from a legendary director who has never ceased to be excellent.
