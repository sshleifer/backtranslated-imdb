HUNT FOR JUSTICE is a Canadian television drama that has arrived on DVD and this is a source of gratitude for those who are hungry for educational dramas that inform us of facts from current history that are somehow buried in the media. The film is not a Hollywood production, it relies heavily on films taken from judicial files, but also introduces to many of us the act of heroism of Louise Arbor in completing the trial against Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic. <br /> <br /> Louise Arbor (veteran Canadian actor Wendy Crewson) is a Canadian judge appointed by NATO as Chief War Crimes Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. The film begins in 1996 when Arbor goes to The Hague to address the political obstacles that prevent the Court from bringing to justice the war criminals in the war that Yugoslavia has conducted in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, a war that has clear evidence of crimes against humanity in the form of genocide, death camps and other atrocious abuses. Progress towards delivering criminals to justice is hampered by generals (including one played by William Hurt) who fear a great world war if precautions against him are violated. Arbor, with the help of his translator Pasko Odsak (Stipe Erceg), his staff including Keller (Heino Ferch) and the unexpected assistance of British captain John Tanner (John Corbett), proceeds, concentrating the impossible task of bringing all responsible parties to justice on three specific events. Two of the three main suspects are captured, but during the tests each meets his end. This leaves only Slobodan Milosevic himself, and Arbor and his colleagues managed to bring the justice criminal to justice in 1999. <br /> <br /> There are several tactile outlines used to tell this well-documented story, stories that make the point in the most personal story. Some may find the footage of corpses and prisoners and extermination camps too strong to watch, but they are necessary to bring home the purpose of the film. Wendy Crewson brings the power to take the message home - the message that war crimes should never go unpunished. There is a lot of current history to be drawn from this film: the writers Ian Adams, Riley Adams and M.A. Lovretta have condensed the information and made it dramatic. The director Charles Binam√© balances the docudrama with the progress of history, never forgetting to have a story of intrigue to tell. HUNTING FOR JUSTICE is worth watching! Grady Harp
