this is the film is probably one of the best I've seen so far. I would only put him second to All About Lily Chou-chou because it gives me the same vibrations ... '9 souls' are about 9 prisoners who have just escaped from prison to go and find counterfeit money stored in a capsule time at the School Primary of Mount Fuji. later they discover that there was not much and they leave for their streets. the first half of the film is just a moment to introduce the characters and for the main points to be enunciated. it is a comic but serious part of the journey. the second half moved me to tears. as the film progresses, each character goes and tries to make their dreams come true, but unfortunately it ends up badly. in the end only 2 of the 9 fugitives remained. the way each character left the scene was very sad and you will probably feel the tears in your eyes. a beautiful film directed in a fantastic way. this is a movie for people who have enjoyed Toshiaki Toyoda's other films as "Blue Spring".
