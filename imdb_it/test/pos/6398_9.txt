"MY WIFE AND CHILDREN", in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I didn't see every episode, but I still liked it. There are many episodes that I liked. One of these was the place where Junior (George O. Gore II) obtained a driving license. If you want to know why, you will have to have seen it for yourself. Before concluding, I would like to say that everyone has always given a good performance, the design of the production was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, even though it can now be seen in syndication, I strongly advise you to take it in case it goes on air forever.
