Shepitko is the wife of Russian filmmaker Elem Klimov, who directed the best-known 1984 film COME AND SEE, generally considered one of the most realistic war movies ever, none of which, notable for its burning poetic intensity, but I think you lack the inner complexity of this even bigger Russian film, which examines not only the external graphic horrors, but finds really stimulating images centered on individuals or small groups of characters that reflect the absolute madness that takes place within these beings human, whose term is simply awe-inspiring. The bullets are flying and the bodies are dying in a shootout focused on the credits, where the intensity of the film never stops for the duration, focusing on gloomy faces, soldiers consumed with almost nothing to eat, a population terrified under occupation, hungry children with petrified mothers, all immersed in an immense landscape of endless white snow. Like CRANES ARE FLYING (1957), this represents a retreating Russian army, a shock traumatizing at the beginning of the war when they were almost wiped out. The Russian campaign has been invaded by German Nazis who are terrorizing citizens, stealing the food they have, forcing them to become their informed eyes and ears. What Russian soldiers are left hidden under forest cover, but they are forced to send food shipments to nearby farms. This film follows two soldiers who from the beginning are on an almost impossible mission, since there is little food left in the middle of winter. One is healthy and fit, Vladimir Gostyukhin in the role of Rybak, while the other, Boris Plotnikov in the role of Sotnikov, is slowed down by a tubercular cough and finally by a bullet in his leg that almost leaves him dead, but his companion save heroically. As they pass through the knee, the deep snow descents, crawling in some places with insufficient protection against hard elements, like so many other Russian films, nature itself becomes their hardest enemy. <br /> <br /> Spoiler !! Everything is reduced to a question of survival. When they reach their destination, the farm was demolished and left in a state of rubble, pushing forward into the occupied German territory where the next farm is manned by an elderly Soviet collaborator who fears Nazi retribution. The partisan soldiers consider him a coward but they go ahead, where they are captured and taken to a Nazi camp in a nearby town and held prisoner, along with a proud and protective mother (Lyudmila Polyakova) who helped them hide them. The fearless Tarkovsky Anatoli Solonitsyn appears as Portnov the interrogator, a Russian teacher from a nearby academy became a Nazi sympathizer. The Russians who torture and execute the Russian comrades are the depth of the depravity of the war and Solonitsyn is brilliant in the despicable role for which he is perfectly suited. From what we can see, while the Nazi officers chat jovially in close proximity to each other, he is also a stranger in this group, seen instead as a kind of creepy gravestone with a black cloak that routinely sends men to their graves . The public is not spared from witnessing acts of torture on Sotnikov, who offers nothing but contempt, while Rybak speaks freely, hoping to save his life, but both are doomed to die, even if Rybak is offered the opportunity to serve the Reich German as a police officer. The mother, the elderly collaborator and a child are added to this group, spending a night together where they discuss the merits of a soldier's mission, of being a patriot, a mother, a coward or a collaborator. Everyone seems to be driven individually by a desperate need to survive, but Sotnikov offers himself as a selfless example, trying to confess his guilt to spare others, where the title appropriately chosen reflects his spiritual redemption. <br /> <br /> The next morning, Portnov seems amused, making fun of their sudden willingness to speak, but he spares no one except Rybak, who changes sides to maintain life, rationalizing in his thoughts that if he is alive, at least he has the chance to escape. But there is no escape from this torment. What happens is shown with exquisite delicacy and poetic grace, as we witness the betrayal of war without a single shot being fired, while the execution by hanging is transformed into a public spectacle, where the villagers at a gun point are forced to witness . The heart-rending rhythm and intensity of this film are relentless, since there is never a moment without imminent threat, beautifully filmed by Vladimir Chukhnov (who died in the same car accident as Shepitko), characterized by perfectly composed landscapes and lots of camera movement, much of close range using portraits, especially that of a fierce young boy who eventually looks at the doomed men, who creates a surreal bond with the next wordless generation, accentuated by Alfred Shnittke's psychologically horrible music that resembles transcendental monolithic music, but which ferociously disturbs Kubrick 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968). The sound design of this film is highly advanced and unique, where the use of off-screen sound continuously exposes the nerves of each moment, the barking dogs, the blowing wind, the bullets, the chatter of the Nazis in the untranslated Germans or sadistically laughing at their impotence, which hastens the horrible tension to crazy heights. In many ways similar to Dreyer's THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC (1928), here the absolute madness is exposed, the unstoppable realization that you have no choice, yet you are forced to make one anyway. The inner nightmarish thoughts are finally expressed without words, where the nobility of the dead speaks, where voices continue to reverberate inside the heads of the living as an explosion of endless echoes, but only silence fills the cold air and sparkling with a mournful reverence and a profound sense of loss.
