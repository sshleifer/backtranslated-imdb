I don't understand why this show did not go ahead there could have been various ways to continue on the Darwin and Farik line after the second season, obviously Darwin could not be the UC agent infiltrating the cells and sabotaging them from the inside , but in any case they should have given this show at least for another season. <br /> <br /> The show is well thought out, credible and sees the Islamic religion from both a normal and an extremist point of view. It touches on controversial topics in detail and has a dramatic meaning that can be said of very few shows nowadays. I'm really sad for not having known about this show until the end of 2007.
