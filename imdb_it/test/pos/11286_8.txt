Begotten is certainly an experience and an extraordinary experience. The use of color is fascinating and sometimes frustrating. VERY difficult to understand what happens on the screen. Your point of view is obscured by a sudden bizarre change of color and tone, characters in the way and random cuts towards the sky. The sound is very obsessive and a welcome addition. It really helps the nihilistic and hopeless tone that suffocates this film. <br /> <br /> As far as Begotten is concerned, the "rat environment and rebirth" theory seems to me to be quite accurate. But I wouldn't spend much time focusing on meaning, it's practically irrelevant. It is clear that the director did not want to explain anything. He simply presents it as it is and if you want to look for a meaning that depends on you. <br /> <br /> Watching Begotten is definitely not a walk in the park, but I was fascinated by the opening. It's really like watching a person's worst nightmare. What we see is sometimes distressing and very unpleasant, but there is a surreal dreamlike beauty. If you are an art-house / experimental enthusiast and haven't yet seen Begotten, make it a priority. I doubt I'll ever forget it. I know I won't.
