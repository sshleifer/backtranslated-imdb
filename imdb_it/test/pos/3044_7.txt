Pat Conroy's autobiographical book "The Water Is Wide" turns out to be a Southern Up The Down Staircase, but despite the teacher-against-odd formula, "Conrack" really does move the public with every little discovery and creative flash. These students (uneducated black children on an island off South Carolina) are actually shown while they are learning, and their collective innocence with wide eyes is extraordinarily sweet. The only real actress in the group (Tina Andrews, an incredible performer) plays the "tough guy" that Conrack has to break, and once he falls under his charm, everything looks like child's play. But the story is not ready for a happy ending, and I was not prepared for the quiet simplicity of the ending. It is well done. The script fades from time to time, but director Martin Ritt is very adept at always resorting to the solid presence of Jon Voight. Scenes like the one in which he drives in his van by venting his frustrations on a loudspeaker do not add up to much, but the whole film is full of episodes that arouse emotions, and the actual ending is their payoff. ** 1/2 of ****
