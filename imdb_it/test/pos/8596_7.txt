I've never read a novel by Jacqueline Susann, but I've also seen Valley of the Dolls, based on another one of her books. On both occasions I thought that the film is probably better than the book and will improve further with age (certainly contrary to books). The reason is that a film focuses more on a specific style in fashion, design and behavior models. And in this aspect The Love Machine offers a lot. The setting fits the story perfectly. And all the characters fit themselves too. They are perfect in the way they complete a well balanced overall picture. They are superficial and do not develop, it is true, but in this film I would not want it to be different. <br /> <br /> David Hemmings takes up the role he played in Antonioni's Blow Up. And it's more than a rip-off. He is a fashion photographer, he seems visibly aged and seems to be starting to go semi. Robert Ryan takes up the role he played in Max Oph√ºl's film, Caught, is again Smith Ohlrig, greedy, bored and boring, uninspired and uninspiring. It is possible that Ryan did not want to be in this photo and act accordingly, on the other hand he could have thought a lot about his part and then given a carefully studied performance. Whatever happened, it adapts to the image. Dyan Cannon is fantastic (fantastic wardrobe!), He dominates every scene he is in and is involved in the two highlights of the film: the burning of a luxurious bed and the demolition of the Hemmings character with an Academy Award statuette. <Br /> <br /> The title, The Love Machine, is, of course, understood ironically. Robin Stone is a kind of Barry Lyndon of the pop era (incidentally, the film is slightly kubrickysh). Whether he chooses a TV station to make his way to the top seems to be a simple coincidence. He sees love (that is, sexual favors) only as a means of personal progress. There are rather frightening signs of a tormented sexuality that are not explored in the film. Homosexuality is treated very casually, probably not the standard for the mayor's films of the period. The open cynicism of TV executives should not fear confrontation with other good films on the subject such as A Face in the Crowd or Network or Truman Show. They are sucking, I agree between them it's crap and they know they'll make a lot of money with it. <br /> <br /> I have not regretted having spent the strange 108 minutes with this film and I would not be surprised if it has collected a cult following, as long as it has the possibility (ie a DVD version).
