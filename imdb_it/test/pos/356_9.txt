I saw what I believe is the best Australian film of the year so far, Jon Hewitt's Acolytes. <br /> <br /> Accoliti is an elegant thriller with a killer premise. Take this? Two molested and molested teenagers discover a local serial killer in their suburb And then they start to blackmail him to kill the bully who molested them. Hewitt chose a first-rate cast including excellent newcomers Sebastian Gregory, Josua Payne and Hanna Mangan Lawrence to play the boys. Add to that three, yes, this is right for three great psycho! Directed by Joel Edgerton in an extraordinary performance by the serial killer du jour, Belinda McClory, her deranged wife and Michael Dorman in the role of the rapist bully, with swastika-shaped tattoos. Once you add these guys and these menacing adults, does hell break loose? Hewitt has made a serial thriller with balls on the wall, which is damn original and accomplished. You can see the influence of Larry Clark and the Twin Peaks of David Lynch, but Hewitt does it all by himself, in suburban water on the outskirts of Qld, always resonating with the drones of emptiness. The screenplay by Shayne Armstong, Shane Krouse and Hewitt is narrow. <br /> <br /> If marketed correctly, this film could be a hit for teenagers. The next Wolf Creek? It could very well be. It makes all the right moves. Teenagers are royals Larry Clark wing. They do not suck and have a connected PC program, they are not communicative, beautiful and fashionable. The killers are dark with real threat. Joel Edgerton steals his scenes like the mild local Ted Bundy, which sports a butterfly on its 4WD spare wing John Fowles The Collector. Dorman's gasoline head rapist pours into the threat of Suburban Mayhem and provides a terrifying hooligan who can't wait to see the farm buy. <br /> <br /> The film is fast, tough and brutal. Not only that, he shows confidence and direction from Hewitt that will surely evaluate him a nomination to IF or AFI, if not prize! His nuanced and poetic mise en scene, brilliant sound design, excellent cinematography and narrow structure distinguish him as one of the best Oz films I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> The film leaves you shaken, thinking and unstable. It is indeed a great edition for the return to the current genre in Australian cinema at the moment. It will surely win the interest of Hollywood. Oh, and did I mention that he arrived in Toronto? What other Oz feature films can say so much? The world should prepare for a new author, Jon Hewitt.
