The rhythm of the film is slow in parts, but if you can tune in with its languid speed and long silences, then it's a satisfying piece of polite intrigue. The story of China's first emperor, his childhood sweetness and the personal cost of power. The film is very suggestive, the ceremony and the courteous and extremely polite and courteous ritual are in contrast with the sudden brutal violence. Shot in a way that evokes shadows and cold spaces. The battle scenes are rare and brief, the focus is on the battle within the individual over what is right to do and if the ends justify the means. The emperor's journey from the peacemaker idealist to the ruthless tyrant aims to be subtle, but gives little background or convincing insight into the Emperor's motivation, indeed his actions and goals do not really change in everything, only the attitudes of Gong Li towards of him they are altered. The most interesting exhibits are those of Gong Li and the titular murderer who re-evaluate when to fight, when to retire, when to kill. The most expensive film ever made in China at the moment, the Emperor and the Assassin is not based on hysterical emotions or great battles, but rather a gloomy atmosphere of threat and inevitability. Gong Li fans will not be surprised to hear that he is extraordinarily beautiful as always, offering a discreet performance.
