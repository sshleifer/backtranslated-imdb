It is characteristic that this film is no longer known. Obviously, most of the elements a successful film needs are missing: heroes, criminals, conflicts and resolution, romantic love interests. <br /> <br /> Here everything is upside down, nothing works as it should, everyone is clumsy, sad, angry, hurt and hungry and no one has a solution for nothing. In short: it is war and it is hell for everyone. People try to do better, but interests, alliances and the so-called duty interfere. The image takes us back in time to the civil war with an intensity rarely seen in today's cinema. Direct honest images of intense beauty. The actors are very well expressed for the story and make the characters really alive before our eyes. <br /> <br /> A silver dollar in a pile of coins!
