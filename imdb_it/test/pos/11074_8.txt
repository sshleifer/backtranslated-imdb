This is a very realistic film. It's the most realistic I've seen about urban youth. The actors were fantastic. I'll look for more Gomez movies. I had never heard of the movie until someone mentioned it recently. I bought it on DVD. I was impressed I didn't see anything approaching life as I know it in Philadelphia. This is very close - in fact, a scene in which there is an accident (I don't want to spoil and give details), reminded me of an almost identical situation in Philadelphia. At first I thought that Gomez had taken the scene from that real event, but then I realized that he had made the film a few years before that situation. I also agree that this film has not tried to expand its appeal by inserting a Hollywood shit. Gomez also directed "Laws of Gravity" - I can't wait to see it.
