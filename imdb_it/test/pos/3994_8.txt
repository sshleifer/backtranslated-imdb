This film, winning Im Kwon-Taek the best director at Cannes in 2002 (linked to P.T. Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), talks about a nineteenth-century Korean painter with common roots and a significant impact on Korean painting. One of the strengths of the film is that Im trying to help us see with the eye of a painter, so we see more scenes and objects that help our drunk painter friend, Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik), to receive inspiration. <br /> <br /> The costumes and art direction are all impressive and the acting continues to be good. It is not a film that moved me, but it was what made me think about art and what it means to find your voice in it. It is really beautiful. It is also interesting to see a version of Korea in those days just before the turn of the century, where the Chinese and Japanese powers are both in Korea and the kingdom of Chosun is coming to an end. More than one revolution and political ideology are gathered in the film, but they are never the center. It is firmly about the painter. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is a well-made film about the life of a painter. But it doesn't have exactly the regular plot in three acts, so you have to be able to take a non-standard Hollywood story to watch it. Yay for art! 8/10
