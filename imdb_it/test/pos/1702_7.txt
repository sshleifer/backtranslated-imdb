I have just finished a double movie night with An American Werewolf in London and Paris. Allow me to start by saying that "London" continues to hold out after all these years and the transformation sequence is of any level quite impressive, the film was fun, and scary, even a little gore .... Now comes to "Paris "It's funny, some scars, a lot of blood not as exciting or disturbing as it is original, but it has some laughs in what has become quite fashionable these days in movies, so maybe in that sense it was ahead of its time, the transformations "A good CGI for the technology of its time is nowhere near as impressive as the original. I gave this film a 7 because I have to admit it was fun, I laughed a lot and found Tom Everett Scott so foolish that in the beginning I wanted to hate his performance only to end up enjoying him ... go figure .. Julie Delpy was competent as was the direction in which the script lacked a bit of shine and finesse. read here that John Landis should have been heading for evil, but I'm not sure it would have been a completely different film. I also noticed some discussions about a "What If" sequel, but no one noticed that Ovvio should be in America and here is my title "An American Werewolf Goes Home" or in Washington that it would be fun for all those political dogs to need of a good fright. You simply have to see the original in its new DVD transfer with dolby 5.1 audio and see them both on an HDTV with upconvert turned on ... nice !!!!
