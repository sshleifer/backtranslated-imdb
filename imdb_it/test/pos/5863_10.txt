This film is perhaps one of the most creative horror works of all time. It has everything you could want ... suspense, drama, comedy, confused subplots, native Americans, eating brain ... If you're looking for the all-end, end of all hypocritical movies, look no further. The story of a man, determined to take revenge. And how best to get it? "I know, I'll suck the brain!" With great sound effects and awesome special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.
