First of all, nothing can ever be compared to the original film, but for God's sake, they are not trying. It's just a person's opinion of what might have happened after Rhett left Scarlett to Tara. I was the first to think it was a fantastic film and I would like to add it to my GWTW collection. The scenery alone would make me want to watch the movie. Just look at this movie as an extension of the original and don't think they're trying to replace Vivian Leigh and Clark Cable and you'll have a great time. They really captured Scarlett's spoiled selfishness in many scenes and you can see from Rhett's desire to be clearly in love with Scarlett. The fact that you can recognize many of the actors in the film is another advantage, even though some of them have only been seen on TV. I always wanted them to have other kids after Bonnie Blue died in the movie and that perfectly suited my need. <br /> <br /> Lore60
