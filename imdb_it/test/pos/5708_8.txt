THE NURSING STUDENT is not a typical sexploitation film. Of course, nudity and sexual openness are there, but it's not all about laughter. Stephanie Rothman has written a socially compelling and well-written tits and ass that address issues such as racism, socio-economic inequalities, rape, abortion, medical ethics, public health problems, human rights, the Vietnam war, free love, LSD and drug experimentation. Four sexy college mates are doing their infirmary internship at the same time. Sharon (Elaine Giftos) is assigned to the terminal care department, Lynn (Brioni Farrell) to the public health administration, Priscilla (Barbara Leigh), gynecology and Phred (Karen Carlson) to psychiatry. These four beauties have ample opportunities to undress and fornicate, of which they take advantage, to the great joy of male spectators. These are women freed at the height of the sexual revolution, after all, and they are as intelligent as they are excited and beautiful. Visceral but low-budget sequences are interspersed everywhere. There is a bloody fire fight in the headquarters of the resistance movement in which two policemen are killed and shot together with several members of the group. A protest against the war (in Vietnam) composed of young ghostly clothes of all races painted like skeletons becomes violent, with policemen beating the protesters. The effective travel sequence on the beach consists of beautiful, strange and confused sensory and memory montages with hyper-sensual nuances. In short, THE STUDENT NURSES is a thoughtful and compelling reflection of the times, expressed through the true perspectives of women (since it was written and directed by a woman). But it's still fun and titillating, despite the thought-provoking treatment.
