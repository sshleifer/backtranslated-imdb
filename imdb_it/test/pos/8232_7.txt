After cleaning up Dodge City (with a little help from Wyatt Earp), Bat Masterson goes to Liberal, Kansas, where he has a good war for the range. Plus a rather interesting sharecropping scheme. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is Bat Masterson and he is behind the bad Billy House and Steve Brodie who are leading the farm owners off their farms. The families they are taking away are in a sharecropping scheme funded by Robert Ryan. It seems that the various farmers are aiming at a plot of land to get to the farm for a percentage of profit from their harvest. Ryan is about to lose his shirt because of all the cheating. <br /> <br /> As played by Scott, Bat Masterson is a standing western hero who has the passion to go east and become a reporter that we all know he did later in life. <br /> <br /> Anne Jeffreys and Madge Meredith are involved in a romantic subplot involving Brodie and Ryan, which is a bit silly and distracts the action. Anne Jeffreys instead sings well. <br /> <br /> Obviously Gabby Hayes always provides a great comic relief. <br /> <br /> A good addition to Randolph Scott's western collection. Also interesting because his latest western films don't have it as a white hat like the one here. <br /> <br /> This review is dedicated to Kasey Hayes of Bull Bull professionals who is a proud inhabitant of Liberal, Kansas, a city with a great tradition, whether Bat Masterson would gather there or not.
