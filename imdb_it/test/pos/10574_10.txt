It is always difficult to bring a book of 450 pages in a three-hour film. I read the book first and found the BBC production that dealt with this difficulty in the best possible way. The qualities of the book were not lost: the dense and lively representation of a family of blacksmith artisans in London in 1860, the cold and obscene cruelty in which Maud grew up, the characterization of different social groups with different ways of speaking, the unexpected and surprising twists in the story, the way in which the film makes viewers different in the same scenes when they are told first from Sue's point of view and then from Maud's. The main actors do very well, and in particular the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed, with a first climax in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgive all the evil they were ready to do and do each other, because they still love each other. <br /> <br /> For each of her books the author, Sarah Waters, thoroughly investigated what life was like in the nineteenth century British. While in Tipping the Velvet it was the world of vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements, in Affinity the terrible reality of penitentiary women and the evocation of spirits, in Fingersmith he paints the public hanging ceremony in London and the inhuman treatment of alleged or declared disturbed people in asylums based on reading sources and scientific research. This is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high degree of historical truth. I highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful Victorian atmosphere, vivid emotions and suspense.
