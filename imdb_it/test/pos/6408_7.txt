Compared to this, Tarkovsky is a speed freak. <br /> <br /> Compared to this, Bela Tarr is MTV. <br /> <br /> Compared to this, the film "Russian Ark" is a roller coaster ride. <br /> <br /> I have just described 3 of the sllllowwwwwesssstttt experiences I've ever known, and this is the best of all. But he's not saying it's bad. On the contrary, I really liked it. But it was a thankless job. <br /> <br /> I will not describe the plot, because you can easily find it elsewhere. Suffice it to say that the plot is INSANE. It is one of the most creative and bizarre ideas from "Becoming John Malkovich". I think the interesting plot is the main reason why I kept nodding (even humor was beautiful. It's something we rarely see in slow and artistic films). <br /> <br /> Here we see a bizarre reversal of the norm. Most films have little plot and little substance; yet they fill 90 minutes with lots of captivating images to keep us fascinated. But "The Hole" has 100% plot / theme without much eye candy. In this regard, I suppose it is a truly intellectual experience, very similar to reading a maliciously wordy novel like "Vanity Fair" by Thackaray (which I have NEVER been able to finish!). <br /> <br /> If you have tremendous attention, I think you will like this movie very much. Despite his molested rhythm, he is very creative and imaginative. It is like Jean-Pierre Jeunet on the quaaludes and with a gray and dusty chamber lens. Good luck.
