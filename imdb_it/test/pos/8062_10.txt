As much as Schindler's List was, I found this film much more powerful as it is a documentary and based on real life. It describes in detail the history of the Frank family, and Anne in particular. Although at the beginning it is a bit slow (detail of family life before the war); it becomes very powerful. <br /> <br /> Due to some of the filming and photos of the camps, I would not recommend it to children but to adults, illustrating the horror of the Holocaust through a girl. Highly recommended.
