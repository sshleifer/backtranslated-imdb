Any film about the Second World War made during the Second World War by a British production company does not, in my opinion, be compared between the last few days, respectfully. The confluence of so many close and dear things to my heart are in At Dawn We Dive: as a descendant of Admiral Horatio Nelson and a student of all aspects of the Second World War and in particular of the naval war, I prefer the depictions of submarines and actions in the North Atlantic and especially those that include the German side of things. For those who do not know the target priorities, an attack on an enemy warship is the biggest event a submarine can hope to meet and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similar to what we see here. The rhythm is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of the Ealing, Rank and British-Gaumont studies throughout the day: frankly, I prefer his more calm, more cerebral approach to his humanity and realism, which engages much better than any Hollywood overproduced movie could never. This reminds me of Powell and Pressburger of The 49th Parallel thanks to the powerful convincing Eric Portman, one of my favorites. John Mills receives the second billing and a smaller font in the titles, so this is clearly meant to be Mr. Portman's movie, but the whole cast shines. Regarding the title sequence, am I the only one who is completely fascinated by Gainsborough Production's beautiful Gainsborough Girl pre-CGI?
