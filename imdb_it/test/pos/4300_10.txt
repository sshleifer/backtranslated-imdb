This is a sensational film. Raw and in sublime movement. It seemed a very compelling and intelligent theatrical game (but without the excessively theatrical feeling that one feels from watching people on a stage) that plays on everyone's terror of a white lie that rises to monstrous consequences. All the main players are mesmerizing. Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end ... and everyone else judges by the amount of fiddling for handkerchiefs and hands that rise between males and females. Julian Fellowes has triumphed again. It is a national treasure. Gosford Park, Vanity Fair, Mary Poppins ... and now this. Can't go wrong? GO AND WATCH! This is a movie for real adults.
