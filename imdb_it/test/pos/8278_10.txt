If you are a child of the 80s and you have not seen this film, you have never been a true son of the 80s. How can you not love those fantastic squirrels (don't forget the chippette), the lines and the songs. Years later I can still sing every word for each song. The plot is fantastic and much better than today's children's movies. It's just pure fun and worth the rent, even if you grew up.
