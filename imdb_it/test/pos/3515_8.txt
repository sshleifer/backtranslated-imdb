I didn't have high expectations on Just Before Dawn. I don't know why I keep buying these slasher movies when I know it's still the same. Maybe I'm a little masochist? Anyway, I'm glad I bought this. Yes, it's the same. No, it has nothing original. Yes, it's a small group of teenagers who go to the woods to camp, drink and have sex. Yes, they are killed one by one by a maniac. And you know what? It's just magic! It's one of the best experiences I've seen watching a slasher movie. The places where it is shot are so wonderful. See mountains, waterfalls, rocky mountains. It's just great. It takes a long time (except for the opening scene) before the killer starts killing, but I didn't care! It was fun to watch enough not to worry. What I mean is that you won't be sitting there waiting for the murders to start because everything that happens is nice because of the beauty of the movie itself. The ending is a bit strange, but I won't tell you anything else. You will know what I mean. Another thing I liked: you care about the characters. I'm not just a group of jerks who spend time complaining to each other. Of course, they are pure stereotypes of the usual slasher characters, but there is something special about them. Anyway, it's a great horror movie and I hope you'll have a great time watching it because I really did it!
