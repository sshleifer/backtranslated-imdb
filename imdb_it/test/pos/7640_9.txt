I don't see why all people are giving this movie negative reviews?!?! I loved this movie! Bled is a form of abstract art, and if you don't appreciate art, I understand why you won't like this movie. It was a big turning point compared to the media, played by a vampire movie. If you're looking for a new new, brilliant, new vampire movie then this is for you. But if you want one of them to turn into bats, wolves and melt into the movies of sunlight, then go watch your old Dracula movies. Sure, it's a little low budget, but they did a great job with the budget they had. I am very happy to have found this movie because I was going to give up the vampire genre for good. I thought this movie was brilliant! I give the screenwriter, director and everyone involved in the film 2 inches.
