Twins Effect, played by some of HK's most famous stars, offers one of the most entertaining cinematic experiences coming out of Hong Kong. It has something for everyone, action, comedy, horror, romance and some drama. This film cannot be taken too seriously, otherwise you would be disappointed, but if you leave your brain at the door and watch the movie for some fun, you are bound to have fun. <br /> Big effects, excellent action, cute Twins, fantastic HK actors, FUN movies! <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to everyone!
