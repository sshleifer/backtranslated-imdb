Of course, there are some scenes in this film that seem a bit unrealistic. The charming woman first panics and then, only a few minutes later, starts kissing the boy while the old man is right next to her. But as the film progresses, we learn that she is a girl who is not very volatile (or slutty) and that partly explains her behavior. The cinematography of this film is well done. We see the elevator from almost every angle and perspective, and some of those images and scenes really increase the tension. GÃ¶tz George plays his character well, an aspiring hot-shot that ages and is overwhelmed by young people like the character of Jaennicke. Wolfgang Kieling, whom I admired in Hitchcock's THE TORN CURTAIN, offers a great performance that, although he doesn't say much, is by far the best actor in this play. One critic complained about how unrealistic the film was and that in a real emergency case nothing would have happened. But then again, how realistic films like Mission impossible or Phone Booth are. Since we are talking about a movie here, and that in a movie you are always dealing with scenes that don't happen much in real life, you can still enjoy this movie. It's much better than many things I see on German TV these days and I think the 80s vintage style added something to this movie.
