I have just this adaptation of the book Anne Rice. While most of the film is shot here in Australia, it offers a great deal of scenery and a fantastic area to shoot. Lestat (Stuart Townsend) has recently awakened from a long sleep and decided to betray his vampire oath by revealing himself to a band. When he becomes an icon of the popular film, his fellow vampires, inadequately, go crazy and plot his death. Meanwhile Jesse (Marguerite Moreau), an orphan member of supernatural studies, who has an ancient family tree of vampires, became deeply obsessed with Lestat. His boss David (Paul McGann) understands his obsession and reviews his obsession with the vampire Marius, (Vincent Perez) who is an ancient vampire and the man who made Lestat even a vampire. Jesse is given the diary of Lestats and reads of his first killing and meeting with the Queen of the Damned - Akasha (Aaliyah). When Lestat holds a concert in Death Valley, he receives the news that not only will the angry vampires be there, but Akasha could also come. Meanwhile, Akasha has other plans. He goes to a coven of vampires, a bar, and kills everyone on his way. With Lestat tempted by the royalty and loving care of Akasha, the ancient vampires of Marius and Jesses Zia Maharet (Lena Olin) are plotting against them. Join her or die? <br /> <br /> I thought the film was fantastic, it had fantastic fight scenes, great music and fantastic locations. Aaliyah has sadly disappeared in a plane crash just before the film's premiere, but he looked amazing on set and off the set. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10/10 because it was a fantastic movie and I urge you to see it!
