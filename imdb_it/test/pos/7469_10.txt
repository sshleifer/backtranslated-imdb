Very well written, recited and filmed. Violent, but not too much. Whoever changed it knew exactly what he wanted to portray. There is no scene wasted on this film. "The Usual Suspects" was a superb acting together; this is a collection of exceptional individual performances. I rarely buy films, but this is worth owning.
