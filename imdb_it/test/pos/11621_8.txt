The film "... and the earth didn't swallow it", based on the book by Tomas Rivera, is a film that opens the eyes for most people. It speaks of the exploitation that migrant agricultural workers cross to survive. Sergio Perez uses impressionistic techniques to describe Rivera's story. Use the effects of Siena and grayscale to represent some scenes, and use specific photographic techniques to make scenes similar to those that took place in the 1950s. Perez also gives life to the use of music adapted to the time, including balladeering and guitar. <br /> <br /> I think it's a good movie to see because it shows in detail how migrants live, how they behave for entertainment and their beliefs.
