One of the most interesting things is that this 1988 movie is widely advertised as a sequel to "in-name only". There is nothing wrong with that except this: the return of Chevy Chase as Ty Webb. This links the observer to this character (from the original Caddyshack in 1980) and makes fans think that they want Caddyshack II to be similar to the first one. <br /> <br /> It is said that Rodney Dangerfield should have come back. He played most of the first film, so his return would put Caddyshack 2 at the top. Jackie Mason is the "new" Rodney for this film and does a decent job, even if their comic deliveries are very different. Dan Aykroyd was great but not enough in the film. He should have been involved for the amount of time Bill Murray had in the first one. Robert Stack (Airplane!) He was good at the "new" role of Ted Knight / Villian. (We miss you, Ted!) Danny Noonan should have come back. So many others may have returned to show us what happened to their characters eight years later. Bushwood should not have undergone the total makeover he did. Instead, the characters involved, rather than the club itself, should have been the main focus as they were in the first one. When you watch this movie, keep in mind that it's not an important sequel and you might think it's another good or bad 80s comedy. Fans of the former should see it, but don't be shocked when the comparisons between the original and Part II are so far apart.
