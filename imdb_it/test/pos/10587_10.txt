I was waiting to see this movie for so long and I finally arrived yesterday. In summary, I'm glad I finally did it. Humor is exaggerated. The plot is so incredibly credible that it must have at least some truth to it. If something stands out in this film it is definitely the coffee shop scene. I've been there every kid has. You are downloaded. Find out that your ex has cheated with a guy you are sure is an asshole. Now every time you see something for the next few days you only get horrible thoughts of this place in all the wrong areas. He's fucking everyone and everyone knows it. I could probably watch that man lick and flip through his wallet all day and look back at myself and laugh at being there too.
