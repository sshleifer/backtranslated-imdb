By convincing the Prime Minister to support the completely inadequate Ali G as a candidate in Staines in the local elections, the ugly chancellor David Carlton (Charles Dance) hopes to discredit the current leader of his party, thus allowing him to take power. To his surprise, however, the plan fails, Ali is embraced by the nation, and Carlton is forced to find other ways to try to secure his political future. <br /> <br /> Childish, raw, misogynistic and always outrageous: Ali G Indahouse, the big-screen debut for Sascha Baron Cohen's middle-class Berkshire gangster, is all this and much more, in the sense that it's my kind of movie !! <br /> <br /> Obviously, there are those who simply won't understand the joke, and surely there will be people who find risky jokes about oral sex, homosexuality, recreational drug use, hardcore pornography and regions lower than the Queen in the offensive (needless to say you should stay away from her!), but if you find such a youthful humor that divides amusingly, I'm a Baron Cohen fan in general, or you simply want to see the beautiful Rhona Mitra in her underwear (and you do the shud, because it is well fit!), so I highly recommend to spend an hour and a half in the company of Ali G and West S taines Massive. <br /> <br /> They are wicked!
