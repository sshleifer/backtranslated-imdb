This is a film that will brighten up your day, for sure. Kermit the Frog, it's just a normal frog in his swamp, when a talented agent stops and tells him that Hollywood is looking for frogs in the movie (lol). On the road, Kermit meets Fozzie Bear, Miss Piggy, Gonzo and his chicken Camilla, Rowlf, The Electric Mayhem, Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker. But Kermit is also the owner of a restaurant chain, Doc Hoppers French Fried Frog Legs. Despite everything, Kermit and the Muppet arrive in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This film is recommended for everyone, young and old. <br /> <br /> It has some wonderful musical numbers, like "The Rainbow Connection:" I'm Going to There There Someday "and" Movin Right Right ". The Muppets also use many forms of transport in this movie: Kermit drives a bike, Fozzie drives a Studebaker and another car, Bizzarri takes off with a bundle of helium balloons, (which is one of my favorite moments, by the way;)), and Kermit and the rest of the Muppets finally do the rest of the way with the Electric Mayhem bus (Dr. Teeth, Floyd, Janice, Scooter and Animal) that meet in the desert after Fozzie's car breaks down. <br /> <br /> Also some Muppets of Sesame Street they have cameo appearances (that is, Big Bird walks along the road, on the way to New York to break into public television.) The end is also a very moving moment: every single Muppet created is in the final scene, alg with a shot final of "Rainbow Connection". <br /> <br /> But those poor Muppets worked like this Ã¬ harshly on their movie set, then everything comes crashing down and the camera explodes in a huge ball of sparks. You would think that everything is ruined and destroyed, but in the end the rainbow shines through the roof and summarizes the magic of this film, and you know that everything will be fine. <br /> <br /> Perfect 10/10. Watch it and you will be enchanted by the fun and sadness of this movie.
