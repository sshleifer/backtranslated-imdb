Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson were fantastic in this film / musical. Andrews' opening song, "Whistling Away the Dark", will always be in the back streets of my mind. The plot during the First World War is large and full of suspense. If you are a romantic, you will love this movie. This is a film that I always enjoy seeing again and again.
