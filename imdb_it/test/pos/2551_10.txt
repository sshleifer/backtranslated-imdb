Chop Shop, Ramin Bahrani's second feature film, is a rare breed. It is an American film that tells a story that is not usually found in American cinema, the story of a minority living in poverty. It is a work of simple beauty. Shot on location in Queens, New York, in the shadow of Shea Stadium, Chop Shop is the neo-realism in the center. Characterized by a cast of non-actors, it has more elements in common with the classic Ladri di biciclette of Vittorio De Sica, than any other product in the United States. There is no score or soundtrack, all the music and sounds are diagonal. Watching it seems to watch a great foreign film, it takes us to another world because it is so rare to see. However this other world is not the Rome after World War II or Istanbul or New Delhi, it is the contemporary New York City. <br /> <br /> Bahrani tells the story of Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), better known as Ale. He is a 12-year-old Latin American boy with no parents or family units to watch. He lives in a small room upstairs in the car shop where he also works. He shares the same bed with his teenage sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales). None of them passed the second grade. Ale, although young, is hard and mature. Acts as head of the small family. Attracts his sister with a job, and he does everything he can to earn a living when he doesn't work at the chop shop. Sells bootleg DVDs in the streets and sweets in the subways. Look for auto waste parts and sell them to the many auto shops that line the street where you live. <br /> <br /> Alejandro is heartbroken when he discovers that his sister works as a prostitute at night. He himself becomes progressively disinterested in respecting the law. He starts to steal, first car parts and subsequent wallets. Like Antonio, the desperate protagonist of Bicycle Thieves, we can't blame Ale for becoming a thief. It's simply survival. Ale and Isamar save in the hope of buying a grocery van for $ 4,500. They see the van as a way out, and there is a lot of optimism. However, as usually happens in neorealism, we know that this will only lead to disappointment. <br /> <br /> The performance of Polanco is what gives legitimacy to the realism of Chop Shop. Here is a 12-year-old character who must be credibly independent and vulnerable. Whether you run the machines at the store, sell Snickers movies and bars, or play with your sister in their poor room, it's authentic. <br /> <br /> Chop Shop is a reminder that not all American children grow up in a land of opportunity. Ale's lifestyle is what many in the middle class of white America consider the "third world". They act aware of poverty and deprivation in a foreign land while sipping their coffee and reading the New York Times on Sunday mornings, but they become blind with their streets. Once you look at Chop Shop, you will think differently about children selling candy in the subway. <br /> <br /> other reviews on www.mediasickness.com
