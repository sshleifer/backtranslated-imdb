A little appreciated and invisible gem. Estevez does a remarkable job of illustrating in a moving, heartbreaking way, the tension that arises between a child who has been in hell and back, and his parents, who cannot understand the emotional scars left behind. It is not unlike Born on the Fourth July, as it is an emotional and mental breakdown of the soldiers after serving in Vietnam, but while focusing more on post-Vietnam politics (anti-war speeches, etc.), this concerns a much more personal topic: the family. A man's struggle to return to normal after a life-altering experience, and his parents' inability to see the change that has occurred. <br /> <br /> Estevez offers a steaming performance like Jeremy Collier. You can feel the pain and frustration bubbling beneath the surface. There to match it inch by inch is the father of his real life, Martin Sheen. It is a journey to look at these two acts out of one another, since one has the feeling that they are constantly trying to do with one another. It is as if the mutual presence inspired the couple to do its best and their performances triumphed for this. <br /> <br /> Recommended for anyone who appreciates acting, writing and directing. And any fan of Vietnam war. <br /> <br /> **** / ***** (8/10)
