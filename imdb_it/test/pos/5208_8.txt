The film is about the battle of Stalingrad. For those of you who don't know anything about it, it was the worst battle of World War II. Over 1 million people died during the battle. This is the only film I saw that seems to have actually captured how bad things were in the war between Russia and Germany. What I really liked is that the two ideologies (Nazism and communism) were not in the film. Unlike most American films, the Germans are not seen as bloodthirsty killers, but the one who was the average German soldier, a person. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around four soldiers fighting in Stalingrad. They were transferred there to try to take the city. The film follows these men from August 1942 to the beginning of 1943. During this time, they learn about the horrors of war and try to find a way out of the battle. <br /> <br /> Through the whole film, one feels the desperation of the entire battle. Unlike "Enemy at the Gates", the filmmakers did not try to put a sweetened romance or to dress the real events of the battle. This film can be a fiction, but it transmits what happened in the bloodiest battle of the second world war.
