There is all this horror theory that some people adhere strictly to the fact that monsters and violence should be kept off the screen. Park Chan-Wook throws that concept completely out the window and shows directly what it wants - and what it wants to show is pretty much everything it can think of. Leaving it to the actors and to the dialogue to create subtlety, from the stylistic point of view Park seems willing to do practically anything to get his point of view. Whether it is scenes of long ensembles with the camera whizzing around a mah-jong table or entire weeks confined to a single shot between two other scenes, dialogue from the scenes before and after bleeding, Park does not stick to a specifically structured style but focuses more on telling the whole story of a couple's relationship, from virginal repression through complete codependency to complete self-cancellation - and uses vampirism as a connection and priesthood as drama. It is so simple and complex at the same time. <br /> <br /> You must give him credit. Too many people are ready to compare any modern vampire movie with Twilight, since Twilight is almost always the least of the works, but the stories here are actually comparable, but this one is more raw and honest. None of that enters the window during the night to talk about disgust, but everything that goes from the dirtiest, most desperate and shameful sex scene to any conjugal abuse, while the two protagonists begin to compete for power on the other. It's the same deal - boy and girl meet, the girl discovers that the boy is a vampire, decides to join him anyway, but without happiness forever, just right in limited time as they become obliged to keep one the other closer and closer to options. The girl's motivations are particularly interesting as a desperately thirsty for power and attention, by fault, foiled by the boy who just wants to live a good life as best he can, given the circumstances, but he is a hypocrite who cannot admit that he is simply using the his vampirism as an excuse to act against his moral training. <br /> <br /> The film is not perfect and tends to stretch (there are not three acts, five acts or any structure here, only scene after scene of character construction and dysfunctional romanticism), but the fantastic thing is that Park Chan-Wook is willing to show everything frankly and honestly while delighting the horror sensitivity of tension and blood. It also provides a carefully chosen soundtrack to hit the acute emotional notes quite effectively. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
