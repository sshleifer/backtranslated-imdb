the subspecies series will always be the best vampire movie ever. there is something in them that makes them special I think it's the feeling you get when you look at them. <br /> <br /> are set in modern times yet they feel like they are set in the 1700s! s or 1800`s you think it has something to do with the sets that are used so if it works then you will keep the boy :). <br /> <br /> in a quick turn of what happened in the first part - Radu was apparently banned from his homeland years ago by his father and decided to return and take what he thinks his birth ritual is. the bloodstone and the whole father thus kills his father played by Angus Scrimm (the tall man in the movies Phantom). and takes the stone of blood that has an eminent power to those who have ever had it, because whoever needs it must never again kill anyone because the stone is designed to drip the blood of the saints and whenever the Radu takes a drop from it it's going slowly crazy. (this is all we need for a crazy vampire as if a normal vampire wasn't bad enough). Well, Radu's brother, Stephan, tries to stop his evil ways as he tries to stop himself from falling with a tourist who stays in a house / fort that belongs to a friend of his. <br /> <br /> well one thing leads to another and the two brothers collide and you will have to see the movie to see what will happen from here. <br /> <br /> I will review / comment on the other sequels soon. <br /> <br /> the difference between this and buffy is buffy is too commercial and it's not like that, everyone won't like it but this has a much better atmosphere than Buffy's even though Radu doesn't look good like the full wonder Sarah Michelle Gellar :). <br /> <br /> evaluation for this film 10/10 is a fine example of how a vampire movie should be made :). <br /> <br />
