God cuts himself with a razor, after which he gives birth to mother earth, which then gives birth to the sperm of the gods, son of the earth. <br /> <br /> This is an hour and a half movie that describes a dark version of how God created the world. It's surreal, dark and poetic. The most important aspect of the film for me is the graphics. It is shot in a very grainy black and white film, using both slow and normal motion. Sometimes even fast movies and stop-motion. The scenes are long and dragged, which create a very strange mood. No sound was recorded during filming (I think), sound effects were added later, such as criccets, water and other ambient sounds, repeated over and over again. As you can understand, this film is certainly not for the impatient person ... I often thought it was similar to David Lynch's Eraserhead, only this is even more difficult to understand, and even more dragged out, but that's okay for me I like that kind of thing. Surely it's not entertainment (at least it's not the Hollywood type) so if you check it out, I suggest you prepare for it. Be open and save something like the end of 2001: an odyssey in space.
