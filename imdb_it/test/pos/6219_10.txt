This enchanted film is based on a novel by Arto Paasilinna. The bestseller is one of the best books I've read. Here is the story: <br /> <br /> A journalist and photographer one day, Kaarlo Vatanen, decides to leave his past behind and start a new life wandering through the Finnish forests and countryside. With him he has a companion, a young hare hit by a car. Vatanen has to take care of the hare, because he is wounded in the leg, so they start a journey together taking care of each other. <br /> <br /> During their adventures they are almost killed by hunters, they are captured by the police, meet many people and finally arrive in Lapland, where they live in peace, until a group of foreign tourists disturbs their privacy . The hare gets sick and they have to go back to Helsinki to see the vet. <br /> <br /> Vatanen has found an ideal way of living, but modern society tries to tie him to his duties and taxes. In Helsinki Vatanen drank, even got engaged and imprisoned, but in the end he and the hare escaped.
