This concert is the kind of concert that only comes around once every twenty years, Madonna's Confessions in a dance floor era will surely be remembered as one of the high points of her career. He is 48 years old and simply looks divine, keeping up with the dancers who are almost twenty years younger. I am also very happy to report that all the songs were sung live, which is good because it sounds better live. Each song was so unique, the graphics in which it is stunning. The performance of "Live to tell" was fantastic and impressed me, "Isaac" was exotic and wonderful and was rich in political symbolism, the Arab horn, the American eagle released. I particularly liked the rockin performance of 'I Love New York', I almost stood up in my living room and I rejoiced when he told his critics to suck George Bushes ****. And then again I was impressed by the music inspired by the 70s (remix of hell). This deceased Spectacular Concert made me a fan. Verdict: Highly recommended with a Capital H.
