Caddyshack 2 has a terrible reputation, due only to the fact that it is a sequel to a well-kept classic. People have criticized the film for many reasons, but in the end they all refer to the fact that this is not Caddyshack. <br /> <br /> I would begin by saying that we should simply remove Caddyshack from the equation and consider this film for its merits, but I think it would be unfair. The film has a lot in common with its predecessor. The themes related to the class of "snobs versus slob" and the desire to adapt to a class above yours are prevalent here as in the first film. The two things that are really missing here are Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield, who have been replaced by Dan Ackroyd and Jackie Mason respectively. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not trying to argue that Ackroyd approaches Murray in the film, but Jackie Mason is an admirable successor to Dangerfield. It comes as a cross between Dangerfield and Arnold Stang, but without even nibbling too much. I wouldn't say that it's as funny as Dangerfield is in Caddyshack, but there's a lot more to his character and his dilemma in the film. Chevy Chase opens only a handful of times in the film, which is another common complaint. Perhaps these details have not noticed that it appeared only a few times in the first film. For my money, his scenes here are much more fun, even if a little excessive. <br /> <br /> While I'm on the subject, it's really the excess of direction of this movie that lowers it. He turns out to be more embarrassed in his attempts to laugh. Many of the jokes are laborious and the Gopher is definitely excessive, which seems to have taken on a much more anthropomorphic personality and a voice, in case we didn't understand the idea that it would be fun. <Br /> <br /> Even the characters are hammered at home, especially the yuppy smilzi children. Jackie Mason rarely misses a beat, and he is always funny and very funny, but we didn't need the tango sequence at all! The director is clearly not of the same school of thought as Harold Ramis. Not to suggest that Caddyshack was thin, but the jokes here are just a little overcooked, and most of them are unnecessarily embellished with an eccentric musical cue. <br /> <br /> All things considered, this is a funny and stupid movie with something to say about class and identity that very few movies were saying at the time. Don't be put off by the appallingly low rating of IMDb, take a look at yourself.
