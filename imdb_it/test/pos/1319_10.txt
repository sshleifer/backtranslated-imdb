This is my favorite movie and I think it's perfect. Unlike any other movie I can name, I never watch this movie and I think it would have been better if they had changed this or that or anything else. Is this the definition of a work of art? I think so. Every stroke in Mishima is perfect and everything flows from Schrader's script. I've always liked Paul Schrader's work (you can't argue with Taxi Driver and Light Sleeper is a fantastic film), but while his writings often seem to delimit chaos, his style of directing is usually non-existent. This is intentional, I think, because his films usually deal with a quest for redemption and are set in the real world; ugly and hard. His style adapts to his themes while presenting his characters in a simple and realistic way, and allows them to show the public the truth of the situation. Imagine if Schrader had directed Taxi Driver or Bringing Out The Dead instead of Scorsese. But as the protagonists of those two films, while Mishima was the ideal material of Schrader, right wing, vain and in contrast with society, his works were thin and beautiful. In fact, he had a career as a secondary writer as a woman writer, churning out what can reasonably be described as a romantic Pentapoist. So you don't necessarily have to imagine that Schrader was the ideal man to capture the subtlety and beauty of the film. I think the movie shows that it was. The script that helped the fashion divides Mishima into three parts; his life, his death and his mind. His life is represented in black and white, still camera, formal compositions. His death, for which he will always be remembered, is the freehand documentary style. And his mind is represented by the dramatized excerpts of his novels, each of which reveals the mental processes of this complex man, who never wrote a character that was not a reflection of himself. These dramas are beautiful to look at, thanks to Eiko Ishioka's extraordinary production design and Schrader's imaginative set design. In all parts, the acting is superb, especially by Ken Ogata as Mishima, who captures the essential charm, arrogance and narcissism of man. The photography is excellent and contains images that the viewer will keep forever. Finally, the music is simply superb, perfectly corresponding to the images, even if written and recorded before shooting, adapted during the editorial process and then re-recorded. How much music has influenced the filming I don't know, but it is perfectly linked to the image. I have seen many ideas about what various people think the film's theme is, what Schrader is trying to say. You know, big things about life, death, etc. But I don't think the movie is saying anything. Mishima has already said it, the film simply repeats itself.
