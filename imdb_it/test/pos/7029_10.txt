<br /> <br /> When this film was released, I discarded the nonsense of light pop. It was a mistake. <br /> <br /> After repeating the visualizations and seeing a documentary about the making of DIRTY DANCING, discovering the depth of this film certainly increases its appeal. <br /> <br /> DIRTY DANCING is a film about change. The evolving nature of relationships within the family, changes in one's vision of the world during their age, etc. The story takes place in August 1963, the last weeks of the last innocence of innocence for the American people. The many personal changes experienced by the characters reflect the many changes in American society that would have been marked by the assassins of Kennedy and Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Female film-goers loved this film and repeated trips to the homes of films made is the most successful dance film in the world. As a boy I find it very difficult to accept the romantic mating of the final stallion Patrick Swayze with very simple Jennifer Gray. This would be fatal to most romantic dramas, and may even have created the intense aversion expressed by most male critics. <br /> <br /> The film's soundtrack took first place before the film was released. Today it is almost impossible to attend a wedding reception without listening to a DIRTY DANCING song. <br /> <br /> Near the midpoint of the film Baby's mother wakes up and asks Baby's father, "Is something wrong?" <Br /> <br /> Baby's father, the anti-change family member, tries to keep everything that is happening secret. He tells his wife to go back to sleep. However, resisting as you can, change is incontrovertible. DIRTY DANCING is the story of a person who wakes up only in the last moments of our country's last sleep in innocence.
