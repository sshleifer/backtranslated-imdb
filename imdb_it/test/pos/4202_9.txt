Great 1939 film in which John Garfield plays another boxer who becomes a victim when everyone thinks they have committed a murder. The problem is that Garfield's killer and girlfriend, Ann Sheridan, in a short but good performance, are killed while trying to evade the police. <br /> <br /> A crooked lawyer convinces Garfield to flee to New York. Land in Arizona and meet with Dead End Kids .. They were sent there by a funding program to keep them away from further problems. <br /> <br /> Of course, Garfield finds a new love interest but must hide his identity as everyone thinks he was not just the killer but that he was a victim of the car accident. <br /> <br /> May Robson is fabulous as the type of grandmother who runs the place for young rebels. Claude Rains is also effective in the role of the detective who suspects Garfield is still alive and chases him when a picture of him is taken in Arizona. <br /> <br /> The film is really about Garfield's relationship with the boys. While the ending is good, you want to see Garfield return to New York to proclaim his innocence.
