Provocative thought, humiliating representation of the human tragedies of war. A small but altruistic view of a family's interactions with the enemy during the civil war in Kentucky. This film reduces the "glamor" of war; showing its effect not only on the soldier but on the whole family. <br /> <br /> Many films of today show war as an opportunity to highlight the "heroes" and other glamorous features of the war, but few attempts to show the true effect that war actually takes on in a community. This film attempts this by revisiting a person's memory of those days. It is said that this film is a loose translation of a real event, when in reality this film is probably a real reality of hundreds, perhaps thousands of "real events" during the civil war. I highly recommend anyone interested in our civil war to watch this movie.
