Although this film has never achieved commercial fame, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-made artistic expressions often do not get mass appeal. The plot tells a young boy who steals a car and embarks on a surreal and dreamlike adventure with very few bases in the conceptualization of time and space. Therefore, anyone trying to see this film in terms of its conformity to reality will probably be disappointed; it is not intended to be "realistic". It is, however, destined to be metaphorical with an extended symbolism evident to those with superb attention to detail. Furthermore, symbolic representations are left open to interpretation, which can be said of great works of art. Don't be fooled by the cover (if you happen to rent or buy this film) - the film is not what it might seem on the surface.
