I loved this movie but again, I'm a big fan of Cronenberg. If you haven't seen a David Cronenberg movie, this is not a good place to start. Scanner, The Fly, Rabid would be a place to start and then work on Videodrome before checking this. This is definitely one of his best and brings the phenomena of interactive gaming one step further. <br /> <br /> In this game the players connect a bio-engineered game pad through a jack inserted in the spinal cord and come into play directly through their nervous system. It is very difficult to tell you more without giving away the plot and the plot, but suffice it to say that this is a game you will not forget. It is full of slimy Cronenberg bodyworks, a dark and eerie scene populated by a large cast including Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law and Willem Dafoe who take the situation they find themselves in very seriously. These people will do their best to understand the game and then to win. Like his other films, there is no lack of imagination or parts in which you sink your seat, but like a car accident you do not look away. If you liked one of the films mentioned above, then go at all costs and take this.
