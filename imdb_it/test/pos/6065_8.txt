First of all, I'm American - I haven't seen any IMDb commentary on this series from an American user yet. Secondly, I work in the developing television sector. So I mostly melt in the mud that comes out of American broadcast programming. "Unit One" is an example of television that is a return to what I would attribute to 70s-style scripts, in terms of functionality. That is to say, those films made by young auteur who had free rein to make the dramas more realistic and to allow an organic development of the character. It looks more like British stellar dramas like "Cracker" and "Prime Suspect" as does the brilliant Australian "Underbelly". "Unit One" presents autonomous cases that are committed, then solved, every week. The mysteries are not extraordinary or particularly Byzantine. They usually revolve around a single twist, with a clock generally corresponding to the 40 minute mark and the resolution is neatly wrapped in the next 15 minutes. What makes this series a breath of fresh air is that it presents the main characters you are hooked into and that are recognizable from episode 2. These are real, breathing, living characters who have a personal luggage, yet it is not a type of rather irritating baggage That American flotsam like "Grey's Anatomy" or "Desperate Housewives" capsizes. These are realistic individuals whose background is played quietly throughout the series, as if you were working with them daily. After the senseless decade of "CSI", "NCIS" and "Criminal Minds", along with their subsequent spawns, it is really nice to sit and watch friends with whom you want to spend time, as in the case of "Unit One". "The joke, the wooden dialogue without emotions and the excessive risk that those American series I mentioned affect us every week are absurd compared to the nuance and the silent resonance that is obtained with this extraordinary Danish series. I am in episode 7 of the first season, but I've already bought all four seasons and I'm long range If you need explosions and insanely skipped testosterone, along with the music of The Who and the frantic action, with neon and nervous lights, with main characters like ciphers like your main TV viewing diet, I suggest you stay away from this series If you are an adult with a hunger for threatening, moving, reflective and, yes, sometimes straight procedural dramas, I urge you to check this show .
