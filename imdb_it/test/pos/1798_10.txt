Happy Valley Girl 25th Birthday! Great soundtrack, plausible story, wonderful performances ... captures the spirit of the 80s; the jargon of mainstreams and outcasts. A wonderful interpretation of high school life and "gritty center" from a suburban perspective. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack contains songs by Modern English, Felony, Josie Cotton, Sparks, Payola $, Josie Cotton, The Plimsouls, The Psychedelic Furs, Men at Work, The Flirts and Bananarama. <br /> <br /> This film is really Romeo and Juliet (minus the double suicide) set in 1980 in Los Angeles. Julie's dad, played by Frederic Forrest (Sonny Bono, anyone?) Is hysterical as an idealistic hippy dad who wonders how he gave birth to such materialistic offspring. Still, he doesn't judge, he digs ??
