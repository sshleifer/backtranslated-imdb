I lived in that area (Hoboken and Jersey City) for about ten years. This film certainly captures the feeling of that time and place. The dialogue is very good, the music is right and the scenarios are realistic. As another poster said, it looks like a documentary. <br /> <br /> I like the way he humanizes these guys, who probably would have been born in Westchester, but fall into the one where the children fall. It just happens that that area is pretty hard. <br /> <br /> Excessively demonize the cops, but that's to be expected. I would say that even acting is good all round. <br /> <br /> It gives the viewer an idea of ​​how this idiocy was caused and frightened beyond measure. I hope the new mayor of Newark is making progress.
