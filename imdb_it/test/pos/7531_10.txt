Watching this movie, I can't help but draw the comparison between this and Wild Reeds, another thoughtful film about the most popular teenagers. <br /> <br /> Like Wild Reeds, this film is slow and the director wouldn't hurry. So if you want a quick resolution of things, don't look at it. This film is like a slice of life, which imperfectly begins and ends imperfectly. There is no solution for anything, not happy and happy for anyone, just like in real life. <br /> <br /> This film is as real as it sounds. Acting is surprisingly good. The director loves long, really long shots, and the actors and actresses excel at showing subtlety and inner thoughts. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. I almost didn't look at it, but now I'm very glad I did it. It's not a movie for everyone, but if you're willing to let it grow on you, you'll be rewarded. <br /> <br /> 10/10
