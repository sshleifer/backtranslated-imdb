Blade is a fantastic action / thriller that keeps you captured for the entire duration and Wesley Snipes offers what I would say is his best performance. <br /> <br /> This film has everything you would want to achieve in an action / thriller, it has a lot of blood, guts and blood, a bad twisted, disturbed purchase, moments of humor, but above all a very good storyline with lots of twists. <br /> <br /> Theirs is a constant action throughout the film with acrobatics and stunning effects, Wesley Snipes' fighting movement is fantastic. <br /> <br /> This film is in my opinion a must see, Wesley Snipes cool, solid look makes this film and I can't wait for the sequel to start 'BLADE 2' is released next year. <br /> <br /> My IMDB rating - 9 out of 10
