Looking at "Plots with a View" (called "Undertaking Betty" in the United States), I had the feeling that there are more films shot in Wales. This portrays a woman (Brenda Blethyn) in a small Welsh town trying to get away from her cheating husband. So you and the funeral director (Alfred Molina) come up with a plan ... but there will probably be problems along the way. <br /> <br /> I would say that the character of Christopher Walken is the cleanest in the film (how could it not be?). But overall, the whole idea is really very beautiful, stacked for a few moments "uh oh" ... especially the haunted house scene. It's the kind of film I wish I could get in, just to live it. <br /> <br /> Also played by Lee Evans, Naomi Watts and Miriam Margoyles.
