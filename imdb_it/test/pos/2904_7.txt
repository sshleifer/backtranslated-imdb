There are now many DVD movies, but the producers have forgotten some important things for many viewers. The Egyptian, along with El Cid and other favorites of the big screen era, had merit for the great epics of the budget. Many people of my generation learn a lot about the history of Egypt, medieval Spain and even the Incas (the first time I heard from them was a very cheap adventure film with Charlton Heston called The Inca Treasure), the same success to me with Egypt, or Rome, he saw many "bad" epic poems of the time. many production values, excellent use of color (the De Luxe color was brighter and clearer than normal Technicolor), maybe the cast was wrong but, in any case, the film was designed to give us an idea of ​​life in the ancient Egypt and it was in a sense the engine of going out and buying the novel, my Mika Waltari, one of the best, if not the best historical novel ever published. Anding anding was also the soundtrack by Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann. I saw this movie many times when I was a boy, it wasn't the big box office success that the Fox studios wanted to get from The Robe, a huge success, in CinemaScope and Stereo it was a wonderful spit. I have the Lasser Disc version. The only way to see its wdisescreen format. Soon the Hope will appear.
