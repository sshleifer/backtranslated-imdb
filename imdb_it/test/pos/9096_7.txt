Originally I was a Tenacious D fan of their first album and of course I listened to some tracks from The P.O.D. and was rather disappointed. After seeing the film, my opinion was changed. The film is pretty funny from start to finish and I found myself involved even though it was really a stupid storyline due to the attitudes that KG and Jaybles play in the film. <br /> <br /> Much more fun and entertaining than the movies I've seen in theaters lately. former. I saw III (boring and enthralling), Casino Royale (the homo-erotic way) that in previous versions I really enjoyed <br /> <br /> If you liked Borat, you will enjoy the fairy tale of The Greatest Band on Earth
