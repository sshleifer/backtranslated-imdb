This film was much better than I expected. After a couple of Will Smith movies that weren't as great as me, Robot, he went back to being nice and funny in that. Smith plays, Hitch, a doctor of the date. Most of the film revolves around him teaching Albert how to be himself and to have a date with Allegra Cole, a rich and famous celebrity he works with. Albert is a klutz and goof and always tripping on his feet or what not. All Hitch does is teach him how to behave in a cooler way and not be so nervous about Allegra. <br /> <br /> During all this, Hitch meets Sara, a gossip journalist who has sworn men. Hitch bewitches her, so of course they come out. But, Hitch can teach other kids how to make the girl fall in love, he doesn't believe in love itself. He has never had a girlfriend since he was discharged to university. But, he likes Sara, so he continues to follow her. Sara's friend is injured by the guy who thinks he went to the doctor. So Sara tracks down the doctor, just to learn her hitch. So obviously, she thinks she's a pig. Then it's up to you to explain to Sara and Allegra what she does, so both end up forgiving. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Well, he has laughter and it's fun. I advise.
