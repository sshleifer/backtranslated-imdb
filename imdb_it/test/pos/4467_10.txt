This is Lucio Fulci at his best. If only all the films he made were like this. <br /> <br /> This extraordinary film is as intriguing as "The bird with the crystal plumage" by Dario Argento ... <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Argento but don't like movies by Lucio Fulci, such as "The Beyond", "Manhattan Baby", "The House by the Cemetery", etc. this has nothing to do with the others ... this is what the Italians call "yellow" ... it would be a "who-did-it" movie in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> You won't know who the murderer is until the last moments of the film. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, there's the plot: some maniacs who live in a small village start killing kids ... A journalist (Tomas Milian), a sexy young woman (Barbara Bouchet), a priest (Marc Porel), his mother (Irene Papas) and a witch (Florinda Bolkan) are the protagonists of this intricate and bloody plot. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the actors, I mean that Tomas Milian is superb (as always), and Florinda Bolkan is formidable s the village witch ... <br /> <br /> Want to know who is the 'murderess? ... <br /> <br /> I can't tell you ... but I can tell you that I have to see this movie! <br /> <br /> (10 out of 10) ... of course!
