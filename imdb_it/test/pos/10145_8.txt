This is another fun and entertaining Hitchcock movie. James Stewart and Doris Day are incredible in this film. Bernard Herrmann appears as himself close to the climax. <br /> <br /> Landscapes and settings are fantastic, except for the scene where the background was obviously fake, which makes no sense to me since the scenes before and after were in the same scenario and were true and own position shots. I heard that Hitchcock did this on purpose sometimes. <br /> <br /> The reviews of this film seem to be mixed. I think this is a better than average Hitchcock movie. Very funny and eventually has a light comic scene. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie 8 out of 10. <br /> <br />
