If you have nothing better to do, then go ahead and rent this movie, it's smart, it's fun, surely it will have your attention occupied for a while. <br /> <br /> I discovered it by browsing channels on a boring Sunday, it was on cable, and for the faces I saw, I thought it was worth a try, made me laugh and for a movie on a Sunday with nothing else on TV, it was OK. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler looks incredible in the film, even if her acting is not what I expected, it's kind of a bad acting and for the rest of the crew, I liked Reba in her role as Dr. I found it interesting to see the sitcom guy "What I like about you" play an almost gay lawyer. <br /> <br /> As for J. Goodman, I found that, like always a great performance, Michael Douglas plays a small role but his characterization was difficult for me to identify him .. <br /> < br /> It is also a good movie to watch with the company.
