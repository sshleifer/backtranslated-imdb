This is a great example of no Hollywood film production that is very inspiring, moving and not lacking in humor, Kevin McKidd and Paula Sage are superb. <br /> <br /> I saw it on TV late at night and I understand why I lost it in the cinema, it's not the kind of film that "mega" multiplex cinemas show today, plus sin . <br /> <br /> I'm going to look for the DVD. Not for those who prefer, the current trend towards special effects and no history. If you liked the best-selling book "The Curious Dog Night Accident", you will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is next to the best of Scottish films, such as "Small Faces" and "trainspotting". All the films in which Kevin McKidd is also present. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
