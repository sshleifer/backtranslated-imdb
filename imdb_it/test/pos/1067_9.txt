At the time this film was shot, most housewives knew exactly who Barbara Stanwick was parodying. Today only a few women over 50 probably remember Gladys Taber, whose "Butternut Wisdom" column was published in Family Circle Magazine from World War I until the 1970s. he lived on Stillmeadow's farm in Conecticut, and his columns were collected in a number of books, Stillmeadow Seasons, Stillmeadow Daybook, etc. The lines that Barbara Stanwick plays while typing them for her column are quite typical of those that started a typical Tablad Gladys Column. In addition to cooking and living in the countryside, he sometimes had a bit of nostalgia and philosophy. He talked a lot about his favorite dogs, mostly cocker spaniels. You could say that Martha Stewart is today's Gladys Tabor. <br /> <br /> Christmas is Connecticut may not be a cinematic masterpiece, but it is enjoyable, a carefree fun, soothing to the stressed mind, and that's pretty good
