Take away all the parts of the movie that were "current" and attack the flashbacks. Then you would have had a great story. The story of Faith and Wolf and their relationship was the best part. Diaz and Eccleston were wonderful. Brewster was ponderous to sit on. Surprised to see Blythe Danner as a mother. She was great. Also look for Patrick Bergen as a father, always like him (Sleeping with the Enemy). This is a very hippy movie, save the world. I don't care much, but I recommend seeing it only for Diaz's performance. It has an excellent range and should be used more. Eccleston is, as always, compelling. He is wonderful!
