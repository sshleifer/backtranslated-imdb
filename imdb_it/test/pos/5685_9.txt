I live here in a croc area and I remember the real events that inspired this film. Our guts fall whenever we hear of a croc attack. BLACK WATER is, quite simply, the best crocodile film I've ever seen. While I loved ROGUE last year for all its effects and flashy scenes, it was local scenes that captured our audience. We laughed at ROGUE more than anything else. BLACK WATER, however, really resonated with the strangeness and fear you can feel when you are alone in the mangroves (girls call them marshes or bays - but they are mangroves). Every tourist should see this movie before heading to the Northern Territory. The ending was a bit disappointing after the rest of the film, but I'll add it to my DVD collection when it's available.
