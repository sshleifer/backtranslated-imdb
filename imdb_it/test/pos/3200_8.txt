This short film (and the poem behind it) is one of the greatest metaphors I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Poetry is beautiful! Does it describe exactly the feeling of a person who pursues a dream and cannot make it happen? but also tells how to make it happen! I see the "History of the Cat and the Moon" as a beautiful metaphor for human relationships, passion and love. <br /> <br /> Even technically he did a good job. Despite being very simple, the animation, in black and white, gives a tone of allegory to the film and its message, but also of tenderness and nostalgia. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, music also contributes to this poetic sensation. <br /> <br /> "It doesn't matter anything else! I'll wait! It will come when it can, or whenever it wants!"
