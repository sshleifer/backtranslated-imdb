If this film is examined closely, it is a bit sad. It is quite detailed to touch very real problems children, who grow up in poor and dysfunctional environments. However, it retains its comic value, with the lively performances of Diahann Carroll and James Earl Jones. The sadness lies in the struggles and dysfunction of the mother (Carroll), who cannot really help her children, not because she doesn't want or try, but because, of course, she doesn't know how. Remember, this is a comedy, but if you've never seen it, or if you've seen it, watch this movie and look at humanity, in the characters. Nice film.
