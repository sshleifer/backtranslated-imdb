This new installment in the Child's Play series does not have a scary scene but tons of hilarious jokes like a braggart who attends Chucky giving him the finger and saying "rude f-king doll" and many references to the series: "you can kill but I'll come back, I always come back ". The title of the film was probably thought before the script and was written around it. This is totally different from all the other films in the series. He doesn't even have Andy, the central character of all the previous ones. Chucky seems to interfere with the characters in another film, a soap opera on two teenagers running together to get married. There is an elaborate death scene involving broken glass and water spilling everywhere. The film is very gory, very funny, and has references to pop culture from Martha Stewert to Jerry Springer. DO NOT SEE THIS ONE BEFORE SEEING THE OTHER THREE. It will really ruin the effect since the first one is really scary. A lot of guilty fun pleasure and stupidity. <br /> <br />
