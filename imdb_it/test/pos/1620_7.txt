As in the case of many films of this genre, my non-Catholicism has prevented me from understanding it. The church has this mass of rules that have been put together over the centuries. We have little time to learn them and accept them at face value. So, throw some bad guys who retaliate for a long term act against them, working by these rules and trying to get around them, and you have this book and this movie. I found myself thinking, "It's great, why did they do it?" There is this random thing in the character of Robert Langdon, where no matter what the problem, he always seems to make the right first move. I suppose it's like watching CSI where they solve incredibly complex cases in a few days. They know the position of the earth. In this film there is so much land and so little time to really understand all that is happening. But if you create Robert Langdon, you have to put it to work. Okay because the heroic nerds like him have saved the day forever. I thought the movie was fun. I thought the Da Vinci Code was fun too. Interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think. This is a wonder to look at and it never stops for a second.
