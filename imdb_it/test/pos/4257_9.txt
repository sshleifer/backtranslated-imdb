I can't say how many times that line made me laugh or how often I described that scene to people who are not familiar with this movie. I saw him the year he was released, I was 19 years old. I don't think there were a dozen people in that East Village theater that night. For years I thought we were the only ones to see it. It is nice to see here that others have found it hysterical like me, and to see its lasting value despite the past time. Rent it, buy it or steal it .... a must see.
