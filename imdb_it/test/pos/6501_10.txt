just saw this movie at the resfest and it was paved. I've never been a big fan of scratches, but this movie drove me crazy from getgo. is listed as a documentary, but never really felt like one. (I can't remember the last time I had so much fun watching a documentary). he has a style and energy that is refreshing, insightful and never too much a preacher. production values ​​were also up there. (shot in movies with fantastic cuts and an incredible soundtrack). overall an intelligent, fun and enlightening piece.
