I was one of the few who did everything to see him in the theater. I've thought about it a lot since then. After two DVD views, I'm happy to be able to say it perfectly. Like any great comedy, I laughed more about each vision, both in anticipation of gags, but also after capturing things missed before. <br /> <br /> Mike Judge does very well creating insanely comic characters and putting them into their world so they make sense. In Office Space, the environment makes the characters credible. The future of Idiocracy gives him the freedom to write incredibly stupid characters and make them work. I'll wait to see if they release a better DVD with some real features before buying it. But this film deserves DVD support not offered at the theater.
