The Violent Men is a good western. Perhaps the story is not original - a great ranch owner dedicated to finding small competitors from a valley he needs for his growing cattle - but the film has many ingredients that increase its level and make it worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The cast is a highlight. There is the reliable Glenn Ford (John Parrish) as a former army officer and now one of the small breeders, who tries to stay out of trouble until he is pushed to the bottom. Edward Robinson (Lew Wilkinson) is as good as ever a crippled man and Barbara Stanwyck (Martha) plays his wicked wife in one of his usual media roles with which he has to deal easily (others were in "Double Indemnity" and "Blowing Wild" Brian Keith (Cole) does it perfectly as Robinson's robotic brother, an ambitious man who tries to conquer his brother's big ranch, no matter what the bad Western of the 50s Richard Jaeckel (Wade Mattlock) Dianne Foster (Judith Wilkinson) plays Robinson's daughter who does not approve of the way her father, mother and uncle run things with their neighbors. <br /> <br /> Rudolph Mate brings a standard direction but acceptable, perhaps helped by a beautiful and wide-open scenario and an excellent and appropriate musical score also helps. <br /> <br /> The inevitable final clash between Ford and Keith is one of the best westerns, shooting with his Trainer s arm and aiming at his military goal) to resolve their differences then and once and for all. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of Glenn Ford's best Western appearances, second only to the classic "3: 10 to Yuma" he did two years later. It is probably the cast that places the film as an "A" and, as far as I'm concerned, it enters the top 10 of the genre.
