Entering this film, I was a little cautious. I've always been a bit uncertain about claymation films. I've always liked decent animated films, but claymation has always been different from me. But this took me by surprise. Wallace and Gromit are extremely lovable characters, and it's a good story with jokes for all ages. There are the burp jokes / fools jokes for children and the subtle, but above the heads of small children, jokes for us elders. The claymation very clean and while the story had holes, it kept my interest starting to end. <br /> <br /> It is so rare to find pure and incorrupt humor these days, this film has been all the more refreshing. Wallace and Gromit go to do their normal thing, which is exterminating HUMANS the bastards who ruin vegetable crops. But this time they find themselves fighting some form of a huge strange rabbit that their humanly built traps can't even control. Great laughs and a great hour and a half of fun. If you haven't exposed yourself to Wallace and Gromit, I highly recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason why I classify it as a 7 and not higher is because it is still a family film and I have no children. I liked it, but if I had looked at it with some carpet mice and my wife, it would definitely be a 9! Give it a shot!
