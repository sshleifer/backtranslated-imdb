This film was never conceived as a high-budget film, but it was a cute little photo that almost anyone could appreciate. It probably won't change your life, but it's certainly fascinating and compelling. <br /> <br /> Clifton Webb plays a musone (which is certainly not new) that has a TV. However, his grades are failing and he is worried about the cancellation. So he decides that maybe he's too out of touch with children - like he and his wife don't have any of them. Therefore, he volunteers as a scout master and regrets having done so almost immediately! Remember, he is a brat and does not particularly like children. To make matters worse, one of the guys really likes him and follows him like a lost puppy. No matter how much the child does, he just wants to spend time with him! The boy is cute and almost steals the show by himself! <br /> <br /> What happens next and the turns of the film are something you will have to find out for yourself. Understand that this is a light, cute and not cloying film that you will probably like.
