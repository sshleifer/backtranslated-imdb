The merciless mercenary Bruno Rivera (Paul Naschy in a mood in a bad mood) cheats on his pregnant partner / girlfriend Meiko (well played by Eiko Nagashima) to have exclusive dibs on a fortune in stolen diamonds. But Meiko manages to seriously injure Bruno before he leaves. Bruno ends up in the light-hearted chalet of Dr. Don Simon (a beautiful performance by Lautaro Murua). It also attracts the attention of Simon's two hotee daughters: the smoldering Monica (the succulent Silvia Aguiler) and the sweet Alicia (well represented by the beautiful Azucena Hernandez). However, Bruno soon realizes that something is wrong with the isolated place and plans to escape as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the bitter Meiko tries to find Bruno so he can take revenge on him. Naschy, who wrote and directed as well as the stars, creates one of his strangest, most twisted and perverted vehicles of horror with this strange strangeness. The unusual plot and the mysterious atmosphere become more strange and unnerving as the story unfolds, eventually leading to a surprisingly surprising surprise ending. This film benefits further from occasional moments of graphic design (watch out for the memorable sequence with a poor boy eaten alive by vicious carnivorous pigs!), Alejandro Ulloa's sloppy cinematography and a fair sprinkling of nudity and soft-core sex. Good support turns from Roxana Dupre in the role of waitress Raquel, Pepe Ruiz as amorous playboy Don Serafin and Julia Saly in the role of the unbalanced Teresa. A pleasantly sad and worthy fool.
