The film can certainly be a narrative medium, but it is absolutely not the ideal medium. Literature brings a plot better because the reader can provide the imagination needed to complete the structure. The film is best appreciated if considered for what it is: a series of images grouped together. What Soderbergh does in Ocean's Twelve combines an impeccable film production technique with the fluid form of American films of the 70s. Looking at the comments posted recently, most people expected a standard-type robber movie, a la Entrapment; it seems that people really miss the annoying clich√©s of romance masked by lead tension and ridiculous twists designed to keep the audience awake. Soderbergh's directing ability is the only reason to watch this film, but the thirty-meter high screen shots of Pitt and Zeta-Jones don't hurt either. A real surprise for those who love the flickering of lights on the silver screen and a disappointment for those who try to make cinema something that is not.
