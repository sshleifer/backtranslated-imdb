Jon Cryer resumes the role of a neurotic boy in Two and a Half Men, which he perfected in this series. He wants to have a good relationship with a girl as his colleague has developed, and the tet-a-tet between him and his partner's best friend is pretty funny. Then they realize that they are attracted to each other and start dating. In one of the funniest lines on TV, NEVER - I think in the final episode - he and his partner are discussing what he wants to propose to the girl. <br /> <br /> His partner prepares him for the moment by suggesting: "What is the worst thing that can happen?" "No". <br /> <br /> Armed with new optimism, he proposes his dinner date. To which you respond, <br /> <br /> "GOD, no!" <br /> <br /> I laughed so hard that I cried.
