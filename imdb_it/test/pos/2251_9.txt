Excellence seems to be rare at Hollwood today. Many consider only two of the best photo candidates to show the meaning of the film industry. And in "Everything is Illuminated", the brand is hit directly. <br /> <br /> The film begins its brilliance with the splendid scenery. From the beginning, one receives a sense of warmth and true family connections and relationships between one another. And besides, the cast is presented perfectly. For the character of Elijah Wood, Jonathon, his sensitivity is expressed by holding the hand of his dying grandmother. And for the character Alex, it's easy to see his life in his perspective, the real Ukrainian rock star. With the cast lit up at first, the story slowly comes to mind when Jonathon decides to venture into Ukraine to meet the woman who believed he was saving his grandfather, then the whole family. And from there, the films of the story slowly, but kept at a fast pace by the contrast between the dripping drama of tears and the laughter humor included in the scene scene by scene, in every scene. <br /> <br /> Although the film itself is quite rewarding, there are several complaints from other sources that comment on Liev Schrieber's inadequate adaptation of Jonathon's novel Safron Foer. Personally, I never read the novel. But any film, especially this film in particular, should not be evaluated if the film's storyboard matches the plot of the book, but rather how the main concepts of the novel were expressed and exploited through the film. Just because it might be unlikely from the novel does not mean that this film is no longer a must - it still is. <br /> <br /> During the film, new information floods the mind of the public very slowly. Some of these thoughts are not answered; and in fact, the second part of the film focuses on the whole subject and the reason for the journey through Ukraine on something different, but rather similar to the original intentions of this film. The film, however, leaves you a satisfied note, yet for the souls with a weak heart, a tear could fall. And for the whole movie. to saneful people with the common sense of humor can simply laugh at the amusing and continuous conversations of Alex and John. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to different types of people: to those who love films that share the genre dramatic comedy, for those who are interested in family relationships and for those interested in the themes of Holocaust. And to those fools who find the hoax as a hilarious comedy, this movie is not for you. And for you who think this is a seriously funny and absolutely ingeniously funny movie, you are wrong; this film shares comic moments and dramatic sequences. And to those who judge a film based on their sympathy with its corresponding novel, you may or may not have fun with this film, but this film should be taken much more than if it were close to the book or not. <br /> <br /> All in all, 'Everything is Illuminated' is an ingenious work that will illuminate anyone's hearts.
