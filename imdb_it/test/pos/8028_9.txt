This film is about Carlos "The Jackal" (Quinn), an international terrorist who, according to the description of the CIA agent Henry Fields (Sutherland), seems to mutilate women and children for the fun of it. At least that's what he says to hit US naval officer Annibal Ramirez (again Quinn) in assuming the task of pretending to be Carlos and setting him up as a traitor in the eyes of the KGB. Ramirez is apparently physically identical to Carlos but mentally it is his antithesis. He was born by order and Carlos is carried away by chaos. <br /> <br /> The movie is not all action shooter, it's a good thing. In his first half, Ramirez trains to act and think like Carlos, and is actually the point where the film gets its distinction from other action films. An Israeli agent (Kingsley) joins Fields in Ramirez's training, and together they seem to take on the roles of parents in the birth of the new Ramirez character. Ramirez is taught to detest things that Carlos doesn't like, to act in the split second as Carlos would, and even to make love like Carlos (courtesy of Carlos' ex-girlfriend). Of course everything he is taught will be put to use in the second half of the film. He's a little bit forced but Quinn offers a compelling performance as an aspiring Carlos. Another thing that I liked about this film is that it didn't use the exaggerated plot point in movies of evil twins - you know, the one in which the evil twin enters the family of the good twin. Ramirez's family enters the film, but instead points out that his new character destroys chaos in his family life. <br /> <br /> The giggling good humor is injected into this film, often with the immature duo of Sutherland and Kingsley. An exception is the apparently free and abused joke involving the name of Ramirez (Annibal, Annabelle, understood?). Furthermore, the constant arpeggio of the duo over how powerful, intelligent and intelligent Carlos was exaggerated. In my opinion, during the final showdown, the payoff was not able to match the build up. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film was fun. I'm not a big fan of the action movie, but this movie was smarter and more compelling than the average action movie and kept my attention all the time. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10
