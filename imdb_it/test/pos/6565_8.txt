Hey, now, I've never laid eyes on a Manga comic book, but apparently this movie is based on one. Ah well! That's life. However, this is rather bizarre, to say the least, film, because things literally get out of hand in a small Japanese city. People are becoming obsessed with uzumaki (spiral) and this girl is watching the videotape of her friend's father a snail, and later in the film, do people start to become snails? It also seems that this boy's father becomes so obsessed that he somehow commits suicide in a household appliance. There is a bizarre humor that could be at home in a Tim Burton film, but there is a certain nastiness and gore as only the Japanese can do with justice. As with many Japanese films, is the ending the ending and something has been solved? Well, not for me, it's not like that. There are some suggestions as to why this is happening, but they have not been explored and there is still a lot left to the imagination or it was not considered important. However, there are many things for the eyes to taste and if you are not obsessed with everything that makes perfect sense, it is worth seeing, because it is so original and bizarre. My favorite was the father with rolling eyes, personally. 8 out of 10 stars.
