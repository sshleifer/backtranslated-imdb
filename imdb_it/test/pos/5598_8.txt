In this particular film, the themes of the end of days and of Satan against Jesus are treated in a new way. Jesus does not want to open the last two seals, and Satan is hindered in his attempt to bring another soul into hell ... Armageddon, Armageddon and Jehosaphat prove to be a - company!, And the book of life is a bit difficult to open. <br /> <br /> What is memorable in this film is the slanted image, the out-of-focus shots and the light effects, which are effective but sometimes irritating. And, of course, Donovan is as big as a disillusioned Jesus who tries to come to terms with what the world and his people have become! So see it if you get the chance!
