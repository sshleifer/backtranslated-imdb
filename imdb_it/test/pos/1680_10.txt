Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes / Rififi (1955) can be described on the surface as a French variant of the John Huston robbery film, Asphalt Jungle (1950). The difference between the two films is Rififi (1955) which pays a little more attention to the sequence of robberies. Furthermore, the police are not involved in the consequences of the Rififi robbery as much as in Asphalt Jungle. In the end Rififi (1955) is, in my opinion, a slightly better film than Asphalt Jungle (1950). Notable Noir image that defines the French cinema of the 50s. <br /> <br /> Spartacus (1960) may have been the one that broke the infamous blacklist, but in my opinion Rififi (1955) was the film that has started breaking Hollywood's indisputable blacklist. First film in five years for Jules Dassin, a victim of McCarthy's communist hunting in the late 1940s and early 1950s. He obtained a kind of retribution when Rififi (1955) became a success in France and in Europe. In this way challenging the blacklisted Hollywood poison in an important way that probably inspired others to do the same. Rififi (1955) is the most important film of Dassin's career because he not only returned his name, but also gave him a second chance to make films. Jules Dassin has given the world of cinema and its public more and more a masterpiece of influential proportions. His material handling is exceptional and the direction of the actors is impeccable. Create tense situations with crafted precision. Dassin has come full circle in the genre Film Noir directing his best and last Noir, Rififi (1955). It marked the end of the Dassin period in the cinema when he was involved in making Noir films. <br /> <br /> Rififi (1955) is the number one film in an arsenal of thirty and more films for the director, Jules Dassin. A masterpiece of acting, cinematography, direction, editing and writing. It's not a movie to leave your seat for a minute because there's always something memorable going on. Brilliant as nothing by Jean Pierre Melville who was a master of this type of film. Masterpieces like Rififi (1955) are relatively small compared to probably billions of films made in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> The fascinating aspect of Rififi is the precise planning and accurate execution of a robbery that takes most of the 118 minutes. The main characters plan and execute the jewel robbery in the same way that a director prepares for the pre-productions, production and post-production of a film. It shows how difficult a Jewel stroke is like in Rififi (1955) and why very few do something similar. The fact that the scene barely contains a mess like in other robbery films turns this scene into something even bigger. Close as you can get to have a perfect sequence in a movie. <br /> <br /> The lack of unnatural sounds in the sequence of bustle of triumph of the utmost importance places him in a realm of absolute realism. Any dialogue and / or music would ruin every suspense and tension that the director is trying to create. The use of natural sound makes the robbery sequence a rewarding cinematic viewing experience. Now directors and producers would have used dialogue and music in a scene like this due to the lack of confidence in the patience of a mainstream film. It supports a level of coherence that can never be broken down. <br /> <br /> Maintaining a high level of suspense is what makes the sequence of rapi perfectly. The director achieves the suspense in the robbery sequence that is rarely matched in most robbery robbery scenes. Jean Servais and the rest of the main actors contribute to the suspense with a low-profile acting. Getting suspense in a scene is a task that few can do. The Rififi robbery sequence (1955) reaches a Hitchcockian level of suspense and tension. <br /> <br /> Many filmmakers of the following years at Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes (1955) were influenced if not inspired by it. An influenced filmmaker was Jean Pierre Melville (original choice for the director of Rififi) who used variations of the robbery sequence in Le Doulos (1961) and Le Cercle Rouge (1970). Another influenced filmmaker was Stanley Kubrick who made a film with a similar theme in The Killing (1956). Also, Quentin Tarantino, whose debut film Reservoir Dogs (1992) was inspired by this film. Other influenced directors are John Woo, Michael Mann, Paul Schrader, Ringo Lam, etc. <br /> <br /> Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes (1955) is comparable to Bob le Flambeur (1955) in many ways. One, Jules Dassin and Jean Pierre Melville directed revolutionary films in Rififi (1955) and Bob le Flambeur (1955). Two, each film involves a senior criminal who plans and makes a brave blow. Three, Bob the Flambeur and Rififi end in a fatalistic way. Four, each film shares many motifs and situations that classify the two as great in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Part of the charm of Rififi are the colorful characters that surround the story like Tony le Stephanois, Jo le Suedois, Mario Farrati, and Cesar le Milanais. Most violence is implicit but effectively brutal. The main characters led by Tony Le Stephanois stick to a strong obsolete code of honor that recalls Sam Peckinpah and John Woo. Jean Servais becomes the role of Tony le Stephanois with his cynical vision and tired looks. Du Rififi Chez Les Hommes / Rififi (1955) became my favorite when I saw it on the big screen from beginning to end.
