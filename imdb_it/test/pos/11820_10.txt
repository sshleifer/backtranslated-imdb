Very nice movie! I was browsing the channels on my TV and I usually ignore the channels that broadcast dramatic films, but then I saw this channel broadcasting old-school films and this is where I saw this film. At first, when I saw the title "The Cure" I thought it would be boring, but then I got passionate when I saw Brad Renfro in this film (because one of my favorite movies of all time is "The Client" in which Brad also stars). Then the scenes were getting better. The story is so beautiful and touching! I cried harshly in this film that I don't usually do. Great casting! and there are so many beautiful lines / quotes in this film that is very surprising and made me cry! Now I bought my copy on DVD and I always recommend it to everyone!
