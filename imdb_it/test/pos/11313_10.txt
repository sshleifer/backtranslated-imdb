I really enjoyed this movie. I saw him last night on the public broadcasting system. The part I liked was that they faced today's issues, not in the future or in the past. Basically some terrorists took a van or two and hired them to be a car bomb. I think what the movie could show were people in different countries at the same time. It demonstrated the fact that England, or any other country, is not prepared for an attack on the greatness shown. I've never heard any of the actors or actresses in the film, so I can't really tell if they are normally their parts. After the film, they had this group of experts discussing whether something like this could happen here in the United States. It was a stimulating discussion!
