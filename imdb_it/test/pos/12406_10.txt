The effectiveness of this image was best demonstrated by the intended target audience, namely adolescents. My 14-year-old son became so engrossed in this film that I consider him considerably taller than his imitator "Mad City". It has sparked debate in our family on issues such as peer pressure and loyalty to doing the right thing. For that one alone, I consider this film a 10! Parents should watch it with their kids and discuss it later. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed intelligent dialogue and consistent acting. I thought James Remar was adequate in his role, but the youthful cast really brought this image. Other IMDB users have praised the performance of Corey Feldman, which is truly inspired. All in all, I give this image my highest recommendation. Go get this!
