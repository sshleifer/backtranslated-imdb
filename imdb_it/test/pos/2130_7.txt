I lost the full four-hour version when it was originally released in theaters because it played a week. I had to settle for seeing the shorter two-and-a-half-hour version about a year later and was stunned by what I saw. I left the theater thinking I had witnessed a masterpiece and wondered what the full version was. <br /> <br /> The full version is mostly good, but it has such incredibly boring sequences that the whole movie is shot down and almost sinks under the waves. <br /> <br /> The problem is entirely in the editing which should be labeled as the last word on excess. There are times when things go on and on and on and nothing happens. Shots of people in a city that goes on too long without purpose in the story. We get beautiful views and visions of such beauty to bring tears to our eyes, but they are used too often as a placeholder instead of punctuation or a place. Most of the longer version appears to be on the screen simply because it looked good. <br /> <br /> I tried to sit down and look at Heavens Gate without using the Fast Forward button but somewhere along the way you find I can't take it anymore. <br /> <br /> I wish MGM to have mercy on us and to release the shorter version on DVD and the huge dinosaur. Maybe like a two pack so we could see what the best version is and if Cimino was crazy or not. <br /> <br /> And while they were there, why not include the modification of the county of Johnson County, which was once said to be 90 minutes. Presumably United Artists tinkered with a further cut in hopes of recovering some of their money. Whether it was made or still exists is in the air, but it would be interesting to see.
