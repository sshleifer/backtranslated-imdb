Really a pity that this wonderful bright spot on the small screen had such a talent in writers and actors, such a wonderful scenario that it was the last escape for those who find themselves in a land closed to the sun, without sun. Many of the actors went to bigger things ... another indicator that there was something wonderful, unfortunately lost. At the time I lived in Columbus, Ohio, with all my large family (now ex) husband in a chorus of "NO NO !!" every time he would be picked up again by a baseball game. <br /> <br /> Someone who wrote here spoke of "Rosanne" ... all my ex and I noticed that it was always always anticipated by BASEBALL !!!! Yes, FOX has really wasted something wonderful that one and nothing will ever equal ~! Thanks for the memories.
