I've always liked animated ducks for some reason: Duck Tales, Darkwing Duck, Daffy Duck, Donald Duck. Although none of them is as deranged as Duckman. Originally broadcast between 1994 and 1997, Duckman lasted for a total of 70 episodes, but could easily have continued forever without becoming stale. <br /> <br /> The titular character is a disenchanted disinterested and unscrupulous and the worst living person in the world. He's a private investigator, a widower, a voyeur, an alcoholic, a sex maniac, a murderer, a (fill in the blank). Call him, Duckman did it. But who can blame him for being so pale when the world we live in is so crazy, outrageous and simply senseless? Eric Tiberius Duckman (voiced by the maniac Jason Alexander) could carry the entire show on his own, but when surrounded by a bunch of eccentric supporting characters, you only know that the trouble is just waiting to explode at every opportunity. My favorite is Willibald Feivel Cornfed (or just Cornfed Pig), Duckman's incredibly faithful companion who is apparently talented and highly qualified in everything and is perpetually unaware of the infinity of vices and incompetence of his partner. <br /> <br /> the typical plot will involve a bizarre case that will inevitably cross or rotate around his highly dysfunctional family, although occasionally the archenemy King Chicken by Duckman (Tim Curry), a sort of Professor Moriarty in the form of bird, it opens some diabolical revenge scheme for being bullied in high school. <br /> <br /> Ever since I was a teenager this was my absolute favorite animated show, better than The Simpsons, Family Guy and even King of the Hill. Nothing will ever exceed it. There has never been, or will be, anything like Duckman ever again. The level of satire, observational humor and writing is so acute that it is deadly and the animation is done in that unique Klasky / Csupo style (anyone who has seen Rugrats will understand it). It is a wonderful world, extremely imaginative and wild and all with a 1940s touch. <br /> <br /> You can never have too much of this particular bird.
