The United States of Leland was a fantastic film. I kept passing it on my TV guide without knowing what it was and never having the chance to sit there and enter. Then one morning, when I woke up early, I saw that he was about to start. So I decided to watch it. I had the time and interest to see it. When I saw that Ryan Gosling was in the movie and then that he was the main character, I was immediately sucked in and couldn't move from my couch. The struggle that Leland goes through is such a stimulating story. Everyone has to deal with the same kind of thoughts during their life, whether it's a small minor detail or something as big as what's going on. I have to sit down and watch the movie again just to capture all the things I might have missed the first time. As a general comment ... I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Gosling or anyone who loves a good movie with a good story. The fact that there are so many other big stars that have also had great performances is just an added BONUS! So do what you can to have time to take a look at this movie, I can almost be sure it won't be a waste of time.
