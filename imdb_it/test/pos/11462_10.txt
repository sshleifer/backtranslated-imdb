any movie that has a line of dialogue that does something like this ... "Judy is getting ready for her date, Butthole!" it must be good! I found it on an unclassified, unpublished and pleasantly surprised DVD, I worked a lot to make this film. Actually, I liked it a lot more than many movies from the 80s that I saw. Great addition to my movie collection. <br /> <br /> Accumulation was great, it creates fears for the rest of the film. I love GORE and T&A. I never thought that the eyeballs that came out would look like pustules, the color of my eyes was lousy! I still think "Rog" looks like Tiger Woods but blacker, does anyone agree?
