I didn't know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary. I knew it was a former POW from Viet Nam in Laos who had fled, but I didn't know much else. In fact, I didn't expect too much. Oh what a surprise! The life story of this man is very interesting in itself, but what distinguishes this film from other biographical documents is that Dieter himself tells most of the story. Dieter is very at ease in front of the camera. His personality really shines. He tells his story about his life growing up in Germany during the Second World War and the difficulties. We are there with him in the same small city that describes his family, his inspirations and his battles. We follow him in America and his journey to realize his dream of being a pilot. Subsequently, Dieter describes his story of capture, escape and survival in the Laos jungle. We are with him again in that jungle that describes and recalls his imprisonment and his journey towards freedom with great details. We see the same primitive huts, villagers and the forms of detention with which he had to deal with that has not changed for 30 years. We see the dense jungle, the mountainous terrain and the rivers that Dieter faced during his escape. It helps us understand his emotions, pain and sadness. I liked the man, the history and the style. Job well done!
