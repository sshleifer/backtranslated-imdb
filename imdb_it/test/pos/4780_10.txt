This was the first Mickey Mouse comic book released and the first cartoon with sound. In the cartoon, Mickey does not yet wear gloves. He doesn't talk yet either. All he does is whistle and play music. The song he plays is "Turkey in the Straw" using different farm animals as musical instruments. For example, play the teeth of a cow like a xylophone and pull the suckling piglets like an accordion keyboard. I recorded this comic from Disney Channel and I think it's wonderful. It was based on a silent film starring Buster Keaton entitled "Steamboat Bill, Jr."
