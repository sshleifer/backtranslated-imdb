I was able to see "Anywhere But Here" last night as a free preview. I absolutely loved the movie! I was attracted to it because of the realistic representation of a mother / daughter relationship ... there was certainly a connection between Adele and Ann. I think he talks about the exceptional performances of Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman. Sarandon was the right actress to play Adele and after leaving the theater I couldn't think of another actress in the role. Portman was also excellent as Ann. He brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to the role that I don't think any other teenage actress can have. I think the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should give credit for what is due and appoint both Sarandon and Portman for the awards in the "Actress" and "Supporting Actress" categories. It would be a shame if they were neglected.
