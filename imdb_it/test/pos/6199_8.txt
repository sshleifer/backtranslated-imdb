* BE ADVISED OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> A friend told me to take a look at this series, and I'm glad I took his words for it. <br /> <br /> I read the synopsis on the cover of the DVD and was immediately intrigued. Is the main protagonist Muslim? Absolutely not, this is the first one! This is an FBI agent who is undercover to penetrate a possible sleeper cell in Los Angeles; and take this - he is a practicing Muslim. At first I was a bit skeptical, a bit I expected some hero or antagonist to spit crazy, free and senseless minions more fanatical ... let's face it, many shows have been guilty of this. /> <br /> But then I watched the first three episodes and thought: Ok, okay. It wasn't until episode four ("Scholar") when I was really impressed. I would like to congratulate you for the great writing and also for the extraordinary interpretations of the actors. I love how complex each of these characters is - they are not two-dimensional cardboard two-sided extinct good guys / bads. Michael Ealy offers a wonderful and believable performance as the FBI Muslim agent Darwyn Al-Sayeed, who trod the thin line between being a good Muslim and being a man with flaws. Oded Fehr gives his character Farik an interesting depth - Farik is not the classic Middle Eastern stereotype, but simply someone who truly believes in his cause and does not consider himself a fanatic but a man willing to take any extreme measures to justify his beliefs . He is very charismatic and authoritative. But I would say that it was Alex Nesic's performance that left a clear impression on me in "Scholar". His interpretation of his character's emotional struggle was surprising - torn between words kindly spoken by a Muslim scholar encouraging him to return to the non-aggressive way because it is the only acceptable way in God's eyes and Farik's persuasion to believe otherwise. > <br /> I can't wait to see other shows like this, and not a series of shows by a ridiculously high-octane man. He is intelligent and open-minded.
