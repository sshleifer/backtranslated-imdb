There are no flaws in this production. Perfectly fun, fun and worthy of respect. <br /> <br /> This is the theater. Certainly not for the very young, but the slightly older children will have a great time seeing it and can be introduced to the theater in this way. <br /> <br /> Surprising and surprising.
