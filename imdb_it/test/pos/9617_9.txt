I was first introduced to this film while I was in San Antonio, Texas. This film was the 2nd. in a double function. Unfortunately, the theater where I saw this was demolished. However, Five Fingers of Death (aka: King Boxer), was released in 1972 and introduced in the United States the following year. Like many other "Kung-Fu" films released while riding the "coat tails" of Enter the Dragon, this particular film was pretty good. It is the story of a country boy who is sent to a martial arts institute to improve himself and his fighting skills. Meanwhile, the programs and schemes of the martial arts school "opponents" to counter our hero, using dirty tactics to try to throw him off the track and try to prevent him from participating in the tournament. Surprisingly, I had thought that since Warner Bros. had distributed this film in the United States, Warner Bros. would have released a DVD. It never happened As far as I know, this film was published both in English and in Cantonese, with subtitles ... the second a more "clean and clear" version. Although the combat sequences are a little fun to watch (for example: flying in the air and hitting, jumping on buildings, a fighter using his head ... literally .... to hit his opponent, etc.) However, the wonderfully planned and performed kung-fu action is classic. If you like Enter the Dragon, Five Fingers of Death would be an excellent addition to any movie collection ..... if you can find it.
