Sharpe's Honor for non-specialists, is the fifth item in a series of TV movies focused on an English army rifleman during the Napoleonic wars and based on Bernard Cornwell's books (which I highly recommend reading). If you were to start looking at this detail though, you would have the impression that Sharpe is not so much a soldier as the centrifugal force that revolves around the rest of the army. In that case, I would recommend starting with previous chapters like Sharpe's Eagle or Sharpe's Company, but this is a worthy choice for a second viewing. <br /> <br /> The story this time is about the espionage side of things. With the French army retreating in disorder from Spain, Major Ducos, the slimy espionage master discovers an opportunity to reverse the situation. Staring the murder of a Spanish marquis on Richard Sharpe, hero of the British army, the fragile British / Spanish alliance will begin to crumble and things will change again. When the Spanish nobles come to Wellington crying for Sharpe's blood, however, the British general is less than willing to hang his best soldier, so fake his death and soon, is on a secret mission behind enemy lines to find out who has designed the plot. Surprisingly enough for a Sharpe movie, there's a beautiful woman to save along the way, I guess. <br /> <br /> What this naturally entails is a more adventurous approach. The concentration is less on the functioning of the British army with Sharpe as figurehead and focuses more on his escapades in the countryside, dodging French patrols, making a clean sweep with the Spanish guerrillas and getting involved in daring escapes from fortified military positions. Sergeant Harper, his loyal right arm accompanies him naturally but the rest of the riflemen remain in the field unaware of the fact that their leader is still alive. Strangely, however, they actually receive more attention than usual while they find themselves in the subplot involving the delivery of Harper's child. <br /> <br /> This slightly different approach makes an intriguing episode but it is only a good thing the long run. And someone should worry that there won't be the standard battle at the peak, not because, once again, the poor old Frenchman has the right kick. Furthermore, Ducos is a fantastic successor to Obadiah Hakeswill as the villain you love to hate. He is a duplicate, mischievous and absolutely evil son of a female dog and is also strangely reminiscent of that boy in black from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Elsewhere, Hagman stands out quite prominently when he has the chance to have more time on the screen and presents himself as the kind of man you would like to deliver your firstborn, even if he looks like an Iron Maiden member who catapulted back in time by mistake. In short, then, another strong chapter of the Sharpe series. Sharpe remains as heroic as ever, but considerably more bitter and angry this time, considering the events of the previous film. It's not the best introduction if you haven't seen any of the other chapters, but it shows a side of Sharpe that they normally can't testify: the action hero rather than the professional soldier. And if this isn't enough to tempt you, it's also worth looking only for the rather surreal view of a furious Sean Bean swinging a live chicken in a group of nuns.
