Looking at this hilarious but very entertaining career story, I was struck by Joan Crawford's first appearance. All I could initially think of was, "My God, it's the same face as Michael Jackson in his infamous booking photo!" <br /> <br /> About 34 minutes into the film, Diane Baker and Hope Lange get off a taxi in Greenwich Village. As they walk down the street, you can see part of a sign behind them for the Stonewall Bar - scene of the epochal "revolts" that are considered the trigger of the modern homosexual rights movement. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Baker and taxis, I had to laugh when he took one and he told the taxi driver: "56th and Sutton Place, please - and beware of the bumps". Can you imagine the reaction to that of a pilot in today's Manhattan?! He says it, of course, because he is pregnant and does not want to hurt the fetus. But that doesn't stop her from jumping from a moving car when she finds out that Bob Evans wants her to abort! Well, they had to find a way to make the child lose (1959 and all). <br /> <br /> Sue Carson is as delicious as Mary Agnes. Why was this your only film? There is no biographical information about her on IMDb.
