While I agree that this was a sitcom from the 1950s, it doesn't seem like it was "typical". First, Donna Reed was a STRONG woman, unlike the normal sitcom moms of the 1950s. He took a stand for the value and equality of women (he recalls the episode in which the TV announcer says "only a housewife") and Donna stands up for all the women and represents, especially those who do not work outside the home ? And when women rebelled against something in the series, it wasn't something trivial ... it was always something to prove that women have the right to be treated with the same respect as men. Remember, Donna Reed was married to the producer of the show, so she had much more to do to make her character more powerful. <br /> <br /> The children were intelligent, but not precocious. They were normal children. And they could act. <br /> <br /> Something else that made Donna Reed Show stand out was not just the fact that the children look like their parents, but one could hear the chemistry among all the actors in the real life situation, which then it came out in the characters. Shelly Fabares and Paul Peterson have often written and observed that they were treated as the sons of Donna Reed and Carl Betz, and that the adults were fiercely protective of the child actors, and treated them accordingly. Donna and Alex also had some sexual chemistry that was not seen in other family shows. And the characters could be imperfect, and in important ways, yet accepted for flaws and errors. These were not super parents who were not wrong and had no emotional ups and downs. They were normal people acting like normal people. <br /> <br /> Women's rights, drug abuse, pedophilia, single fathers, poverty, children who need good health care but cannot afford it ... it was all shown in this show Rather revolutionary for the 'era. <br /> <br /> Donna Reed's show did not last for eight years without a reason. And he could have resisted, if it hadn't been for the divorce of Tony Owens and Donna Reed. <br /> <br /> This show is very underrated and should be shown so that other generations can appreciate the quality. <br /> <br /> In summary, I agree with the original poster, which obviously takes care of the show, but I think the Donna Reed show has a lot more to offer than casual entertainment.
