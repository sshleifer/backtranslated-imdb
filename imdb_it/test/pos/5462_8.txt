Well, so maybe the imitations of Jay Leno and David Letterman are not clear, but you still have an idea of ​​who these people are and how they work behind the screen. Bob Balaban and Treat Williams are excellent as Warren Littlefield and Micheal Ovitz. <br /> <br /> The film is not a joke and a punchline, but it's still fun. Kathy Bates in particular is incredible as Leno's manager. <br /> <br /> Funny, surprising, interesting, very watchable, this is a good TV movie.
