William Shakespeare probably did not imagine Stephanos as a gay doctor, Antonio as an unfaithful wife, or Caliban as a goat with a Trinitron, but the Bard had done worse at his good job over time, and he could even enjoy the sumptuous spectacle of life this is his "Tempesta" reconfigured by Paul Mazursky and co-writer Leon Capetanos. <br /> <br /> This time, Prospero is Philip Dimitrius (John Cassevetes), a Manhattan architect tired of designing Atlantic City casinos for the amiable Mafioso Alonso (Vittorio Gassman), especially after discovering Alonso, is bringing continue a relationship with Filippo's wife, Antonia (Gena Rowlands). Together with his daughter Miranda (Molly Ringwald), Philip flees to a remote Greek island with Miranda and her new friend Aretha (Susan Sarandon), a Catholic girl struggling with Philip's unmarried lifestyle. Will a sudden storm go well in the end? <br /> <br /> Here's a thought about Cassevetes' career: how many other actors could make a film so confusing in something so compelling? A lover of film critics for his previous work, often with the wife of Rowland, who actually lives, he presents a central character who really suffers for his art here, but seems to enjoy himself and amuses him too. It is not Prospero, but something rich and strange that makes the sea a fantastic change of its own. <br /> <br /> "It's all here", says Aretha's dog, Nino, to one of his faithful companions. "Beauty, magic, inspiration and serenity." It is so. "Tempest" moved London to Manhattan in 1611 and found some beautiful resonances in Philip's displaced life. "Let me see the magic," he calls to a storm-tossed city skyscape, and Mazursky's version, augmented by Donald McAlpine's cinematography with purple seascapes and naturally sun-burned Greek landscapes, does just that. <br /> <br /> It is not a perfect film, in any way. In reality, the grand finale, which is the only part of the film that follows Shakespeare's plot to any extent faithful, is a mess. The character of Rowland is difficult to heal in this film, and after meeting Sarandon in all his unbridled glory, it is difficult to understand Philip's continuing concern for his wife, not to mention his left-wing desire to make an unhappy one " sacrifice "to restore the natural order of things. <br /> <br /> But there is much to love about "Tempest". In addition to Cassavetes, there is the film debut of Ringwald as a loyal but restless daughter, here as in the comedy an object of desire for the primitive rustic "Kalibanos" (Raul Julia). Here Ringwald is the same adolescent muse of a privileged adolescence that would inspire John Hughes, but with an emotional depth that Hughes's later films have not deepened. Ringwald and Julia have never had the attention of the Oscars, but both will win Golden Globes for their playful work here. He tries to woo her in the island isolation with his Greek "Gunsmoke" TV repetitions, attempted by his 15-year-old body. <br /> <br /> "I want to balonga of you with my bonny johnny," Kalibanos claims to be pushed to one side, but he still won our sympathy, especially after playing "New York, New York" with a chorus of goats. (When "Tempest" appeared on the screens, Julia was the Broadway toast in "Nine".) <br /> <br /> It's Mazursky's show, although sometimes it seems that Cassavetes is turning things around with improvisational line readings and emotional breakdowns galore. (Philip introduces himself to Aretha saying "I'm in the middle of a nervous breakdown".) He interprets his character as an obsessive lovable, trying to crystallize his happiness by building a theater in his otherwise uninhabited island. /> <br /> Adding to the fun is Gassman's rich performance as the other man, who is as lovable as Julia while telling Philip a youth obsession: "Boys don't have half of funds like us. " I'm nervous ... and make love in the back of an old sports car. "Despite being too long and pretentious, like so many art films," Tempest "is fun in its excesses and a journey very similar to Shakespeare's , although his dreams did not include smoking backstage at a Go-Go concert.
