Starewicz is infinitely inventive and his techniques still amaze fans of animation 70 years later. We may have computer-generated techniques now, but all he had in 1934 was an imagination that would not accept the "no" for an answer. Whatever he wanted to see on the screen, he created. <br /> <br /> And he wanted to see some really bizarre things - every conceivable scrap piece is called service: old shoes, chicken bones, utensils, broken glasses, dolls, monkeys, rats ... it seems as if there was nothing that was off limits. <br /> <br /> A truly disturbing, even disturbing film that should be seen by anyone who has a passing interest in animation. This film must be seen to be believed!
