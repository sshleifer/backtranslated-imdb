I cry a lot of movies. Call me sentimental Call me one of those spectators who always like to see a happy ending. This film, although it has a sad ending, was great! Of all the actors I would like to have lunch with, it would be Sidney Poitier. His acting, along with John Cassavetes and Jack Warden (of 12 Angry Men) is stellar. His character, who makes friends with a man on the run (Cassavetes) and helps him in every way possible is incredible. <br /> <br /> This is another of the forgotten noirs created during the end of the noir era. It is well done, it has a superb cast, an extremely talented acting and a great cinematography. It is a film that is worth watching over and over again. I highly recommend this! This is just another great movie made by Mr. Poitier and should be sold on DVD. Even if I cried, congratulations for such a great art!
