This is undoubtedly the most heartbreaking black and white war movie I've seen; in fact, the only Western director during this period to remotely approach his level of intensity and visceral power in his work was Samuel Fuller. By the way, I had seen a retrospective by Kon Ichikawa at the National Film Theater in London in September 2002, but I managed to capture only some of his works made between 1960 and 1973. <br /> <br /> The film is certainly depressing as it is known to be; however, it also shows welcome touches of black humor everywhere - the "dead" man who wakes up to answer a questioning soldier and promptly "dies" again, the delightful ironic sequence of exchange of shoes, an eccentric dying who says to the hungry hero as part of the body he should eat, etc. Incidentally, the script was written by a woman - Natto Wada, the director's own wife! <br /> <br /> Ichikawa is a versatile and prolific filmmaker whose reputation may not be as high as he was during his peak years (1956-65), but his direction here is often surprising - the surprising sequence of pre-credits (the hero is violently reprimanded by his superior officer for being discharged from the hospital earlier than expected!), the death of a Japanese who surrenders at the hands of a Filipino woman armed with rifles, the bombing of a hospital (with medical personnel running away to save themselves, leaving wounded soldiers behind to crawl out of the hut at their limited pace), the automatism in March in the rain of disillusioned soldiers (which also involves the already mentioned shoe business which, in reality, resembles a similar scene in ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT [1930], a hill strewn with the bodies of soldiers trying to climb, the finale, etc. Surely one of the main strengths of the film is the extraordinary cinematography of the muddy and ruthless landscape. <br /> <br /> The film is known for treating the taboo subject to cannibalism (almost 10 years before it became a staple of horror films) but Ichikawa's approach is not only subtle but very effective: the meat is called "monkey meat", while the hero is seen only once (and immediately spits out the piece along with most of his decaying teeth!); on the contrary, when the weak subdued soldier (played by Mickey Curtis who, despite his name, was a Japanese pop idol of the time!) concedes angrily, the ground near is splashed with blood. <br /> <br /> In the integrators, Ichikawa recalls that Method Methoding lead actor Eiji Funakoshi (whose portrait is unforgettable, by the way) came to the set to the point of starving - with the result that production was forced to close for two weeks until it recovered! Donald Richie's perceptive interview favors the nihilism of the basic patriotism film behind a similar recent Hollywood tragedy by SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998). <br /> <br /> FIRES ON THE PLAIN are universally regarded as one of his best efforts by the director and, among the many Ichikawa films I have seen, the closest to it is THE BURMESE HARP (1956, a another war movie based on characters but with a spiritual tone, and which is also available on DVD from Criterion) and ENJO aka CONFLAGRATION (1958, which was actually given in a limited theatrical performance locally, as part of a week of foreign films, a couple of years ago). Personally, I also have a weakness for the director's extraordinarily stylized color extravagance, AN ACTOR'S REVENGE (1963), which I saw twice at NFT in 1999 and at the aforementioned 2002 retrospective.
