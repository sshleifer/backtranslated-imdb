This is basically a goofball comedy, with a rather strange rhythm due to some dramatic elements. For Michael J. Fox and Paul Reubens, it was their first film (Fox had previously been in a short-lived TV series and a TV movie). <br /> <br /> Since the film is basically a type of hunt / treasure hunt movie like "Cannonball Run", "Mad Mad Mad Mad World", or more recently "Rat Race", there are no characters main. Instead there are groups of characters, dividing screen time and allowing tons of mini-plots. Usually this type of film is a way to fill the maximum amount of stars (or semi-stars) on a film. <br /> <br /> This has teams, with one of which is the main team to which Fox belongs, they are the only characters to be developed. Their plot is more of a stereotype of the Disney affair, of a college boy who doesn't pay attention to his younger brother, whom he considers a lazy punk. Since they are forced to work together, together with the older brother's girlfriend, they are forced to work together. Since this is the main plot, get the most time on the screen. <br /> <br /> Some other stupid graphics stand out. The Blue Team is about a rich overweight child whose dad just wants him and his misfits friends out of the house. They end up with a custom van that had an on-board computer (in 1980!) To solve puzzles instantly, as well as play video games with the time saved! One member, Stephen Furst, continued to play the role of Dr. Axelrod on "St. Elsewhere", and later on "Babylon 5". I also admit that laughing again when Barf, while trying to decipher a word a'la Scrabble, comes up with "Fagabefe?" This is a lot more fun than Bart Simpson's "Qwyjibo", in my opinion. <br /> <br /> The other three teams have plots that are somehow linked together. The green team is a group of frat boys, with beer beats mostly culminating in a slump for one when the hunt leads to the Pabst Blue Ribbon Brewery. They have the opportunity to harass the red team, with two feminists and two fun-loving twins. The white nerd team is led by Eddie Deezen, who was previously in "Grease", but has continued to play a critical computer role in "Wargames" and later in Tim Conway's Sidekick in some of the "Dorf" series. <br /> <br /> If you grew up in the 80s, then there are some classic moments in the film that bring to mind. The first video game, from the back when they were fantastic, is always an advantage in my mind. Look for Paul Reubens and his gunshots. There is also a miniature golf course and a roller disco. <br /> <br /> The film is actually a family movie just because vulgarity is almost non-existent, and the small amount of sexual humor is completely innocent. The strange rhythm thanks to the dramatic moments of cheese of the yellow team will put the parents to sleep while their children can laugh at giant melons at Fat Burger (oh, actually they have a special melon dish? Does it have to be, right?)
