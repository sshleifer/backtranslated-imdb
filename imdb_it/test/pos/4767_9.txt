It is now clear that the real golden age of the American film was from the mid-1960s until just before the release of Star Wars. Before that, there was too much Hays Code-constricted pap. With Star Wars, the green light was on for most films to be directed towards children and morons, a practice that continues today. THE SEVEN-UPS, actually, contains a couple of logical lines of dialogue - "We can do it the easy way, or we can do it the hard way" is one - but I'm damned if I can find something else wrong with it . (In fact, that line might not have been refined when this film was made.) THE SEVEN-UPS demonstrates everything that was right with the best films of the golden age: scattered dialogues, realistic acting, real places ( dirty winter New York has never looked better / worse), propulsive stories and, yes, the best car chase ever filmed. Bill Hickman is the driver that Scheider is chasing (you will recognize him from Bullitt), and the structure of the chase is quite similar to that of McQueen, but I prefer the intensity of Scheider's face here, the rhythm, the fantastic close-ups of the pupils and the shocking conclusion. (The VW bug that goes around 2 km / h always annoys me in Bullitt's pursuit.) A score and squeaky Don Ellis score creates the perfect atmosphere. THE SEVEN UPS: sad, gloomy, action-oriented, adult. This is a film that could not be made today; there is no "trick" for the children or an absurd ending. Thank you, Philip D'Antoni, Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco: as long as the police films are watched, THE SEVEN-UPS and his brothers from the 70s (for example, THE FRENCH CONNECTION), will set the standard.
