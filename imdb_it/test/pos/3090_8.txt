As another IMDb reviewer says, "... imagine 2001: A Space Odyssey in the Desert" and you won't be far from a brief summary of what to expect from this piece of cinema (I urge you profoundly to use the word "film"). A conference on philosophical views on creationism, on the myth that surrounds the existence of the humanities, on the before and after, has been, what is and what will be. This for some perhaps a "2001" on the sand, but they face different philosophical points of view, one on evolution and the future, hope and the potential for humanity, while Fata Morgana itself is a more metaphysical path . I just hope to be able to transmit it quite effectively. <br /> <br /> The style of Herzogs will not appeal to everyone and those who are not of an apparent hardcore of cinema vision could, and most likely will find it, difficult to go, and may not even see until its final after 72 minutes. Fusing together a montage of footage from the Sahara, including villages, villagers and various other places for a somewhat surrealistic ending, music of various genres and an almost mythical narrative, Fata Morgana is very slow but ultimately extremely rewarding. <br /> <br /> Opening with a montage of various shots of planes landed for almost five minutes, you already arrive to the introduction of the immensely confused film, and the feeling that this will not be like anything you've seen before that clear echoes in your mind. Divided into three sections, creation, paradise and the golden age, Fata Morgana tries, and succeeds, to succeed in juxtaposing the images of the natural beauty of the desert with the tools created by man that contaminate it. Its three segments are narrated by different people who belong specifically to the particular section that are giving voice and give more emphasis to the long monologues and montages of the desert. <br /> <br /> Fata Morgana is a film that deals with the existence of man our Earth. Observe the natural beauty for which the Earth was designed and, at the same time, looking at the potential beauty that we have inside us, shows us in particular our negative contributions to the world in which we live. Each shot was built on purpose, using what can only be described in the context of this film as "The Holy Trinity Of Film" in images, words and music. Every part of these three pieces provides something in particular with each shot, but when they are joined together they create something larger than all of their parts, creating unbridled beauty and deep thought within our minds. I will not be able to make this film with the justice it deserves with words alone, perhaps if I had the photos and a score, and I know that this will not be appreciated by the masses, but this is profound and I will not use the term "film of art "because it is simply art. This is moving art that moves the mind and arouses the soul. Whether or not creationism is your wish is irrelevant, because this film is about intelligent design.
