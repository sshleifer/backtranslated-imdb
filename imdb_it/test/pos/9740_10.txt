In the 1960s, Cleveland TV audiences could see an episode of "Flash Gordon" as part of the Ghoulardi Show (11:30 PM on Friday). This was the best playful material that none of us had ever seen. We would have regular pajamas (even if we didn't call them that) just to have fun watching this stuff with a group of friends. Then next week we would mention our favorite cornball lines from the last episode. <br /> <br /> Watching it today causes the same reaction. But if you can stop laughing at dialogue, at lame creatures, at foolish costumes and at horrible spaceships long enough, there are some good things that I didn't like the first time. Production designers have created some excellent sets, both rooms and laboratory devices. Charles Middleton's character of Ming the Merciless was the best villain of all time on the screen, certainly up to that point and questionable better than anyone else. Jean Rogers is incredibly beautiful. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
