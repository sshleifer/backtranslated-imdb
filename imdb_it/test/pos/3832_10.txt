This is one of the best episodes of the "Star Trek" series, with Kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to fight with an enemy known only by name. Imagine their surprise when they discover that the feared Romulans are racial offshoots of the Vulcans! The young Mr. Stiles, well played by Paul Comi, is one of the few really unlikely characters in the "Star Trek" universe. His barely disguised hatred of Mr. Spock is strangely similar to the hate and post-9/11 suspicion of many Americans of Arab or Middle Eastern origin. The atmosphere of paranoia in wartime is all too real. Then there are the Romulans: they are the last nemesis of the Federation. The Klingons are evil but fundamentally harmless; more of a nuisance than a serious threat. The Romulans, however, do business: they are the ancient Romans reborn in the space age; despite their Vulcanic features, they are clearly meant to remind us of Imperial Rome, with names like Decius and titles such as "centurion" and "praetor". Chain armor is very beautiful. The famous guest star Mark Lenard, who starred in the role of Spock Sorek's father and Klingon commander in "Star Trek: the film" is an appropriately tired, war-tired commander, a character who bears a striking resemblance to Laurence's Crassus Olivier in "Spartacus". Furthermore, his questioning of the inexhaustible thirst for conquests of the Empire reminds me of the same fears as Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) expressed at the beginning of the "Gladiator". A must for both the Trekkies and epic sword-and-sandal fans.
