Watching "Cold Mountain" gave me the impression that its director, Anthony Minghella, was deliberately trying to outdo himself and his "trying to beat" movie was practically flawless "The English Patient" of 1996. Comparing the two films , the premise is quite similar: we have a passionate love story between two people set in a turbulent period of war and end up treating the war more or less like a disturbance in the background as they try to find each other in each other's arms The main differences of the plot are that Nicole Kidman's character is not married, Jude Law's is a deserter, and the conflict is the American Civil War. <br /> <br /> "Cold Mountain" is, as far as the plot, more watered down and sweeter than saying "The English patient" and is more on the level for people who want a simple love story with a sort of outward turbulence that causes a problem. It is a shorter film, which is an advantage for people with less patience. However, it is not as spectacular or original or truly compelling as "The English Patient". My * unique * complaint about "Cold Mountain" is, incredibly, the love story between the characters of Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). Surprisingly, their love was the least interesting thing in the picture. They don't have a real relationship; we don't feel any real passion coming from them and the passion we see is more physical than emotional. I was more fascinated by the friendship between Nicole Kidman and Oscar winner Renee Zellwegger and also Jude Law's journeys across the country dodging vigilantes and enemy soldiers. If Minghella had reinforced the importance of the love story, then I would have had, I believe, a better image. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is fun even if the love story is not interesting. The Civil War sequences are absolutely fantastic; they are of the modern tradition that show war as horrible and dehumanizing. The re-enactment of the Petersburg campaign, in which tons of explosives were detonated from the underground and then followed by a melee battle is horrible. Minghella does not hesitate to show blood and blood in an artistic and reasonable way, and is not afraid to show victims of innocence and life in these scenes. There are times when women and men are killed, often cross-fire. And there's more. Only the sound design of the film generates tension. There is a scene where Inman and another deserter make a meal by sawing the head of a dead cow. We do not see slicing, but the sound effects of the blade crossing the bones are disgusting. Finally, I must congratulate the cast on the performances. Jude Law was exceptional in the film and earned the Oscar nomination he received. I feel that even Nicole Kidman deserved it, even if her character was a bit superficial. Renee Zellwegger has had most of her personality and fencing atmosphere. And then there are only a few parts that really work to complete this stylistic world by recreating a horrible time in the American past. <br /> <br /> Maybe "Cold Mountain" would have been better as a war movie, but surely it would have been as spectacular as "The English Patient" if his love story had been enhanced and made more passionate by the writers and by the director Anthony Minghella. As it is, it is a very pleasant image, I was not bored and I recommend it. I'm just saying that his love story - though a central point of the plot - is a little sweeter than it should be and all that surrounds him is what really worked.
