The Women is a nice film that talks about women of all ages (but above 30 years old) and their problems in life. Not only men and infidelity, but also relationships with friends and family, time to connect with others, problems with the image, compromising the values, the results of life and finding what will make you really happy. <br /> <br /> It is also about being true to yourself. Many times people will give you advice but will not follow it alone. Have they sometimes created an illusion for themselves, and should you really follow the same path or react based on your feelings now? I really enjoyed this movie. Of course, sometimes he tried to be like Sex & the City, but he probably helped me. The difference here is that it is a bit like the discoveries after the stage of life in which the Sex & the City stars were present - here, most are married or have gone beyond the point of looking for a man. Now, they are trying to find happiness in their marriages and lives. <br /> <br /> Obviously he is not an Oscar competitor, but he is fun and serves the purpose. <br /> <br /> And for the men out there, there was an equal share of men and women in the cinema (most were with their wives / girlfriends), and the men were actually laughing. :)
