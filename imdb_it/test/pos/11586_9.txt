This film tells the story of the real life of Ramon Sampedro, who lived for 27 years lying on the bed after breaking his head, and fights a battle to get legal permission for someone who can help with his death. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem is one of the best actors of his generation. Consider this: you must wear this film only with your face! Incredible that he has not even received an Oscar nomination. Now we can all see that the academy is a joke! The supporting cast was fantastic! Optimist Rosa, her lawyer Julia, the rest of the family ... Everyone has their own opinion that Ramon wants to die. <br /> <br /> Whether for or against euthanasia, put your opinions aside, because this film deserves to be seen by people around the world! In the middle of the film I started crying and didn't stop until the credits were shot. This film is so heartbreaking but also wonderful to watch and I can't wait to see it again. I give him a 9/10, and I think it's by far the best film of the year so far.
