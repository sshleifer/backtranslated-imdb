If I assume you know what this movie is about, I am also forced to assume that you came to this review knowing that you will probably look at it regardless of what I say. If this all sounds true - read on - it's likely that you find some consonance with at least part of this review. If you are undecided or not quite sure what happened in the culture of urban and suburban youth music in the late 70s and early 80s, you should probably read one of the reviews that purports to be objective . <br /> Although I didn't grow up in California, the American punk scene was the first music scene I've ever really lived. At the height of the hardcore I immersed myself between 1979 and 1981. Everyone had a band and the only common denominators between the bands and in fact the members of their audience were: <br /> <br /> * rejection of compliance <br /> <br /> * tolerance and enjoyment of difference <br /> <br /> * a desire to have fun - difficult and fast <br /> <br /> Hairstyles, politics, dislike of authority figures and violent slam ballads were not an integral part of what I felt, even though there were certainly cliques or factions that tended to be intolerant of those who do not dress, speak or act "punk" enough. And there was often a certain amount of unearned credit extended from some of these cliques to those who really tried to live up to the fascist paradigm of anarchists, self-mutilators, angry young cop haters. <br /> <br /> Although the interviews with the punk public in Penelope Spheeris' excellent documentary Cal-Punk "Decline of Western Civilization" present a very narrow view of the subculture that some of us appreciated, the interviews with the bands, club owners, promoters and even security people are much more representative of at least my perspective and memories of the "scene". however, it is possible for those who approach this with prejudices about what punk is to experience this film without having their preconceptions challenged. Unlucky as it is, the fault is only for those who promote, believe or feel comfortable with stereotypes - Not filmmakers. Don't blame the messenger. <br /> <br /> The music presented here will not be for everyone, not even for the most part. It's not the crudest stuff out there, but it's loud, unpleasant, fast and less worried about technology than raw energy. <br /> <br /> For me, seeing the first Black Flag with the singing of Ron Reyes, X, Fear and the Circle Jerks was worth much more than the cost of this difficult movie to get. As much as I like The Germs, see Darby Crash for the casino - and the good guy - that left me a little cold. However, the scenes of Darby playing with his pet tarantula while "Shut Down" kept buzzing in the background were precious. The interview X is also great. <br /> <br /> Spheer's direct documentary style is complemented by wild panoramas and zooms during the musical segments. During interviews, the shot is very well used to provide the context for whatever is said. Considering his experience and budget, Spheeris did what anyone could have had with this film. <br /> <br /> Recommended for those who appreciate what this film actually is, and for those who have forgotten those few years of fun, honest rebellion, without direction, before the American punk was co-opted into another stream within the musical mainstream and stereotypes became more important than the basic philosophy.
