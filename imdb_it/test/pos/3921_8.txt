Actually, before seeing House of Wax, I thought it would simply be a second low-quality teen movie, following in the footsteps of films like The Darkness or Amityville Horror. After attending an advanced presentation on my university campus, I can honestly say that the people of Dark Castle did an excellent job with the task of making a slasher. <br /> <br /> Starting from the usual basic products of a horror film for teenagers like the small group of friends leaving for a road trip, coming across a strange detour that takes them through the back roads of the town, meeting the terrifying locals, after the slow but obligatory back-story, this film really reaches a quick clip. Paris Hilton appears in this film as many already know, but I really have to give it to her for her brave performance. Clearly his acting was not worth an Oscar, but filmmakers use his appearance to the maximum by crushing two brazen satire of her, say, a less noble aspect than the media in this film. Mrs. Hilton also claims the title for the biggest death scene in the film, and not simply because it was her death scene. <br /> <br /> This film is filled to the brim with nervous moments and economic scares, but Jaume Serra has certainly created suspense and quality tension between the characters. The causes of the horror are partly based on the fact that the public takes care of the characters, which we do. Doing the usual buildup followed with a loud noise and camera shot some other scary moments. These standard cinematographic techniques adopted by many previous films are almost perfect with this film and provide many beautiful scares. In reality there is no slow moment after arriving in the small town where the dreaded Wax museum is located. <br /> <br /> This film owes much to many previous films of this and other genres, although I'm not sure how much came from the original 1953 film of the same title. References to films like Texas Chainsaw Masacres, Saw and even Titanic, (see the great scene of Paris Hilton's death and you'll understand what I mean) are common, but in the end the reward will leave you scared and satisfied if you are looking for a good scare with some laughter. Not bad.
