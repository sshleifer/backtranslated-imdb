This is NOT the masterpiece that is Snow White, Cinderella or Bambi, but it is a very sweet, funny, romantic and well done Disney animated film. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, lessons included here for children, and some very appropriate for kiddie-cheek, but there is also a lot for adults. <br /> <br /> Although this is a bit of a regurgitation of the Classic Disney RomCom Adventure, it still holds some elements, which belong exclusively to the AristoCats. O'Malley is the "tramp" and Dutchess is the "lady", but Dutchess has several kittens and everyone is trying to get home. <br /> <br /> Phil Harris is our cat O'Malley. You can recognize his voice, as he also provided the voice of Baloo the Bear in the jungle book and Little John in Disney's Robin Hood. Eva Gabor lends her sweet voice to the Dutchess. <br /> <br /> Directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, who directed, or worked on, every Disney animated film worth mentioning until his death in 1985. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite Disney movies and belongs to any Disney collection. The special 2-Disk edition is scheduled for this summer (2007). <br /> <br /> The rate is an 8.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
