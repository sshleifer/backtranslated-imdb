This short film intends to focus on one of the sociological problems known as culture shock. the film presents the condition of an average Romanian in democratic Romania who discovers that life and problems are no different from the communist period, and if you want something, you have to corrupt it to get it. <br /> <br /> So, our main character is fired after a long time, is around 50 years old and needs to get a similar job, but the only job available is a lower one. He is forced to take it because the lack of money. <br /> <br /> My opinion is that you have to live in Romania so that this film can be the truest and most tragic it may seem.
