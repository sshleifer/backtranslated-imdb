Overall, I liked the Scarlett movie. I'm a big fan of Gone with the Wind. I read the book and saw the classic movie many times. I also have a small collection of ornaments by Rossella O'Hara and other things. I have to admit that Gone with the Wind is my favorite book and movie of all time. Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable are remarkable actors and two of my favorites. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to read the Scarlett book, but I was excited to see the film. Actually, the film is not close to the level of Gone with the Wind nor the actors. However, Joan Whalley Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were pleasant actors in the roles and on many occasions Joan played like Vivian Leigh in her portrait of Scarlett. Dalton also played Rhett sometimes. It took some time to get used to the different actors, but overall I loved it, being the fan of Gone With the Wind as I am. One of the biggest disappointments was that Joan didn't have green eyes and Rossella O'Hara and Vivian Leigh did both. I also found the Lord Fenton absolutely terrifying and I didn't like his character. If you are a fan of the Wind and / or enjoy romantic stories, watch the movie Scarlett. However, don't expect it to be as noticeable as Gone with the Wind. It is far from it even though it is interesting with the new characters and so on. I'm glad it's not a remake and some of the events in the story were the ones I imagined the sequel to the love story of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. If you haven't seen it today, take it tomorrow? After all, tomorrow is another day. :)
