I remember seeing this film when it came out and I still remember the "buzz" I heard when I left the cinema. Everything about this film is magnificent! The music is top notch and I still play the soundtrack after all these years. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie so many times yet I still want to see it again and again. Nicholas Cage was great and every time I see Cameron Dye in something nowadays, I always associate him with this movie. Too bad the rest of the cast didn't go any further, but maybe it's part of the charm of this movie. <br /> <br /> I will not criticize the film school because I am sure that all the analysts out there may find fault if they wanted to, but what I will say is that this film has defined my adolescence and continues to influence my life over 20 years later. The film "feels" great and arouses emotions when you look at it (well ... it did it for me) and I can't recommend it well enough for anyone who hasn't seen it yet. <br /> <br /> Either you take the movie or you don't! Those of you who "get it" will be rewarded with a unique cinematic experience.
