Giant Robot was the most popular Japanese TV series ever seen on Indian TV. It was intended for children and we saw a robot for the first time in our lives. <br /> <br /> Many Indian children must have seen a car for the first time outside of school textbooks. <br /> <br /> The serial also showed a child in an adult organization that fights evil. Undoubtedly, many of us who have seen Robot Giant in our childhood for a long time for our robots and as an arrangement for stalling, look at our computers in the same way. <br /> <br /> This show also portrayed ideal adults, (referring to Jerry, a friend of Johnny's friend and the unicorn chief Azuma). We have grown in respect of Japanese progress and consider Japan as the ideal Asian nation. <br /> <br /> BTW, at that time, there were no satellite TV channels in India and the government-owned broadcaster did not show much of the Disney cartoons. I imagine it was the way children's magazines like the giant robot were appreciated. Nowadays there are Pokemon etc. But they are not as fascinating or seductive as giant robots.
