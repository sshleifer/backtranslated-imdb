I agree with "johnlewis", who said that there is a lot to do between the lines in this film. While I think that the rhythm of this film can be improved, I think the complexity of the relationships between the characters is fascinating. <br /> <br /> Examples: <br /> <br /> Is Pierre going to marry his cousin, even though his love for her seems very cousin? <br /> <br /> Pierre and his stepmother have a rather ... curious relationship. <br /> <br /> Pierre, Lucie and Thibault seem to have a triangular relationship, and the real points of the triangle are not entirely sure ... <br /> <br /> Lucie's brother is a bit of a eunuch , or is he? <br /> <br /> And Isabelle, who is she really ?? <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it's worth my time. An interesting film that makes me want to read Melville.
