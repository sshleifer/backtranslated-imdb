Start a little slow, but give it a chance. In the spirit of the "Wackiest Ship in the Arm" and the "Pink Sub", this film is about a not-so-orthodox group engaged in not so orthodox methods to defeat everyone. Rob Schneider is priceless as an LT that takes itself too seriously, which translates into a failed mutiny attempt and the "pirate" crew makes him walk on the axis. On the contrary Kelsey Grammar (similar to Cary Grant) does not take anything serious except work. This film speaks more of the lines than of the plot. From the "giggled" fisherman in the port of Charleston to the "whale" call, their antics caught me by surprise and I laughed loudly.
