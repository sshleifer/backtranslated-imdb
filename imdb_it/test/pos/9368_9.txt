A film like Crossfire puts another film that spreads around his social conscience - that is, the recent film Crash - almost ashamed. Not necessarily because one of them puts forward his message of intolerance-is-rotten in a more meaningful way (although I would bet that Crash throws the hammer much more often compared to this), but because of how the narrative and the ploys never get much like with Crash. Perhaps it is not really necessary to compare the two, given that Crossfire is in its core all deep in the vein of the film-noir as if it were out of fashion. It was really interesting to see what director Edward Dmytryk said in the DVD interview, where he mentioned that the budget for photography was significantly lower (on purpose) so that more could be spent on the actors, and the program a very lively and fast pace was achieved. But then what comes out of being unbelievable about the image is that you'd think to look at many of the light sets that took a lot of things to do. Just for a small scene, like when Robert Mitchum's Keeely goes for the first time to question under Captain Robert Young - the contrasts of seamless shadows in the room are exquisite. Let there be many other lighting systems that go even further, with so few signs that this is something essential in the realm of the aspect of the noir period. Just take a look at a series of characters on a stairwell, the bars that stand out against them, and see what I mean. <br /> <br /> But going back to the substantial part of the film - it really is a story that consists of a mysterious murder, but that we as an audience don't get to understand the answer much. It is therefore something else, therefore, in the mind and soul of a killer who will not find himself in a common criminal framework, since there are really no "criminals" for the most part in the film. There is a very calculated risk with this, so that the characters could be too thin just to support the (useful) message against anti-Semitism. But Dmytryk's management of his top-level cast, along with a truly fantastic script by John Paxton, embody the characters, least of all for what they should not seem too thin next to the message. And what then would a noir be without a certain aptitude to get along? Mitchum helps him, even in scenes like the one between him and Young, in which he relies heavily on the situation of the moment in history (that is, a detail in the plot), injecting some playful wit into some of the dialogues. It may already be there in the lines, but it helps to make the character with a good margin for his scenes. <br /> <br /> Then there is also Robert Ryan, who excels in Montgomery as a man you know you don't wear at the beginning I really like, only through his bs demeanor, but you're not entirely sure. Then, once it starts to become clearer - ironically through a subjective point of view of suspect Mitchell (George Cooper) in the Samuels' apartment, which will soon become deceased - his performance becomes a great balancing act of being full of shit and also quite frightening in its blind way. It is a good performance when it is also countered with Cooper, who has real personal problems that he faces and comes forward with regret and humility. It is really after the end of the film that one thinks of a lot of this, however, and while watching the film it is more a question of entering the dialogue and the flow of the scenes, and in the filming sometimes dirty and oppressive on the actors, then the message is in a certain sense secondary. Not that it's not important, especially for the period (coming right after the Second World War), but years later he sees the actors, even those who don't get the great marquee status like Gloria Grahame as Ginny (the femme fatale of the photo, if had had time for something that is not so) and William Phipps as Leroy ("the hick"), working with one another that sticks very strongly in the compact script. <br /> <br /> Dmytryk is also very wise in choosing to limit the musical score is also powerful, given that for very long strokes we do not hear anything, and especially when it occurs it is incidental around the character. He could easily have gone with the musical notes added on some dramatic scenes to emphasize, especially the opening audience, entering the film. By avoiding this and obtaining the right attitudes and nuances in the room and in the cast, the standards of the genre material are raised to a very fine and memorable level. My favorite scene would probably go to Finley's story about an Irish immigrant telling in Leroy, where all these elements are good. It may not get very high in my favorites noir - and I would continue to throw Murder My Sweet like the director's masterpiece in this kind of photo - but it's definitely higher quality than something too high B level.
