I feel the warmth of Niiiiiight! Feel your HEEAAAAAAAAAART-beat! "Something's not right!" Thematic song written by BJ Cook of the old band and wife of Skylark-David Foster, who also wrote the memorable theme of CBC's "Airwaves". OH Night Heat! What a program! Well written, well acted and totally classic, crime solvers and a good team and a bit of humor in the end I'd like to think that this is really what detectives do / Giambone was a real favorite! On a Canadian tip, I learned EVERY Canadian actor name and style from a guest spot made on Night Heat. Everyone went through the Night Heat set and as Law & Order, was guided by the plot so you could just watch and have fun without a lot of character melodrama.
