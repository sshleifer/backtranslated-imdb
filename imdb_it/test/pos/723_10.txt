Set mostly in the back streets of Toronto, NG is a dark and mysterious journey that takes the viewer into the minds of a young man and woman (Vern and Sarah), each of whom has the charm of enigmas and a disastrous accident in their past . Sophisticated dialogues and first-rate castings push this noirish and low-key journey into the search for the girl of meaning behind the word puzzles that continue to appear in her life.
