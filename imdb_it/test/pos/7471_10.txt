Really a good movie ... I came across it in the video store and I rented it because Aaron Eckhart (in the company of men and your friends and neighbors) was inside as well as Paulina Porizcova ... The adorable SI's former swimsuit model is naked in the film, but that's just one of the many reasons to rent it ... It's very exciting, and the character's development is fantastic ... Eckhart is one of the most underrated actors who works, and steals this movie ... It's very dark and violent, but I enjoyed it immensely ....
