Lady and the tramp ii: scamp's adventure I think it's a good movie, but I think the first lady and the tramp movie are better because it's the original and I think the original films compared to the sequues are better. Lady and the tramp ii start after the original, but this time it's junior's turn, the young man from Lady and Tramp (scamp) always hates the same with the things that have to be done with him, following the rules at home, doing the Bath the whole time and take things nice and easy, Scamp gets angry and runs away with a bunch of dogs that have stayed out of trouble. Scamp meets another dog named Angel, they both get along and do the things that his father's mom and dad did, having an Italian meal (Spagetthi and meatballs etc.) Later, Scamp realizes he's loved by his family in particular from his friend, who is the child, the way out returns and Angel joins the family. I give this film 10 out of 10.
