I felt that this film had a lot of heart and must have been a labor of love for Eleanor Bergstein. The main actors (Campbell Scott, Jennifer Beals, Yancy Butler, James Goodwin III, Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron) have been very well selected and have played their parts with excellence. It was a very uplifting film that I wish would be available on tape or DVD. A rare gem.
