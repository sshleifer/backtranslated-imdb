The 70s are often considered a golden age of British television comedy, a period that saw numerous classic sitcoms and sketched shows like "Monty Python's Flying Circus". The period, however, was not emphatically a golden age of British film comedy, and what worked well on television rarely moved successfully to the big screen. The most triumphant exceptions to this rule were provided by the Python, but their best films ("Monty Python and the Holy Grail" and "Brian's life") were very different in their conception to their television program. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the adaptation of cinema sitcoms is that the concepts designed to adapt to the BBC's 30-minute slots (25 minutes on ITV, which must find space for commercials) do not always they work well when they expand into a three or four long movie. Few people will remember the film versions of "Up Pompei!" or "Steptoe and Son" with the same affection as the TV versions. In the case of many classic television comedies ("Some Mothers Do 'Ave' Em", "Yes, Minister", "Fawlty Towers", "The Goodies") no attempt was made to take them back, so we can be grateful. Characters like Frank Spencer by Michael Crawford or Basil Fawlty by John Cleese can be hilarious in half-hour doses, but I doubt they'll be funny for two hours. A comic program (although a dramatization of a comic novel rather than a sitcom in the normal sense) that could have worked in the cinema was "The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin", but the hopes of a film were dashed by the tragically precocious death of his star Leonard Rossiter. <br /> <br /> "Dad's Army" was one of the few television sitcoms of the period that was turned into a decent movie. (About the only other one I can think of was "Porridge"). This was probably because he had an unusually large number of well-developed characters and derived most of his humor from the interactions between them. The original sitcom ran between 1968 and 1977 and related the misadventures of a National Guard platoon in the small coastal town of Walmington-on-Sea. (The National Guard, initially known as the local Defense Volunteers, was an auxiliary militia during World War II composed mostly of men too old to serve in regular forces). The film version is a drama in three acts. Act I concerns the formation of the platoon and the recruitment of its members. In the second act they cause havoc during an army training exercise. In the third act they succeed in capturing a group of Nazi airmen whose plane was shot down. <br /> <br /> The three key players in this drama are the platoon commander, Captain George Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe), and his two subordinates Sergeant Arthur Wilson (John Le Mesurier) and Corporal Jack Jones (Clive Dunn). Mainwaring, who in the civil life is the manager of the local bank, is a little fussy man who looks at the world through a pair of thick glasses. It is he who takes the initiative to form the National Guard unit and who is named his commander. It is pompous, official, with an exaggerated sense of its importance and its powers of command, the kind of man who does not suffer fools willingly. (And in George Mainwaring's world view the term "crazy" covers most of the rest of the human race). However, it has its good qualities. He is motivated by genuine patriotic idealism and is capable of great physical courage, shown in his encounter with the Germans. <br /> <br /> Wilson is Mainwaring's deputy bank. The two men have a very different character, something emphasized by a difference in appearance, Wilson is tall and thin while Mainwaring is low and robust. He turns out to be smarter and more educated than his boss. (His accent suggests that he could be a former public schoolboy). Nevertheless, he ended up playing the second violin in both civil and military life, probably because he has a sort of passive personality that leads to pessimism and defeatism and the inability to take anything seriously. Jones is an old soldier who now runs the local butcher shop. (His promotion to Caporale is mainly due to his ability to corrupt the Mainwaring with black market sausages). His enthusiasm for his new role is matched only by his incompetence and ability to cause chaos. Although his slogan is "Don't panic!" is prone to panic at all times. <br /> <br /> There are many other members of the platoon. Private Fraser, the austere Scottish impresario, is even more pessimistic than Wilson. (Catchphrase: "We are condemned, man, DOOMED!"). Private Godfrey is a kind old man whose main concern is where the nearest cabinet is located. The Private Walker is a sharp Cockney spiv and Private Pike (another bank employee), a spoiled mom boy. (Pike's mother is Wilson's lover, although Wilson tries to keep this connection secret from disapproving Mainwaring). Two significant outsiders are the mild Vicar and the Guardian ARP, the hated enemy of Mainwaring and rather his equal with pomposity and honesty. <br /> <br /> There are occasional enthusiastic double meanings ("Keep your hands away from my intimates" - Mainwaring apparently refers to those soldiers holding that rank), rather than on the TV show which was surprisingly devoid of allusions. (Its creators, David Croft and Jimmy Perry, would later continue to create comedies such as "Are You Being Served?" And "Hi-de-hi", which were famous for suggestive humor). The film, however, retains much of the mixture of gentle spirit, nostalgia and strong characterization that made the TV series so successful. 7/10
