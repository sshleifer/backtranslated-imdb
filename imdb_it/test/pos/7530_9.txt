I just saw this movie, and I have to say that it surprised me. It was very well done, with good acting and a deep look at high school students from Japan, in adolescent love. <br /> <br /> The appearance is very different from many films, and you can easily enter the film. Much of the emphasis seems to be in history itself, which is extremely subtle. The main theme and relationships with other characters are a bit complex. But the general sense of realism and size still attracts you. <br /> <br /> A main attraction is obviously, for those who like something simple. Which is not here You have to be open to many things, including a new culture, to get more out of the film. <br /> <br /> I still liked this movie. Worth watching.
