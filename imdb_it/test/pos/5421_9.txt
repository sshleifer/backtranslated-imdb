This is a very strange short film that initially did not impress me. From a purely aesthetic point of view, the animation here is certainly not pretty, although after a while one notices that the simple and foolish designs possess a certain strange charm. This is probably because with such a compelling script, the animation works. <br /> <br /> The film shows an elderly couple sitting at the table playing Scrabble. At the same time they are fixed on this game or other bizarre research (such as the husband's compulsion to see things - even the chair and the table)! And all these things happen while the television warns of outstanding atomic annihilation - Armageddon is definitely here! Of course, the neighbors are screaming and running - during which the couple continues incessantly with this idiotic game. Heck, even their cat knows that the end is coming while the couple starts arguing about who can or can't have cheated - leading to a really surreal ending !! The film deserves my appreciation both for its uniqueness and for being a lot of fun. Although he did not win the Oscar, he was nominated for the best animated short film - which he well deserved.
