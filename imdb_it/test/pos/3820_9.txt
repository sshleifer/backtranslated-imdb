I saw this show a few times when I was young and played on tilt, my parents loved it and now in syndication I feel what they feel. This show did what the original limits and the twilight zone (old and new) could not do. This show used some old ideas and some really original ideas. <br /> <br /> I still can't believe that Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright did it. Those guys were producers on the stargate sg-1. The show kept the audience rooted in the story and created a truly scary atmosphere. This is what was not there in the new twilight zone. The arrival of Rod serling added to fear, the oncoming forest lightened the mood. <br /> <br /> The ending if good or bad done for a scary time. You could never predict what will happen. I'm still trying to find the seasons on DVD.
