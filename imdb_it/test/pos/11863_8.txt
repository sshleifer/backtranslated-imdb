Every guy Liv Tyler meets his head on her, not, of course, without a little encouragement from Liv. Liv is at his best, with Matt Dillon in first place among the paramours. An interesting initial premise, to tell the story from the point of view of each dupe, degenerates into a final in a sitcom style (not unlike Blame It On Rio, with which it has more than a few similarities). It is worth looking at anyway.
