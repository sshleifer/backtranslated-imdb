Nelson is a professor of medicine who wants his four students to kill him and then bring him back to life so that he can prove there is an afterlife. So they do and soon enough all medical students want to know if there is a life after death. The afterlife is not about pearly gates and lights at the end of the tunnel, but something more sinister. The ghosts of the past come back to haunt them and surely this movie will haunt anyone. It has some pretty scary moments that could translate into real life and make people think about what happens when you die. It's a good movie to see when it rains and you feel down. It's also a bit strange. <br /> <br /> Look at it with a haunted past.
