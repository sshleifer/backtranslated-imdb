SO good, acting, cutting, directing in there can't be the best ever, but the dance, moves, warmth and passion in this film is definitely the best (well ... at least for me ^^ ) really touched me, inspired me to learn to dance. in particular I registered on this site only to be able to vote and contribute to my support for this film. for this film it literally gave me goose bumps when I saw it. I love it. Jennifer Gray is so cute! Patrick is so sexy in there !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the first thing I will do tomorrow, while I am going to university, will be to jump to the video store and buy a copy, or look at it again until I am older and have not danced with the movie . sooner than I would need to learn ALL THE DANCE MOVES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
