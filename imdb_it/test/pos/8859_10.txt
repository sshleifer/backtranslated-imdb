John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it the maximum possible respect, the only difference is that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoid core of John W Campbell Jr.'s story. The secret of the success of this version is the unbearable tension that is accumulates when the group of men becomes suspicious of each other, the tension of literally waiting to be taken over takes a terrible grip. Carpenter manages to deliver the shocks and mystery necessary to keep the film heading in the right direction. Whether it's a horrible scene or a "what's in the shadows" sequence, for me the film is a perfect fusion of horror and science fiction. The dialogue is perfect for a group of men trying to keep it together under duress, and Carpenter's soundtrack is a wonderful, disturbing heartbeat that further strengthens the sense of ruin and paranoia that runs through the film. The cast is superb, a solid assembly of actors led by Carpenter was chosen by Kurt Russell, while the effects used give the right dose of impact. But above all it is the ending that is the final glory, an ending that does not comply with the norm and is incredibly suitable for what happened before, let's wait and see what really happens, 10/10.
