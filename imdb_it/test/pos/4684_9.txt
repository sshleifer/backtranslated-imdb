In recent months I have seen many reviews for The Italian Job, many of them negative. The essence of almost all these pessimistic criticisms is that, despite all its modernist bravado and high-budget technology, the film doesn't have much substance where it counts. Look, folks, it's just a funny movie. This is the kind of photo where you have to sit down, relax and enjoy the constant pace of the film. Like Ocean's Eleven (2001), you can focus on characters and plot at the same time without having to think much (lucky for some of us). Of course, "Ocean" is a better film, but who cares? The plot could have some holes (there's a huge one about 3/4 of the way), the action might not be as gratifying as the trailers did, and some of the dialogues might seem useless and stylistic, but of new, who really cares? Fantastic characters, Mini Coopers, big explosions, Charlize Theron. What do you want more? I think it's time to abandon the fake Roger Ebert meets the act of Gene Shalit and have fun for once! Oh, and another thing, whatever you do, don't compare it to the original because, to reiterate what F. Gary Gray told the press a million times, THIS IS NOT A REMEDY !! My advice: if you are interested in getting your way through a fun and entertaining film, don't worry about seeing The Italian Job. But if you don't have a serious inferiority complex and / or want to see Ed Norton being taken by a group of Ukrainians, go ahead. The Bottom Line, my movie partners, is: Lighten and have fun, damn it.
