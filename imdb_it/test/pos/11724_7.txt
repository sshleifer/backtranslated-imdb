Burt Reynolds' response to Clint Eastwood invading his red comedy with his orangutan comedies was to create his Dirty Harry in the Chicago thriller, Sharky's Machine. Originally intended for John Boorman but ultimately directed by the star itself, it is a real commercial package with Reynolds a narcot who gets caught by the Vice Squad (literally - I'm in the basement) who aims to nail down a mysterious crime lord he's supporting Earl Holliman as next governor. You can guess the rest, but while Reynolds tends to lose sight of the story, he sometimes has a good eye for individual scenes and almost gets a performance from Rachel Ward as a high-class actress for whom he falls. The romantic subplot is unusually well developed, there are a couple of good action scenes and some nice touches, like having Vittorio Gassman's bad lookalike a mirror image of the hero or Reynolds and a killer both of whom beat an apartment witness adjacent in the same building. One of the star's best films from his glory days, it's not a classic but makes a special Saturday night more than efficient.
