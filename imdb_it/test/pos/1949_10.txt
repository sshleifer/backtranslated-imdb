I didn't expect much from this movie, it was just one of those films that I thought I would only watch because it was on television. I certainly underestimated this film. <br /> <br /> This is a guy who kills his girlfriend and prides himself on his friends. I was very happy with the acting, they played the characters well. It was a particularly beautiful scene when Feck (Dennis Hopper) and John (Daniel Roebuck) talk to each other about why John killed Jamie. It's shocking to hear how he explains he wanted to feel in control and that's why. But Feck had loved the girl he had killed. Feck felt remorse as John felt nothing, and he was proud of what he had done. It really makes you think about people. Keanu Reeves did a great job as Matt, and Ione Skye was good. It is strange to see her as a valedictoriana in "Say Anything" and in her as Clarissa. Every actor has done great things ... acting. It was really nice for a change. It was a great movie and I would definitely recommend it.
