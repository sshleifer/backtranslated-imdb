The Monkees, surprisingly, are one of my favorites. Yes, they could have been the original rock band produced; a gimmick that has certainly achieved success in the 21st century. However, their music holds up as some of the best that the 60s have to offer. Last Train To Clarksville, Daydream Believer, I'm A Believer, (I'm Not) Stewart. Even though they weren't great musicians or songwriters, they had a nice onscreen presence and lots of charm and some of their stuff was really decent. Their T.V. it's dated in 2007, but I watch the show on some occasions as a time capsule in which to live in 1966-1968; that magical and dangerous moment in US history. <br /> <br /> However, as we all know, as a marvel of things that will come for characters like Kelly Clarkson, The Monkees didn't want to be considered fabricated and just puppets for their record company. Despite their average talent, they wanted to write their own songs, produce their own albums and call the shots when it came to touring. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a disaster; especially when the choice of Peter Tork by Jimi Hendrix as an opening act was clear due to his stealing of the show and the strong sexual suggestions in his music compared to the G-Rated content of The Monkees. <br /> <br /> However, the last nail in the Monkees coffin (until 1986) was the infamous movie Head. The head was written by Bob Rafelson and Jack Nicholson while they were supposedly tall on the Mary-Jane. The film received negative reviews and earned only $ 16,000 at the box office. Today, the film is a cult classic, ahead of its time and offers a message about what was in the minds of young people in 1968, The Summer Of Anger. <br /> <br /> Head has no plot. Basically, from one to four of The Monkees staggers from scene to scene without any rhyme or reason. They go from eating at a diner, to seeing Davy Jones being beaten by Sonny Liston, to a Westerner, being sucked into the void, performing at a concert and so on. The film basically offers oblique opinions about what was wrong with American society. The Monkees affect mercantilism, the war in Vietnam, American politics, censorship, the establishment and greed. You have to read between the lines to see what the targets of derision are. <br /> <br /> The Monkees spend a lot of time stuck in certain intersections of the film, symbolizing how they heard their record company seeing them; like nothing more than toys to play with when it was time to record another hit album. A scene in which they are outnumbered 16-4 in the western scene could be a symbol of them against session musicians, songwriters, record producers and anything else that controlled their careers and cannon shooting at them is their way of saying "Begone!" . <br /> <br /> The film is truly a psychedelic journey to contemplate. The eye-catching tie-dye colors, the hypnotic concert and the belly dance scenes and the drugged images are everywhere. The acting is actually very good, but this is prevented as I like the show Monkees T.V. A small soundtrack features "The Porpoise Song" and three songs written by The Monkees themselves. <br /> <br /> The film actually has some hilarious scenes on the occasion; although maybe they shouldn't have been. Mickey Dolenz, who hit a coke machine that didn't give him a soda or his violent punch-ups in the boxing scene (I mean, he was a muscular guy who probably weighed no more than 135) made me laugh. /> <br /> All in all, this film is a must for Monkees fans. I think many people will feel that this film is really "over their head", but for those obsessed by the 60s and by society at that time they will find an exceptional capsule.
