I thought this is a wonderfully written film. I love little Scamp and Angel on the street. This film is very easy to understand for the little ones, but also a good movie for adults. I liked this movie because it continues the original Lady and the Tramp, and that movie is a classic. Lady and the Tramp 2 Scamp's Adventure was full of new characters, catchy songs, brilliant animations and unforgettable classic characters. I've loved the movie since I first saw it. I also loved the way they showed the different personalities of each character. Also show the falls and the good things to create new friends with which you can go out. My favorite song from the movie was Always there because it showed the different characters that shared their opinions on how they felt. I highly recommend this film for all those who were fans of the original Lady and tramp.
