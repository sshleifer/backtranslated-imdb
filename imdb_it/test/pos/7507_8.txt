Dr. Bock teaches in the hospital and he is pretty good. The thing about him is that he is depressed. Dr. Bock and his wife separate, his children are deviant, he can't perform in the bedroom and he feels like he's not doing a great job healing people. Become a suicide but meet Barbara who changes her ideas for the better. Around this story there is a mysterious murder and a group of angry protesters outside. <br /> <br /> The film is well done and the character of Dr. Bock is well interpreted. It's a bit sad, a little funny and a little dramatic. It was nice to see a couple of stories wrapped around the hospital even though they were somehow unrelated to what Dr. was doing. Bock. Great movie.
