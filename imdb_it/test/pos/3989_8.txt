I've always liked this movie, I've seen it many times but I've always liked it :) the story is interesting and special. But the only thing I disagree with is that I don't think Max lived in a Romanian monastery or what it was: P They don't look like that in Romania. However, returning to the story, Ghita Muresan played quite well but as someone said before me, his English needs to improve. <br /> <br /> And there have been some fun moments and even some tragic / sad parts. It's worth seeing, I thought it was sweet that the giant wanted to find his love. I have recommended to you all. It is not the best film ever, but it was beautiful!
