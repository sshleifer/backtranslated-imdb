This joke of 30 minutes per minute is best understood by Catholics, the number one religion of comedians in the world. This does not mean that it cannot stand alone, which it does, that the film is not without flaws, which has been obtained. Technical problems, in large part: I thought that in 1998 digital was the answer when in reality it was in its infancy - a Beta of Beta if you want it, and re-mastering will never improve. For the love of God, Hal ... please take a Red One. Or three. <br /> <br /> If you like Hartley movies, of course, you'll like it. I liked it, because I liked the Grim / Matto, and there were further benefits of the retrospective: I couldn't help but notice a prophetic self-prophecy, an airliner that soared high up, used as an omen of Armageddon in this movie from 1998. It was as if Cheney had gotten the whole idea from Hal. It's true - Hartley moves his players into the camera as if it were the House of Commons, just a piece of the gimmick that needs rest. After all, we're already paying attention to the actors and the writing is alive. It's not good writing, but ... fervent. Can I use the word fervent? Purposeful, intelligent, not condescending. <br /> <br /> I love PJ Harvey in this, of course I would love it everywhere. Strangely, if Helen Mirren needs a younger self, she should look at Harvey and bring a bottle of blond.
