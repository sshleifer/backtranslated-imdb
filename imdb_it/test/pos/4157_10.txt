This film is an impressionist and poetic impression of the experience of immigrants, a reflective look at the turmoil and fear that could be associated with emigration. These aspects are not often considered in emigration films in America in particular and in any other country in general and the film vividly and convincingly describes the nervousness and enthusiasm, if ignorance, that poor illiterate Sicilian immigrants have in anticipation of their emigration to the United States. <br /> <br /> They have some fantastic and unrealistic notions about the United States that are scattered throughout the journey. One is that the rivers run with milk, an image that is represented in the film with a poetic and impressionistic effect. The film has no sound and the silence seems to reflect the discomfort of ignorance that the locals have about life in America, or if not ignorance, a vision significantly colored by superstition and fantasy. <br /> <br /> That said, the film describes with astonishing realism, the boat trip to the United States and the assumption process that arrivals at Ellis Island had to suffer. The boat ride is imagined as rather boring which surely was most of the time. The neighborhoods in which the arriving residents sleep are depicted as extremely crowded, with beds spaced four or five inches apart and devoid of much light, which was certainly the case below. <br /> <br /> Once again, the film is not complemented by excessive music or overly bright lighting and the effect is to create a fairly realistic image of what it really was for the people who emigrate to the States US. The villagers may not be worldly, but they are quite reasonable, and the interaction with the eldest emigrant, Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) with the immigration officer who insists on particular results, is rather bittersweet as they are not diluted or sweetened for the benefit of a syrupy conclusion and we see the fusion of the realism of Sicily with the extensive regulations that guide life in the United States. <br /> <br /> Immigrants and their history are very interesting and the combination of cold realism of the eyes and the magical fantasy of people's imaginations create a persuasive vision of the beliefs of the Sicilians, or of any other person, with poor formal education moving to the United States. Acting is similarly barebones; it is not at all demonstrative or flashy, but it seems the most realistic for this. Having said that, all the main interpreters, in particular Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato), the clear leader of the group is excellent. While not smiling, the actions of his character speak much stronger and it is clear that (fortunately) the other members of the group, his two sons and the elderly Fortunata, the grandmother of the boys, have confidence in his ability to command and respect its clear command. Amato imbues his character with great decency and frankness and is a testament to his abilities that his character appears so capable and confident while his character betrays very few emotions. <br /> <br /> An oddity in the film is a chance encounter with a mysterious English woman (the excellent and appropriately mysterious Charlotte Gainsbourg) who speaks Italian and, throughout the film, we wonder why she goes to the United States or what connection does it have with the group of Sicilian emigrants otherwise unanimously. Eventually this is finally revealed and the revelation is performed in a realistic way and does not seem particularly melodramatic or flashy. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Emmanuel Crialese who has a solid understanding of the realistic, sometimes superstitious, vision of the world in which his characters live and present it with competence and confidence. In fact, he's incredibly confident, given the way in which realism and superstition could have been combined in the film. It is a worthy examination of the immigrant experience.
