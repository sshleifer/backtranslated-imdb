I bought this DVD from Walmart cheaply, thinking it would be a typical, crappy monster of straight video monsters, but it turned out much better than expected. There's really no criticism about it ... it's obviously a low budget, but that only adds to the old-fashioned fun. It's very beautiful and fun. <br /> <br /> There is everything: horror, sex, a great plane crash and good characters. And I'd say it's pretty original, because it doesn't really come out like any other movie I've seen. He has his unique look, which I really liked, that's why this film deserves credit. I can't wait to see more of these fantastic "The Scare Master" films, Brett Piper, which I've never heard before. <br /> <br /> The DVD menu is really creative with groovy music playing, so it's just perfect to keep it on when you're not ready to sit down and watch it. It also includes some special features, which are really interesting. But we can never see the director or listen to him in the comment, we must be shy. This comes from Edgewood Studios in Vermont, USA. I highly recommend it to all horror fans, you will love it!
