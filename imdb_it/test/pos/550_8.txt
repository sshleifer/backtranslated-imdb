My one-line summary suggests that this is not a good movie, but it's not true. I liked the movie, but I probably expected too much. <br /> <br /> Adele, who is played solidly by Susan Sarandon, has not become a very nice character. She is agitated and irresponsible for what would be an unforgivable degree were it not for the enormous love she has for her daughter. This is the only thing he knows how to do without fail. Adele's daughter, Anna, is a sad girl who is so busy remedying the shortcomings of her mother that she doesn't seem to be only 14-17 years old. This, of course, makes Natalie Portman the perfect choice to play Anna since she never seems to be between 14 and 17 years old. Portman extracts this role so easily that you almost forget that he hasn't been making films for 20 years. Yet, even with the two solid protagonists, Wayne Wang never seems to attract the public as he did with The Joy Luck Luck and even more so with Smoke. Although I haven't read the book, the film seems to have made the necessary changes to the story to bring it to the big screen, changes that could empty the emotional pungency of the story. I liked the film for the fun of seeing two wonderful actresses do their job, but I never lost myself in the experience and I never related their situation.
