My husband dragged me into this movie because I had no interest in seeing some Anime cartoons. I was absolutely delighted by the simple story and fantastic animation. In a digital world where effects are generated by the computer, it was nice to see fantastic and imaginative hand-drawn animations. The world of Sosuke and Ponyo is a vivid land of fantasy mixed with minimal reality. I haven't seen animations like this since I was a child and it's wonderful to see it last and be successful. <br /> <br /> The actors who provide the voices in the English version were fabulous. The duration of the film was PERFECT, especially for children who tend to become furious in films. Overall, a delicious experience is worth the very expensive ticket prices we have nowadays.
