This is really a movie that you have to see twice. When I first saw this film I was really drawn to the story. While most of the story takes place inside a hotel room, the stories that Buddy (Nick Drake, wonderful allusion) and Daphne share bring you out of their room and into their world. Through their conversations you understand the loneliness and the pain that everyone feels. The soundtrack perfectly accompanies the film, dark, lo-fi and intriguing. When you see the movie the second time, you can collect all the clues you lost the first time, until you reach one of the best endings I've seen in a long time. I hope to see this movie find a distributor for the DVD so that it is more accessible. Great movie, you won't be disappointed.
