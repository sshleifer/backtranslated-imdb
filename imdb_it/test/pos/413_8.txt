The legendary horror and arrogant movie star Conrad Radzoff (beautifully played by Ferdy Mayne's sardonic evil aplomb) dies of a heart attack. A group of dramatic school students steals Radzoff's corpse from its crypt and takes it to a dilapidated villa so they can celebrate with it. Radzoff comes back to life and chooses rude young men for having desecrated his tomb. Writer / director Norman Thaddeus Vane elaborates a fresh, original, and also rather elegant spin on the usual premise of the body, offers an elegant evocation of the sparkling Hollywood environment, and does a robust job to maintain a pleasantly hazy and spooky ooga atmosphere -booga. The killed pieces deliver the gruesome products, with a focused girl, a succulent beheading (the severed head rolls down the stairs and onto the lawn so a crow can catch him!), And another poor girl is crushed with an evaluation of the levitating coffin as obvious point macabre. The compliments are also for the stellar cast of the familiar faces of the B-flick: Mayne has a delicious ball with his flashy role, Leon Askin contributes with a funny cameo as the bitter washed director Wolfgang, Nita Talbot adds a bit of medium class psychic Mrs. Rohmer, plus there are the beautiful curves of Luca Bercovici as the leader of the student drama films Saint, Jennifer Starrett as sweet Meg, Jeffrey Combs as geek Stu, and Scott Thomson as nerd Bobo. Jumping on cold pieces are Chuck "Porky" Mitchell as a detective, Patrick Wright in one of his customary policeman's parts and Tallie Cochrane as a corpse. The refined cinematography of Joel King gives the film an attractive and brilliant appearance. Even the soundtrack of Jerry Mosely hits the thrill point. A funny little scare.
