This movie is simply adorable. It's funny as hell and as old as the hills. The acting is superb and it is fascinating to see post-war Britain and how we behaved in those days. This seems to have been a pre-runner of the films of St. Trinians (given the link between Alastair Sim and Margaret Rutherford - there is also a very young George Cole who has appeared in many St. Trinians films) but I don't understand the connection . It was shown on BBC4 recently, after a biography of St. Trinians creator Ronald Searle, but I missed out on the biography enough to lose connection with this film. However a great movie in its own right and something that should be preserved forever!
