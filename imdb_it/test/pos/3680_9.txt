This film is the most moving and amusing film I've seen in a long time. As a housewife ("housewife") and fan (Rupert), I found it nice. Anyone who interprets the Dirk explosion wrong was wrong. Kathy Bates is not an actress I know, but she is perfect, the whole cast is perfect for their roles. Julie Andrews made fun of me. I look at him after reading Rupert's autobiography, so the inclusion of her was even more fun. Sometimes it's terribly moving. I'm not really a fan of the kind of music in the movie but you're drawn to the love story and find out you've been singing the songs for days. This film deserves to be more widely available. Our favorite movie scene involves Dirk and a gun and his pants, watch it and watch!
