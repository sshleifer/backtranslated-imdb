Here is another fun suspense film by Clint Eastwood. I'm not his particular fan, but I have to give him a hand: he knows how to make funny movies. This is another example. It didn't hurt either to have John Malkovich as a co-star. Now there's an intense actor! In this story, Malkovich plays a murderer, and it is fascinating to look at, thanks to his different disguises and the magnificent dialogue he was given. He also has an interesting voice. <br /> <br /> Rene Russo is quite low-key (for her), but that's okay and Eastwood plays the usual solo role, not appreciated by his superiors but showing them all at the end. I guess he couldn't stop playing the "Dirty Harry" figures, but he played them well. <br /> <br /> There were some negative aspects to this film, however, namely: the credibility in the parts since there were a couple of times, if it was a real life, the killer would have eliminated Eastwood. The climate scene, in particular, had too many holes. There were also too many abuses of the Lord's name in vain in here. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, this is a good, loophole.
