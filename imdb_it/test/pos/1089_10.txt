I love the way he experiences. Ab Tak Chappan was a thrill to watch Satya and company so much. Jatin, the newcomer, also lived in his role and Nana Patekar was at her best. Suchak was really irritating, but I think he adapted to the character he was playing - he had really bad teeth. The story has great progress and no song in the film makes it better. I just hope you sign Urmila for his other upcoming films. I think they are the best combination of director and actress I've ever seen. I haven't seen Naach yet, but I can't wait. For some reason I don't find Antra Maali so exciting to watch on the screen - unlike Urmila.
