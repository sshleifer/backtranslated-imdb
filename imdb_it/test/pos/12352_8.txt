Pam Grier punches and names the role of the heroine in the entertainment director "Shaba Baby" by director William Girdler, "Asylum of Satan", played by D'Urville Martin and Austin Stoker. "Sheba Baby" is one of the many difficult films that Grier appeared in the 1970s, including "Coffy", "Foxy Brown" and "Friday Foster". The short-lived Girdler co-wrote this routine private pot-boiler overnight with producer David Shelton and introduces a stubborn female shamus who refuses to rely on a man to help her take care of business. Unfortunately, "Sheba Baby" is not up to the blaxploitation films made by Grier under the supervision of director Jack Hill. Hill directed the North African native American in "Coffy", "Foxy Brown", "The Big Bird Cage" and "The Big Doll House". Anyone who analyzes images of African-American women at the cinema should be familiar with these epics. The main problem of "Sheba Baby" is that our heroine gets too many convenient breaks. Of course, the secondary villains are triggered by happy clowns who could not hit the side of a barn with a howitzer. Being the main antagonist, Dick Merrifield qualifies as both a bad self-centered and a bad guy with lines of choice such as: "All worthwhile is worth stealing". Furthermore, the composer Monk Huggins provides a strong and suggestive orchestral soundtrack, and the best song, with Barbara Mason that the trinket, is "Good Man Is Gone". "Sheba Baby" launches Grier as a stylist for Chicago fashion designer Sheba Shayne. He leaves Windy City to return to his hometown in Louisville, Kentucky to help his father. When she arrives in Louisville, Sheba discovers that his father, Andy (Rudy Challenger of "Detroit 9000"), is having problems with a local black gangster surnamed Pilot (Mr. D'Urville Martin of "Hammer") who asks Andy to sell the his loan company to Pilot or die. <br /> <br /> Initially, Pilot sends a team of goons to sweep Andy's office, but our heroine's father catches them red-handed. They turn Sheba's father into a punching bag. It is interesting to note that during the fighting scene, Girdler rarely shows punches that cut meat to pieces. Previously, Andy's right-hand man, Brick Williams (Austin Stoker of "Horror High"), had sent Sheba a telegram requesting his return to Louisville, but she did not receive it immediately thanks to her lazy partner who did not know where find it. Brick and Sheba tie up, rekindle their romantic flames and share a night in the bag. Brick spends most of his time urging Sheba to remain calm in the face of adversity. As a former police woman from Louisville, Kentucky, Sheba prefers to shoot first and ask questions second. After returning home, Sheba borrows her father's car and can barely blow herself up. As he walks out the door to enter his father's car, Andy gets another annoying call from Pilot. Previously, Andy had refused to discuss the prospect of selling his loan company to Pilot, but Andy changes his mind and agrees to talk to the punk. A gratified pilot warns Andy of the dynamite that was linked to his ignition with a delayed fuse. In other words, raising the machine will not trigger the explosion; the explosion comes ten seconds later. Andy and Brick save Sheba before the car explodes. Previously, Sheba had agreed to let his father handle his problems without his interference. "Dad, I know you think I'm doing a man's job, but I won't sit apart just because I'm a woman," Sheba tells him. After her near-death experience, Sheba swears he knows who sabotaged his father's car. She grilles an old contact from his days as a policeman and threatens the boy with his gun to extract the information. Only after Sheba has ground the boy's face in a bucket of chlorine dust, does he go out and tell her about a reward at the city museum. Brick accompanies Sheba and the shots follow one another with an agitated Pilot running away through the skin of his chin. <br /> <br /> Next, Pilot sends a quintet of out-of-ordinary criminals who arm themselves to the teeth to wipe out Andy's office. These gunslingers ignore their orders not to kill. Not only do they shoot at the tape company, but they also blow Sheba's father with a rifle. Sheba takes revenge in a short time. With his nickel-plated revolver, he fired three of the four Dirty Harry assailants. The last assassin discards his weapon and begs for mercy. Sheba has a finger on the trigger when homicide detective Phil Jackson ("Abby's" Charles Kissinger) and a uniformed cop arrive at the scene. At the hospital, Andy Shayne dies holding his daughter. Of course, Pilot is furious at this revelation and his fury verges on apoplexy. Afterwards, Sheba tracks down a loan shark, Walker (Christopher Joy of "Cleopatra Jones"), and tells him about the pilot while she keeps him in a car wash. This is one of the improved scenes with many disturbing shots of car washing equipment humming and humming. Walker warns Sheba's pilot. Pilot and his henchmen face Sheba in a parking lot and exchange lead. Sheba flees on foot to a nearby carnival. While the police give one of Pilot's men, he takes care of the others. The pilot shoots one of his by mistake and Sheba hits him. He pushes Pilot on a roller coaster track and threatens to hold him until the roller coaster cuts his head off. Pilot manages to escape after toppling Sheba's identity and phone number of the great man, Shark (Dick Merrifield of "The Hellcats"), whose reputation is so immaculate that Detective Jackson describes him as "the boy with all the right answers. "" Sheba Baby "is not first rate Pam Grier. However, the idea that our heroine can handle everything on her own without the help of the kids makes it interesting and fun.
