Not many people seem to know about this movie. Which is a shame because I think it's good enough. Of course, sometimes it's a little rough and could have a predictable plot. But the presentation of the film is quite well done. I think the cast is good with nice actors / characters. Tom Selleck does a good job playing a baseball player (go figure ... not too much, I guess) and Ken Takakura (from Black Rain) plays the boss (the coach of the Japanese baseball team). There's not much to complain about. It's just a light, easy-going, happy comedy and I recommend it.
