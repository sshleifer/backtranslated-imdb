as a "physically challenged" person (god, as I hate that sentence) I happened to take this in cable where there was absolutely nothing else to look at - overall, it was a fantastic film. Yes, I was a little disappointed when I found out that none of the actors is disabled, and yes, I was a little disappointed that more than the film had not been shot from the "real" perspective of the disabled (can you imagine that "is it like always being the tallest person in the room and then having to live the rest of your life with a view of nothing but ass and forked others? Always having to wait for the idiot to stop reading the newspaper in the only stall for people with disabilities, putting up with the wicked bodily expulsion of everyone else while you wait?). and the scene with him driving the car was absolutely me! been there, done this, literally. but the film was true enough to be important - while I've never lived in a home or assisted living, there have been many times in the whole movie where I found myself nodding and telling me "yes, it's true .... it's success to me ... ". What struck me is that some of the commentators on this forum expressed the fact that the film made them see life a little differently and with a little more intuition as the life of a silent "minority" - can Do not ask for more than a movie, which makes you think and see life in a different way, so by virtue of that alone, the film has been enormously successful. viewing of each child in middle school should be required. <br /> <br /> for virtually every person who is severely physically disabled, independence is one of, if not the most important goal of our daily life, from re-creating work to socialization. for those of you who thought the film was "cliché", try to live our life for just one day - you will see that the film was "cliché" because ... it's true. the challenges faced by the actors have only touched the surface of what happens to us every day - if we are lucky, we experience the same emotional and personal growth that the three characters (including the girl) have done. every day presents obstacles to overcome for us - it's just that there is no swollen and dramatic music that accompanies our lives, unless it is in our ipods .... lol!
