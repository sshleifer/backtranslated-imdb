This is a delightful type of film that others don't make. Well interpreted by all and populated by interesting character actors. An intelligent and witty script worked with the right mix of broad comedy and sober humor. Returns for repeated (annual?) Visions. <br /> <br /> ** NOTICE ** the reproduction of this film of the same name, directed by Arnold Whatwashethinking, is an unbearable disaster - painful to look at - without a spark of charm and ingenuity of the original.
