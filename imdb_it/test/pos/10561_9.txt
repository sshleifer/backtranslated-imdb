After watching Sarah waters' Tipping the Velvet I decided to look at Fingersmith, the characters were equally good at both performances, even though Rachael Stirling was missing in Fingersmith's adaptation. <br /> <br /> The plot as a whole was of a good choice, the twists and the breakup of the characters were incredible! Excellent watch, just missing Rachael Stirling! <br /> <br /> If you like the romance of two girls this is not one of the best movies to watch. <br /> <br /> It takes a different turn from Tipping The Velvet but just as good. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to everyone!
