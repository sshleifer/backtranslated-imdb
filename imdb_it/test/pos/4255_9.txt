I thought I might be disappointed watching this movie after so many years. On the contrary, I was more impressed now than in my hardened youth with his honesty and his courageous humor. In 1969, the transition between African-American groups from a predominant policy of conciliation and integration to one of confrontation and self-determination was still rather new and more than controversial. It took courage and finesse to portray both the establishment and the anti-establishment as caricatures that often came very close to real life. A special mention should be made for Arnold Johnson's performance: he successfully avoided his character falling into a sociopathy or buffoonery. I'd rather watch this than "To Sir With Love" any day!
