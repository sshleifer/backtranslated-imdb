I must admit that I have never seen "Waiting for Guffman", the acclaimed mockumentary of the 1997 comedy about a small town that represents a show. When the Best in Show ad got the slogan "From the group that led you to wait for Guffman", a fair number of critics have implied in their reviews that only people who are familiar with the film or its directors and cast they will have a good time seeing this movie. For shame, critics, for shame twice! Any critic who implies something like this with any film probably doesn't want to share the richness of the film with the rest of the world, but this is a film that I hope people can experience now that its video / DVD. "Best in Show" is, without a doubt, the best comedy of 2000. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a mockumentary style, introducing the main competitors (not to mention the screwballs) of the annual Mayflower "Best In Mostra "competition, where dogs of all races come to compete to see who is the best dog. We have the adorable and fond Harry Pepper (Guest) with his hound, the simple Gerry & Cookie Fleck (Levy and O'Hara) with their terriers, the yuppies of the case Hamilton & Meg Swan (Hitchcock & Posey), the groomers dog gays Scott Dolan and Stefan Vanderhoof (Higgins and McKean), and Sheri Ann Ward Cabot's co-millionaire (Coolidge) along with his trainer Christy Cummings (Lynch). They all have their minds on a simple object: the Blue Ribbon, which will be assigned to the best dog. And ... should I tell you the rest? <br /> <br /> Director / scriptwriter / star The idea of ​​guest humor is one that assures me that there are comedies out there that are worth laughing, and that the idiocy of movies like " American Pie "or other useless" teenagers "films will not conquer the world after all. His idea is simple: make your comedy not only fun, but SMART fun. But instead of following in the footsteps of films like "Zero Effect" and "High Fidelity", he used a rather unusual approach (and, as I understand it, he also used this approach for "Guffman"). Whether you notice it or not, a very large part of the film is improvisation. In other words, what the actors say and do probably weren't written in the script, perhaps not even dreamed of by Guest and co-writer / star Levy. But with a kind hand from Guest, he and the actors made a hilarious theatrical feat that would probably have failed if it had been run by other less experienced actors. Now he's smart! <br /> <br /> The cast is, of course, what makes improvisation more effective. All of them are a marvel (comic) to see, especially Guest like Pepper. But the real prodigy must be Fred Williard as Buck Laughlin, the clueless informant of the competition who can bring out the most shockingly funny stories and comments that no announcer would even dream of ... that is, if the announcer was trying to be funny. Williard can go from talking about the dog to suddenly going on and on about what a bench can do. There is also a part that gives an idea for a new marketing strategy: sexy women pose in shirts and shorts tight with dogs and imply something like "having a doggy style of the past". It is priceless, as is its performance. <br /> <br /> I hope people will engage in this 90-minute "dogumentary". The film deserves a lot of recognition. He was nominated for the best comedy of photos at the Golden Globes, but he didn't win. I can't understand why. I mean, in the comedy department, it's the best show. <br /> <br /> GRADE: A
