I didn't catch the Gilmore Girls when it came out, so I did some more recovery during the first season. I have read most of the comments from users and for negative ones, I have to ask, what spectacle are you watching? <br /> <br /> This show is a classic, great lines, characters and good acting. And above all, NOT your standard formula always shows an occasional turning point in history. There are probably more women who see themselves reflected in the Lorelai / Emily report, then in the Lorelai / Rory report. People and plots are not PCs but they are real !! <br /> <br /> If you find the dialogue annoying, I suggest you record the show, so you can review the parts you don't understand.
