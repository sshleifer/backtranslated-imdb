"Dead Man Walking" is an incredible film. All the acting is first-rate and realistic, and the script examines the issue of the death penalty on both sides, giving equal tribute to both. Above all, this is a deeply moving story of redemption, death with dignity and loss of ego. Every film that treats this bravely and with maturity with such incredibly difficult subjects deserves a rating of 10/10. Thanks, Tim Robbins!
