This film was originally published as a soft "X", apparently with explicit sex deleted. Later, the producers "yielded" (they smelled money) and republished it with the excised restored scenes (apparently only about 3 minutes). I believe that since Kristine was of age, she was held against her and her promising career came to a halt. I guess it's all in the times (a testament to Pam Anderson's career) - but Ronald Reagan was in charge during Kristine's defeat (we hadn't heard of Nancy Reagan's business), Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinski were in full swing during "coming out "of Pam. <br /> <br /> Sex is just the icing on the cake, both versions satisfy. This bad musical is far above others that have been released simultaneously.
