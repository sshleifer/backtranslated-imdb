Yes, this show has had a lot of male frontal nudity and yes, over the years the lines of the plot have become exaggerated, melodramatic and very unrealistic, however, it doesn't matter because the show is great. You are really involved in the characters and every character, no matter how minor or important, is perfectly chosen. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine anyone else, except that JK Simmons plays the neo-Nazi racist leader, nor does anyone else play Tobias Beecher except Lee Tergesen. His character's transformation from season 1 to season 2 is amazing. However, the character of MADE Oz OZ was CHRIS KELLER (played by Christopher Meloni). He had no relationship with anyone else in prison except Beecher (well, except for Ronnie Barlog, but it was just to get Ronnie to stop playing with Keller's boyfriend, Beecher). Their relationship transcended the sexes and Tom Fontana actually made us interested in those two and wanted those two to be together. <br /> <br /> I loved Vern's weak spot for his children on the show and how Fontana created cute characters these hateful criminals who grew up to worship, even Simon Adebesi. <br /> <br /> However, some lines were absolutely incredible and unrealistic: * A boy who builds a bomb in oz * Guys standing in the spotlight in their windows in their pods watching other men plot something in their mind - even them over the top. * Drugs enter oz * Everyone in the rehabilitation group used or sold drugs and Sister Pete never helped anyone in six years. * People are killed in the gym, they provide closet and kitchen. * No one hurts Ryan's mom * No one fights against Cyril outside the ring (except Vern, of course) * Two inmates with tools left alone in the elevator shaft and one of them dies without investigation. * Karl Metzger (guard) is killed and no one investigates. * The Governor holds all his press conferences at the jail * All a prisoner has to do is say "I want to see Glenn" or "I want to see mcmanus" and they are taken by them without asking questions. * People die every week in Oz * Outside, people kill someone and get 20 years, until they are released on conditionally, but if they kill someone inside, they enter death row almost immediately * No staff on-site paid in the kitchen or in the mail room - inmates manage both departments without asking questions * Aging drugs for inmates that replace time * Ryan has no friends or partners, but is never injured, killed, mutilated, raped or beaten. * The boys NEVER wash the toilets when they go to the bathroom or vomit. * An NBA scout arrives in jail to recruit an NBA player (yes, yes) <br /> <br /> However, with all these flaws, this show is still fantastic. It's macabre, brutal, sexy, sharp, raw and innovative. Dean Winters, Scott William Winters, JK Simmons, Christopher Meloni, Luiz Guzman, Adele (the guy who played Simon Adebisi), Eammon Walker, Lee Tergesen, Terry Kinney, mUms, Alexander Maschio, LL Cool J, etc. Etc. Etc. All are fantastic and have made the show worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend renting it on DVD. The sixth season comes out 9/06 (next month). The first five seasons are on DVD: watch them and then watch them again with an audio commentary. I loved the director's comment with Chazz Palmentari. The sequence with Andy Schillinger running down the tables of the cafeteria and then falling into the hole was a stupendous first-rate shot !!!! Congratulations! And Kathy Bates who runs Family Business and the famous wrestling scene between Beecher and Keller - just amazing !! Brilliant!!! It should be so strange for Meloni to touch the private part of Tergesen in front of an icon like Kathy Bates in that scene !! Wow! I pulled out beautifully, pun! <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for Oz: The Next Generation !!!! (as with Star Trek, etc.) C'Mon !!! Let's start!!!!
