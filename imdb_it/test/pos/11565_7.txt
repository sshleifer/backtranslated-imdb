This is a nice silent French comedy about a man who bets on another who can't stay in this castle for an hour because of his being persecuted. And, once the boy enters the house, he looks much more like a crazy fun house or maybe like the after-effects of LSD !! While there are ghosts and skeletons, there is a strange species of animals, strange special effects and pure gags. It's terribly difficult to describe, but only the images make the film worth seeing. HOWEVER, understand that the self-indulgent director also had many "funny gags" that fell completely flat and wounded in the film. His "camera tricks" weren't so complicated but annoying and stupid. IGNORE THESE AND KEEP THE WATCH: it's better. The film is fast, fun and worth seeing. In particular, I really enjoyed watching Max Linder's acting and aggression - he was so expressive and funny! Too bad it's practically forgotten today. For an interesting but very sad reading, check out IMDb's biography on him.
