This is my favorite horror film, a second from "Poltergeist". I saw "One Dark Night" when it was first released in cinemas in 1983, in the theater where I worked. <br /> <br /> I was born in 1963, so I have a certain love for the horror films of the 80s, although they are a little dated and the dialogue is not well written. What I thought was so original is that the phenomenon of "psychic vampirism" has not been addressed (at least to my knowledge at that time) and is a very real phenomenon. <br /> <br /> I didn't do it I care if Adam West was in it (nothing against him, but his supporting role wasn't memorable), but I thought Meg Tilly was a good casting. The little-known Donald Hutton (from "Brainstorm" and "Invaders From Mars") as an ambiguous scientist who oversaw Ramar's abilities studies was sadly overlooked. As a gay, I was paying more attention to David Mason Daniels, Meg Tilly's unlucky boyfriend. Now sells real estate in Texas. <br /> <br /> I heard the film "realistic" in two ways: Raymar, who was discovered for killing 6 girls in his surreal apartment, had a funeral that was scarce, reflecting the fact that not only he was mysterious, a hermit, but a murderer. As you know, these guys are buried without fanfare. Second, if the corpses were telekinetically mobile, they would hover, dragging their feet. The filmmakers could have gone from the schlock to walking, moaning, protruding zombies, but opt ​​for what would be credible. Congratulations! The buzzing electric discharge from Ramar's eyes in his 'throne coffin' (as if he were controlling his dead kingdom), cast a mysterious magenta light into the mausoleum that will stay with you for years! If you ever went to a mausoleum, even on a sunny day, you will notice that they have their rosette lights caused by stained glass windows. Don't let me start on the cavernous silence. Even Ramar himself looked like someone who could pass for an eccentric and perverse old man. The score was unique and memorable, and I keep getting kicked for not finding it on the cassette when it came out. The shooting was done where it needed to be. I especially liked the carefully planned characteristics of each corpse: the bride, the severely decomposed child who still held her teddy bear, her grandmother, the tall thin boy of color, the veterinarian half world war of the second war and the green eyes an elderly gentleman who was the first to greet the initiators of the "sister" clique. Even corpses can be good actors, I suppose. The only thing I had to complain about was the arm that came out of one of the vaults and choked Julie's boyfriend that could not possibly be done unless a body had been placed first on the stomach and feet, but why? He also seemed a little too handsome. <br /> <br /> The film starts disturbing, with us who never see Ramar's face (until the last quarter of the movie, which is like unwrapping a birthday present) while he is collecting teen runaway girl in the psychic flash of his daughter. Then we see the coroners dragging his body away in his one-bedroom apartment where we see that he has experimented his telekinetic craft by sequencing the plates in his wall. The rest drags on as the group of "sisters" of Heathers comes out of Julie in a last initiation spending the night inside the mausoleum, but it's a well-placed build to unleash the horror later. The film is not bloody in any sense of the word. The most glorious part is when Ramar's daughter uses a compact mirror to feed her power to him, and then boils and melts. I always thought that a power like Ramar could never die and that a sequel could be worth examining. I can see it now: One Dark Night II: Turning In The Grave. But let's face it: the film is alone. I heard that the film had other titles, but the original fits. <br /> <br /> A remake would be useless. But if there were one, I would write better dialogues and stretch some scenes like showing studies of Ramar's laboratory skills instead of hearing about them on a tape recorder. In this information age, something like this would be well documented on DVD. And more corpses! Why raise those in the mausoleum when Ramar's power could also spread to the cemetery? Let's say that I hate being one of the people who had to clean up the mess at the end of the climax; something that can also be shown. I think having one of the starting nuns recognizes one of the corpses as a relative would add a good character if disturbing. With CG effects, some fantastic scenes with Ramar animating the cremated remains would be off the wall! <br /> <br /> Say what you want, 'One Dark Night' but it has everything. So, see at least once in your life ... or death!
