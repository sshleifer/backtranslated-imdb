I haven't seen this fun of a fox show for a long time, and the wait was worth it. The children on the show have something I can relate to in each episode, and my father will also sit and watch it. It is a show not for all ages that does not fall asleep for children. It's like standing, but at the next level. The things that everyone says are things that everyone says and actions that everyone does. He says things that we all think, but in a well-rounded presentation way. The first time I saw the show I couldn't believe it was on fox, and that it was allowed to stay on the air after a few episodes, from Hilary's boy's choices to Kenny's boyfriend choices, it was worth it.
