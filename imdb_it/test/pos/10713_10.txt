Just as Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) is about to take a break in his professional life, his frustrated wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) finally has the courage to leave him, leaving Ted his five-year-old son (Justin Henry). Being a single parent proves to be a real nuisance for Ted, and he suffers professionally, but he also learns much more in the life of a career while he continues to tie and really know his son. But then Joanna returns and intends to bring her son back, which leads to a cruel custody process. <br /> <br /> Kramer vs Kramer is a superbly well written and beautifully performed human drama that will leave only the coldest-hearted an untouched spectator. Hoffman's growing relationship with his son is so well represented and the film never takes an easy way out. It always seems very real and thanks to the film's low-key approach has an even greater impact and can easily work on multiple views, the dramatic impact of the film does not decrease. <br /> <br /> Easily recommended; 10 out of 10.
