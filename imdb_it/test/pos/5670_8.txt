This film is a sleeper because Rod Steiger is the only big name in the credits. Still, all the secondary actors adapt well to his character. It was right that in his latest film Rod Steiger reminded us once again of his inventive power as an actor. He interpreted impulsiveness, stubbornness and acceptance of a grandfather's end of life in a typically individual and convincing performance. Because his character was close to death, the story brings us closer to the most precious things granted to us: the privilege of life, the relationships with family members and the empathy of those who take care of us. His search with his niece for one of his sons provided enough suspense to keep me waiting, expecting a very heavy climax like the meeting of two long-time elderly lovers who were also on the cusp of death in "Forever Young ". "I was wondering how the meeting would be staged and how intensely my emotions would have been hurt by the time he and his niece had reached the end of his research. I was happy to find out that the story brought more than as I expected, the delightfully satisfying climax led me to appreciate more the value of the precious gifts of life, love and family that are appreciated today by me and by all of us.
