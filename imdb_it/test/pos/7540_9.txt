Terrible fun both as a movie and as an excuse to sit and play the game 'oh, it's a level game. Every star of the golden age of English films seems to be in this and it was a joy to see them. And the greatest of all, Richard Wattis, was as terrible as ever. <br /> <br /> Actually there is a plot that trudges very well, there are also some jokes and comic moments, but the key to the triumph of this film are the characters inside it. Alastair Sim is magnificent and somehow convinces you that a Scotsman of six feet or so could be the director of a girl's college. George Cole, Beryl Reid and Irene Handl all have their moments but, with Alastair and Richard, the star of the show is Joyce Grenfell. It is an absolute one-off and smiles every time it appears on the screen ... its way of walking and the plum accent made to perfection. <br /> <br /> And for those who play the game of the level name, you can also see Arthur Mullard, Barbara Windsor and Ronald Searle if you look closely.
