Going beyond words is the story of divorce that breaks the heart and results in a tragic battle for the custody of a seven-year-old child. <br /> <br /> One of the great strengths of Kramer v. Kramer is the director of screenwriter Robert Benton, who wonderfully adapted Avery Corman's novel to the big screen. It keeps things wonderfully simple and realistic, while distributing all the drama directly from the heart. His talent for telling exciting stories like this was to prove himself again with "Places in the heart", where he demonstrated, as in "Kramer v. Kramer", that he has a natural ability to work with children. <br /> <The other strong point of the image is the splendid acting that deservedly received four of the nine Oscar nominations for the film, two of which were awarded. One of these was Dustin Hoffman (best actor), who is superb as a frustrated businessman, Ted Kramer, a man who has forgotten that his wife is a person. As his wife Joanne said, Meryl Streep claimed the supporting actress Oscar for a strong and sensitive portrait of a woman who had lost herself in eight years of marriage. Jane Alexander was also nominated for her fantastic turn as Kramer's dear friend Margaret. The last word in the acting episodes must go to the young Justin Henry, whose incredibly moving execution will find you suffocating again and again tears, and a fully deserved Oscar nomination has arrived. <br /> <br /> Nestor Almendros is also brilliant "The cinematography and timely editing by Jerry Greenberg, while musically the classic piece by Henry Purcell is used to perform. Truly this is a moving story of how a father and son they come to depend on each other when the wife and mother leaves, they grow together, they know each other and form a completely new and wonderful relationship.Ted finds himself with new responsibilities and a new vision of life, and slowly understands why Joanne must go. <br /> <br /> Certainly if nothing else, "Kramer Kramer "shows that no one wins when he comes to a battle for child custody, especially not the child himself. <br /> <br /> Saturday, June 10, 1995 - TV <br /> <br /> Strong drama trait from the novel by Avery Corman on the anguish of a custody battle between extraneous parents who both feel they have the best interest of the child at heart, apart from a superb script and an incredibly controlled director, both of Robert Benton, it is the super cast that makes this image so successful. <br /> <br /> Hoffman is as brilliant as Ted Kramer, the man split between his career in freefall and the son he desperately wants to keep.The Streep is also excellent as the woman lost in eight years of marriage that had to come out before it vanished into thin air as a person.To support these two is Jane Alexander who is as strong as her mutual friend Margaret, an exceptional Justin Henry as the boy caught in the middle and a high cast them fleece. <br /> <br /> This highly emotional and heartbreaking drama more than deserved is the 1979 Academy Awards for Best Film, Best Actor (Hoffman) and Best Supporting Actress (Streep). <br /> <br /> Wednesday, February 28, 1996 - TV
