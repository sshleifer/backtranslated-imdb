Susan Sarandon. He made this film for me. I never appreciated his acting more than I did in this movie. He really acted like he was Adele August. I can appreciate actors and actresses who abandon their individual personality and create a truly believable character. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman as Ann August helped create the ideal antagonist as their characters developed through the film. The film was about them, so the other characters were peripheral. I gave this film a vote of eight, but Susan received a ten from me because of her performance. As for the relationship films, Beaches and Terms of Endearment has had a greater impact on me than this film, but I highly recommend it.
