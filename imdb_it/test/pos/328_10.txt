Kannathil Muthamittal is definitely a great movie. I have to give it to Mani Ratnam for a great work as director and A.R. Rahman for great songs. The work with the camera is excellent and is similar to Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan. I will be shocked if this film does not win an Oscar for best foreign film or even for best photographic work.
