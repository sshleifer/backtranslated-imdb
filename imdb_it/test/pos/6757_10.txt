A brilliant animated piece that was far ahead of his time, and certainly far ahead of anything published in mass production at the same point in history. The influence of this work on Tim Burton's "Nightmare Before Christmas" is immediately evident. One can only imagine how Starewicz has a slave on every wonderfully detailed frame of this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> There have been very few animated films of this caliber. It is a pity that more people have not seen this jewel. <br /> <br /> Apparently, IMdB now requires that the comments are at least ten lines, so this is the tenth line. It must be something new - but I really have nothing else to say!
