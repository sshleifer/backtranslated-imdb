This film was really interesting ... it's also pretty shocking since the film's similar events only occurred 10 months after the film's premiere. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see the problems that could be encountered and realistic enough to show that no matter how much you think you are - you are not. if it had been made for an American public, it would be different because they would have used it as a complete propaganda film and not as a wake-up call that the BBC did! it is still propaganda, somehow - no film today with these themes cannot be - but it has successfully addressed the problem. <br /> <br /> a film that should be shown in all terrorism / counterterrorism courses but not because it shows flaws that cannot be recognized! A great film in which the BBC took some risks and, unfortunately, London no longer needs a fiction, due to the reality of 7 July 2005.
