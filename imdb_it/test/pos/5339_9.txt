I was extremely amused reading some of the negative reviews on this film. First of all, many claimed to have taken their 4-year-old daughters and granddaughters to see it and didn't like it. First of all, I don't think this is a film for children, at least not a film for very young children, not at least 4. It has a very subtle humor, but is not meant to offer fast fun as seen in Tom and Jerry or something gender. Many people have complained that it goes very very slowly ... I guess those people are used to "quantity" compared to "quality". Although I have a small quality problem with this film and that is that the film was not as detail-oriented as the short films, I still believe that it did quite well for a full-length feature film. And how can people complain about the jokes ?? The jokes were sensible, punctual and well thought out, never rude, offensive or "in the face". Wallace is extremely intelligent, but cautious and Grommit is the most adorable, intelligent and cute character he could be. This was a beautiful film and the theme was very appropriate ... for adults it is .... especially with the increase in obesity and metabolic diseases in the world, there is nothing wrong with promoting vegetables and fruit for once ... and this was done in a very refined way in this ... while people worry about the appearance of vegetables that doesn't necessarily mean they are healthier or eat more ... but only that are tempered with nature, which is actually what caused the legend of the fact that the rabbit became a reality. And for those out there who have complained about religious jokes, I say ... come on! are you for real? Many villages revolve around the local church, and legends / premonitions etc. They are normal subjects, no damage done. This film was absolutely amazing, yet some people have negative comments about it and I find this absolutely absurd !!!
