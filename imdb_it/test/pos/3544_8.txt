I imagine some luxury directors were sitting sipping absinthe, brandy, aramangac or jungle juice in the 1980s during the Cannes or other film festival and one said, "Hey, guys, let's make a movie where each of us make a segment around a world class air. "Welllll ... it worked. Clearly someone has been smart enough to select some of the best recordings of the chosen tunes, for example the Bjoreling Nessun Dorma, so if you were blind and you were only listening to the DVD you were worth more than your money. Not all filmmakers have been successful, but much more and the film seems to improve with every vision over the years. My favorite is the mysteriously beautiful love duet by Die Todt Statd; okay, a naked young woman, Elizabeth Hurley is a candy for the eyes, but the husband who sings for her, the ghost of his wife, is incredibly beautiful with the love music second only to Otello and Desdemona "Gia nel Densa Notte" throughout the opera repertoire. The film would have been better, of course, what couldn't have been, but it's worth seeing, especially if you're in a hyper-romantic mood.
