William H. Macy is exceptional in this Alfred Hitchcock film. Macy plays the role of a film critic who accidentally kills one of her friends. The resulting characters are hilarious. James Cromwell offers an exceptional performance as a private blackmail blackmail detective. As always, Macy is incredibly fun and offers phenomenal performance. Watch this movie whenever it's on t.v. and check your video stores because it is one of those not to be missed.
