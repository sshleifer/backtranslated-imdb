Based on the book "Space Vampires" by Colin Wilson. This is (in my humble opinion) one of the best Sci-Fi horror pieces to come out of the eighties. The effects (made by ILM) continue to stand up to today's standards. The actors are mostly British and being British they seem to give this film a greater depth of realism. <br /> <br /> The film was cut short by critics and unfortunately failed to do well at the box office on both sides of the Atlantic. Tobe Hooper accused the promotional work that was done before its release as the main cause for its low takings. But for some reason, it does not detract from the fact that it is an excellent film with an exceptional cast and a well-set plot. <br /> <br /> Not to be underestimated.
