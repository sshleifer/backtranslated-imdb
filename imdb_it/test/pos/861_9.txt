I saw the film at the Hollywood Film Festival in October '04. Mark Robertson had a tremendous opportunity to write an extremely difficult part for his first film and he bore fruit in his casting of Kelly Overton. I had the strong feeling that he came from the theater, so I looked at her here and ... surprise, I'm right. Other Hollywood actors should follow his example, forgo costly acting lessons and return to the theater because only with that kind of training will you be prepared for a tour like this. For all the great things I can say about the film and the director (and there are many), I can't just stop talking to people about Kelly Overton's masterful performance. We will see much more of his work, no doubt. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mark and Kelly for a bold movie. Get it out in theaters so I can bring all the people I wanted to see the movie as soon as possible!
