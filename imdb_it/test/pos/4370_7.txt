Hindsight is a wonderful thing. Very insulted when he first appeared (inspired by the famous review "Me No Leica"), this precursor of "Cabaret" can now be seen in comparison and is not badly bad. It is certainly not a classic, but it has its rebellious charm, (the film version of "Cabaret" follows this plot while the theatrical version slightly changes the plot). One should, of course, resist the temptation to giggle when Christopher Isherwood of Laurence Harvey (maintains the true name of the original author: God knows what Isherwood thought of it), describes himself as "a confirmed bachelor" and while Harvey is absolutely inadequate "hero" ', (he is practically asexual), and Shelly Winters sadly miscible as Fraulien Landauer, (the part that Marisa Berenson played in "Cabaret"), Julie Harris is a perfectly wonderful Sally, (it's a beautiful piece of comic acting), and Anton Diffring is first rate like Fritz, the German Jew in love with the character of Shelly. Of course, if "Cabaret" had never arrived, you might wonder if this would ever see the light of day again. The fact that it was filmed may not be a reason for celebration, but the same is perfectly acceptable.
