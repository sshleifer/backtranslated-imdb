As a father of four children in their forties, I thought this film made the vision compelling - if not mind-boggling. I deserve a much higher score than the 4.3 I had when I wrote this. (I gave it 7.) <br /> <br /> I agree with some of the comments on the characters, but Cameron Diaz was, once again, sparkling in another very different role. The plot was a bit silly, but the point of the film for me was beautifully summarized in the final sequence, quite surreal. A moving ending for any parent. I could imagine that a young, single person might find the film quite boring, but for other people not fixated with high doses of testosterone they would find something sweet in this.
