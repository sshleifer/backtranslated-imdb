This is a wonderful old-fashioned Christmas gift, which I try to capture on TV every year, if I can. It's about a journalist named Martha Stewart, Elizabeth Lane, interpreted in a charming way by Barbara Stanwyck. However, unlike Martha, this woman is a fake with no domestic skills. The other cast members effectively complete the story, and include Dennis Morgan (Jefferson Jones), Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan) and Sydney Greenstreet (Alexander Yardley). <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Lane is a journalist who writes food articles, portraying herself as a happily married country housewife with children. In fact, she's a single woman who lives in a New York City apartment and can't boil an egg. His recipes are borrowed from his Hungarian chef friend, Felix. Elizabeth gets by with her deception until the editor of her magazine, Alexander Yardley, decides she wants a nice old-fashioned Christmas, and invites her to visit her, bringing with her a war hero, Jefferson Jones, a sailor shipwrecked . Yardley requires total honesty of its employees. To get out of her situation and save her career based on deception, Elizabeth borrows the Connecticut home from her old architect husband, John Sloan, a boring and fussy type who has always sought marriage. He also borrows the daughter of a neighbor (actually, many) to pass off as his and his "husband" of Sloan. <br /> <br /> Of course this scenario makes it very cheerful. It is a dejected comedy and a fascinating love story, with the addition of a Christmas atmosphere. Every time I think of this film, I imagine the falling snowflakes, the beautifully decorated tree, the fire roaring in the fireplace, the roasting turkey and the baking Christmas cookies. <br /> <br /> Why did Hollywood feel compelled to do a remake? I understand that there is a 1992 version, directed by Arnold Schwarzenegger and interpreted by Dyan Cannon, Kris Kristofferson and Tony Curtis. I have not seen this modern adaptation, nor do I desire. This old favorite is perfect as it is and a vacation to "see" with It's a Wonderful Life, White Christmas, Miracle on 34th Street and, of course, all versions of A Christmas Carol.
