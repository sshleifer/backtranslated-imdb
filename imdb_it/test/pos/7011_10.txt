It's strange how time has passed and I've never seen this movie ... 'until last week, when I was like in a spell. I saw him twice in a week and it was still not enough. It's a great movie and I'd like to see it again. The story is great and it really moved me. I'd like to live a story like that. The actors are fantastic, even the music and you can dream about your love story. I just hope that one day I will find the opportunity to learn to dance like Johnny and Baby. I feel like dance connects people and brings them together. I think people should learn to dance ... it helps a lot, especially in a relationship. It is good to feel the dance in the blood and in the body.
