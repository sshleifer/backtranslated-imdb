Now I understand that this film was not intended as an accusation against all Indians, but it is a fantastic film because it dares to investigate the hypocrisy that some Indians have towards their women and their sexuality. I have known for some time that sexism is very common in this society (with women being killed because their husband's family no longer wants them after his death or because he had a small dowry as well as the frequent killings of female fetuses because they are seen as a curse instead of a blessing). I also realize that some of this culture will be very offended by the film, but the bottom line is that there is something true about the subject - even though the film was so strongly attacked when it debuted in India ten years ago. As a result of the extreme misogyny in the film, most members of the Western public will be shocked or at least emotionally involved in the situation of women in this film. <br /> <br /> Even if I am a male, I am not rabidly feminist and I am straight, the film has had a strong positive impact on me and is NOT a agenda film that can only be appreciated by lesbians and " haters of men ". In fact, I don't think the film is promoting hatred of men or homosexuality, but instead provides a credible argument about the way in which these two ladies were the only reasonable alternative because of their bad husbands. Yes, I use the word "evil" and I mean it, since both husbands living in this big family are intensely selfish and have no regard for the sexuality of their spouses. In many traditional societies this is indeed the case and women are condemned to an empty emotional existence. <br /> <br /> A husband married a lively young woman, Sita, as a family obligation. This arranged marriage is inconvenient for both, but at first Sita tries to connect with her sullen husband. However, he sees himself as a victim and may have less of Sita - and continues to have a relationship with a liberal-minded Chinese lady. To make matters worse, he did nothing to hide the relationship and made no excuses. In their dead marriage, sex was destined exclusively to produce children and Sita could not in any way satisfy his sexual or emotional needs. And unfortunately, he could have cared less. <br /> <br /> Another husband was married to an infertile woman (Radha). Strangely, after initially trying to have children, the next 13 years passed without any sexual contact! It is because this man has decided to become an ascetic (that is, in Hinduism, a person who renounces the pleasures of the world to obtain inner enlightenment). Now his desire to do this was all right if he was not already married and had obligations to his wife. However, being married, this was an incredibly selfish act and like his brother, he assumed that his wife had no sexual feelings, nor did he seem to care. The closest thing that would have allowed her sexually was to sleep next to him - as if to help him teach her to "overcome the desires of the flesh". This must have only brought frustration to her. <br /> <br /> So, you have two neglected and normal women living in the same family who want an emotional connection and an outlet for their sexual needs. In the end, these needs bring these sisters-in-law together - initially on an emotional level but also on a sexual level. The film was brilliant as it allowed me to look and understand how in some cases homosexuality is inevitable and even healthy with respect to a life of emotional desolation. <br /> <br /> In the late film, when the intensity of their sex the relationship is discovered, it leads to a reaction not totally unexpected by Radha's "enlightened" husband - a man who seeks religious insight and peace, but is so wrapped up in himself that true intuition and growth is impossible. <br /> <br /> This is a very challenging and adult film. While there is very little nudity, the subject is very adult and this is not a film to show to your children. Really very disturbing is a secondary character who masturbates in front of a paralyzed old lady - as I said, this is NOT a movie to let your children watch. However, for an adult audience, this is an excellent and highly erotic film that will make you think. <br /> <br /> The film features good acting, complex characters, excellent writing, atmospheric music and a slow rhythm that might annoy some, but which I found gratifying. The only serious negative I cannot blame the film itself but the idiots who posted it on a videotape. This is because although the film is in English, sometimes the accents are quite strong and it is not always easy to understand what is being said. BUT, and this is the worst part, there are no closed or open captions - including them is a must for the Western public. If you watch this movie, see if you can find it on DVD or hopefully a new video version has subtitles. Mine was definitely not. <br /> <br /> By the way, director Deepa Mehta (a popular director) has made many other wonderful films like EARTH and BOLLYWOOD / Hollywood. A consistent theme in his films is the conflict between traditional Indian culture and expectations and occidentalism - with a strong emphasis on female characters. Not surprisingly, this western-looking lady makes her home in Canada and is divorced - a very unusual woman to say the least. For a similar film that explores traditional culture meets western culture, try another Canadian gem, EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN.
