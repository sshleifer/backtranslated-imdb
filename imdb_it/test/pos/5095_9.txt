The best acting is rewarded with the pairing with a melodramatic script that really elevates the human spirit. Courage to all those servants who strive every day! your patience is virtuous. Your patience and decency will prove it, in ways you will never anticipate. This is your great story. I don't think you can look up to the end without a hint of moisture in that hardened eye. Or can you? For me, it wouldn't be like that ... the story is relentless! The idealist denied the due. Will anyone speak? Ah! but you will need to see the show! he observes the master in his best moment, without warning and peerage that the observer would expect. And why does it continue like this? Yup! you have to watch O'Toole's show for you! I can only wish that it was still "printed" for the purchase, then present to my friends as my testimony of respect for their faithful lives.
