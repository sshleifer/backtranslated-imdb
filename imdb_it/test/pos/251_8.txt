A beautiful story by Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) who dreams of being on Broadway, which means he will have to leave the small dining room where he works with Danny (Gene Kelly) and Genius (Phil Silvers). Rusty is in love with Danny. All three are good friends and every Friday night they go to a local bar where they take oysters to look for a pearl (they never eat them). The plot provides numerous opportunities for songs and dances. The film has two questions that Rusty must answer: is fame all so raw? and is it less true if you are happy? Answering these questions makes the film. The film also does a good job of showcasing the talents that all three principals have had. Never a dull moment!
