This film was really different from what I had imagined, but it still exceeded my expectations. This film has the right mix of comedy, drama, political criticism and satire (not necessarily in this order). Without being paternalistic or wisenheimer it reveals the open and subtle problems of our highly technological and democratic capitalist society. It makes you laugh instantly and you remain worried later. For those of you who loved "wag the dog" and wanted human and male politicians, this film should definitely be the choice! <br /> <br /> "Politicians are very similar to diapers: they should be changed frequently and for the same reasons."
