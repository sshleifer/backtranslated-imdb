A nice movie. One that made me think of God but I don't feel guilty or overwhelmed. It made me think about death but don't be afraid, think about life but don't hide it. A film that gave both love for everything I support and at the same time condemned it to the deepest cavities of hell. A film that made me think of love and all that I lost, but no sadness has embellished my eyes, for some strange reason, relief. A son of two worlds, god and theater. And a lot of wine and irony! I highly recommend ***** <br /> <br /> "When The S *** hits the fan, take a tent" Oh and we should all go camping. Everyday.
