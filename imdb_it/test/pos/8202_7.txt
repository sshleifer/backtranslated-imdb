It was a movie that made you think a little. Some parts a little cheese, some parts pretty good. Sometimes the plot gets thicker and just when you thought that Angella (Sandra) had found a friend, the friend was a swindler or dead. All I have to say is that DENNIS MILLER should have been in the whole movie. His character was the best, very refreshing after all the shit Angella went through. He would raise Angella and me through the dumps.
