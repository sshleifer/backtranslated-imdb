This certainly wouldn't have been my kind of movie, but my husband saw it on TV and said it was really good. So, on his recommendation, I bought a copy, since I didn't know if he would ever be on TV again. I had never heard anyone outside except Armand Assante. At first I had trouble getting into the story, because the first part of the film is a mixture of images - and it doesn't make much sense. It is only later in the film that it all comes together. The cut of the scene - if that's what it's called, it's a bit jarring - sometimes it seems that some scenes have been cut out of each scene, and the scenes are confusing - but I think it was made to add to the unusual (if it is a word). The story veers here and there, and almost as long as you understand it, everything turns upside down and you have to readjust your thoughts about who is the bad and who is not. O bad woman. The acting is very good - I kept thinking about how Norman Reedus looks like Leo Decaprio. The ending was a real twist, totally unexpected, which I liked. A beautiful show
