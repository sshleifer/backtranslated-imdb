I have to say it. Gary Busey saved this film. Had it not been for his acting talents, this film would have been comparable. I recommend the movie, but barely. <br /> <br /> The biggest difficulty with the film is its broad disregard for historical, geographical and physical accuracy. For example, why is Lubbock green and hilly? Why did Buddy's producer Petty ignore him? Where are the day trips in the Clovis studio in New Mexico? Why is Nashville treated as a racist hatred camp to destroy Holly's sound? Why was Buddy's two-week courtship for Maria considered a complex, taboo and mixed stereotype? Why are Buddy's tile boxes light as feathers? Finally, why are Crickets interpreted as problems in making the checkpoints to Holly's talent? <br /> <br /> Taken on their face these inaccuracies should mean destiny for any movie that claims to be "The Buddy Holly Story". However, Busey offers an exciting portrayal as the man whose death eventually led to the day the music died.
