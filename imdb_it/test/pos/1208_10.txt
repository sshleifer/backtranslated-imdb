The biggest crowd I've ever seen a wrestling event in the United States took place at Wrestlemania 6. Over 93,000 people showed up to break the Rolling Stones indoor record, and this event didn't disappoint at all. Perhaps the biggest game of all time took place when the Immortal Hulk defended his world title against the Ultimate Warrior. There are over 12 games in all, so you get a lot of action
