I really enjoyed this movie ... and I still watch it from time to time. I used it in my music classes at the school where I teach. The children seem to be enjoying themselves, even if they liked them in color. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film is, for me, that it grew after Heifetz's death, it's the chance to see a master violinist working his job! I was surprised by how "updated" the plot is. Although the references to "school reform" are obsolete. A boy, whose father died, and was raised by his mother and stepfather ... most of our children today are raised by adoptive parents, although the film makes it seem like most parents are cruel . I get VERY angry when his mother does not take his side and defends his actions against his stepfather. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, musical selections are hard to believe. I find it unbelievable that a child, who appears to be about 8 years old, can play the "Minute Waltz", or that a 13-year-old girl can sing an aria from Rigoletto. <br /> <br /> In addition to this, it is a really fun, beautiful film and I recommend it. I wish it would be released on DVD.
