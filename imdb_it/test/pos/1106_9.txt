I received this DVD from the ACCENT range which is a label specializing in art-house flics, published Irreversible and a series of Bergman's works. <br /> <br /> The thing that struck me about Alex Frayne's film strangely titled MODERN LOVE is that it is an impeccable film that breathes with perfection and vision, a film that takes us into the mind of Mr Joe Average, full of voices in the head, visions and madness. Set in a rural Australian countryside, the film does not trivialize or praise people like so many Australian films. that is, our films are full of "lovely thieves" or people with "golden hearts" etc etc <br /> <br /> Not in this movie. The spirit of Stanley Kubrick appears in the distance here, it is not impeccable, but it has hypnotic attention to detail, a romantic vein and a mood that is comforting, if not cumbersome. <br /> <br /> Minor quibbles ... the transfer seems defective - the credits have been cut, they don't fit the frame. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, one of the short films is corrupt, it stops halfway.
