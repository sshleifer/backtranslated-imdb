I saw this film on my local cable system with the title "Beyond the Redemption". I was looking for new material to watch, as most of the Saturday morning replicas didn't interest me. I've always been a fan of Andrew McCarthy and Michael Ironside, so I chose this film. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Personally, I liked the movie. Rich Roesing, who published a commentary on the film that was ruined by seeing scenes from the film on the back of a video rental box, is well justified. I didn't have the disappointment of knowing anything about the movie in advance. This led me to evaluate the highest film of the average score listed on the page. <br /> <br /> I like suspense films, and this was no exception. The film made me guess until the end. I was surprised by the ending! <br /> <br /> Moments of reflection and remembrance of the protagonist's past experiences during the film have been added to the suspense. His reactions to those memories gave the film a sense of the humanitarian, but conflicting, side of police work. The struggle with his faith is also a welcome addition. <br /> <br /> If you like suspenseful films, but also films that expose the character's feeling, on the personal inflection side, this film is for you. <br /> <br /> If you find this movie about your local cable or satellite guide, watch it! <br /> <br /> However, if you are looking for a video to rent, follow Rich Roesing's advice and ask someone to get the video for you before watching it.
