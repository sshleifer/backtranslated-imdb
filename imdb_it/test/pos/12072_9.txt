I cried like a child during the finale of this film and I challenge anyone else to keep it together without a hiccup. Absolutely heartbreaking, but edifying at its core. <br /> <br /> A great effort on the part of Ann Margaret, who plays a mother of ten terminally ill patients who, knowing that her arthritic husband who works the steel will not be able to support the family when she does not 'is more, organize the adoptions of his children before she leaves. The role really deserved an Oscar. <br /> <br /> You feel really good for this poor family while the dying mother gives her everything to make sure her children do not end up in a poorly administered state orphanage system. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, take it if you can.
