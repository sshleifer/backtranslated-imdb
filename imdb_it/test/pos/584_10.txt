The Muppet movie is an instant classic. I remember the opening scene with the bird's-eye view of the swamp and Kermit which begins (in my opinion) the most beloved song in the history of songs. At this point my mother always sang with Kermit. <br /> <br /> Watching this title as a young adult makes me smile. I can still sing according to my heart's desire. Like many Muppet movies there are adult jokes that are (in my opinion) still fun today. My favorite phrase of all time is actually from this movie, it's the last joke of my green-eyed hero, Kermit "Life is like a movie, write your ending". This is what I intend to do! Thanks Jim Henson.
