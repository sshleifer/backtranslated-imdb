Cleopatra 2525 is a very fun and entertaining show. You shouldn't take the whole show seriously, but if you want to have fun, it's your TV show. Being made by Xena producers is a guarantee of quality, and Cleopatra 2525 is not that different from Xena. The formula of female warriors is brought into the future, where they must not fight warriors or gods, but dangerous robots living on the surface, and humans are forced to live underground. Along the two seasons of Cleopatra, they develop an interesting and entertaining underground world, and we know the three main characters: Cleopatra (Jennifer Sky), Hel (Gina Torres) and Sarge (Victoria Pratt). They are all different, but as a team, they work really well. The three main actresses have appeared previously in Xena, like most of the regular / guest cast (there are also familiar faces from Hercules or both shows). I particularly liked the character played by Danielle Cormack (Ephiny in Xena), which is very different from all her previously known roles. So if you like Xena and Hercules, you'll love Cleopatra 2525. If you don't know them, try: I'm sure you'll like it.
