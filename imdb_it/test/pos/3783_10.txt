I described Woody Allen's Manhattan as perfect for someone the other day, and she thought it was a strange way of describing a movie ... I only saw a handful of movies that I would call perfect. Manhattan is one, McCabe and Ms. Miller by Robert Altman is another and Once Upon a Time the West by Sergio Leone is also another film that I believe reaches perfection. There are some others, but apart from the fact that I can't find any flaws in the three I mentioned, I must also admit that all three directors have acquired tastes. <br /> <br /> If there is a film I could stand behind and bet the house that anyone I would like to show would find it perfect it is shoulder arms. <br /> <br /> City Lights, The Great Dictator, The Gold Rush and even the pawnshop are 10, but not only did Chaplin do everything right in this movie, all he did was hilarious and moving to a level beyond any explanation.
