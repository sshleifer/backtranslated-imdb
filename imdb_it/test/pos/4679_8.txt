- a surprisingly fun movie <br /> <br /> - A group of thieves led by Mark Wahlberg steals a gold safe in Italy and fortunately for them the robbery is successful and they manage without major problems. Before the group can celebrate, however, Steve, played by Ed Norton, decides he wants gold for himself and rolls a Cout De 'Ta in the group and shoots one of the members. He and his accomplices suggest that the group is dead but fortunately the group is not dead. A year later we return to the story in which the group tracked down Norton and decides to steal the gold and spend the rest of the film with plans to steal their gold and set a score. <br /> <br /> - This was a surprise for me, it had all the requirements to be a typical forgettable summer movie, but in reality it was memorable and really fun to watch. What I like is how smart and well thought out the film's plans are, and how realistic the film is. Watching the trailer makes you think it was an unreasonable action movie, but in reality there are only two action scenes in the movie and they are all really well done. This last action scene is 20 minutes long. scene that has one of the best car chases ever made. I love how real the hunt is and how everything is done in old school style without the help of CGI. Personally, I liked this car chase more than the full CGI hunt in "Matrix 2". I remember seeing the music videos of director F. Gary Gray and I always noticed how well they were and they thought he would become a great director, and I discovered that I was right as always and he shows it here. I can't wait to see what it does with the sequel. <br /> <br /> - The actors do a decent job even with Seth Green who is my favorite of the group. The other thing I liked was the excellent soundtrack of John Powell, since I listened to his soundtrack for "Robots" this year I was his fan and I paid a lot of attention to his music and the man is really good. It does a great job to avoid all the typical musical clich√©s of the summer action movie and provides a very well done soundtrack. I haven't seen the original that this is based on, so I can't really tell how well it imposes on that. <br /> <br /> - Yes this is a great popcorn movie that actually has a brain unlike most of the shit from the summer movie that comes out. He has great characters, it's fun to die for and has an incredible soundtrack by John Powell. If you love robbery movies then you will like this <br /> <br /> - you know if you were in the group they would call me nice Mike
