Why do people need to follow the opinion of the herds of masses and critics? RANDOM HEARTS, directed by the brilliant Sydney Pollack (who also has a small role in the film) is another Harrison Ford vehicle. As such, it's pretty good and fun. Surely, anyone who goes to see it has this in mind, or reads the book which is no better. Even the fans of Kristin Scott Thomas, myself included, knew that it would be her variation to reinterpret the love interest of her older uncle. Even so, the film is satisfying. What's wrong with this film which is much better in the other Harrison Ford vehicles (much more quoted)? This film is not a masterpiece, but it is not as bad as the potential spectator would have believed.
