One of the myths of the first era of sound is that they couldn't do westerns because they had trouble recording sound on the spot. Indeed, it was the financial restrictions of the depression that temporarily killed the gender, at least in the "A" budget range. However, in the period 1929-1931, before the economic crisis was really unleashed, "A" flourished in the West, notable examples including The Virginian, Billy the Kid and Cimarron. Was the Big Trail the biggest of them all ?? a giant pioneer, shot in the West in an early widescreen process that appropriately is called grandiosity. Thanks to a recent version of DVD, we can now see the widescreen version alongside the full screen that was shot simultaneously. <br /> <br /> The director was Raoul Walsh, a man for whom the spirit of adventure was in vast open-air views, and therefore in many ways a perfect choice. It makes great use of the wider frame to show the western landscape in its most extraordinary form. Very typical of Walsh are a number of strokes at the beginning, like the one in which a woman is cutting firewood. Most of the screen is full of carts and other messes, but in one corner we see the invitingly wild nature. When the caravan starts, the open plain is gradually revealed to us, with the wagons moving away like the curtains of the stage. These shots are not so effective in the full screen version, but on the larger canvas Walsh's expression on the outside has never been better. <br /> <br /> But there is an unfortunate downside of the coin. When it comes to dialogue scenes, Walsh's tendency is to position the actors in the middle of the shot, as if they were in an imaginary full-screen box. Does the extra width really become that ?? extra. At first it may seem logical, because it means that in terms of height we see all the actors as in a full screen image. However, the players seem small and insignificant within the frame, while the whole background business dominates the shot ?? and there are a lot of big deals on the Big Trail. When widescreen formats re-emerged in the 1950s, many filmmakers would have made the same mistake before finally realizing that in talkie scenes it is better to frame actors from behind the chest, losing part of their height but allowing them to fill the screen . <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because The Big Trail is a particularly well balanced and finely scripted effort. The subplots of romance and revenge are simple but well defined and do not threaten to unbalance each other or the history of the pioneers. It may have been a great intimate epic, but it loses dramatic weight because every time the characters start talking to each other they distract us from herds of cattle, drifting cars or anything else that fills every inch of the frame. However, Walsh's sensitivity to deeply emotional romantic moments is still on display, and he manages to make the final scene effective and memorable. There are also some nice comic touches, mostly courtesy of "comedian Swede" El Brendel. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail is also known to be John Wayne's first starring role. While Wayne is another victim of faraway framing in the dialogue scenes, we at least see his strong physical presence and listen to his warm but assertive voice. He betrays his lack of experience, but the potential is clearly there. Unfortunately that potential was not widely understood during that time and he spent the rest of the decade painting it in B-pictures before reaching celebrity. In this photo also appears the companion of Wayne (and then prolific character actor) Ward Bond. It is not accredited, but it is possible to identify it in a series of scenes, in particular around the 80 minutes in which it is on the left of Tyrone Power. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail is a glorious epic that manages to defeat itself as a drama. And it was this wonderful ladder that would put the Western (and widescreen) in bed for some time. And even though the 40s and 50s are now considered the golden age of the West, was it now a changed genre, with stories of individual adventure and heroism in an established West? not better or worse, but of a different shape. The period of the first talkers was the end of an era in which Westerners could be truly gigantic.
