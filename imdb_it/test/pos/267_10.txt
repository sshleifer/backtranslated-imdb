After seeing The Lost Child a number of times since its release in 1995, and after reading the reader's comments (especially on the background of Jane Tennison and the wonderful role of Helen Mirren in it), it strikes me more than ever that no comment has been made on the brilliant role that Robert Glenister plays as Chris Hughes. Even after 10 years it is still one of the most credible ways to portray the complex personality of an abusing child, bearing the brunt of its past. Watching the episode for a whole hour makes you pass constantly between feelings of love and hatred for this boy, where hatred prevails because of the gravity of his actions. I've seen more brilliant roles than my favorite actor, but this never fails to make the biggest impression possible for me. Helen Mirren would never shine without these wonderful actors next to her. Praise to Robert Glenister!
