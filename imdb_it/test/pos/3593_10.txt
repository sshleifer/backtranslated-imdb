David Attenborough brings his charm of wild life, this time the creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary journey of 8 episodes to all the animals under the sea! <br /> <br /> Cinematography is astounding, bringing truly stunning videos of those whales to the screen! But the best thing, besides seeing every episode, is how they did it! Whether it's creating models of creatures or impressive whales, they tell you in about 10 minutes how they did it! <br /> <br /> In 2001 we had some fantastic TV shows on our screen. But, in contrast to this documentary gem, they make them rather lame! But even bragging about this series of documentaries as the best TV series of 2001 does not sum up the pure splendor that this series offers in terms of entertainment! <br /> <br /> Overall, this is the best TV series of 2001, with no competition and, perhaps, the best TV series of the 2000s!
