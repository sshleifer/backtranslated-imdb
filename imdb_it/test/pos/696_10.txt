As a teenager, I watched this movie whenever he was on TV (and he was on a lot) because of his witty, appealing teen-oriented humor. It may not be what critics consider a 4-star vision, but I like it for what it is - a fun comedy designed to satisfy the public. The teenage actors are of my generation (probably because I love the movie so much) and they were like a fantasy cast of the favorite TV shows of the early 90s - Full House, Family Matters, Fresh Prince - all the shows were represented and the result was probably the best teenage movie of the 90s. Although it might not include the high doses of nudity and violence that so many young film writers consider vital to success among demographic youth (or perhaps because of its absence), I highly recommend it to pre-teens and teenagers around the world.
