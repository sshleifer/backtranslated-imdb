I love this movie and I have my TV set to record it when it comes back on November 2nd. It's a really beautiful love story with a twist. The song that is played at the end of the film is the one you wouldn't think would be a great success, but it's a song that stays in your head and now I'm trying to find that song so I can listen to it and play it. I don't have any style of shows I see or songs that I like to listen to and there it makes me open enough to see new things with an open mind. I would like to say that there are some parts in this film that are not meant for the whole family to watch. This film shows the skin. It's a bit like a movie of a lifetime for women, for women. I say watch the movie and you might like it as much as I do.
