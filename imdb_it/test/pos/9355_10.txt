Crossfire is a fantastic noir film that is both a product of its time and a timeless classic. This film achieves this problem by addressing issues that were not brought to the screen before its release in 1947, and being a high-quality film that still retains a good script, an excellent appearance and fantastic performances by its actors. The first American film to occupy the issue of anti-Semitism, Crossfire is cemented in a classic position. Set in post-World War II America, a filthy specimen develops after a Jewish man is found murdered. <br /> <br /> The story is great, its anti-hate theme contained in an obscure multi-character thriller, and alongside the anxiety anti-Semitism there are also some great post-war dialogues and themes. Unlike other yellow thrillers, the public is warned of who the culprit is almost immediately. However, the story of the film is still compelling due to the struggle of all the great characters involved while they are trying to make sense of the situation. Outside of the great story and the general themes, the entire script is simply intelligent, complete with meaningful messages and exchanges between extremely clear characters. <br /> <br /> The film's captivating story is wonderfully interpreted by its excellent cast. Robert Young is as fantastic as Captain Finlay, the principal investigator of the murder case. Finlay is my favorite character in the film, he's just a cool character - dry as a bone and as tough as a two by four and he stops at nothing to bring the murderer to justice. Robert Mitchum is also great in the film, very vivid in his army sergeant character spoken in a low voice due to his superb on-screen presence. Gloria Grahame gives a memorable performance in her small Oscar nominated role; George Cooper also does a good job as Corporal Mitchell sick and distressed; Paul Kelly makes a disturbing portrait of a bizarre character; and Steve Brodie, Sam Levene, Jacqueline White and William Phipps also give strong supportive performances. Robert Ryan ends up being the most talked about performer of the film, giving a chilling show like Montgomery and even nominated for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> Crossfire looks terrific. Director Edward Dmytryk does an amazing job with the film and director of photography J. Roy Hunt does a masterful job with his black and white image. The image of Crossfire is dark and damp as its themes, covered by a shadow with an almost shiny tone, but also very rough in the parts. Ironically, the film's magnificent appearance was not the result of hard work - or even intention. Dmytryk wanted to spend more time and money on the actors than on the lighting, so that's what he did. Less light, less preparation (about 6 hours a day), and produced a fantastic looking film. Crossfire is not only a well-made piece of film art, but it is also an excellent example of an economic film that ends with a rich classic.
