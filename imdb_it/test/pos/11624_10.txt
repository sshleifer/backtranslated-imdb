I first saw All the Rivers Run on TV when I was a kid and I loved it. It was good to see a mini series that was set and shot in a place so close to home. Living close enough to Echuca, I enjoyed going to the historic port to see paddle steamers. The first I ever had a ride was the Pevensy (Philadelphia in the film). I like how it's time to let the events take place. Nothing seems rushed like most movies are today. The acting was fantastic. All the Rivers Runs were perfectly expressed and I love the Philadelphia crew. Mac is always fun to watch with its brand of raw onion sandwich after a big night out. It easily deserves a 10 out of 10 and is one of my favorite mini-series ever with the Dirtwater Dynasty.
