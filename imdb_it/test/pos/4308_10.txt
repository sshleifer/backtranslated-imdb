"Müllers Büro" is a film that many will watch and appreciate until the end, while others will stop watching it within five minutes. It is a parody of detective films with all the turns; the action takes place only at night in the dark corners of a city that looks like Batman's Gotham City (look carefully at the streets, buildings, the police car chasing criminals, etc.). It's also a parody of musicals with his really funny characters like Müller's secretary and Vitasek's lover (the actor who plays Müller's assistant) who do their best to sing, though not very successfully. <br /> <br /> The spaces occupied by the characters have their presence in the film like the decadent Blue Box (there is a real club with this name in Vienna) where you see a sailor hitting a girl in the background, Müller's apartment with the black paint spread on the walls and the dirty kitchen, Müller's office with the sweet image of his assistant, etc. <br /> <br /> The film's humorous moments are many and include a kind of "flat in the face" humor like Müller farting in the face of his assistant, the prostitute loads Müller more for orgasm, the ridiculous Montana delinquent women's clothes, etc. <br /> <br /> A legendary film from the 1980s especially for those interested in Austrian or German-speaking cinema.
