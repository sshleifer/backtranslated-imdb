A lot of complete Muppet films, created by Jim Henson & Co, have been made, but "The Muppet Movie" was the first of all and the first of the original trilogy, which also features "The Great". Muppet Caper "and" The Muppets Take Manhattan ". It was released seven years before I was born, so obviously I didn't see it at the time (nor could I see his two successors when they were released for the first time). , I saw a lot of Muppets during my childhood, especially after Henson's untimely death in 1990. I finally saw this film for the first time in the mid-1990s, after hearing the soundtrack, which is not surprising. liked at that moment, and revisiting it in the last few years was not exactly disappointing. <br /> <br /> One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with her banjo after singing "Rainbow Connection", an agent Hollywood named Bernie arrives from a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown. Kermit takes his advice and goes west, soon meeting Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful cabaret artist, and convinces him to come. frog comes and also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a chain of frog-legged restaurants that wants Kermit to be his mascot. Like a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie. During their journey through the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo. Unfortunately, while everyone tries to reach Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become the mascot of his restaurant chain, so Kermit is in growing danger! <br /> <br /> One thing that many people praise for this film are the songs, and I can understand why. There is, of course, the "Rainbow Connection" nominated for the Oscar in the beginning, and other good songs follow, such as the catchy song of Kermit and Fozzie, "Movin 'Right Along", and "I'm Going to Go Back There Un giorno ", a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo. "Never Before, Never Again", the song that Miss Piggy sings when she sees Kermit for the first time, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their love story seems terribly sudden. The Muppets in this film are generally amiable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of humor, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film desperately trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand- up and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them. Some of the live actors who briefly appear in the film can also be fun, like Dom DeLuise like Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as "Insolent Waiter". Moreover, it is not 100% comedy. There are serious parts of the film that have also done well. <br /> <br /> Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since I saw "Muppets from Space" (one of the Muppet films made after the death of Henson, released in 1999) for the first time last year. I was very disappointed when I saw that movie, which had never happened before when I watched a movie or a TV show with the famous puppet characters! Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a bit too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review! However, I cannot say that I consider it the same as any of the predecessors of that film, including this one, published twenty years before. "The Muppet Movie" seems to be the most popular of the group, and since it has so much pleasure, not just for children, it's understandable. I strongly doubt that there is still much to be said about "The Muppet Movie" which has not been said at some point in the last thirty years, but today it remains a good family entertainment.
