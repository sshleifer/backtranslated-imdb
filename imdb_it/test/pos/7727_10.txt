I liked Carmen very much, better than Original Sin (Angelina Jolie and Antonio Bandaras), who share some thematic similarities and liked them a lot. I heard the acting was stronger here (Paz Vega showed a wider range, got more fire and even Sbaraglia was great). Overall, their acting was more gritty, more credible (less dreamy than Original Sin, and both actors had less "celebrity status" and "pretty face" to depend on to make the movie work. <br /> < br /> The director Vincente Aranda has also built a detailed world (again, better than Original Sin) that makes you feel the dirt and everyday events of archaic Spain - for example, the people who unload goods from a trolley on the street, the workers change the candles of the street lamps, all against the background of the action. <br /> <br /> While strongly sharing the recent idea of ​​redeeming the femme fatale (as Femme Fatale by Brian de Palma) Carmen is a moving and modern interpretation of the tradition of the classic noir Double Indemnity and it is a delicious pleasure to look at, another example of the triumph of the brave European cinema on the sumptuous and safe Hollywood cuisine.
