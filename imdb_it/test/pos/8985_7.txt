Peter Lorre turns into one of his best interpretations as a Hungarian watchmaker who comes to the United States to make a new life and one day bring his girlfriend across the big pond to be with him. The infectious optimism and brilliant perspectives of Lorre come out very effectively, which makes the best performance when he has his face burned in a hotel fire and, when no one gives him the chance to work, he reluctantly turns to a criminal life. The range of Lorre as an actor is rarely evident as in this film with his jovial, cheerful immigrant, in his depressing, melancholy and disfigured self in search of the truth behind what he believed that America offered him, to his sweet, intelligent better-than-normal hood, to his affectionate relationships with a blind woman with whom he falls in love. The plot has a fast pace, presents interesting twists and offers Lorre many opportunities to shine. Director Robert Florey does quality work behind the lens, and the whole supporting cast helps help the film with Evelyn Keyes giving a particularly positive turn as a blind girl. I loved the ending - and the truth - that was shined to exist in the character of Lorre, despite all the negative things the company had done to him. For a small B movie, The Man Behind the Mask is a good movie for his time.
