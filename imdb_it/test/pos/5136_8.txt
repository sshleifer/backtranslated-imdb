I highly recommend this movie to everyone. My son and I first read the book and then saw the movie. While the book was better (in my opinion) the film was still exceptional. My son and I agree that while we like the version of the book better, we liked the ending of the film better than the end of the book. The scenery is tremendous and the soundtrack is a must. The fact that Jimmy Buffett has a small role and provides music is an added advantage. Luke Wilson does a decent job in his role as Officer Delinko and is pretty much what I had mentally imagined he would have Delinko when I read the book. I'm surprised this didn't work better in theaters, and I'll wait for the DVD to come out.
