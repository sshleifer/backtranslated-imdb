The Cure is a fantastic film about a boy with AIDS. I cried 4 times watching this movie and it's so sad. I can't promise everyone will cry looking at this, but this will make you want to. Very exciting and very sad, The Cure is a must-see film. It shows you the meaning of friendship and love and it's a fantastic film. <br /> <br /> At first I didn't think it would be so beautiful and I wondered why my mother always cried to look at it. But now I know it's an extraordinary film that is so original and so close to real life situations, unlike most other films that don't make sense. Words cannot describe the greatness of The Cure, you just have to see it.
