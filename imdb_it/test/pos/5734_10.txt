I can't believe someone gave this movie a vote !!! and it is only a 3. media ... What is not to love about this movie? It's original, it has a lot of scary scenes that made me jump out of my seat and has fantastic special effects. The story is fresh, there is some nudity, and it is very campy. The killer was scary in his demented way and the end is very unexpected. I have to admit that I love this movie, one of the best Spanish horror films of all time. If you consider yourself a true horror fan you need to go out and try to find this movie. You will be pleasantly surprised to do so.
