I must have seen this movie about four or five times already, and it improves every vision. Suffice to say: this is the best film I've ever seen. And I think I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> But I've always wondered why this movie was so avoided in some reviews or ratings. For example, take IMDb's Top 250. Why classify only at # 216 (today)? Surely, the answer is not in the film itself (because it is nothing but impeccable), but in its reception. The film caused controversy in his portrayal of compassion for a doomed murderer and his anti-death stance. And so, obviously, the most prudent user probably didn't like the movie (as you can see from some of the other comments). So Dead Walker gets a ranking that is nothing ridiculous in relation to its quality. These people didn't understand what the film meant, and maybe they didn't want to understand it, being a death sentence. So now I understand: it's all political. You're the death penalty - you don't like (and therefore don't want to hear) what the movie has to say. <br /> <br /> I'm really sorry there are still so many people out there who simply tune in when a new perspective casts doubt on their beliefs. <br /> <br /> Robbins, the problem of your movie would divide people's opinions. Some have reconsidered their point of view, others simply have not listened, but you have made a very important point. Your film will probably never appear on any list of "TOP 100 MOVIES OF ALL TIME", but it will be remembered, long after films like Braveheart or Babe or Apollo 13 (which were unfairly preferred for your 1996 Oscar film) are forgotten. Congratulations, Mr. Robbins, and thank you for this important filmmaking.
