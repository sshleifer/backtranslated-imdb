I was lucky to see this sequel before the original because I'm not sure I would have gone out of my way to see it if the opposite had been true. I found "Mission Cléopâtre" better than its predecessor for different reasons, but the most important is this: it was almost word for word an adaptation of a book, not an amalgam like the first film. The physical similarity of some characters with their animated ego was very funny, especially the villain (the name that escapes me, but is the other architect). I don't know how this movie played in English; my first language is french so i didn't have this problem ... i guess some jokes weren't so easy to translate. I've learned something with years it's better to watch a movie with subtitles than with dubbing, maybe you won't understand what they say, but you won't lose the rhythm and I think this is important too. I would recommend this film to anyone who truly loves "Astérix et Obélix".
