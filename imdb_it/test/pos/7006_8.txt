Pitch Black is a story of survival. It's about how to survive in a hostile and alien world against even more hostile enemies. The task becomes even more difficult when the closest enemies can be found within your surviving group. <br /> <br /> The Pitch Black plot is quite common and has been seen several times in different variations. But what makes this film shine over others is that they are well-written characters. <br /> <br /> The group consists of very different people with few more interesting than the others: Jack, a boy with a secret; Fry, a pilot who has difficulty with his conscience; Johns, a bounty hunter with a drug habit; Imam, a saint who faces the fact that God is sometimes cruel and Riddick, a convict and a murderer who learns to value others, not just himself. The characters begin to live in the film. I'm not just paper like in many other films of this kind. You start to worry about the characters, especially for Riddick, even if it's rather strange. It should be the bad guy. In this film, the line between light and black is very thin. All the characters are familiar with both. <br /> <br /> Another thing that works in this film is the casting. Actors rarely adapt well to their roles. Radha Mitchell is suitable for frying. Cole Hauser brings the right amount of cruelty and a sense of responsibility to Johns. But the most impressive work is done by Vin Diesel. He does a great job as Riddick. In his hands Riddick is rather disturbing, certainly very dangerous and also a deep character, just as it should be. <br /> <br /> So how do you survive in Pitch Black? Keep your friends close and enemies even closer.
