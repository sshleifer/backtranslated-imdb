The "House of Dracula" really has nothing new to offer in terms of thrills or chills or new turns on an already tired plot. This film was made as a hasty sequel to the "House of Frankenstein" done quite well a year ago. In "House of Dracula" you can see the factory as the 1945 production values, which took their toll on a potentially potentially scary movie. Previous films of the series and the finale of "Ghost of Frankenstein" have been used as an ending, but they are just an "el cheepo" movie. Here lies the shame of the studio and the producer, given that they had top-notch talent and simply wasted everyone's time and effort on a quick money return system. But that seems to have been the trend throughout Hollywood at the end of World War II. This is what prompted some of those unreasonable science fiction photos of the 50s with all their close-ups of innocent lizards to make them look like dinosaurs. The days of James Whale and Val Lewton, to name just two, ended up creating a true mood and atmosphere in this genre. Keep in mind also that the makeup genius, Jack Pierce, who actually did medical research to create all our favorites, was summarily fired immediately after the release of this particular film. A lesser makeup man, by the name of Bud Westmore, was later hired as head of this department of Universal, which would soon become Universal-International. Not to denigrate Mr. Westmore's ability, but horror movies weren't his forte. OK, to watch or not to watch. Watch this movie, but only as part of the chronological order of the Frankenstein series and you will see how this all ended up as comic fodder for Abbott and Costello.
