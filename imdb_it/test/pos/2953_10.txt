In the midst of a documentary about her parents, the filmmaker's mother dies, but continues to shoot the documentary, discovering a story she has not foreseen. The result is an engaging drama that has the quality of fiction in the best sense of that word, in which a sympathetic but unconscious narrator privileges the public unconsciously. The plot therefore has a double plot, the history of the documentary and the history of the documentarist. <br /> <br /> Our admiration is with the director, not only to stubbornly persecute his story, although he risks his entire notion of his parents' relationship, but also to never give in to sensationalism or melodrama. Although the Hollywood stuff lurks in the details, Doug Block treats the story like he would in everyday life. For those of us who have always speculated about our parents' lives before entering the scene (or after we arrived, but while we were too busy to realize that we had a life independent of ourselves), 51 Birch Street gives the right warning: There are wonderful things back there at home, but be careful if you choose to go in there. <br /> <br /> But that caution is that the public moves slowly wandering in the details of his parents' past. It is not a warning to those who offered a glimpse into the life of Block's parents. The film is a marvel in making the mother alive as a lively and passionate but introspective person who makes her conscious decisions during the 1950s. The filmmaker's particular success is to get viewers to see the young woman behind the elderly parent and grandfather. We all know that our parents were once young and vigorous, but on 51 Birch Street, the mother is. The father who was away while the filmmaker and his sister were growing eventually remains distant in the film, but this is due more to its elusive nature than to its interpretation. This biography turned into an autobiography is dramatic, intense and unforgettable, it will certainly send viewers who will rush to take a closer look at their family albums, but more hesitant in looking at the shoulders of those photographs.
