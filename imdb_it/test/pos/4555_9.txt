During my trip to a youth leadership forum, I did channel surfing until I found "Tommy Boy" on TBS. Since I've never seen this movie before, I wanted to take a look. My roommate, who has already seen this, told me: "This film is a classic". After seeing the whole movie, I came to the conclusion that he was right. <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is constantly entertaining from beginning to end, thanks to the comedic duo of Chris Farley and David Spade. Farley is a riot like the title character, a spastic dobo who spends his life as if it were not important. His lazy ways are soon interrupted when his father (Brian Dennehy), a wealthy "Break Pads King", dies of a heart attack on his wedding day. This brings Tommy, with the help of his sarcastic childhood friend Richard (David Spade), to travel to sell enough break pads to save the company. <br /> <br /> The main reason why "Tommy Boy" is the entertaining shows from the main cast. Farley is the funniest person in this movie, the second funniest person is Spade and the third is Rob Lowe as the villain of the movie who had bad luck. Another funny character is Dan Aykroyd in the role of Ray Zalinsky, a well-known piece of extra car. <br /> <br /> Another reason the film works is the large amount of jokes. Chris Farley has hilarious moments of slapstick and David Spade has funny comments and jokes. The gags in the film (some of which involve a deer and the bathroom of an airplane) are fun and entertaining, thanks to director Peter Segal (Naked Gun 33 1/3), screenwriters Bonnie & Terry Turner <br /> <br / > (3rd Rock From the Sun, That 70s Show), and the cast. <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is a really fun film, although for some unknown reason most film critics (including Roger Ebert) find it horrible and not very funny. (I wonder when their sense of humor is dead). I recommend "Tommy Boy" for those who are big fans of comedy. Thank you very much, roommate.
