This film gives Daniel Wu the chance to make a great action movie, but I really find the character of Emil Chow really big, brave but determined to correct the wrongs. Moreover, the main terrorist, makes me think about his revolution, makes me wonder if he is doing this for better or for worse. <br /> <br /> A film about Todd, an Amnesian terrorist who is deceived as a raid until he learns who he really is. The consequences he makes from his terrorist family give him a choice of redemption. <br /> <br /> Purple Storm was one of the best I've seen this year. The film really stood out when it was filled with incredible action scenes set by Stephen Tung Wai, who won the best action sequences in the Hong Kong Awards. (9/10)
