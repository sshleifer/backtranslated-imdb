This film will certainly not agree with some, because most horror is mental. But it has something more for almost everyone, including a couple of really fantastic abduction scenes with aliens. The film makes extensive use of the mythology of alien abductions, while also showing a little more intelligence on some aspects of the kidnapping myths that one would not expect from a movie. Jillian McWhirter is excellent in what must have been a grueling performance.
