Created in 1928 and originally named Mortimer before Walt Disney changed its name (because his wife convinced him), Mickey Mouse has become the staple of the Disney brand. I always thought this cartoon was Mickey's first cartoon, it's actually his third, but it doesn't matter, for a six-minute animated short it's fun. The story sees Mickey Mouse flying a steamer until Captain Pete takes him off the bridge, stopping to pick up the load, and Minnie Mouse misses the boat. When she is raised, she drops her sheets of music and a goat eats them, Mickey helps her to turn the tails and play the melody, and to make other animals percussion, until Pete comes back to stop him, making him peel Mickey Mouse potatoes. Mickey was number 53 in The 100 greatest pop culture icons, and was the number 31 of the 100 largest cartoons. Very good!
