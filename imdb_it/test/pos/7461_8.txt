Finding the intriguing premise, and reading the reviews, and being a fan of Angel, I watched this movie. It's sexy and original and very funny. David Boreanaz is Keith. He is a robust and married man, he is at home dad and feels a little inadequate in his marriage. He makes the mistake of entering a small circle of teenage girls who are fascinated by the idea of ​​doing it with an older man. They will do anything to get into his bed, including beg, lie and blackmail, but above all they try to press his buttons. The resulting darkness sends Keith to stagger and push friendships to the limit. David Boreanaz shows some skin in this ... and it looks hot. Yes, it sounds a bleak cheater - but it shows enough vulnerability and tenderness towards the stupid adolescent years that in the end you end up cheering for him. Another thing, when someone moans "oh yes, oh..oh..YEAH !!", it's hard to see them as victims of rape.
