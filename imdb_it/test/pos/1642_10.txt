Ice the Limerick: <br /> <br /> A virus pulled out of the ice <br /> <br /> I simply didn't know how to play well. <br /> <br /> If infected you will kill <br /> <br /> Because you are sick. <br /> <br /> The cure must be infected twice. <br /> <br /> Ice is a great episode; one of the greats of season 1 who started to shape the show and if you ask me, you couldn't really ask for much better during the whole series. Start with a fantastic teaser that in my opinion is really one of the best teasers in the series. A group of scientists in Alaska pierced something from the ice core that, for some reason, made them kill each other. Now Mulder and Scully are sent with three other scientists to investigate what happened. As Mulder says, this is because they are brilliant or expendable. I take this to say that it would have been better to be brilliant or something ... The group soon finds out that the cause of the chaos is a small parasite extracted from the ice core. A small worm that enters the bloodstream and causes violent behavior. Since the pilot is infected, the rest of the show turns into a suspenseful paranoid thriller, while the others begin to suspect each other of being infected. This is not at all helped by an overly paranoid doctor, Hodge, who does not trust anyone of what we learn early from the first thing he asks: to see everyone's credentials to "make sure we are who we say we are". Events lead to discovering the one who is infected and learning to cure them. <br /> <br /> There are a number of things I like about the episode and, of course, certain characters that I want to slap in the face with this episode, as well as a couple of loopholes, but most can be attributed be careful not to think clearly. I like Bear from the moment I met him for the first time. It is a pity that he must die. I also like the scene from the point of view of the other scientist as Mulder and Scully argue in the other room. It gives an interesting twist to our typical perception as a spectator and to me it seems to say that maybe we shouldn't take it for granted that just because someone is a government means they know all kinds of conspiracy secrets. As much as Hodges frustrates me in this episode, I think Mulder is so much to blame for some of the reckless actions taken. I really like Scully in this episode. First of all she can face like a damn linebacker! Second, I really like to focus on her terror at what can happen to them out there and how she tries not to let Mulder's trust and friendship prevent her from influencing her judgment. I love the scene when he enters the room to sleep and first appears as the image of the previous group that embraces everyone and the birthday presents from them to those who slept in that room and then how suddenly he gets scared and pushes the dresser in front of the door and with a final touch of subtlety as he sits on the floor with his knees drawn into his chest we see the bottom of a poster on the wall that reads "Bosom Buddies". This is a great writing. A way to say without words that Scully is worried that she can't even trust her best friend. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this increased suspicion leads the group to believe that Mulder has been infected since he discovers that Murphy is a dead body even though they have not at all inspected him to find out for sure. That was my main problem with the behavior of the characters: they could easily have solved all the suspicions simply by giving blood. But I imagine that I probably would have acted rashly even in that situation. But then the stupid Hodges decides he must assume that Mulder is infected even though Mulder voluntarily surrenders and then is voluntarily going to be inspected and almost infects Mulder in the process. Fortunately he sees that it is really Dasilva who is infected and we finally reach a resolution. At least what you can expect from an X-File. The "government" wastes no time in burning up the evidence as always happens in these cases and Mulder remains with another frustrating "unresolved" case. In closing I give "Ice" and easy 10/10 and I leave you with a haiku. <br /> <br /> "We are not who we are. It does not go beyond this. It ends right here now".
