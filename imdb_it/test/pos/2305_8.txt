In 1895, in a small village in Japan, the wife of the sedan chair Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura), Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), has an affair with a twenty-six year-old man, Toyiji (Tatsuya Fuji). Toyiji becomes jealous of Gisaburo and plots with Seki to kill him. They squeeze Gisaburo and dump his body in a well in the woods, and Seki tells the locals that Gisaburo has moved to Tokyo to work. Three years later, locals talk about the fate of Gisaburo and Seki is haunted by his ghost. The situation becomes unbearable for Seki and Toyiji when a police authority arrives in the village to investigate the disappearance of Gisaburo. <br /> <br /> "Ai no Borei" is a surreal and supernatural love story. Seki's remorse and guilty complex show her the ghost of her murdered husband, ruining her lover's perfect plot. Cinematography is jeopardized by the quality of the VHS released in Brazil, but there are very nice scenes, including "Ringu" and the American remake "The Ring" using the view of the well from the inside at the same angle. The performances and direction are excellent making "Ai no Borei" a great film. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Império da Paixão" ("The Empire of the Passion")
