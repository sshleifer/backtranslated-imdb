I collect films on Super-8 and managed to get a full print of this last week on E-bay. It seems at least for the moment, this is the only way to see this film in a country with NTSC videos. I've seen it many times on the region 2 DVD, but never the region 1. <br /> <br /> I just finished watching it a few minutes ago and I'm surprised. It is a powerful testament to freedom and finding your place in the world. Photography and music were wonderful, and I felt empathy for some characters. <br /> <br /> I like the idea that I was probably the only one in the United States watching "When the North Wind Blows" tonight! <br /> <br /> Long Live Avakum !!
