Mike Nichols' "Charlie Wilson's War" film, set in the 1980s, tells the story of how the title character (played by Tom Hanks) managed to wage a secret war with the Russians helping Afghan forces. Of course, we know how much has gone well in the long run but, fortunately, the film does not fly over the unpleasant side effects. <br /> <br /> The cast is studded with stars, with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts among Hollywood's most bankable stars. As a bonus, you have the versatile Philip Seymour Hoffman in a typically memorable support role, one for whom he received a non-undue Oscar nomination. I'm not very fan of Roberts but Hanks is always reliable. However, I can't buy it as a drugged womanizer, even though the real Charlie Wilson seems just as nice as Hanks. However, apart from the big three, there is not much to emphasize, even from a recognizable name like Amy Adams. <br /> <br /> The story is compelling and is backed up by a beautiful script by Aaron Sorkin. The verbal interaction between the main characters is excellent and is full of memorable lines. The subsequent events set in motion by the war are not ignored, even though the table scenes that honor Wilson seem to me too sincere to get the bittersweet atmosphere that was probably expected. Overall, Nichols is directed by a worker and follows the action of the script admirably. <br /> <br /> This is a film that, like Charlie Wilson himself, has flaws but is still pleasantly disarming. Definitely recommended for fans of the three stars and for those who are looking for an engaging political drama with a light feeling.
