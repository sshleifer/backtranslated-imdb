This was a good film. It had an interesting plot, which was performed quite well in the next part of the film. The plot reminded me of the City of God. But this is done in a nicer way by comparison. He had what I truly loved: a tinge of surrealism. A rather interesting cinematography (through the wooden camera) I'm not sure if it was culturally correct, but it certainly broadens your vision of South Africa. The actors were good (for the 1st timer, most of them anyway), I particularly liked the character of Estelle, who made this movie very funny. What is interesting, though, is that it makes you wonder about your life. Are you really doing what you really love? Or you consent to normality, to conventionalism around you. Definitely worth looking at.
