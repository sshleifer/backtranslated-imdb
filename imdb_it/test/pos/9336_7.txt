In 1983, Michael Jackson's popularity was such that if he wanted to make a $ 1 million horror music video with the "American Werewolf" team and in the voice of Vincent Price, then that was exactly what he would do. And never before has a music video created such a feeling, before or after it was released on VHS, this 13-minute short has become the world's best-selling musical of all time. But the odds are all known, like whenever there is a list of the greatest music videos of all time, this almost invariably takes first place. <br /> <br /> Start with Michael Jackson walking in a dark street with his date after their car has fallen apart. He explains that he is not "like other men" (damn good), and then the full moon appears from behind the clouds. His girlfriend stands there and screams, and screams, and then screams a little more, during a sumptuous transformation sequence while Michael Jackson becomes a werewolf. He chases her through the forest, takes her and we ... cut into a cinema. Ah, all this is happening in a horror movie that Michael Jackson and his date are watching. <br /> <br /> So we're five minutes away and there's still no sign of the song "Thriller". Extravagant, a lot? Anyway, you need to know how it goes from here ... dance, sing ... cemetery ... Vincent Price ... zombie ... "What's the problem?" ... then the credits. Final credits for a fucking music video. "Thriller" is not one of Michael Jackon's most memorable songs, but even by today's standards it is definitely a bitch of a visual experience. If you haven't seen it in its entirety yet, then surely you should one day soon.
