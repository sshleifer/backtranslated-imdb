This first Warner Brothers talkie "Son of the Gods" (1930) deals with the racial intolerance that Anglo-Saxon Americans show towards the Chinese. The Chinese-Americans are treated as second-class citizens, and the whites hold them with nothing but contempt. <br /> <br /> Prolific writer Bradley King based his script on the Rex Beach novel about a young, impressionable Chinese, Sam Lee (Richard Barthelmess of "Only Angels Have Wings"), who experiences the racial bias of first hand when the girls that his college mates bring with them for a party reveal their racist feelings about Sam once they learned of his legacy. Sam goes to his father, Lee Ying (E. Alyn Warren of "Gone With The Wind"), who is a rich Chinese with offices not only in New York but also in San Francisco. Sam feels deeply wounded by racist insults and wants to leave New York and go where he can't be hurt by the Americans. His patient father warns him that racism is a fact of everyday life and the only solution to racism is tolerance. Sam has yet to learn this lesson. He refuses to take more money from his father and takes a ship to London, England, peel the potatoes while on board. <br /> <br /> During the journey, he meets an English playwright, Bathurst (Claude King of "Arrowsmith"), who needs help writing a play about the Chinese. Sam and he make a friendship and Sam gives him cultural information about Asians. While relaxing in France, Sam meets a beautiful young woman, Allana Wagner (Constance Bennett of "Two-Face Woman"), who falls madly in love with him. It seems that Allana and her rich father are on vacation in the same motel. Everyone at the motel knows that Sam is a Chinese with the exception of Allana. Sensitive to her racial heritage, Sam keeps Allana close at hand until she can convince him that nothing can change her mind. They fall madly in love together. Allana's father drops the bomb on her when she reveals that Sam is a Chinese and all the memories of living in San Francisco and dealing with the coolies flood Allana's mind. He rushes into the motel's dining room and publicly blocks Sam with a horse crop in front of a room full of spectators. <br /> <br /> Naturally, Sam is terribly devastated by this reversal of events. He thought that Allana loved him but he didn't. During this time, Sam Lee Ying's father became tragically ill and Ying's secretary Eileen ("Iron Man" Mildred Van Dorn) sent Sam a telegram about Ying's disease. Predictably, Sam rushes home to New York to stand by his father's side. After his public humiliation, Sam promised not to show kindness to Anglo-Saxon Americans; Eileen is an Irish Catholic and probably one of his few white friends. Lee Ying dies and Sam takes control of the business and practices his anti-White racism, until he finds out that he was an Anglo-Saxon foundling that a San Francisco cop gave Lee Ying and his wife to show them. The policeman forgot about it until two types of busy physician wanted to take Sam away from the Yings. Sam learns this revelation around the same time that Allana comes to New York and becomes ill. During his illness, he repeatedly pronounces his name in his sleep and the devoted father goes to see Sam and asks Sam to visit her to help her recover. Unbeknownst to Allana, Sam visits her and she improves, but has no memory of her visit, just a nebulous idea. In the end, Allana discovers the truth that Sam is not Chinese and they marry and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> This socially conscientious Warner Brothers / First National Pictures Release frankly and resolutely upholds the race problem for the first hour or so before the revelation that Sam has no Chinese blood flowing in his veins catch both him and the audience by surprise. The reconciliation between Allana and Sam extends credibility, despite their self-professed eternal love for one another. However, in the name of a happy ending that would have erased all the negativity that came before, they end up in each other's arms. <br /> <br /> The capitulation on the problem of race with the revelation that Sam is not The Chinese damage part of the moral power of the film. Incredibly, "Son of the Gods" is a pre-coded film that seems almost prudent; for example, Sam is an American, not a Chinese! Constance Bennett gives a wonderful performance while a petulant beautifies and attracts your attention when she whips Sam with her riding crop. Claude King is as good as Bathurst, and E. Alyn Warren is as convincing as Lee Ying. It is interesting to note that Warren made a career playing Asian characters. Richard Barthelmess is as flawless as Sam; delivers a very nuanced performance. Despite his age, "Son of the Gods" is the son of a good movie!
