Mute Witness is a modest but very solid thriller that has never received the attention or good comments it deserves. The film ?? written and directed entirely by Anthony Waller ?? is a tense and action-packed thriller with aspects of black comedy and horror influences. No useless mumbo-jumbo or endless weaves of plot just to the point of the mystery. Mute Witness manages the vicious theme of "snuff" movies and is set in Russia. *** SPOILER *** As production costs are cheaper, an American film crew temporarily moves to Russia to shoot a horror film. An old hangar is used as a film location. The team's make-up artist is accidentally blocked during the night and while trying to find a way out, she witnesses the recordings of an authentic snuff movie! She is captured and tries to escape, but since she is mute, she cannot ask for help and even she cannot explain what she saw to the police correctly. Is the girl's life in real danger now, since there's a whole network hidden behind these tobacco productions and they don't want witnesses to be alive? *** End Spoilers ***. Mute Witness contains more highly exciting action sequences and is quite gory. Some of the mysterious clues are actually kept secret until the end. As for the similar theme, I'd say it's definitely better than the more famous "8 mm", directed by Joel Schumacher and starring Nicolas Cage. The acting in Mute Witness is not great, but the leading actress (who is the same Russian) looks really pretty. Sir Alec Guinness also makes a special appearance. And very nice, I can say. Definitely recommended with guaranteed fun and scares.
