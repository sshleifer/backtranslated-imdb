Although this film is not the most fun in the world, I think it is better than most. I mean, he had his little laughs and a good feeling all around. It is not often that you see two old geeks enjoying themselves with their age and genuinely enjoying themselves with jokes. Walter and Jack have had great chemistry together as friends / brothers-in-law. Just looking at them while making fun of these women was fun and you rooted for them all the way because they have to admit it or not, for their age, they still had game! : D I just loved the plot of being able to go on and have fun, no matter how old you are. I recommend this movie for a good laugh if you want one. <br /> <br /> 7/10
