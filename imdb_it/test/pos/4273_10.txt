I love the TV contest. I hate to see him finish. There are so many talented competitors. It is a pity that only 2 will be selected. I also love the judges. Sometimes they are fun like the competitors. I watched the show faithfully every Sunday night. I will not miss for the world. It's the best reality show I've ever been on television. Good luck to all the competitors, even though I've already chosen the two I'd like to see playing Danny and Sandy on Broadway. I look forward to seeing if my decisions are correct. I'm not aware of how long the race will last until Danny and Sandy are chosen, but I will continue to watch until the end.
