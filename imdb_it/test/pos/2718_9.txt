That's how I played the film: first. There was not a single scene in the movie where you see the villain (Taylor) torturing or nailing Ben's hands to the wall. However the same cannot be said of the girls. Finally, see Taylor disappear as he walks. It seems the message was "There was no Taylor". And the whole movie was a figment of Ben's imagination. Furthermore, there was no scene during the moments of torture in which any of the girls confront or find themselves in the same frame as Ben. It was Taylor all the time. But really, Taylor was Ben. If they were two different people, then why was there no scene that showed them both in a frame during horrible times? But of course before that, you see them both together, and THAT cud is just Ben's imagination at work. Also, when Ben was out of jail, the text on the screen clearly states that Ben's story was unrealistic and there was no place as he had explained (read mine, cars etc ...) even after Liz Hunter leaves Kristy and goes back to find Ben, can't find him. Why??? Because Ben (Taylor) was out looking for the girls. Instead Kristy has all the time in the world to check Taylor's (Ben) webcam, photos etc ... <br /> <br /> Somehow it just sums up just one fact that Kristy and Liz, both knew that Taylor was Well. So, my conclusion is that Ben was schizophrenic and the film in which you see him and Taylor in a frame was nothing but a figment of his imagination. Otherwise if there was indeed a Taylor, then they would have to find him out given all the detailed explanations coming from Ben.
