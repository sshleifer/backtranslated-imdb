WONDERBIRD, certainly an incredibly refined cartoon, drawn in a deliciously old-fashioned way, and sensational old-fashioned in almost every respect, takes place in a kingdom ruled by a bad and evil monarch; consequently, the kingdom, or at least what we see around the king's palace, seems lifeless, uninhabited. <br /> <br /> Are there any inhabitants? far from the sun ?? in the shriveled underground city. <br /> <br /> A suggestion is to call it an allegory, to call it a parable, not to call it a fable alone. <br /> <br /> Because IMDb encourages prolixity, and perhaps for other reasons, and I will add that this cartoon is the work of the great Paul Grimault.
