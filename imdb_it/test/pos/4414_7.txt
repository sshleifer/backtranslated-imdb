In many ways this film defines the essence of everything I love about cinema, in terms of capturing those strange, elusive moments of unattended truth. In other ways, it is undeniably an amateurish, unfocused result of junkies who let themselves be fooled with a camera. In the end, it emerges somehow between pure splendor and incoherability (luckily much more the first than the second). A part of me wants to reward him only for his absolute innovation and for moments of pure sublimity, but at the same time I can't completely ignore the "unpleasant" acting and the openly bad production values. At the beginning the editing seems overwhelming and unnecessarily distracted (or maybe just wrong, "innovative"), but after a while I'm used to it, which is, in the end, the real sign that a film manages to respect its terms or not. I guess the answer basically summarizes my all-round feelings for the film. That is, despite being an un-skippable defect, on the whole it works very well. And, if nothing else, a film like this really shows how fake and documented the fake-documentary style is, sometimes tremendously mimic, when it is so obviously applied for pure effect (as in films like Roger Dodger, otherwise admirable). Here the aesthetics is clearly derived from the needs of the shooting situation and is not simply used arbitrarily to make it "cool".
