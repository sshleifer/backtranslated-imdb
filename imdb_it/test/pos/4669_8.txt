Here is another pleasant surprise. Every time I hear a movie being redone, I shudder. Movies like Gone in Sixty Seconds and The Day of the Jackal are being redone and the results are less than stellar. So when I learned that "Italian work" was going to be redone, I expected it to go wrong. <br /> <br /> Well, I had the opportunity to calm down, read some reviews and finally see the movie, and it was proved wrong. Of course, it's not original and predictable, but it's definitely fun. From start to finish, you're taken on a very fun ride. The scenes with the Minis are fantastic and the characters really have fun. <br /> <br /> So, even if there are some flaws, who cares how much fun it is? <br /> <br /> In general, 8 out of 10. The only points lost are, perhaps, the few details and a slight lack of realism. But you'll have so much fun that you won't even be given the chance to stop and notice it.
