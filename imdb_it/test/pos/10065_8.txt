If this film had been made in the 50s or 60s, critics and fans would have praised it. I myself enjoyed the film from beginning to end. It's not a timeless piece, and it hasn't aged well over the years, but it's still fun to watch it. What about Mrs. Ritchie's acting in the film? It is not the best on the planet - but it adds to the unique burlesque aspirations of the film, and highlights the sense (often underestimated) of Madonna's comic moment. Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a former prisoner who was framed for a crime she didn't commit. Griffin Dunne plays the unfortunate future groom / puppet who is sent to escort her from the prison to the bus station, where a series of unfortunate events occur, thus creating the plot. (And there * is * one, folks!) Give it a shot. You might be pleasantly surprised at how much fun it really is.
