... The reason why I like this movie so much is because of the spirit it has. It's a brilliant summer camp movie, so the jokes are not petty in a lasting way that makes a character the permanent target of ridicule. The jokes take place, but you have the feeling that the respective fall-guys would be able to look back and laugh, having been stupid enough to fall in love with them - and without being too mischievous, it's actually a little cute that everyone still remains friends in the end! <br /> <br /> It's an extra bonus when the director of all these jokers is Bill Murray. For me, he is still considered the god of comedy without equal when he has the chance to break free. No one is better at generating a sense of unrestrained anarchy without hurting anyone. The tone of the entire film has the same style as its protagonist, established with a large opening scene that shows the way Murray prepares for the day. Everything is stupid, yes, but more important than acting as an adult is having a lot of fun. "Meatballs" promises such and eventually offers a nutritious watch.
