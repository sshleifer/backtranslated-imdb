I saw it last night and this morning again - that's how much I liked it. There's something in this movie ... When the movie was almost finished, I was going to cry. I highly recommend "Latter Days" to my friends: it's definitely worth seeing! I agree with those who say that some parts of the film do not seem very realistic. For example, both main characters are totally cute and in perfect physical shape (even if the round is also a kind of shape :)). I rarely meet people like this as a single person and I've never met any of them as a couple. Other parts of the film, including all those "coincidences", don't seem very realistic. BUT, after all it's a movie, not a life story.
