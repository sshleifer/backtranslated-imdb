Lemuel Gulliver (Ted Danson) is a doctor who disappears into the sea, leaving behind his pregnant wife Mary (Mary Steenburgen). Eight years later, he appears, disheveled and seemingly mad, stammering about his adventures in the lands of little Lilliputians, the giant Brobdingnags, the floating island of intellectual Laputa and the Houyhnhnms, a race of intelligent talking horses who have dealt with Yahoos - a race of bestial humans - among many other adventures. The not so good Dr. Bates (James Fox), who has drawings on Lemuel's wife, has Gulliver imprisoned in a psychiatric institution, and Lemuel, Mary and son Thomas (Tom Sturridge) have to find a way to prove his sanity . <br /> <br /> A splendid adaptation of the satirical novel by Jonathan Swift, this film is a magnificent adaptation on so many levels: history, satire, characters, images, brilliant cast. It's simply a pleasure to watch, and it's almost unbelievable considering it was a TV movie. <br /> <br /> The film does a great job in capturing Swift's vicious satire, which cuts through the English society of the time as an ax, but still resonates today. The essays Brobdingnags and the Houyhnhnms are almost perfect individuals who find it virtually impossible to understand why Gulliver speaks so proudly of the vices and corruptions of his society. The scenes in which Gulliver strives to prove himself different from the Yahoos are perhaps the best, with the biting satire describing how they choose their leaders ("they seem to choose the worst among them ... who rules until they find someone even worse" ), go to war ("We go to war only for a good reason - how weaker they are, or we want all their land"), etc. Even the scenes involving Laputa are done effectively - intellectuals are so wrapped up in their specialized fields that they have no time for anything else, and actually have little common sense. And the addition of the plot to the plot greatly increases the story - Dr. Bates is a really bad character, and when he makes a speech for the investigation into the alleged defects of Gulliver, it's pretty clear he's describing his own flaws. <br /> <br /> The film makes use of wonderful and quite convincing CGI effects that effectively represent the various settings of the novel. The contrast of dimensions is done very skilfully and all the worlds represented in the story are convincing in their own way. The cinematography (in particular that relating to the asylum) and the costumes are brilliantly realized. Mounting the present with Lemuel's memories is a device that could be embarrassing, but it works very well. <br /> <br /> The cast is really wonderful; a real who's-who of British and American talent. Ted Danson offers an excellent and multi-level performance like Gulliver, effectively showing his transformation from a person disoriented by his strange environments, from the moody state he was in when he reappears, from his rational and intellectual personality to the end. Best known for his work on sitcoms, Danson proves to be much more than Sam Malone with this wonderful comedy show. Mary Steenburgen is as effective as his wife, and James Fox is absolutely repulsive as Bates. The rest of the cast is mainly composed of cameos, with Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Warwick Davis, Kristin Scott Thomas, Geraldine Chaplin, Alfre Woodward, Edward Fox and Sir John Gielgud as the most memorable - but also the smallest parts they are very well played. <br /> <br /> While not 100% faithful to the book, "Gulliver's Travels" is a triumph of stories and images. Not to be missed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
