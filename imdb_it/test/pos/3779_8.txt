Chaplin is a doughboy in his latest 1918 film, a doughboy who seems unable to make a straight march. He spends his time "down there" in the trenches of the First World War. Several gags stand out: Limburger cheese as an improvised grenade for one. The narrow spaces of the barracks in the trenches and when Chaplin and his companions are washed by the bunks due to flooding are highlights. Chaplin ends up capturing numerous German soldiers from one hand and channels the German commander for refusing a cigarette. When asked how he did it, Chaplin replied that he surrounded them. Chaplin hides behind enemy lines like a tree of all things, and those scenes are very funny. He flees to a bombed house where he meets a French girl played by Edna Purviance. He is tracked down by German soldiers, escapes from them again and Purviance is arrested for assisting him. Chaplin is able to pull one fast by jumping a soldier and using the soldier's uniform. He ends up naturally saving Purviance and capturing the Kaiser in the process. Along the way, Chaplin employs some sighting gags and a joke in bringing German soldiers back. With this film, Chaplin explored the possibilities of location of the footage keeping the public's attention for a time closer to the feature film, which his contract with the Mutual Film Corporation denied him. The film also allowed him to make fun of the enemy, which he would have done more effectively in The Great Dictator. *** of 4 stars.
