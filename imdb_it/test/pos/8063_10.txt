Over the years I have been very interested in the life of this teenager who has left such a profound and indelible mark on the world. My fascination was also born of fear, as in, it could happen again. <br /> <br /> And in the following years, yes, I fear that "it" continues to happen around us and, of course, "it" was happening long before Anne. Is "it" of course that a so-called civilized society turns alone or in an innocent country / race / continent and kills cold-blooded citizens with the most subtle excuses? I leave this question out there. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the documentary there is a statement about the leader Adolf Hitler because the profound fact of Hitler that is never mentioned is that he was democratically elected and all of the atrocities committed were accomplished as a result of a compliant poodle press and of a propaganda that scares fear, repeated over and over again for a docile population. <br /> <br /> One of the atrocities was Anne Frank, who put a face to the death camps thanks to the miracle of the survival of her diary. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Brannagh does a wonderful job on commenting and interviewing, he has the rare gift of minimizing his personality and allowing subjects to speak for themselves. <br /> <br /> Many new facts and people never before interviewed are brought back to life in the meticulous research, which I will not enter here as they immeasurably add to the reality and the harrowing pain of the film. /> <br /> Glenn Close reads the selections from the diary and from her the voice is perfect for the part, it brings a naivety and freshness to the role. <br /> <br /> Friends of Anne's old childhood are long interviewed and the last days before death are well recorded and witnessed along with her vibrant and mischievous personality. <br /> <br /> This is not to be missed. A wonderful and respectful film on the rarely seen Anne. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
