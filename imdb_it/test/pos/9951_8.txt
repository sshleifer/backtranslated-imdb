What can I say? The little one inside has always had great affections for the following ... giant robots, giant monsters and a pestiferous and megalomaniac criminal of lead and this film has all the right cards. As an adult, it is easy to point out the numerous flaws of this film and to say that they are only some of the episodes taken from a TV series for children together. Despite everything, I find that the finish is very moving and the content surprisingly adult in nature. Terrible fun if sometimes a little absurd.
