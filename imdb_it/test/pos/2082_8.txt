This is a great little movie, full of interesting characters and situations. While not in the same class as some of the best-known films of his time, it is still extremely watchable and memorable. The scene in which Zachary Scott, sitting on a bus, accidentally steals the airman's brooch from the lapel of a coat thrown over the seat next to him, is terrifying. He beautifully defines his character - a boy so low, that he will overwhelm something of inestimable value for a war veteran, to be used as support in his various charades. It is easily found as the situation requires, and fascinates the women of the Fenchurch family with its irresistible charm and that killer smile. I couldn't help but wonder if this film was made to capitalize on the success of Mildred Pierce. Scott and Bruce Bennett were reunited again, and Faye Emerson bears a certain resemblance to Joan Crawford, with her facial bone structure and large eyes. Furthermore, Mona Freeman's character is not unlike Mildred Pierce's obnoxious Veda. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous comment that the end of the film was too quiet, with the comfortable fall on a cliff for "Ronnie" Mason, the character of Zachary Scott. one of the final scenes, we see bratona Mona Freeman reunited with her boyfriend whom she had previously despised in favor of the older and easier Zachary Scott.I think the script should have called her to be chastised for her behavior and her cruelty towards sister, instead of considering it as a typical adolescent episode, but these are minor flaws in an otherwise pleasant and well-made film.
