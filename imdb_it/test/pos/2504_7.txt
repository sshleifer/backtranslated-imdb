Apart from the fact that this film was shot mainly in Rockport MA, which is a beautiful city where my mother once rented a small shop and I spent many pleasant summer holidays as a child, it's a fun and cute movie. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I didn't really want to see this movie, even though I have a weakness for romantic comedies (I don't know why). The trailers I saw were not interesting, the cast didn't seem so interesting and I had no idea what the plot would be. I finally found it to be an interesting meditation on relationships and family. I had a great time and I have to admit that I thought this film was one of the most neglected jewels of last year. I am disappointed that so few people seem to have enjoyed the same "humanity" with which this film presented the viewer. <br /> <br /> I have read many negative reviews of this film and I must admit a certain level of shock from the cynicism that is prevalent in them. As a graduate student I consider myself rather cynical, but this is a beautiful film that deserves much more than what it got.
