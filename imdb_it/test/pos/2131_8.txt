Although this film destroyed the career of director and screenwriter Michael Cimino and bankrupt United Artists, it is still one of the most important films of all time. There are many reasons to end this film for sure. Among them: its length, its technical problems, its colossal animal abuse on set - the list could go on and on. And yet, for all this, it remains a film that captures something. It is a classic example of a naturalistic narrative like Strindberg - his moments last as long as they could in reality, not having been minimized by good cinema timing. It seems real in its moments of anger, love and war (and desperation). This film should be viewed by anyone who appreciates the film and the narrative.
