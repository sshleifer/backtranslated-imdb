Soul's Midnight stars Armande Assante (Simon) who starred in "The Mambo Kings" and Elizabeth Bennett (Alicia Milford). Together with Sexy vampire vixen, Lucila Sola (Iris), Simon attracts pregnant Alicia and her husband Charles to the afterlife of Soul's Midnight. Assante plunges his fangs into the script of the writers Brian and Jason Cleveland and you enjoy watching him while Iris kills. Alicia and Charles (Robert Floyd) try to stay alive while the gore keeps the craving for satiated blood. <br /> <br /> (spoiler warning) In today's weary landscape, it's not surprising that a perched preacher gets bitten. Set looks cool ?? lots of details at the Borgo Hotel and fantastic special effects at the end. Did I really enjoy watching this movie ?? he doesn't take himself too seriously and looks fantastic.
