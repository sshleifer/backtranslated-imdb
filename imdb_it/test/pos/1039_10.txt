... the dream of a real geek-girl: high tech, high drama, smart guys, hot sex and big explosions. (VERY big explosions.) Sam Waterston is so natural in the role of Oppenheimer that REAL Oppenheimer tapes sound strange: apparently he has a similar voice to Ronald Reagan! Oppenheimer's triumph and tragedy is one of the most moving dramas of the 20th century and this film is a model of what the docu-drama should be: facts are allowed to speak for themselves, while fictitious parts are used to amplify and fill in the record, don't call attention to yourself. An interesting fact: some of the technical details used have been declassified only recently, and are therefore of particular interest. Not to be missed!
