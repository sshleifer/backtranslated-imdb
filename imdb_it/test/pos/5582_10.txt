Not many television programs like so many different types of fans like Farscape ... I know young and 30/40 + years, both male and female fans in as many different countries as you may think they love this miniseries TV. It has elements that can be found in almost every other show on T.V, a character-based drama that could come from an Australian soap opera; yet in the same episode he has a science and a fiction that would give even the most difficult "Trekkie" a run for his money in brain episodes! Wormhole Theory, Time Travel in a True Equal Form ... Magnificent. Embrace cultures from every part of the map, as the possibilities are endless and have more stars and therefore thousands of planets to choose from. <br /> <br /> With such a broad scope; one would expect that nothing would be able to maintain the illusion for a long time, but here is where "Farscape" really enters its own element ... It happens where all the others have failed, especially those of Star Trek (a universe with practically zero elements Kaos!) They ran out of ideas quickly enough + kept removing them! During 4 seasons they manage to keep the attention of the public using good continuity and a constant evolution of the characters with multiple threads for each episode, with unique personal touches specific to the camera specific to certain groups of characters within the whole. This structure allows for a very wide area of ​​arguments, since loyalty is false and broken in many ways on many issues. I happened to see the pilot (Premiere) passing by and I had to continue to tune in later to see if Crichton would ever have "Take the girl", after seeing them all on television I was happy to see them available on DVD and I admit it was the only thing that kept me sane while I had to do a 12-hour night shift and develop chronic insomnia ... Farscape was the only thing that got me through those very long nights ... <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor; Watch the pilot and see what I mean ... <br /> <br /> Farscape Comet
