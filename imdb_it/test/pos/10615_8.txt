*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** It's easy to see why the script of this movie won an Oscar. At least during the first semester. My head turned from all the snappy lines that darted away. Noel Coward plays a New York publisher ("Why don't you publish books you like?" - "What? And corrupts the public?") That enchants and manipulates his numerous gadgets. Then he dies in a plane crash and the story turns into a bizarre Flying Dutchman takeoff in which Coward must find someone to really cry before his soul can rest in peace. Very enjoyable until it becomes bizarre. Seen at the Cinefest in Syracuse in March 2003.
