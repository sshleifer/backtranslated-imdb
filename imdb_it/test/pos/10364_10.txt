In my work with the only national non-profit organization, Security On Campus, Inc. devoted exclusively to the problem of crime prevention on university campuses and student awareness, I see the kind of campus violence and "cover" on campus too often. secret shorts portrayed in the movie "Silencing Mary". In fact, we receive numerous calls and information requests each month from journalists like "Mary" who face similar situations. <br /> <br /> The representation of a rape on campus and the subsequent "Mary" crusade, the victim's roommate and a student journalist played very well by Melissa Joan Hart, because justice was very well done and carefully studied. <br /> <br /> This was the first television movie I ever saw that I really felt reflected and included all the various complex issues associated with how rape and other violent crimes are dealt with on college and university campuses of our nation. Although it would not be possible to address all these problems in depth in 2 hours, this film is closer than all the others I've seen.
