This is a whodunnit in the Hitchcock tradition. You are kept in the dark while suspicions come and go. Dennis Quaid is dominated by Dexter, a man condemned to die and Meg Ryan excellent as his child. There isn't much that you don't like in this little suspense and all the pieces fit perfectly in the way they should. You will not regret having seen it if you like suspense.
