What can I say? Not as bad as many have done to be. The only reason I even saw this movie I had never heard of before was strictly for IAN McSHANE. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed at all. IAN McSHANE was absolutely brilliant and brings a surprising subtlety to his role. It's always nice to look at and for my money ... an extremely underutilized actor. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the film .... Every other actor in the film has produced strong and solid performances. These people were certainly not paid a huge amount of money for their participation (since it was a fairly low budget film), but that didn't mean that none of them "sent" their appearances. All were convincing and convincing with the parts given to them. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of ADRIAN PAUL although I must admit that I have always seen it in the TV series HIGHLANDER before this film. <br /> <br /> The plot was well structured and the plot intriguing and very similar to real life, not all ends up being tied to a nice cute package for you at the end of the film. Anyone expecting a clear cut in numbers, connect the "conclusion" of the points or the "answer" at the end of the film ... CLEANING wasn't watching the movie closely enough! This film will not tell you what the "meaning of life" is! The idea is that after watching the movie, you could go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends for coffee. I certainly did. <br /> <br /> No car chases ... No explosion ... No brawl in the bar room ... (looks rather boring, eh?) But the reality is that I was completely absorbed in the film and it's just a small well-written piece with an interesting hook and solid exhibits of characters from all parties involved. <br /> <br /> ****** WARNING ... ****** If you are the kind of person who does not like films that swing a huge "question" as a central driver of the story and then they finish the film without directly answering that particular question ... <br /> <br /> YOU MAY NOT ENJOY THIS FILM.
