This is not the best film you could ever see, but it is still very refreshing. Of course, it has its flaws, it has humiliating moments and yet at the same time it is different from everyone you are used to and it is fun in a way that only the French can give you. You might recognize the Amelie masterpiece a bit when you see the opening. I give it 7 out of 10, but I still recommend it if you're tired of the usual boredom you can rent in the video store.
