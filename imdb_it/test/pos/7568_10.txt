Zeke Rippy (Mic) is fantastic, you totally believe his character. And it's scary to die for, I spent half the movie covering my eyes, the other half on the edge of my seat. It's nice to see something so full of suspense and terror that it's not all blood and guts - but it made me have bad dreams. <br /> <br /> Basically this is a great movie - see it at the earliest opportunity.
