What makes this low-budget production one of my favorite films? Not kidding, I looked at him 10 times already and didn't get tired. Is it the sweet melancholy of the whole thing? Is the similarity to classics like "Niagara"? I've been thinking about this for a long time. And I understood it: I guess it's like this: there is no hero, there are only people. Some try to be good. Some have given up trying to be good. Some are hopeless cases but still carry the sperm of being human inside. It's the story of a catastrophic night in a motel at the end of the world. A way in which the catastrophe is nothing but the end of a chain of coincidences. The other road of this night reveals the consequent logics of this people's life because they are in a certain constellation cut off from the rest of the world. It has something of a story about Dostoevsky.
