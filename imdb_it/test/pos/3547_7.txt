Robert Altman, Nicolas Roeg, John-Luc Goddard - did you expect a funny film that would please the whole family? These and other directors were obviously chosen because they did not follow the mainstream but created it. For those who complain that they have not adhered to the original story of the opera - How many times does a film's music refer directly to what is happening in the film? It's the mood that counts. This is what I believe the directors of these films were doing: creating a contemporary mood for the old works. Mostly they succeed wonderfully. With all these works, who will like them all. We could have used more Beverly Sills. <br /> <br /> Finally, what is art (even artwork) without some naked women?
