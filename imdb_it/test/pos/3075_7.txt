May contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> This is just a good movie. A lot of good and stupid things to laugh about. However, don't watch the TV version, they cut it out a lot. Dom Deluise is pretty impressive as the Don Mafia who is hired to kill Robin. All I can say about his ten minutes: it's a long drive from Jersey. You must also love them by checking the script to make sure that Robin has another chance. Also: 12th Century Fox. <br /> <br /> Any bad thing? The rappers at the beginning and at the end seem rather old-fashioned. The songs were rather lame. Once during the watching of this film, I could think a few more times when they could have thrown in another bar or 2. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, a fun movie experience. Not to be missed for comedy fans.
