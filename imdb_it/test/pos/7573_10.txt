The end of Sarah Plain and Tall's Winters was the best film I've ever seen. The person in the story that I liked the most was to be Cassie played by Emily Osment. Only for his energy and for how his mind speaks. For example, when Anna calls from the city, Cassie wants to answer and she says "Hi, Anna, guess what ... Grandpa was lost but now he's back and he's not a good man!" I loved all of the Sarah Plain and the tall films for my evaluation, I think Sarah Plain was tall # 3. Skylark was # 2. The end of Winters was # 1! If you could live in a family of the past It should be the Witting family. I think there are so many beautiful parts in this film that I can't name them all. I think they chose the best and perfect actors to play all these people in the film, so if you ever want to see a movie from the past I would highly recommend Sarah Plain and Tall's Winters end.
