I saw this film on IFC for the first time. Which is a great network on how to see underground films. I saw this film and thought it would be pure drama and a plot that doesn't hold water. But it was really a value to watch. The main character is in such a raw form, and you hate to see him deny help, but no matter what you can't hate him. His devotion to The Beatles and John Lennon is a great metaphor for his life and the helplessness he feels. <br /> <br /> Even the atmosphere of the film is fantastic. Sometimes, you feel you can see what you see, hear what you feel in some situations. This movie doesn't let you want to learn more, or you don't like a loophole in the plot. There are no loopholes (in my opinion). I've always been a fan of foreign films, especially now that the films are made so badly in America. I really like foreign settings because I feel that it can take you on a journey and sometimes understand a different culture. This film did all those things for me and more. Please watch this movie and if you don't know foreign films, this is a great start.
