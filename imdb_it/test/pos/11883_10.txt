Critters 4 is one of the greatest films of the twentieth century. The classical word has never been so appropriately used as in describing this amazing epic. I agree that the original Critters is the best in the series, but the claustrophobic tension of the space station in which Critters 4 is set must be seen to be believed. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in seeing one of the main cinematic landmarks of the 20th century.
