The film with its single set, minimal cast and linear photography (except for a couple of short special effects) reminds me of one of those old 60-minute dramas so popular during the early years of TV. Nonetheless, the suspense looms heavily on poor war widow Ida Lupino as she tries to confront her psychotic handyman Robert Ryan before one of her mood swings kills her. And who is better to interpret the problematic part of that great actor Ryan. It wasn't very versatile - watching it comedy is almost painful. But no one was better at injured idealism (On Dangerous Ground) or in the psychic pain of this film. Few actors could express as much with their eyes as this slim and imposing figure. <br /> <br /> Lupino's problem is that she is locked up in her home with a man who is kind and gentle a moment and rages next. The suspense comes from his various tricks to keep him happy as he tries to escape. It's a nail nail all the way down. This is not one of the many beautiful "soulful" parts of Lupino she was so good at. Instead, it is a role that many minor actresses could have handled quite well. My favorite scene is with Ryan and the snotty teen Margaret Whiting. Ryan already has difficulties with his masculinity and what others say about him. Then, when Whiting comes in and finds Ryan looking attractive, he rubs the floor, starts to be shy, flirting with his innate sexuality. Sensing the problems, Ryan abruptly rejects her. Fineness is not his strong seed. Insulted, Whiting attacks his masculinity by calling his work "a woman's job". This he does. Until that moment he was courteous and professional with Lupino, trying to get on the normal road. But Whiting hit his exposed nerve. Now heck pay as Whiting bounces, leaving Lupino to pay the price. It's a compelling, expertly crafted scene. <br /> <br /> However, this is one of the dozens of films produced by Lupino and her husband at a time when the public was moving away from these little black-and-white favored by big-screen glasses. Sin. What a very talented character was behind the camera and in front. It deserves at least an honorary Oscar from a film industry to which it has contributed so much.
