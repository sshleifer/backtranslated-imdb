Charlie's Wilson's war shows with clever truthfulness how vain wars can be, particularly for the same people who spend countless hours and funding to finance them. Virtuosic shows and extraordinarily memorable characters combined with a sarcastic script catapults the film, directed by the always unpredictable Mike Nichols, to the top of the best of the year. Politics has never been so fun. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a member of the Texas Congress who is credited with winning the Cold War. Attaching to a lot of drugs, women and Scotch, he also takes an unexpected interest in the events in Afghanistan and the terrors of the Soviet Union in the 1980s. Enlisting the help of Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a renegade CIA secret mission expert and Joanne (Julia Roberts), a rich socialite, raises funds to provide Afghanistan with the rocket launchers and anti-tank weapons they need to cause serious damage to the Russian army. In the late 1980s the Cold War would end and the funds would be cut immediately, thus eliminating all aid for the nascent country to rebuild and recover. <br /> <br /> Acting is exquisite, although it is to be expected from the most experienced cast. Much of this, however, should be attributed to the script, which allows each character to be undeniably well developed and memorable. And a good helper to this merit goes to the novel of the same name, which is hilarious and honest. Tom Hanks still offers another unparalleled performance like Charlie Wilson, the man who did so much for so many and yet remains relatively unknown. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Gust, a character who is vividly awkward both in his physicality and in his cynical cynicism; the inimitable Hoffman once again shows a superb range in the characters he plays. Julia Roberts is perhaps the only weak link in the film, with its generic snobbish character and not thin enough accent. And then there is Wilson's "jailbait" team of young secretaries who wander around to keep him happy. Guided by the ever delightful Amy Adams, each supporting role has its wonderful moments. <br /> <br /> Defeating the Soviet Union was not an easy task, especially considering the many conflicting goals among the various political leaders. "Why does Congress say one thing and do nothing?" calls for a dissatisfied politician. "Tradition mostly," returns Wilson. Everyone seems to want the Cold War to end, yet a blind eye is turned to the atrocities that occur in Afghanistan. It takes a trip to the war-torn refugee camps in Pakistan to motivate Wilson, as well as his main financial source, Doc Long (Ned Beatty). Wilson uses strategic ties with the committees to raise weapons funds in Afghanistan from $ 5 million to $ 10 million with a simple command, but the president of Pakistan scoffs at the idea of ​​winning a war so insignificantly. By the end of Wilson's campaign, $ 1 billion is sent to the Mujahedin to bring down Russian helicopters - the first step towards victory, as envisioned by Wilson. Beyond the scope of the film, the unresolved riots in Afghanistan have led to further, less ignorant problems that Wilson allegedly envisaged. <br /> <br /> During the Charlie Wilson War, the main characters travel from the United States to Pakistan to Afghanistan to Jerusalem in Egypt, but wherever they go, sarcasm always follows. There is a surprising amount of comedy in the film, considering that political nuances are generally serious. Hoffman offers jokes with almost every exchange of dialogue, as does Hanks, with his ideals naturally pursued by women. A scene in which Gust is continually introduced by Wilson's office as he tries to solve a legal problem with his team of wonderful girls ("you can teach her to write, but you can't teach her to grow tits") reminds me of a slapstick routine of brothers Marx. <br /> <br /> With the press focusing on the drug charges against Wilson, instead of the important issues of the Cold War, and the conflicting desire of the budget officials to help them, it is clear that at the end of the film, the politicians are still unaware of what is really necessary. And because the script is so sharp and intelligent, some members of the public may not be able to keep up with all the intense dialogue events. But, as demonstrated by politicians who ignore the difference between Pakistan and Afghanistan, it is essentially another argument in support of Charlie Wilson's point. <br /> <br /> - Mike Massie
