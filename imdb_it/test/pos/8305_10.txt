My father took me to see this movie when it was released in 1976. I was just a child and it scared the hell out of me. So much so that I had to leave the theater during a particularly claustrophobic tunnel scene because it was too intense for me !!! I came home for the safety of my family. I saw the film all the way when I grew up and loved it. Too bad for men in monster suits, though. If you neglect the cheapness of production and learn more, you will find an excellent performance by Cushing, an extraordinary opening soundtrack, some beautiful photographs and the always reliable Mr.Douglas McClure, my childhood hero! British police officers guarding Whitehouse at the end! Titty bang bang cave woman! Monsters with beaks! Actors in giant overalls who slip on the wires! This has it all! Superb.
