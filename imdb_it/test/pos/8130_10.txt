The biggest tragedy surrounding this truly delightful film is its lack of distribution in the United States. I was lucky enough to see this movie at the Boston International Festival of Women's Cinema, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has the chance to see it. Extraordinary shows, thoughtful screenplay and great direction by the talented and funny Rose Troche come together to make this film a winner!
