My first review on IMDB, after a few years of constant use of this site ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, I saw it on the tube the other night, I liked it a lot. It is in the mindset of a dangerous mind or a substitute, but much better. For a moment I'm sure Rex was Speedy Levitch, in Waking Life, but after checking, it doesn't look like that. <br /> <br /> I can understand why many have problems with this plot and its poetry, but I also think that these people are closed-minded. I admit that the ending wasn't exactly what I was hoping for, but overall it was so unique and well acted, I can't complain. I wouldn't say that this cheese, as one reviewer did, managed to get out of the picture better than most movies of the 1980s. And they refrained from playing any 80s music that really dated. <br /> <br /> I don't remember everything that made me smile when I saw it, but in practice it showed realistically very creative individuals surrounded by mediocrity, and if I share Rex's I believe or not, I love the original attempts to describe the meaning of life. And his theory of mutants is, as far as I know, original. He also talked a lot, but they showed how sometimes he was confused and why he could have some psychological problem. And then in his moments of clarity he was an extraordinary philosopher, a person who noticed the small details of life and tried to give them expression. <br /> <br /> I was also very impressed with John Savage as a teacher. Actors usually fail in that role. He made it brilliantly. <br /> <br /> If you liked Waking Life, I'll tell you to watch this movie if you get the chance. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> pk
