It took me a while to find this movie since I don't have it on DVD yet (and my VCR isn't worth connecting it again). I imagine that all the reference to drug use is too much for some people. But I found a decent bootleg on Ebay and I have to say that anyone who takes this film too seriously is just retarded. It is a parody of slap in the vein of "Airplane". I have to say that when I saw it on Showtime or Spotlight growing in the 80s, I enjoyed it a lot more than the humor back then, than it is now. But it is certainly worth looking at just to see what they (ie the filmmakers) were able to get away with before the "Just Say No" hypocrites unleashed their propaganda. singing ... "We're all junkies" hahaha It's a stupid movie and worth the $ 10 I paid on Ebay for having it on DVD, but don't even think about comparing it to the original - it's just stupid. What are you tall?
