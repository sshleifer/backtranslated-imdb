Christine Lahti (Sandy Dunlap) and Mary Tyler Moore (Holly Davis) worked well with wise material, Ted Danson did his best with an ungrateful role in Chip Davis. The premise of this is that the friendship of the two women, an apparently happily married woman and the other a career woman who is aware of her biological ticking. I found the relationship that the character of Ted Danson had with the single woman played by Christine Lahti rather sordid. He behaved in a transient way, yet he let two "widows" melt on him, screaming. I found it disgusting when Sandy told him he wanted to break up after meeting his wife, he calls her saying he misses (he called his wife? There was no trace of that). He acted like a heel. Perhaps he would have made a more interesting film if he hadn't been killed. Perhaps both ladies would have noticed and unloaded it. I liked the friendship between the two ladies but it was ruined by what they had in common: the Cad of a husband.
