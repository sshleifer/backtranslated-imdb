Wow, I've seen a lot of Kelli McCarty this summer. I didn't know that this woman had produced so many soft films in the last three years. It's like seeing a future softcore star in front of me, just like Michelle Hall did a couple of years ago. <br /> <br /> "Passion's Peak" is the third quality softcore movie in which I saw Kelli McCarty, with "Girl for Girl" and "House of Love" being the others. "Desire and deception" was fine, but it wasn't spectacular. There are spoilers in this review, so read only if you want. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Christina (Kelli McCarty) starting from the big city and towards the mountains. He inherited a house from his dear grandmother and intends to turn it into a mountain refuge. Before she can fix her things, a woman named Kim (not credited in this movie, but rather aggressive) starts booking guests to stay. Now he has to get his house back together - comes Chip (Bobby Johnston), a childhood friend, to the rescue. Chip helps her get the house in good condition. He hires two local loafers to work in his cottage: Chip Bait's sister (Samantha McConnell) and her sex friend Hank. <br /> <br /> Now the guests are starting to come. The first to arrive are Eric and Linda (Flower), two stereotyped lawyers of first money. Linda and Eric face a huge discussion during a dinner in the middle of the film that leads to their breakup; sad stuff there. Then there is the novel novelist Sophia, played by the cinema goddess B Monique Parent. He's using the silly Scarlet Johansing alias again, and this time he looks very professional - with blond hair, of course. It wouldn't be Monique if she didn't have at least one scene in which she acted with herself - and made an effort during one of Eric and Linda's sex scenes. <br /> <br /> James and Shene (Devinn Lane --yes, the porn star Devinn Lane) also show up for a weekend. Unbeknownst to Shene, James and Christina have a real story. James and Christina used to go out, but Christina interrupted him and headed for this mountain cabin. James arrives at the lodge to get Christina back, but his plan backfires. Christina pours beans to Shene, which causes Shene to walk over him and down to the local bar to strip for the locals. Shene ends up in today's Eric's sleeping bag, and they leave together. Bait realizes that he wants something more than just sex with Hank, and Christine finds true love with Chip, with Sophia absorbing it and writing it in her next romance novel. In fact ... if you ask me, the whole film took place like a romance novel. I don't know if the writer wanted to get that effect, but I certainly got this impression. Sophia had some of the best lines in this film, playing on the idea of ​​a live love story. He seems to enjoy all the fighting and backstabing going on. <br /> <br /> Now to the sex. There was a good part of it, and it was the usual bump and grind stuff. Monique made her fair share of groans in her two sex scenes. This film was noteworthy, and the story will actually keep the audience somewhat interested in the sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Women: A- (Monique was simply Monique. Of all the softcore actresses I have seen over the years, she is the best performer, in my opinion. She can really act and be sexy, which is why you is clinging to the top spot in my Skinemax Top 10. Kelli McCarty is better at making softcore films than the soap opera "Passions", I don't know why she's not doing more, Flower was just a background scene for the most in a limited role. Samantha McConnell continues to impress me, and Devinn Lane is another hardcore actress who crosses into the realm of softcore and doing a halfway decent job.) Sex: B (It was nice, but not spectacular "A lot of complaints. Don't look at the R-rated version, trust me .... most good things have been taken. My vote is for the full version.) <br /> <br /> History : B (A solid plot "Ooh, the building inspector will shut us down" subplot towards the end that ruin to things. The background story between Christina and James was beautiful, and Sophia's dialogue, full of metaphors and images that are usually found in romance novels, was a nice touch.) <br /> <br / > Overall: B + (I found this movie to be pretty fun, it's not a Soft-Hall-of-Famer success like "Girl for Girl", but it's a respectable addition to the Skinemax collection.)
