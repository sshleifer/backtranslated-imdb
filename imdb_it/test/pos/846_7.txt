Believe me, I wanted this series to work, but Kevin Kilner's early departure caused a fatal blow after season one. Robert Leeshock was not exactly right for the part and Jane Heitmeyer did an admirable job as a protagonist but the series became too confusing and confused at that point. I don't know what happened in season five, what a mess. Sometimes it's time to drop the red cloak and put the sword in the bull, if you understand what I mean. The only common thread that holds the series together was the extraordinary performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva in the shoes of the two Taelons in a peaceful idealistic conflict. Had it not been for their talents and well-written dialogue, they would have been two strange bald chicks in a series of films B. <br /> <br /> If only this series would have ended in season four and it would SyFy was later resumed ...
