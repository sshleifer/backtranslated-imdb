Jim Varney's performances as Harem Girl and A.U. they are incredibly funny - at a level that exceeds Chaplin and Keaton. Linda Kash is very good in her role, once in a lifetime, of the waffle maid who wants adventure. Unfortunately, the remaining 90% of the film was deceptively bad because of the atrocious plot. The creators of Ernest Goes in Africa have not lived up to the creative challenges inherent in producing low-budget films. Worth seeing only by cable.
