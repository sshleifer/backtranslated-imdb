This is not far from the garbage that Bollywood normally does, but there is only something really beautiful. <br /> <br /> The title song is one of the best in Bollywood and is haunting everywhere. This is one of the films (along with Baazigar - absolutely worth seeing the Bollywood movie) that Shah Rukh Khan has done and that's why you have to take a look. <br /> <br /> Other reviews tell the story - it's a fairly simple idea - ShaRukh certainly stands out and one of his last expressions eventually made me give this movie an extra star. <br /> <br /> It's pretty rough but definitely worth a look if you're new to Bollywood or not! 8/10
