The director, Ramin Niami, delivers the goods with Somewhere in the City. This hilarious farce, I believe, is in the tradition of a Mel Brooks comedy. Niami mocks the New York company by creating the believable, eccentric and tragic characters of a condominium that brings them to life from the initial shots that introduce them. Peter Stormare's performance as a Shakespearean gay actor is absolutely worthy and the film generally does a good job of showing the desperation and ability to laugh at self-centered ambition. Sandra Bernhard is interpreted perfectly as a heterosexual therapist. I really enjoyed Sandra's performance immensely, especially since I've never been a big fan so far. Bai Ling, Ornella Muti and Bulle Ogier complete an international ensemble par excellence. I loved the scene with Robert John Burke and his gang of idiotic criminals who couldn't plan a robbery if their lives depended on it. With a cameo by Mayor Ed Koch and a solid performance by Paul Anthony Stewart, the boy of the revolutionary mother, Somewhere in the City, entertains without missing a beat.
