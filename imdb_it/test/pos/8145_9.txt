I loved this movie !!! It was so easy to become part of the characters' lives and really feel the emotion they were going through. <br /> <br /> A film full of laughter, sarcasm, shock and upheaval only a fantastic romantic drama indeed! <Br /> <br /> The only part I didn't like was in the special features. The behind-the-scenes comment was a bit daunting. Because I had seen the film before the extras I prefer to think of the actors as the characters (fool I know) but the personality of the actors is very different from the characters they play. But anyway it is a totally fantastic, spectacular, brilliant film, I recommend to all those who have watched this movie and have thought of hmmmmmmm should I buy it? the answer must be a certain yes!
