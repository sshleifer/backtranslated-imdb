One of my favorite childhood films ever. The Chipmunk adventure brings incredible fun for young and old. The animation is lively and colorful and the film itself boasts some of the best songs ever made in an animated film. Who could forget the "Boys / Girls of Rock n 'Roll" dynamic, the exciting "Diamond Dolls" and the harrowing "My Mother"? <br /> <br /> This should be considered a classic nostalgic jewel of the eighties. Too bad they don't make them that way anymore. Most animated films today resort to violence, rough humor or sentimental mush ... except of course the people of Pixar. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: An incredible and unforgettable adventure for all ages.
