You Are Alone is a beautiful, almost delicate, direct intelligent film, clearly written, with two complex and compelling performances, and a turning point in a final that no one will see coming, but it will make you want to see the film a second time back back and retrieve all the clues you read poorly. <br /> <br /> The story, about a high school girl who drowns her depression and clumsiness by working a few hours a week as a schoolgirl escort for $ 500 an hour, and the neighbor near depressed who discovers her secret and He hires her for an afternoon call to a hotel in downtown New Haven, offering breathtaking shows from both Jessica Bohl, like the girl, and Richard Brundage, as her neighbor. <br /> Bohl as Daphne offers a revolutionary performance on par with Maggie Gyllenhaal on the secretariat. It thus captures the anguish of a teenager growing in her skin, and when she speaks of always having control, she begins to realize that she has no control at all, but risks going beyond the deep end, which I believe in a certain sense she does it. <br /> <br /> Brundage as Buddy is depressed, angry, with a broken heart, a shell of a man. But it is not until the surprising conclusion of the film that a complete understanding of his pain is captured. <br /> <br /> After a very brief opening, which will attract the majority of independent film lovers, and will ensure that the religious run towards the exits, we are taken to the hotel room. At the beginning you are not sure about these people or about the cinematographic style. Shaky, annoying ... like the characters. Until you make their retrospective, told in brief flashbacks. At first they are provocative for a reason, and so is the camera. But when they open up, while the story is posed, in the same way, even the camera. And, I don't know, 20 minutes in, give or take, you find yourself unable to take your eyes off the screen. <br /> <br /> Having just seen the world premiere screening at the Brooklyn Film Fest - - where the director asked the audience if anyone expected the end and not one person answered yes ?? I almost wish the movie was already on video, so I could watch it again. Because now thinking back to some of the conversations in the film, in particular a very sincere dialogue about fantasy and the climax, I really thought that things were going in a very different direction. But now I realize that much of their conversation meant something completely different from what I imagined. I have to see it again !!! But as obscure and sexual as most of the chatter is, to say the least, I found myself laughing more than I would have expected at some of his candor, which certainly falls under the "things we think, but lacks courage to say out loud "category. He is very blunt, especially when you realize that so much has a completely different meaning. Some of these things will make you uncomfortable, especially if you are looking at You Are Alone with a partner. Will you surely have something to talk about ?? maybe argue ?? later. Maybe it should come with a warning: you should be alone when you look! The music is incredible. I would have come home and bought the soundtrack of my favorite online music store, if I could. The film looks as good as anything filmed on the film. After the director Gorman Bechard was asked what kind of process he used to get the digital movie it looks so good. His answer: none. They couldn't afford it. <br /> <br /> I have to give Bechard credit. I'm a big fan of his two short films, The Pretty Girl and Objects in the Mirror, but even they couldn't have prepared me for the complexities and surprises of this film. <br /> <br /> For all concerned: good.
