This is one of those cartoons Tweety and Sylvester that made this legendary pair second only to Bugs Bunny in terms of popularity Looney Tunes. <br /> <br /> In addition to having all the stock situations for this duo (Sylvester feeds on garbage cans, the "I tawt I taw a putty tat" line, etc.), Tweety's SOS also interprets granny , which is one of those types of secondary characters that these Warner Bros. classics had in abundance to enrich their color and flavor. This time the cat and the bird are on board an ocean liner and the gags that are extracted from this situation are creative and lively. <br /> <br /> What a day the story of the cartoons was when Friz Freleng decided to pair his Sylvester with Robert Clampett's little yellow bird.
