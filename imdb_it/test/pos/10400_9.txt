Like a lot of horror fans out there who went in search of the next fantastic scare, we ransacked the Asian horror market for whatever we could get our hands on, leaving no stone unturned. We had good reason to do so, the Asian market had generated terrifying wonders like Ringu, Dark Waters, Juon - The Grudge and A Tale of Two Sisters. When Takashi Miike began to wrest the cock from the genre with One Missed Call in 2003, the market seemed to have dried up, leaving it open for derision and derision, despite the continuous Hollywood Remake Machine that worked at full speed. Now, don't get me wrong, there were still a lot of good Asian horrors made, like Marebito and Shutter, to name just two, someday they'll become minor genres. But the straight-haired phantom lady had surely made her meal at the party, and it was time to take that drunk successful trick home with her! Then comes a movie like Noroi - The Curse. A film that is smart enough to pay a slight tribute to its roots, but it throws the regulation out of the window as it does. What I am going to describe in terms of plot will probably make you think there is nothing new here. The film is a documentary about one of Japan's most important paranormal investigators, receiving stories and suggestions about ghostly activities. He begins to investigate the claims of a woman who regularly hears a child crying in the house next door, but there is no child there, except for a middle-aged woman and her child. These two disappear when the reporter sniffs at him, but other strange coincidences start to appear. A psychic girl, a mentally ill clairvoyant, a rather young actress who had a strange vision, a lot of dead pigeons and a very sinister demon by the name of Kagutaba, which led to a truly terrifying showdown in a small town historical ... <br /> <br /> Saying more about the plot could ruin the fun a little. The film is shot in 'faux documentary' fashion and incorporates movies of television programs and news, and subtitle labels let you know where you are in terms of time. The film has attracted more than a few comparisons with the Blair Witch Project, but apart from the shooting format and the gruesome journey through the woods late at night, the comparison really ends there. <br /> <br /> What is refreshing Noroi is not like the modern horror audience. If you expect croaking ghost women to jump out of the attic, look elsewhere. The strength of the film lies in the slow, gradual accumulation of terror, a terror so profound that it will remain with you for days after watching it. The climax is damn crazy, but just when you think the movie is finished, you'll end up with the "real" ending when the credits start spinning, and the sweet saint f * ck, is a killer. In terms of acting, it's largely convincing. Get some relief from the "comedy" from the clairvoyant insane covered in tin, but it soon dries in the middle of the film. The film also looks a little more "bad" than a lot of Asian ghost horror, as there is also a violent streak in some of the events. <br /> <br /> In general, Noroi is one to watch alone, late at night. Not since my first vision of Ringu ten years ago I was so pleasantly scared to watch a horror movie. It's one that itches you until it's too late, so it's under your skin. Let yourself go to this completely. And not a phantom lady with straight hair in sight ?? No wonder it was just released outside Japan, not to mention an American remake still on the program. Check this if you can, essential vision in my books!
