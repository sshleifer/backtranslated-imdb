The prints are certainly not your average run of the Giallo mill, and this is not a bad thing. Unlike his previous film, The Fifth Cord (which was your 'classic' Yellow), Luigi Bazzoni's film abandons almost all the brands of Giallo and instead of murder; the focus is very much on the psychological mystery. It is obvious from the beginning that this will be a completely bizarre film as the film opens with a scene set on the moon. Things do not become clearer after the lunar sequence turns out to be the dream of Alice, a tormented woman. Alice is tormented by the dreams of an astronaut stranded on the moon, which seems to come from a vision of a movie called "Footprints on the Moon". After several things went wrong for her, Alice decides to go to a mostly deserted tourist spot called Garma. Upon arrival, she is surprised that the people she meets already seem to know her. Alice also meets a young red-haired girl who already seems to know her; the girl tells Alice that she looks exactly like Nicole, except that she is prettier and with shorter hair ... <br /> <br /> The fact that Footprints does not contain much in terms of sex, murder and other marks of Yellow puts it somehow with his main audience from the beginning, since most people who come into this film will not get what they expected (or probably wanted). But on the other hand, Footprints commands respect for the fact that it doesn't just follow what happened before. In 1975, Yellow had begun to lose its popularity and many of the films released at that time (with some very important exceptions) were simply reconstructed of what had happened before, so Luigi Bazzoni would have had a great chance in this film. Florinda Bolkan offers a strong interpretation in the title role; and the fact that it's not the prettiest yellow heroine isn't really important. The mystery is built well for everything, and while it can sometimes become a little turgid; The footprints are, generally speaking, intriguing for the duration. Probably it will not be a surprise for many, once arrived there, that the ending does not make much sense and does not explain anything; but pleasantly adds the bizarre cult value of the film, and all in all; I give Footprints a sign of approval!
