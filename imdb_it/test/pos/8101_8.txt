From the beginning of the film I found myself laughing trying to keep quiet, so I didn't wake anyone up, this didn't go on so much in the rest of the movie, I didn't find it completely "laugh out loud" funny, but I found some pretty funny things. At first I had to burst out laughing when he threw down the hand of the very shrewd-looking Hand Grenade. Then there are scenes in which you will only have to smile, like when the Barber falls through a roof in someone's apartment, I can see that it is quite funny but in the days and days of today that has been done a lot has not seemed original, even though right now, I'm sure it was. I loved the explosions of Hynkels (Hitler) of the infuriated German with the fine English translation. <br /> <br /> The final scene is very controversial because, well, it's absolutely true and built in a very intelligent way. Even though the film is sixty-eight years old, the final scene is still relevant today, if that doesn't show how great a writer Chaplin is, then I don't know what he will do. In particular, the acting in this scene was quite good, the barber perfectly neglected the message and makes you understand the serious nature of the film, enjoying at the same time the humorous side. <br /> <br /> Another element of this film is the fact that this was such a brave film, that it seems almost ahead of its time. Of course, Chaplin didn't know what would happen after 1940, he wasn't aware of the Holocaust (obviously), he also stated that if he knew he wouldn't make this film. The fact that this film is so anti-Hitler is interesting, it is more interesting that it was not anti-Germany, that it would have been very easy to do in those days, Chaplin could easily have turned it into a propaganda film, but instead he did something moreover, he made an honest film. <br /> <br /> I recommend anyone at a distance interested in this film to see it, as well as those who have studied or are studying Hitler and the Second World War to watch this film. It's funny to say the least, it doesn't have an annoying old-fashioned feeling that some movies of the time have made. Unlike most "comedies", this movie actually has a message that it tries to bring to you, watch this movie, you'll be better off seeing it.
