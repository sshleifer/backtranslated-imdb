Said in flashback, the film opens in 1989 with Charlie who is rewarded for his role in the defeat of communism. I have to admit that my heart sank at the thought of having to endure another serious, boring and too long life story. How wrong I was, because that short scene is so close as the movie gets boring. <br /> <br /> The film is full of fun and funny scripts and crackling dialogues in some of the most unexpected places. The scene after the awards ceremony is Charlie in a hot tub with some naked women and a guy trying to convince him to invest in a television program. Another pretty funny scene is about 3 quarters in the film includes Charlie, a group of his rather sexy secretaries, Phillip Seymour Hoffmans CIA Man and a bottle of Whiskey. As for the dialogue on this topic, "The Senator says: He can teach us to write but he can't teach us to cultivate tits." OK, I know schoolboys, but the film is sewn with big lines. <br /> <br /> As for the performances Phillip Seymour Hoffman as usual steals every scene in which it is found. Hanks is OK, but surprisingly it's still Julia Roberts who is very good at being an eccentric Texas Oil Millionaires. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson's war has been one of the best bio-photos of non-musicians for a long time and it is a rare thing that a film entertains, entertains and informs everyone equally.
