Hell gives Los Angeles what it deserves: a baptism in the fire, death from above. An excellent cast of obsessed characters could survive and sweat the passage of coronal mass ejection, but it would not be fun and certainly not dramatic. A really lame review in Variety criticized the characters for being concerned about their personal redemption instead of banning together to save the world. But what is refreshing about this great heat is that there is nothing anyone can do about it. For this reason, we are not subject to scenes of "warming of the heart" of fascist presidents and other great statesmen of fanatics as they devise implausible plots to save a chosen residue of humanity (Deep Impact wing). Here the soaked sweat and the half dozen filth fed by lust elaborate their redemption or face their personal obliques in the old way - together as individuals or ...... alone with the Solo. Excellent TV movie after all. Clearly not denatured by the destructive interference of over-eager Network Exec. I highly recommend.
