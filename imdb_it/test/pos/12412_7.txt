I can understand why others reacted rather unpleasantly to the climax by producing a turning point that is really hard to take seriously. I think, however, that the accumulation to do it works quite well. The rather threatening and tingling music provides a spooky aura that combines the merciless sound of a constantly ringing phone that is leading the struggling British actress, Joan Matlin (Jean Marsh). He borrows a gracious friend's apartment as he tries to restart his career in New York City (.. the buildings in the city outside the window look as realistic as those of David Letterman) and it is unceremoniously welcome by a noisy phone that sounds a little, followed by loud slamming against the wall. Searching for answers about who is responsible for such contempt for his sanity, Joan discovers that no one rents that room, and that a former tenant had indeed strangled himself. Without the help of the director, Joan will decide to find out for herself who is causing her so much anguish. Joan discovers the empty room and the phone with a particular female voice that will haunt her. <br /> <br /> The episode, I think, is a tour-de-force for Jean Marsh which is a show for a woman. She is the only visible actress and we follow her through the crisis that slowly erodes her, the telephone and the noise of that other room cause a lot of anguish that becomes fear. Instead of leaving, Joan remains, so shaken by the noise and breaking point that she just wants the phone (.. or whoever's playing) to stop. The episode provides a possible answer as to who is afflicting Joan and why. A character named Beth enters the story quite late, while Joan struggles to find out whose female voice was on the other side who knew her name on that dreaded phone that she discovered in the room opposite her. Beth's fate could simply tell the viewer why Joan is traumatized. I think this episode is an exercise in spies instead of credibility, someone didn't particularly like it, but I certainly did. I have to admit that the phone, like a physical "crawl" threat to Joan, is hard to take seriously, not to mention its attack, but I thought the intense opening twenty minutes before would have been chilling enough to compensate.
