This is a spectacular production! I saw the show live twice in Chicago and my only problem with production was the fact that I was able to perceive only fragments of what was happening. The stage consisted of three giant catwalks and the platform and, as the action moves from one part of the stage to the other, sometimes you lose track of what is happening, regardless of where you are. As always, this is a stimulating sensory overload, cleverly captured in high definition with 15 cameras! The movie has been masterfully modified, one of the best DVDs of all time in my opinion! I just hope they want them to release it on Blu-Ray HD-DVD so they can relive this extravagance over and over again.
