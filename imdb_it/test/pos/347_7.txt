I love everything the late Al Adamson has directed in his long and varied career, but "The Possession of Nurse Sherri" is far more fun but certainly schlock-grade like "Horror of the Blood Monsters" and "Dracula vs.. Frankenstein ". This movie is really scary! Am I saying you jump from your place when you look at "Nurse Sherri"? No of course not. But this mess of elements of "The Exorcist", "Ruby" and "Carrie" is one of those funny and disturbing horror films common to the seventies. You can't put your finger on what is so spooky, but the film drips with atmosphere. (And what an end! Don't worry, I won't ruin it for you.) Adamson and producer Sam Sherman really nailed him to it, and it doesn't matter if "Nurse Sherri" was a calculated success or a happy accident. Jill Jacobson is nice but not exceptional as the unfortunate nurse who becomes possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased cult leader (Bill Roy, who shines in his short role). Geoffrey Land is fine as his grumpy doctor. There are some blaxploitative elements here (the profit was the bottom line with these cheap drive-in films, after all) but they actually contribute to the plot rather than just being a window. "Nurse Sherri" was a production of Poverty Row, and sometimes shows (sets, special effects, etc.). However, the film has a heart, mostly acting and decent direction, and some genuine thrills. Sam Sherman also considered it appropriate to use Harry Lubin's theme music for the television series "One Step Beyond" from the late 1950s / early 1960s in this film, which certainly adds to the eerie atmosphere. The DVD contains two significantly different cuts in the film (the first version presents a lot of T & A that ended up on the floor of the editing room to make room for more horrible things) as well as the theatrical trailer, the TV spot and a big comment from Sherman. By the way, does anyone know what happened to Bill Roy? Next to John Carradine, he is the best actor I've ever seen in an Al Adamson film, and he plays the cult leader as if he were serious.
