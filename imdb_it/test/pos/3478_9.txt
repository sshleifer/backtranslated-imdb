When I was 10 (currently 14), I promised never to see a movie that I knew wouldn't have a happy ending. And until a few weeks ago I had done quite well, except for Shakespere for his English lesson ... etc ... I was still looking only at the things that ended happily. But then I saw Ramola Garai at Havana Nights, which was nice, not good but fun enough to watch. After seeing it a couple of times in about two years from the first time I saw it, I really enjoyed it, especially the music. So I did a search on her and found IMDb ... I saw "Inside I'm Dancing" and thought she had made another dance movie, and I watched it. Later a search for images was made (by Rory, looking for Gilmore Girls locker posters) I took a picture from this movie ... I then searched for a trailer, found the trailer and when I saw the hospital and I heard Rory say "you have the future" I remembered my vote and realized that it wouldn't be a good movie for me. But it stayed in the back of my mind until we got to the video store and it was used for $ 5, so I went ahead and bought it. After seeing him, I wanted him out of my mind because he was so sad. I still wouldn't go near it until I had cerebral palsy as a word. Then I had to see it again and this time all I did was laugh, even in the saddest parts I no longer felt depressed because I realized that this whole film was happy and uplifting ... I love it and now it's one of my favorites, I'm sure this is the worst comment you have ever read. But watch the movie it's worth it.
