A great Trainspotting-style movie ... advertised as Welsh Trainspotting, but then it was Twin Town, although this is the way to go. <br /> <br /> Takes a weekend in the life of Cardiff Clubbers, a good Kerrigan movie debut and some great performances in the cast. <br /> <br /> Go see! so go to the disco
