What you saw in BULLITT and THE FRENCH CONNECTION is nothing compared to what you have here. The tracking continues for about 15 minutes and is the best you've ever seen. This film has become a classic dramatic film since the golden age of film production in the 1970s. It's a gritty and realistic representation of the bad streets of New York City. With one of the wisest guys ever put on screen, Tony Lo Bianco's behavior in this film is as fantastic as ice. He's ripping off his own partners and making it look like the police are responsible. His childhood friend, Roy Scheider, is a street detective who becomes perplexed by the disappearances of the mobsters. You can say that Lo Bianco is enjoying the game throughout the movie. Sometimes, however, the film becomes boring, but then when you feel like giving up something, something big happens and it pulls you back. The soundtrack of Don Ellis sets the tone of cold and gray winter in New York City and to complete it, my man Joe Spinell presents himself in an initial role as Toredano the garage man. <br /> <br /> Score, 7 out of 10 stars
