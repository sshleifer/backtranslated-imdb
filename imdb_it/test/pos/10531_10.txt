This film is a very descendant remake of the famous masterpiece by Fritz Lang "M-Murder". It is well done and with a fun key to talk about rather serious events and contemporary problems for Eurobe but not only for the whole world. Ethnic intolerance is such a huge evil and very contagious nowadays. So "Children of Wax" or as is known in the US distribution reveals the issue of German and Turkish hatred in a fun way. There is no doubt that it is much appreciated for being distributed by the great Weinsten brothers. And there is another fact I especially liked the participation in this film by the favorite actor of Lars von Trier, the great Udo Kier who shows to play with such pleasure for Bulgarian director Ivan Nichev.
