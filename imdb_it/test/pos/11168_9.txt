I read the comments on this film before watching it and didn't expect much, but as a movie B is a curiosity. I guess you have to be a certain kind of person to enjoy this kind of thing, but I seriously thought it was fantastic. People should only look at it because of the experience because it is totally unique. Don't expect much. The acting is mediocre, the transitions were obviously made on a PC, etc. Definitely a B movie, but still worth a try. Very funny. Gore light and some questionable themes, so it's probably not something that shows your Gran, but for the more adventurous viewer I would say it's a must see.
