Despite the fact that there were aspects of this film that I thought were not developed enough, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to others. Richard Gere and Diane Lane are great in their main roles. The basic premise of the film is that both were in the wake of failed marriages when they meet. Both are also seeking healing. Unexpectedly, they find that they can help each other heal. There were aspects of the film that I wanted to see recite more - where simple flashes simply suggested themes that my mind had to fill with gaps, such as excuses for the grieving widower and how Adrienne goes from feeling guilty about sleeping with Paul to feel good about him right after. An opportunity for a tremendous love scene was lost when it was only suggested that they would make love with the arrival of the hurricane. But in the end the film made me feel deeply grateful for the relationship that my wife and I share. And there were moments that moved me to the brink of tears. Therefore, I must say that it is worth seeing.
