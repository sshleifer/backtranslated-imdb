I found out about Turner Classics late this evening. I kept saying to myself "I will turn it off as soon as it stops being fun", but needless to say I looked at the whole route. <br /> <br /> I am a movie addict but I never even had this movie HEARD (or if I had done it in 1971, I forgot). It's only worth looking at Goldie Hawn's performance as the sharp-hearted naive. His acting is a revelation in this film. Yes, the script is sharp and excellent (when was the last time they made a Hollywood comedy with a smart script?) But his acting is extraordinary. I've never realized how funny Goldie can be, and makes her subsequent appearances in roles like Laugh-In and Private Benjamin a bit sad. In his later career he is too exaggerated compared to his minimalist, wickedly funny appearance here. <br /> <br /> It is a pleasure to see young Matthau, the great Bergman and the stellar support cast, but it is Goldie Hawn who will make this film worthy of being filmed.
