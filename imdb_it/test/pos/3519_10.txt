Just Before Dawn is one of those really good cutters who send you chills down your spine every time you look at it! This film has a great suspense, great acting, very well done photographic work (nice work Mr. Lieberman!) Which makes an extremely good slasher! Although short of blood for the 1980s, it still has the effect on you after it's over. The opening killing (machete through the horse) seemed so real! And the fist to the death of the mouth left me stunned! Altogether I give this 10 star classic lost on 10 stars! if you're looking for a gore festival, don't look here. but, if you want the chills sent down your back, see this. There are 6 dead and one of them you don't see but, it leaves you thinking of thinking "how was she killed?" the stranded theme reminded me of the Hills Have Eyes of 1977, which followed a similar concept, but in the desert with the cannibals. But, slasher fan, give this forgotten gem, I guarantee you, you'll be satisfied!
