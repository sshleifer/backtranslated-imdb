When I sat down to watch Greek for the first time, I didn't expect a show with complex characters, plot intrigues and impeccable writing ... but that's exactly what I got. <br /> <br /> Greco follows several university students who are part of the Greek system of Cyprus Rhodes University. Rusty Cartwright joins Cyprus Rhodes as a polymer science specialist who aspires to be in a fraternity. His older sister, Casey (the center of the show and the future president of Zeta Beta Zeta, the campus's most prestigious sorority), is not exactly supportive of his plans. In fact, none of his friends knew he had a brother until he set foot on the college grounds! In addition to dealing with the fact that her disgusting brother was forced to return to her life, Casey's boyfriend Evan Chambers (who will soon be president of THE fraternity on campus, Omega Chi) will betray her with a new ZBZ commitment (Rebecca Logan), the diabolical president of ZBZ, Frannie, is pressuring her to stay with him, and still feels for her ex-boyfriend Cappie (president of the campus house, Kappa Tau). These characters are joined by Calvin Owens (an athletic and intelligent friend of Rusty who seems to be gay), Dale Kettlewell (housemate Rusty and his roommate and his best friend), and Ashleigh (the best friend and confidant by Casey)). <br /> <br /> During the two Greek seasons (or four chapters) viewers are often reminded that college life is not in black and white, but "in shades of gray from here on out". Each character makes his fair share of mistakes, but each of them has redeemable qualities. Casey and Cappie have a complicated but beautiful relationship throughout the series. Rusty, Dale and Calvin's friendship are not always perfect, but they manage to survive every obstacle that is thrown at them. Even Frannie, Rebecca and Evan (the "bad guys" of the show) are shown as humans from time to time. <br /> <br /> The Greek shows university students at their best, worse and in between. It's a show that reveals college as what it really is: a four-year adventure in which morality, beliefs and willpower are tested, compromised and sometimes even changed. <br /> <br /> The Greek has at least one season to the left, if not more, before it ends. I can't wait to see where the characters end up. Greek is not your typical ABC family sitcom. If you want to tune in to a show that shows the truth behind human motivation, Greek is the show for you.
