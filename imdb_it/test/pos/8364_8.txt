Shazam was fine, but Hero High was my favorite when I was a kid, I mean before there was Sky High (2005) and Zoom (2006), there was Hero High, a super hero training school, Teen with superpowers it would help the police capture the bad guys, and at other times they find themselves in embarrassing situations like The Greatest American Hero (1981). It was a fun cartoon to watch, what was also fun, it was the live show called The Kid Superpower Hour with Shazam. Actors who have voiced characters, even dressed, have characters on the show. Rex Ruthless (John Berwick), Misty Magic (Jere Fields), WeatherMan (Jim Greenleaf), Captain California (Chris Hensel, who also sang the theme song), Dirty Trixie (Maylo Mccaslin), Glorious Gal (Becky Perle, who looks like the 'love son of Superman and Wonder Woman) and Punk Rock (Johnny Venocour). The whole cast went with everything when it came to jokes. The cartoon was a fun superhero comedy, I'll just come back to live action like Fat Albert (2004)
