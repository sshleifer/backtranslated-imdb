Probably this film is not the most fun I've ever seen and, in fact, it doesn't have much ransom value. In reality, it is nothing more than a collection of vignettes tied together by a loose texture. However, this "make-up-as-it-go-along" attitude really works to the benefit of the film. "Tommy Boy" succeeds as a comedy for the same reasons that Farley and Spade's SNL series starred in success: their stupidity and their impromptu chaos make them humorous despite their immaturity.
