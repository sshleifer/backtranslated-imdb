I read the book before watching the film and it left me emotionally exhausted, but I felt that it really transported me to Afghanistan, a culture of which I know very little. I had high hopes for this film and it didn't disappoint me. I saw this with someone who didn't read the book and liked it too. They had to shorten some things in the film, but it was a well-acted and well-made film. It lets you think about the movie long after it's finished. You feel for the characters and their pains. I highly recommend this film to those who love emotionally draining drama and want to experience Afghan culture. There are some disturbing scenes not suitable for children to watch. It is a heavy drama that describes the horrors of life under a restrictive regime.
