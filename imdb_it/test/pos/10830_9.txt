In Paris, a few months before the Nazi invasion, manipulative actress Viviane Denvers (Isabelle Adjani) uses her ex-boyfriend Frédéric Auger (Grégori Deràngere) to hide the body of a man killed by her. Frederic strikes the car, the dead is found and is sent to prison. When the Germans invade France, Frédéric escapes with another prisoner, Raoul (Yvan Attal), and they become friends. In the Bordeaux fugitive, the young assistant of the physicist Professeur Kopolski (Jean-Marc Stehlé), who is trying to leave France with his search for heavy water, meet in the train Camille (Virginie Ledoyen). Once in Bordeaux, the group meets Viviane with her new lover, Minister of State Jean-Étienne Beaufort (Gérard Depardieu), and is pursued by a German spy, journalist Alex Winckler (Peter Coyote), while Paris is falling and the population is confused. <br /> <br /> What a beautiful and magnificent romantic adventure "Bon Voyage" is! The excellent and complex script has action, romance, war, comedy, espionage, drama and many characters, played by a fantastic cast, indeed a constellation of stars; the direction is staggering; the soundtrack is wonderful. I loved this wonderful movie, and I have to finish my review because of my limitation of adjectives to describe such a gem. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Viagem do Coração" ("Journey of the Heart")
