I realized that many people have commented on the nature of this show as racist and homophobic, but I don't think this is the purpose of this show. <br /> <br /> The show is about parents who were not ready for children and is now not ready for teenagers. This show helps bring humor to a very difficult topic that is sometimes overcome: parenting. <br /> <br /> Yes, we have all had shows that have had families, for example: Family Matters, Step by Step, Family Cravatte, Full House .... but he would always have the same old recipe for his episodes. "Steph" cuts from school and is captured by his father. They have a heart-to-heart conversation and the music is played and ended with a two-week meeting that after a "aww, dad ..." has a smile and the show is over. Where is the comedy in such a situation? Where is the realism? With The War at Home, you get real situations from a true paternal figure. Most parents watching this show hear some of their parents' jokes and laugh (because they know they said it!) Or nod (because they know they thought it and never had the courage to say it!) The War at Home has situations that highlight the great comedy of a father who thinks his son is gay. It doesn't seem funny, most think it makes the father homophobic, but the comedy arrives in the clumsy father who tries to talk to his son to open up. Which parent knows the right thing to say, especially in a situation like this? I highly recommend this show to anyone who knows the sense of humor, and in particular to all those who are young parents or young people when they have had children. You talk to a show like this when you are.
