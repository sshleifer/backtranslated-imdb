This is by far my favorite action movie. But what makes it work is not Renny Harlin's elaborate explosions and shootings. It's the screenplay by Shane Black and his clever distribution by Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two actors deserved a following. Thank God he was never created. Too much danger of ruining the original. <br /> <br /> The chessboards of "The Long Kiss", from quotable scenes to action scenes, to quotable scenes and vice versa. Never a dull moment. <br /> <br /> This must be Jackson's funniest role ever, and the incredible thing is that he plays one of the most normal characters in his career. No eccentric Tarantino, fantastic man, super-cool Shaft or borderline psycho soldier. In TLKG, Jackson is the ordinary man we identify with. The poor schmuck is dragged by the odyssey of this mad woman to discover the dangerous secret of her past. <br /> <br /> Although the story claims that the character of Davis, Samantha Caine suffers from amnesia, the writer and director treat them as if it were a multiple personality disorder. <br /> <br /> Samantha Caine is not just a new identity from the Charly Baltimore affair - it is a separate and fully developed personality. The trauma Samantha suffered in the first half hour of the film helps Charly's emerging dissociated personality to emerge again. <br /> <br /> The materials of his past life excavated by Jackson Mitch Henessey detective facilitate Charly's re-emergence. Also good timing, considering the goal that Samantha makes of herself. <br /> <br /> But Charly must fight herself to remain the dominant personality. It collects from fragments of dialogue that the warrior personality (Charly) developed after the death of his father and was recruited by the "Chapter". <br /> <br /> In the eight years Charly was buried in the psyche, however, she Samantha's identity developed into the dominant personality. (It is even more fun Charly.) Probably she was due to become a mother, because it is the meeting with her daughter that breaks Charly's struggle to suppress Samantha, leading to their apparent integration at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> impossible to choose a "best quote" from this movie: <br /> <br /> "Are you a sniper now?" <br /> <br /> "I saved your ass. It was great!" <br /> <br /> "Keep dying. Out." <br /> <br /> "I tie them to the jaw and shout 'Pop goes the weasel'". <br /> <br /> And a couple more than dozens, many too vulgar to mention here. <br /> <br /> Geena Davis looks good, and emerges as an action hero without glossing over the fact that she is turning forty. (Listen to Charley's story, do math). <br /> <br /> Also the fantastic soundtrack. Santana, Muddy Waters, Elvis, LaBelle, Marvin Gaye. <br /> <br /> I gave "The Long Kiss Goodnight" a 9, just because I don't believe in a perfect 10. Seen a dozen times, and it still stays cool. Nice twisted twist to place on the shelf next to "It's a wonderful life".
