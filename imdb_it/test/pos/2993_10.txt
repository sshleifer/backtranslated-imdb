Well, what do you know, I was painting my house today and an Elton John song came on the radio, which immediately brought me back to this movie I saw in 1971. So long ago and so far away. Ten years later I hitchhiked through the French countryside, and I certainly would have liked to see Michelle. The film is probably not very sophisticated by today's standards, the more it is worth it, but at the time it seemed rather bold. A few years later a sequel was made with Michelle living in a skyscraper in Paris and Paul returning to meet her, just like the life they had moved into, the film was very late. However, the original was fabulous, and if you can get a copy of it, remember to give it the due and treat it kindly. I note that Americans can be rather cautious, so take note, it contains scenes and themes that could upset Central America.
