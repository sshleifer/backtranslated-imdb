This film took me by surprise. For years I have avoided many of Harold Lloyd's (as well as Keaton's) sound images because they have a generally deserved reputation for being bad compared to silent films because the basic formula has been lost. However, when I saw this film, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I really liked it, ... once accepted, it was not a "Harold Lloyd" movie (although there was a protagonist). This is because although it is not similar to the style of his previous films, it is highly original and Lloyd is not bad by playing a completely different kind of character. <br /> <br /> As I said above, the formula of the old films here is almost completely missing. Lloyd doesn't do the old job of familiar stunt, the love story is quite different from his first novels on screen, and the plot is simply strange! Instead of the usual roles, he is the son of a Chinese missionary who returns to America for the first time since he was a kid. For this reason, even if he looks like an American (except for his white suit and explorer helmet), he thinks and acts a lot like someone who is Chinese. In many ways, he is very naive with America and is like an innocent among the wolves. At first he meets a man who turns out to be a local party leader. This boss ALWAYS produces a losing candidate for the mayor's contest - because it is bought and paid for by the corrupt mayor to produce a "token" candidate who DOES NOT HAVE the chance to win. Well, the old old man who is traditionally running for the office has just died and decides to direct the naive Lloyd - he doesn't have a prayer to win! Well, the unthinkable happens and Lloyd wins !!! This, and Lloyd's decision to clean up the city greatly upsets the old political machine and does not stop at nothing to destroy the honest Lloyd. Just when it seems that Lloyd is headed to prison on a bogus accusation of corruption, he creates a 100% impossible and very illegal scheme to get confessions signed by criminals. However, despite this, it's incredibly fun and a fantastic ending. So, my advice is at the end, just suspend disbelief and enjoy yourself. <br /> <br /> An important note: this film is NOT absolutely politically correct. The word "Chink" is used repeatedly. I found it offensive but considering the times, I ignored it as you should. If, however, you are a person who CANNOT CAN and you do not like being angry, I suggest you never watch the films in any case, since you are destined to feel offended again and again.
