I had a lot of fun watching Femina Ridens a couple of mornings, a bit drunk. Most of the film is almost two years old, showing the games and the strange relationship of the crazy doctor Philipe Leroy and the extraordinary Dagmar Lassander. I had already seen her in a couple of Fulci movies that die horribly dead, but here she is young and beautiful. The film is rather predictable and certainly mild on the exploitation front, but also fun for its wonderful colorful kitsch touch. The scenography, the music, the lighting and the cinematography are all classics of the late sixties in Italian style, a surreal feast for the eyes and ears and even if the general thread of the plot is not too difficult to foresee there are more that enough unusual events and memorable places and sounds to keep things interesting for everyone. Both series are pretty good, and reiterates that Dagmar Lassander is really, really good. Even the music, by Stelvo Cipriani, is perfectly suited to images. Director Pierro Schivazappa invented a nice cracker here, but it's not perfect. Although very tempting, there is little substance here and the elements of exploitation are as mild as possible. I guess this gives him a kind of charm and innocence, but I can't help thinking that the topic could have been done with more sleaze, more threats, that kind of thing, especially because it's pretty simple to understand what's going to happen. This is suspect that it is a bit useless for the most exploitative fans and certainly not for people who want to have sex or nudity. It's more a light, fun, pop art, lovable but insubstantial question, like the bubble bath. Recommended mainly for lovers of the 60s, by Dagmar Lassander or dessert sets.
