As I jumped from one movie to another at the SXSW Film Festival, this opening night movie stayed with me. Curious, because it's a dark comedy with a pretty absurd premise. <br /> <br /> A family of supercritical fundamentalists in a small community of similar minds has changed from a car accident. Three of the four have the same experience of pre-death in which they are completely open, since each receives an inversion of the concept of original sin (I will not ruin this scene with the specifications). The fourth, a middle school cheerleader, is not only the only physically wounded person, but she is also unchanged and is now witness to what has become her seemingly bankrupt crazy family. Every new moment brings a new scandal when they have become innocently naked and sincere in all respects, horrifying her and then the community. <br /> <br /> Forgiving the Franklins has the most beautiful sexual awakening scene between a husband and wife I've ever seen, for the song by Sarah Brightman "Deliver Me", a song that can now bring tears to my eyes to the eyes. <br /> <br /> The cast is exceptional. Robertson Dean as the father, Vince Pavia as the son and Aviva as the cheerleader daughter are excellent, Mari Blackwell plays Peggy, the mother's next interrogator and the best friend perfectly, a character much richer in nuances, real, than she would have could have been (everyone in Central America knows a Peggy). And Theresa Willis lights up positively like Betty, the mother. There are many risks taken by the actors who play the three changed characters, and these risks pay off. <br /> <br /> I hope this film has a wide release - if so, I'm going to see it again. /> <br /> Very accurate review at: http://www.fosteronfilm.com/phil/forgiving.htm
